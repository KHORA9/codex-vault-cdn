RICHARDSON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew Johnson\r\n\r\nApril 15, 1865, to March 4, 1869\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew Johnson\r\n\r\nAndrew Johnson was born in Raleigh, N.C., December 29, 1808. His parents\r\nwere very poor. When he was 4 years old his father died of injuries\r\nreceived in rescuing a person from drowning. At the age of 10 years\r\nAndrew was apprenticed to a tailor. His early education was almost\r\nentirely neglected, and, notwithstanding his natural craving to learn,\r\nhe never spent a day in school. Was taught the alphabet by a\r\nfellow-workman, borrowed a book, and learned to read. In 1824 removed to\r\nLaurens Court-House, S.C., where he worked as a journeyman tailor. In\r\nMay, 1826, returned to Raleigh, and in September, with his mother and\r\nstepfather, set out for Greeneville, Tenn., in a two-wheeled cart drawn\r\nby a blind pony. Here he married Eliza McCardle, a woman of refinement,\r\nwho taught him to write, and read to him while he was at work during the\r\nday. It was not until he had been in Congress that he learned to write\r\nwith ease. From Greeneville went to the West, but returned after the\r\nlapse of a year. In 1828 was elected alderman; was reelected in 1829 and\r\n1830, and in 1830 was advanced to the mayoralty, which office he held\r\nfor three years. In 1831 was appointed by the county court a trustee\r\nof Rhea Academy, and about this time participated in the debates of a\r\nsociety at Greeneville College. In 1834 advocated the adoption of a new\r\nState constitution, by which the influence of the large landholders was\r\nabridged. In 1835 represented Greene and Washington counties in the\r\nlegislature. Was defeated for the legislature in 1837, but in 1839 was\r\nreelected. In 1836 supported Hugh L. White for the Presidency, and in\r\nthe political altercations between John Bell and James K. Polk, which\r\ndistracted Tennessee at the time, supported the former. Mr. Johnson was\r\nthe only ardent follower of Bell that failed to go over to the Whig\r\nparty. Was an elector for the State at large on the Van Buren ticket in\r\n1840, and made a State reputation by the force of his oratory. In 1841\r\nwas elected to the State senate from Greene and Hawkins counties, and\r\nwhile in that body was one of the \"immortal thirteen\" Democrats who,\r\nhaving it in their power to prevent the election of a Whig Senator, did\r\nso by refusing to meet the house in joint convention; also proposed that\r\nthe basis of representation should rest upon white votes, without regard\r\nto the ownership of slaves. Was elected to Congress in 1843 over John A.\r\nAsken, a United States Bank Democrat, who was supported by the Whigs.\r\nHis first speech was in support of the resolution to restore to General\r\nJackson the fine imposed upon him at New Orleans; also supported the\r\nannexation of Texas. In 1845 was reelected, and supported Polk's\r\nAdministration. Was regularly reelected to Congress until 1853. During\r\nthis period opposed all expenditures for internal improvements that were\r\nnot general; resisted and defeated the proposed contingent tax of 10 per\r\ncent on tea and coffee; made his celebrated defense of the veto power;\r\nurged the adoption of the homestead law, which was obnoxious to the\r\nextreme Southern element of his party; supported the compromise measures\r\nof 1850 as a matter of expediency, but opposed compromises in general\r\nas a sacrifice of principle. Was elected governor of Tennessee in 1853\r\nover Gustavus A. Henry, the \"Eagle Orator\" of the State. In his message\r\nto the legislature he dwelt upon the homestead law and other measures\r\nfor the benefit of the working classes, and earned the title of\r\nthe \"Mechanic Governor.\" Opposed the Know-nothing movement with\r\ncharacteristic vehemence. Was reelected governor in 1855, defeating\r\nMeredith P. Gentry, the Whig-American candidate, after a most remarkable\r\ncanvass. The Kansas-Nebraska bill received his earnest support. In 1857\r\nwas elected to the United States Senate, where he urged the passage of\r\nthe homestead bill, and on May 20, 1858, made his greatest speech on\r\nthis subject. Opposed the grant of aid for the construction of a Pacific\r\nrailroad. Was prominent in debate, and frequently clashed with Southern\r\nsupporters of the Administration. His pronounced Unionism estranged him\r\nfrom the extremists on the Southern side, while his acceptance of\r\nslavery as an institution guaranteed by the Constitution caused him\r\nto hold aloof from the Republicans on the other. At the Democratic\r\nconvention at Charleston, S.C., in 1860 was a candidate for the\r\nPresidential nomination, but received only the vote of Tennessee, and\r\nwhen the convention reassembled in Baltimore withdrew his name. In the\r\ncanvass that followed supported John C. Breckinridge. At the session\r\nof Congress beginning in December, 1860, took decided and unequivocal\r\ngrounds in opposition to secession, and on December 13 introduced a\r\njoint resolution proposing to amend the Constitution so as to elect the\r\nPresident and Vice-President by district votes, Senators by a direct\r\npopular vote, and to limit the terms of Federal judges to twelve\r\nyears, the judges to be equally divided between slaveholding and\r\nnon-slaveholding States. In his speech on this resolution, December 18\r\nand 19, declared his unyielding opposition to secession and announced\r\nhis intention to stand by and act under the Constitution. Retained\r\nhis seat in the Senate until appointed by President Lincoln military\r\ngovernor of Tennessee, March 4, 1862. March 12 reached Nashville, and\r\norganized a provisional government for the State; March 18 issued a\r\nproclamation in which he appealed to the people to return to their\r\nallegiance, to uphold the law, and to accept \"a full and complete\r\namnesty for all past acts and declarations;\" April 5 removed the mayor\r\nand other officials of Nashville for refusing to take the oath of\r\nallegiance to the United States, and appointed others; urged the holding\r\nof Union meetings throughout the State, and frequently attended them in\r\nperson; completed the railroad from Nashville to the Tennessee River;\r\nraised twenty-five regiments for service in the State; December 8, 1862,\r\nissued a proclamation ordering Congressional elections, and on the 15th\r\nlevied an assessment upon the richer Southern sympathizers \"in behalf of\r\nthe many helpless widows, wives, and children in the city of Nashville\r\nwho have been reduced to poverty and wretchedness in consequence of\r\ntheir husbands, sons, and fathers having been forced into the armies of\r\nthis unholy and nefarious rebellion.\" Was nominated for Vice-President\r\nof the United States at the national Republican convention at Baltimore\r\nJune 8, 1864, and was elected on November 8. In his letter of acceptance\r\nof the nomination Mr. Johnson virtually disclaimed any departure from\r\nhis principles as a Democrat, but placed his acceptance upon the ground\r\nof \"the higher duty of first preserving the Government.\" On the night of\r\nthe 14th of April, 1865, President Lincoln was shot by an assassin and\r\ndied the next morning. At 11 o'clock a.m. April 15 Mr. Johnson was sworn\r\nin as President, at his rooms in the Kirkwood House, Washington, by\r\nChief Justice Chase, in the presence of nearly all the Cabinet officers\r\nand others. April 29, 1865, issued a proclamation for the removal of\r\ntrade restrictions in most of the insurrectionary States, which, being\r\nin contravention of an act of Congress, was subsequently modified.\r\nMay 9 issued an Executive order restoring Virginia to the Union. May 22\r\nproclaimed all ports, except four in Texas, opened to foreign commerce\r\non July 1, 1865. May 29 issued a general amnesty proclamation, after\r\nwhich the fundamental and irreconcilable differences between President\r\nJohnson and the party that had elevated him to power became more\r\napparent. He exercised the veto power to a very great extent, but it was\r\ngenerally nullified by the two-thirds votes of both Houses. From May 29\r\nto July 13, 1865, proclaimed provisional governors for North Carolina,\r\nMississippi, Georgia, Texas, Alabama, South Carolina, and Florida, whose\r\nduties were to reorganize the State governments. The State governments\r\nwere reorganized, but the Republicans claimed that the laws passed were\r\nso stringent in reference to the negroes that it was a worse form of\r\nslavery than the old. The thirteenth amendment to the Constitution\r\nbecame a law December 18, 1865, with Mr. Johnson's concurrence. The first\r\nbreach between the President and the party in power was the veto of the\r\nFreedmen's Bureau bill, in February, 1866, which was designed to protect\r\nthe negroes. March 27 vetoed the civil-rights bill, but it was passed\r\nover his veto. In a message of June 22, 1866, opposed the joint\r\nresolution proposing the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution. In\r\nJune, 1866, the Republicans in Congress brought forward their plan of\r\nreconstruction, called the \"Congressional plan,\" in contradistinction\r\nto that of the President. The chief features of the Congressional plan\r\nwere to give the negroes the right to vote, to protect them in this\r\nright, and to prevent Confederate leaders from voting. January 5, 1867,\r\nvetoed the act giving negroes the right of suffrage in the District\r\nof Columbia, but it was passed over his veto. An attempt was made to\r\nimpeach the President, but it failed. In January, 1867, a bill was\r\npassed to deprive the President of the power to proclaim general\r\namnesty, which he disregarded. Measures were adopted looking to the\r\nmeeting of the Fortieth and all subsequent Congresses immediately after\r\nthe adjournment of the preceding. The President was deprived of the\r\ncommand of the Army by a rider to the army appropriation bill, which\r\nprovided that his orders should only be given through the General, who\r\nwas not to be removed without the previous consent of the Senate. The\r\nbill admitting Nebraska, providing that no law should ever be passed in\r\nthat State denying the right of suffrage to any person because of his\r\ncolor or race, was vetoed by the President, but passed over his veto.\r\nMarch 2, 1867, vetoed the act to provide for the more efficient\r\ngovernment of the rebel States, but it was passed over his veto.\r\nIt embodied the Congressional plan of reconstruction, and divided the\r\nSouthern States into five military districts, each under an officer of\r\nthe Army not under the rank of brigadier-general, who was to exercise\r\nall the functions of government until the citizens had \"formed a\r\nconstitution of government in conformity with the Constitution\r\nof the United States in all respects.\" On the same day vetoed the\r\ntenure-of-office act, which was also passed over his veto. It provided\r\nthat civil officers should remain in office until the confirmation of\r\ntheir successors; that the members of the Cabinet should be removed\r\nonly with the consent of the Senate, and that when Congress was not in\r\nsession the President could suspend but not remove any official, and in\r\ncase the Senate at the next session should not ratify the suspension the\r\nsuspended official should be reinducted into his office. August 5, 1867,\r\nrequested Edwin M. Stanton to resign his office as Secretary of War.\r\nMr. Stanton refused, was suspended, and General Grant was appointed\r\nSecretary of War _ad interim_. When Congress met, the Senate\r\nrefused to ratify the suspension. General Grant then resigned, and Mr.\r\nStanton resumed the duties of his office. The President removed him and\r\nappointed Lorenzo Thomas, Adjutant-General of the Army, Secretary of War\r\n_ad interim_. The Senate declared this act illegal, and Mr. Stanton\r\nrefused to comply, and notified the Speaker of the House. On February\r\n24, 1868, the House of Representatives resolved to impeach the\r\nPresident, and on March 2 and 3 articles of impeachment were agreed upon\r\nby the House of Representatives, and on the 4th were presented to the\r\nSenate. The trial began on March 30. May 16 the test vote was had;\r\nthirty-five Senators voted for conviction and nineteen for acquittal. A\r\nchange of one vote would have carried conviction. A verdict of acquittal\r\nwas entered, and the Senate sitting as a court of impeachment adjourned\r\n_sine die_. After the expiration of his term the ex-President\r\nreturned to Tennessee. Was a candidate for the United States Senate, but\r\nwas defeated. In 1872 was an unsuccessful candidate for Congressman from\r\nthe State at large. In January, 1875, was elected to the United States\r\nSenate, and took his seat at the extra session of that year. Shortly\r\nafter the session began made a speech which was a skillful but bitter\r\nattack upon President Grant. While visiting his daughter near\r\nElizabethton, in Carter County, Tenn., was stricken with paralysis July\r\n30, 1875, and died the following day. He was buried at Greeneville, Tenn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n[From the Sunday Morning Chronicle, Washington, April 16, 1865, and\r\nThe Sun, Baltimore, April 17, 1865.]\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: I must be permitted to say that I have been almost\r\noverwhelmed by the announcement of the sad event which has so recently\r\noccurred. I feel incompetent to perform duties so important and\r\nresponsible as those which have been so unexpectedly thrown upon me.\r\nAs to an indication of any policy which may be pursued by me in the\r\nadministration of the Government, I have to say that that must be left\r\nfor development as the Administration progresses. The message or\r\ndeclaration must be made by the acts as they transpire. The only\r\nassurance that I can now give of the future is reference to the past.\r\nThe course which I have taken in the past in connection with this\r\nrebellion must be regarded as a guaranty of the future. My past public\r\nlife, which has been long and laborious, has been founded, as I in good\r\nconscience believe, upon a great principle of right, which lies at the\r\nbasis of all things. The best energies of my life have been spent in\r\nendeavoring to establish and perpetuate the principles of free\r\ngovernment, and I believe that the Government in passing through its\r\npresent perils will settle down upon principles consonant with popular\r\nrights more permanent and enduring than heretofore. I must be permitted\r\nto say, if I understand the feelings of my own heart, that I have long\r\nlabored to ameliorate and elevate the condition of the great mass of the\r\nAmerican people. Toil and an honest advocacy of the great principles of\r\nfree government have been my lot. Duties have been mine; consequences\r\nare God's. This has been the foundation of my political creed, and I\r\nfeel that in the end the Government will triumph and that these great\r\nprinciples will be permanently established.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, gentlemen, let me say that I want your encouragement and\r\ncountenance. I shall ask and rely upon you and others in carrying the\r\nGovernment through its present perils. I feel in making this request\r\nthat it will be heartily responded to by you and all other patriots\r\nand lovers of the rights and interests of a free people.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 15, 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas, by my direction, the Acting Secretary of State, in a notice to\r\nthe public of the 17th, requested the various religious denominations\r\nto assemble on the 19th instant, on the occasion of the obsequies of\r\nAbraham Lincoln, late President of the United States, and to observe the\r\nsame with appropriate ceremonies; but\r\n\r\nWhereas our country has become one great house of mourning, where the\r\nhead of the family has been taken away, and believing that a special\r\nperiod should be assigned for again humbling ourselves before Almighty\r\nGod, in order that the bereavement may be sanctified to the nation:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, in order to mitigate that grief on earth which can\r\nonly be assuaged by communion with the Father in heaven, and in\r\ncompliance with the wishes of Senators and Representatives in Congress,\r\ncommunicated to me by resolutions adopted at the National Capitol,\r\nI, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, do hereby appoint\r\nThursday, the 25th day of May next, to be observed, wherever in the\r\nUnited States the flag of the country may be respected, as a day of\r\nhumiliation and mourning, and I recommend my fellow citizens then to\r\nassemble in their respective places of worship, there to unite in solemn\r\nservice to Almighty God in memory of the good man who has been removed,\r\nso that all shall be occupied at the same time in contemplation of his\r\nvirtues and in sorrow for his sudden and violent end.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, the 25th day of April, A.D. 1865, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States of America the eighty-ninth.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  W.

HUNTER,\r\n    _Acting Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas it appears from evidence in the Bureau of Military Justice that\r\nthe atrocious murder of the late President, Abraham Lincoln, and the\r\nattempted assassination of the Hon. William H. Seward, Secretary of\r\nState, were incited, concerted, and procured by and between Jefferson\r\nDavis, late of Richmond, Va., and Jacob Thompson, Clement C. Clay,\r\nBeverley Tucker, George N. Sanders, William C. Cleary, and other rebels\r\nand traitors against the Government of the United States harbored in\r\nCanada:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, to the end that justice may be done, I, Andrew Johnson,\r\nPresident of the United States, do offer and promise for the arrest of\r\nsaid persons, or either of them, within the limits of the United States,\r\nso that they can be brought to trial, the following rewards:\r\n\r\nOne hundred thousand dollars for the arrest of Jefferson Davis.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five thousand dollars for the arrest of Clement C.

Sanders.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five thousand dollars for the arrest of Beverley Tucker.\r\n\r\nTen thousand dollars for the arrest of William C. Cleary, late clerk of\r\nClement C. Clay.\r\n\r\nThe Provost-Marshal-General of the United States is directed to cause\r\na description of said persons, with notice of the above rewards, to be\r\npublished.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 2d day of May, A.D. 1865, and of\r\nthe Independence of the United States of America the eighty-ninth.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  W. HUNTER,\r\n    _Acting Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas the President of the United States, by his proclamation of the\r\n19th day of April, 1861, did declare certain States therein mentioned in\r\ninsurrection against the Government of the United States; and\r\n\r\nWhereas armed resistance to the authority of this Government in the said\r\ninsurrectionary States may be regarded as virtually at an end, and the\r\npersons by whom that resistance, as well as the operations of insurgent\r\ncruisers, was directed are fugitives or captives; and\r\n\r\nWhereas it is understood that some of those cruisers are still infesting\r\nthe high seas and others are preparing to capture, burn, and destroy\r\nvessels of the United States:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it known that I, Andrew Johnson, President of the\r\nUnited States, hereby enjoin all naval, military, and civil officers of\r\nthe United States diligently to endeavor, by all lawful means, to arrest\r\nthe said cruisers and to bring them into a port of the United States, in\r\norder that they may be prevented from committing further depredations on\r\ncommerce and that the persons on board of them may no longer enjoy\r\nimpunity for their crimes.\r\n\r\nAnd I do further proclaim and declare that if, after a reasonable time\r\nshall have elapsed for this proclamation to become known in the ports of\r\nnations claiming to have been neutrals, the said insurgent cruisers and\r\nthe persons on board of them shall continue to receive hospitality in\r\nthe said ports, this Government will deem itself justified in refusing\r\nhospitality to the public vessels of such nations in ports of the United\r\nStates and in adopting such other measures as may be deemed advisable\r\ntoward vindicating the national sovereignty.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 10th day of May, A.D. 1865, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States of America the eighty-ninth.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  W. HUNTER,\r\n    _Acting Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas by the proclamation of the President of the 11th day of April\r\nlast certain ports of the United States therein specified, which had\r\npreviously been subject to blockade, were, for objects of public safety,\r\ndeclared, in conformity with previous special legislation of Congress,\r\nto be closed against foreign commerce during the national will, to be\r\nthereafter expressed and made known by the President; and\r\n\r\nWhereas events and circumstances have since occurred which, in my\r\njudgment, render it expedient to remove that restriction, except as to\r\nthe ports of Galveston, La Salle, Brazos de Santiago (Point Isabel), and\r\nBrownsville, in the State of Texas:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it known that I, Andrew Johnson, President of the\r\nUnited States, do hereby declare that the ports aforesaid, not excepted\r\nas above, shall be open to foreign commerce from and after the 1st day\r\nof July next; that commercial intercourse with the said ports may from\r\nthat time be carried on, subject to the laws of the United States and in\r\npursuance of such regulations as may be prescribed by the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury. If, however, any vessel from a foreign port shall enter\r\nany of the before-named excepted ports in the State of Texas, she will\r\ncontinue to be held liable to the penalties prescribed by the act of\r\nCongress approved on the 13th day of July, 1861, and the persons on\r\nboard of her to such penalties as may be incurred, pursuant to the laws\r\nof war, for trading or attempting to trade with an enemy.\r\n\r\nAnd I, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, do hereby declare\r\nand make known that the United States of America do henceforth disallow\r\nto all persons trading or attempting to trade in any ports of the United\r\nStates in violation of the laws thereof all pretense of belligerent\r\nrights and privileges; and I give notice that from the date of this\r\nproclamation all such offenders will be held and dealt with as pirates.\r\n\r\nIt is also ordered that all restrictions upon trade heretofore imposed\r\nin the territory of the United States east of the Mississippi River,\r\nsave those relating to contraband of war, to the reservation of the\r\nrights of the United States to property purchased in the territory of an\r\nenemy, and to the 25 per cent upon purchases of cotton be removed. All\r\nprovisions of the internal-revenue law will be carried into effect under\r\nthe proper officers.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 22d day of May, A.D. 1865, and of\r\nthe Independence of the United States of America the eighty-ninth.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  W. HUNTER,\r\n    _Acting Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas the President of the United States, on the 8th day of December,\r\nA.D. 1863, and on the 26th day of March, A.D. 1864, did, with the object\r\nto suppress the existing rebellion, to induce all persons to return to\r\ntheir loyalty, and to restore the authority of the United States, issue\r\nproclamations offering amnesty and pardon to certain persons who had,\r\ndirectly or by implication, participated in the said rebellion; and\r\n\r\nWhereas many persons who had so engaged in said rebellion have, since\r\nthe issuance of said proclamations, failed or neglected to take the\r\nbenefits offered thereby; and\r\n\r\nWhereas many persons who have been justly deprived of all claim to\r\namnesty and pardon thereunder by reason of their participation, directly\r\nor by implication, in said rebellion and continued hostility to the\r\nGovernment of the United States since the date of said proclamations now\r\ndesire to apply for and obtain amnesty and pardon.\r\n\r\nTo the end, therefore, that the authority of the Government of the\r\nUnited States may be restored and that peace, order, and freedom may\r\nbe established, I, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States,\r\ndo proclaim and declare that I hereby grant to all persons who have,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, participated in the existing rebellion, except\r\nas hereinafter excepted, amnesty and pardon, with restoration of all\r\nrights of property, except as to slaves and except in cases where legal\r\nproceedings under the laws of the United States providing for the\r\nconfiscation of property of persons engaged in rebellion have been\r\ninstituted; but upon the condition, nevertheless, that every such person\r\nshall take and subscribe the following oath (or affirmation) and\r\nthenceforward keep and maintain said oath inviolate, and which oath\r\nshall be registered for permanent preservation and shall be of the tenor\r\nand effect following, to wit:\r\n\r\n  I ---- ---- do solemnly swear (or affirm), in presence of Almighty\r\n  God, that I will henceforth faithfully support, protect, and defend\r\n  the Constitution of the United States and the Union of the States\r\n  thereunder, and that I will in like manner abide by and faithfully\r\n  support all laws and proclamations which have been made during the\r\n  existing rebellion with reference to the emancipation of slaves.\r\n  So help me God.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following classes of persons are excepted from the benefits of this\r\nproclamation:\r\n\r\nFirst. All who are or shall have been pretended civil or diplomatic\r\nofficers or otherwise domestic or foreign agents of the pretended\r\nConfederate government.\r\n\r\nSecond.

TOWNSEND, _Assistant Adjutant-General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 7, 1865_.\r\n\r\nAn impression seems to prevail that the interests of persons having\r\nbusiness with the executive government require that they should have\r\npersonal interviews with the President or heads of Departments. As this\r\nimpression is believed to be entirely unfounded, it is expected that\r\napplications relating to such business will hereafter be made in writing\r\nto the head of that Department to which the business may have been\r\nassigned by law. Those applications will in their order be considered\r\nand disposed of by heads of Departments, subject to the approval of the\r\nPresident. This order is made necessary by the unusual numbers of\r\npersons visiting the seat of Government. It is impracticable to grant\r\npersonal interviews to all of them, and desirable that there should be\r\nno invidious distinction in this respect. Similar business of persons\r\nwho can not conveniently leave their homes must be neglected if the time\r\nof the executive officers here is engrossed by personal interviews with\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From the Daily National Intelligencer, August 26, 1865.]\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, August 25, 1865_.\r\n\r\nParoled prisoners asking passports as citizens of the United States, and\r\nagainst whom no special charges may be pending, will be furnished with\r\npassports upon application therefor to the Department of State in the\r\nusual form.

TOWNSEND,\r\n\r\n_Assistant Adjutant-General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 4, 1865_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nTo express gratitude to God in the name of the people for the\r\npreservation of the United States is my first duty in addressing you.\r\nOur thoughts next revert to the death of the late President by an act\r\nof parricidal treason. The grief of the nation is still fresh. It finds\r\nsome solace in the consideration that he lived to enjoy the highest\r\nproof of its confidence by entering on the renewed term of the Chief\r\nMagistracy to which he had been elected; that he brought the civil war\r\nsubstantially to a close; that his loss was deplored in all parts of the\r\nUnion, and that foreign nations have rendered justice to his memory.\r\nHis removal cast upon me a heavier weight of cares than ever devolved\r\nupon any one of his predecessors. To fulfill my trust I need the support\r\nand confidence of all who are associated with me in the various\r\ndepartments of Government and the support and confidence of the people.\r\nThere is but one way in which I can hope to gain their necessary aid.\r\nIt is to state with frankness the principles which guide my conduct, and\r\ntheir application to the present state of affairs, well aware that the\r\nefficiency of my labors will in a great measure depend on your and their\r\nundivided approbation.\r\n\r\nThe Union of the United States of America was intended by its authors to\r\nlast as long as the States themselves shall last. \"The Union shall be\r\nperpetual\" are the words of the Confederation. \"To form a more perfect\r\nUnion,\" by an ordinance of the people of the United States, is the\r\ndeclared purpose of the Constitution. The hand of Divine Providence was\r\nnever more plainly visible in the affairs of men than in the framing and\r\nthe adopting of that instrument. It is beyond comparison the greatest\r\nevent in American history, and, indeed, is it not of all events in\r\nmodern times the most pregnant with consequences for every people of the\r\nearth? The members of the Convention which prepared it brought to their\r\nwork the experience of the Confederation, of their several States, and\r\nof other republican governments, old and new; but they needed and they\r\nobtained a wisdom superior to experience. And when for its validity it\r\nrequired the approval of a people that occupied a large part of a\r\ncontinent and acted separately in many distinct conventions, what is\r\nmore wonderful than that, after earnest contention and long discussion,\r\nall feelings and all opinions were ultimately drawn in one way to its\r\nsupport? The Constitution to which life was thus imparted contains\r\nwithin itself ample resources for its own preservation. It has power\r\nto enforce the laws, punish treason, and insure domestic tranquillity.\r\nIn case of the usurpation of the government of a State by one man or\r\nan oligarchy, it becomes a duty of the United States to make good the\r\nguaranty to that State of a republican form of government, and so to\r\nmaintain the homogeneousness of all. Does the lapse of time reveal\r\ndefects? A simple mode of amendment is provided in the Constitution\r\nitself, so that its conditions can always be made to conform to the\r\nrequirements of advancing civilization. No room is allowed even for the\r\nthought of a possibility of its coming to an end. And these powers of\r\nself-preservation have always been asserted in their complete integrity\r\nby every patriotic Chief Magistrate--by Jefferson and Jackson not less\r\nthan by Washington and Madison. The parting advice of the Father of his\r\nCountry, while yet President, to the people of the United States was\r\nthat the free Constitution, which was the work of their hands, might be\r\nsacredly maintained; and the inaugural words of President Jefferson\r\nheld up \"the preservation of the General Government in its whole\r\nconstitutional vigor as the sheet anchor of our peace at home and safety\r\nabroad.\" The Constitution is the work of \"the people of the United\r\nStates,\" and it should be as indestructible as the people.\r\n\r\nIt is not strange that the framers of the Constitution, which had no\r\nmodel in the past, should not have fully comprehended the excellence of\r\ntheir own work. Fresh from a struggle against arbitrary power, many\r\npatriots suffered from harassing fears of an absorption of the State\r\ngovernments by the General Government, and many from a dread that the\r\nStates would break away from their orbits. But the very greatness\r\nof our country should allay the apprehension of encroachments by the\r\nGeneral Government, The subjects that come unquestionably within its\r\njurisdiction are so numerous that it must ever naturally refuse to be\r\nembarrassed by questions that lie beyond it. Were it otherwise the\r\nExecutive would sink beneath the burden, the channels of justice would\r\nbe choked, legislation would be obstructed by excess, so that there is\r\na greater temptation to exercise some of the functions of the General\r\nGovernment through the States than to trespass on their rightful sphere.\r\nThe \"absolute acquiescence in the decisions of the majority\" was at the\r\nbeginning of the century enforced by Jefferson as \"the vital principle\r\nof republics;\" and the events of the last four years have established,\r\nwe will hope forever, that there lies no appeal to force.\r\n\r\nThe maintenance of the Union brings with it \"the support of the State\r\ngovernments in all their rights,\" but it is not one of the rights of any\r\nState government to renounce its own place in the Union or to nullify\r\nthe laws of the Union. The largest liberty is to be maintained in the\r\ndiscussion of the acts of the Federal Government, but there is no appeal\r\nfrom its laws except to the various branches of that Government itself,\r\nor to the people, who grant to the members of the legislative and of the\r\nexecutive departments no tenure but a limited one, and in that manner\r\nalways retain the powers of redress.\r\n\r\n\"The sovereignty of the States\" is the language of the Confederacy, and\r\nnot the language of the Constitution. The latter contains the emphatic\r\nwords--\r\n\r\n  This Constitution and the laws of the United States which shall be made\r\n  in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made or which shall be made under\r\n  the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the\r\n  land, and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby, anything in\r\n  the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nCertainly the Government of the United States is a limited government,\r\nand so is every State government a limited government. With us this idea\r\nof limitation spreads through every form of administration--general,\r\nState, and municipal--and rests on the great distinguishing principle of\r\nthe recognition of the rights of man. The ancient republics absorbed\r\nthe individual in the state--prescribed his religion and controlled\r\nhis activity. The American system rests on the assertion of the equal\r\nright of every man to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, to\r\nfreedom of conscience, to the culture and exercise of all his faculties.\r\nAs a consequence the State government is limited--as to the General\r\nGovernment in the interest of union, as to the individual citizen in the\r\ninterest of freedom.\r\n\r\nStates, with proper limitations of power, are essential to the existence\r\nof the Constitution of the United States. At the very commencement, when\r\nwe assumed a place among the powers of the earth, the Declaration of\r\nIndependence was adopted by States; so also were the Articles of\r\nConfederation; and when \"the people of the United States\" ordained and\r\nestablished the Constitution it was the assent of the States, one by\r\none, which gave it vitality. In the event, too, of any amendment to the\r\nConstitution, the proposition of Congress needs the confirmation of\r\nStates. Without States one great branch of the legislative government\r\nwould be wanting. And if we look beyond the letter of the Constitution\r\nto the character of our country, its capacity for comprehending within\r\nits jurisdiction a vast continental empire is due to the system of\r\nStates. The best security for the perpetual existence of the States is\r\nthe \"supreme authority\" of the Constitution of the United States. The\r\nperpetuity of the Constitution brings with it the perpetuity of the\r\nStates; their mutual relation makes us what we are, and in our political\r\nsystem their connection is indissoluble. The whole can not exist without\r\nthe parts, nor the parts without the whole. So long as the Constitution\r\nof the United States endures, the States will endure. The destruction of\r\nthe one is the destruction of the other; the preservation of the one is\r\nthe preservation of the other.\r\n\r\nI have thus explained my views of the mutual relations of the\r\nConstitution and the States, because they unfold the principles on\r\nwhich I have sought to solve the momentous questions and overcome the\r\nappalling difficulties that met me at the very commencement of my\r\nAdministration. It has been my steadfast object to escape from the\r\nsway of momentary passions and to derive a healing policy from the\r\nfundamental and unchanging principles of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nI found the States suffering from the effects of a civil war. Resistance\r\nto the General Government appeared to have exhausted itself. The United\r\nStates had recovered possession of their forts and arsenals, and their\r\narmies were in the occupation of every State which had attempted to\r\nsecede. Whether the territory within the limits of those States should\r\nbe held as conquered territory, under military authority emanating from\r\nthe President as the head of the Army, was the first question that\r\npresented itself for decision.\r\n\r\nNow military governments, established for an indefinite period, would\r\nhave offered no security for the early suppression of discontent, would\r\nhave divided the people into the vanquishers and the vanquished, and\r\nwould have envenomed hatred rather than have restored affection. Once\r\nestablished, no precise limit to their continuance was conceivable. They\r\nwould have occasioned an incalculable and exhausting expense. Peaceful\r\nemigration to and from that portion of the country is one of the best\r\nmeans that can be thought of for the restoration of harmony, and that\r\nemigration would have been prevented; for what emigrant from abroad,\r\nwhat industrious citizen at home, would place himself willingly under\r\nmilitary rule? The chief persons who would have followed in the train of\r\nthe Army would have been dependents on the General Government or men who\r\nexpected profit from the miseries of their erring fellow-citizens. The\r\npowers of patronage and rule which would have been exercised, under the\r\nPresident, over a vast and populous and naturally wealthy region are\r\ngreater than, unless under extreme necessity, I should be willing to\r\nintrust to any one man. They are such as, for myself, I could never,\r\nunless on occasions of great emergency, consent to exercise. The willful\r\nuse of such powers, if continued through a period of years, would have\r\nendangered the purity of the general administration and the liberties of\r\nthe States which remained loyal.\r\n\r\nBesides, the policy of military rule over a conquered territory would\r\nhave implied that the States whose inhabitants may have taken part in\r\nthe rebellion had by the act of those inhabitants ceased to exist. But\r\nthe true theory is that all pretended acts of secession were from the\r\nbeginning null and void. The States can not commit treason nor screen\r\nthe individual citizens who may have committed treason any more than\r\nthey can make valid treaties or engage in lawful commerce with any\r\nforeign power. The States attempting to secede placed themselves in a\r\ncondition where their vitality was impaired, but not extinguished; their\r\nfunctions suspended, but not destroyed.\r\n\r\nBut if any State neglects or refuses to perform its offices there is the\r\nmore need that the General Government should maintain all its authority\r\nand as soon as practicable resume the exercise of all its functions.\r\nOn this principle I have acted, and have gradually and quietly, and by\r\nalmost imperceptible steps, sought to restore the rightful energy of the\r\nGeneral Government and of the States. To that end provisional governors\r\nhave been appointed for the States, conventions called, governors\r\nelected, legislatures assembled, and Senators and Representatives chosen\r\nto the Congress of the United States. At the same time the courts of the\r\nUnited States, as far as could be done, have been reopened, so that the\r\nlaws of the United States may be enforced through their agency. The\r\nblockade has been removed and the custom-houses reestablished in ports\r\nof entry, so that the revenue of the United States may be collected. The\r\nPost-Office Department renews its ceaseless activity, and the General\r\nGovernment is thereby enabled to communicate promptly with its officers\r\nand agents. The courts bring security to persons and property; the\r\nopening of the ports invites the restoration of industry and commerce;\r\nthe post-office renews the facilities of social intercourse and of\r\nbusiness. And is it not happy for us all that the restoration of each\r\none of these functions of the General Government brings with it a\r\nblessing to the States over which they are extended? Is it not a sure\r\npromise of harmony and renewed attachment to the Union that after all\r\nthat has happened the return of the General Government is known only as\r\na beneficence?\r\n\r\nI know very well that this policy is attended with some risk; that for\r\nits success it requires at least the acquiescence of the States which it\r\nconcerns; that it implies an invitation to those States, by renewing\r\ntheir allegiance to the United States, to resume their functions as\r\nStates of the Union. But it is a risk that must be taken. In the choice\r\nof difficulties it is the smallest risk; and to diminish and if possible\r\nto remove all danger, I have felt it incumbent on me to assert one other\r\npower of the General Government--the power of pardon. As no State can\r\nthrow a defense over the crime of treason, the power of pardon is\r\nexclusively vested in the executive government of the United States. In\r\nexercising that power I have taken every precaution to connect it with\r\nthe clearest recognition of the binding force of the laws of the United\r\nStates and an unqualified acknowledgment of the great social change of\r\ncondition in regard to slavery which has grown out of the war.\r\n\r\nThe next step which I have taken to restore the constitutional relations\r\nof the States has been an invitation to them to participate in the high\r\noffice of amending the Constitution. Every patriot must wish for a\r\ngeneral amnesty at the earliest epoch consistent with public safety. For\r\nthis great end there is need of a concurrence of all opinions and the\r\nspirit of mutual conciliation. All parties in the late terrible conflict\r\nmust work together in harmony. It is not too much to ask, in the name of\r\nthe whole people, that on the one side the plan of restoration shall\r\nproceed in conformity with a willingness to cast the disorders of the\r\npast into oblivion, and that on the other the evidence of sincerity in\r\nthe future maintenance of the Union shall be put beyond any doubt by the\r\nratification of the proposed amendment to the Constitution, which\r\nprovides for the abolition of slavery forever within the limits of our\r\ncountry. So long as the adoption of this amendment is delayed, so long\r\nwill doubt and jealousy and uncertainty prevail. This is the measure\r\nwhich will efface the sad memory of the past: this is the measure which\r\nwill most certainly call population and capital and security to those\r\nparts of the Union that need them most. Indeed, it is not too much to\r\nask of the States which are now resuming their places in the family of\r\nthe Union to give this pledge of perpetual loyalty and peace. Until it\r\nis done the past, however much we may desire it, will not be forgotten.\r\nThe adoption of the amendment reunites us beyond all power of\r\ndisruption; it heals the wound that is still imperfectly closed; it\r\nremoves slavery, the element which has so long perplexed and divided the\r\ncountry; it makes of us once more a united people, renewed and\r\nstrengthened, bound more than ever to mutual affection and support.\r\n\r\nThe amendment to the Constitution being adopted, it would remain for the\r\nStates whose powers have been so long in abeyance to resume their places\r\nin the two branches of the National Legislature, and thereby complete\r\nthe work of restoration. Here it is for you, fellow-citizens of the\r\nSenate, and for you, fellow-citizens of the House of Representatives,\r\nto judge, each of you for yourselves, of the elections, returns, and\r\nqualifications of your own members.\r\n\r\nThe full assertion of the powers of the General Government requires the\r\nholding of circuit courts of the United States within the districts\r\nwhere their authority has been interrupted. In the present posture of\r\nour public affairs strong objections have been urged to holding those\r\ncourts in any of the States where the rebellion has existed; and it was\r\nascertained by inquiry that the circuit court of the United States would\r\nnot be held within the district of Virginia during the autumn or early\r\nwinter, nor until Congress should have \"an opportunity to consider and\r\nact on the whole subject.\" To your deliberations the restoration of\r\nthis branch of the civil authority of the United States is therefore\r\nnecessarily referred, with the hope that early provision will be made\r\nfor the resumption of all its functions. It is manifest that treason,\r\nmost flagrant in character, has been committed. Persons who are charged\r\nwith its commission should have fair and impartial trials in the highest\r\ncivil tribunals of the country, in order that the Constitution and the\r\nlaws may be fully vindicated, the truth clearly established and affirmed\r\nthat treason is a crime, that traitors should be punished and the\r\noffense made infamous, and, at the same time, that the question may be\r\njudicially settled, finally and forever, that no State of its own will\r\nhas the right to renounce its place in the Union.\r\n\r\nThe relations of the General Government toward the 4,000,000 inhabitants\r\nwhom the war has called into freedom have engaged my most serious\r\nconsideration. On the propriety of attempting to make the freed-men\r\nelectors by the proclamation of the Executive I took for my counsel the\r\nConstitution itself, the interpretations of that instrument by its\r\nauthors and their contemporaries, and recent legislation by Congress.\r\nWhen at the first movement toward independence, the Congress of the\r\nUnited States instructed the several States to institute governments of\r\ntheir own, they left each State to decide for itself the conditions for\r\nthe enjoyment of the elective franchise. During the period of the\r\nConfederacy there continued to exist a very great diversity in the\r\nqualifications of electors in the several States, and even within a\r\nState a distinction of qualifications prevailed with regard to the\r\nofficers who were to be chosen. The Constitution of the United States\r\nrecognizes these diversities when it enjoins that in the choice of\r\nmembers of the House of Representatives of the United States \"the\r\nelectors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for\r\nelectors of the most numerous branch of the State legislature.\" After\r\nthe formation of the Constitution it remained, as before, the uniform\r\nusage for each State to enlarge the body of its electors according to\r\nits own judgment, and under this system one State after another has\r\nproceeded to increase the number of its electors, until now universal\r\nsuffrage, or something very near it, is the general rule. So fixed was\r\nthis reservation of power in the habits of the people and so\r\nunquestioned has been the interpretation of the Constitution that during\r\nthe civil war the late President never harbored the purpose--certainly\r\nnever avowed the purpose--of disregarding it; and in the acts of\r\nCongress during that period nothing can be found which, during the\r\ncontinuance of hostilities, much less after their close, would have\r\nsanctioned any departure by the Executive from a policy which has so\r\nuniformly obtained. Moreover, a concession of the elective franchise to\r\nthe freedmen by act of the President of the United States must have been\r\nextended to all colored men, wherever found, and so must have\r\nestablished a change of suffrage in the Northern, Middle, and Western\r\nStates, not less than in the Southern and Southwestern. Such an act\r\nwould have created a new class of voters, and would have been an\r\nassumption of power by the President which nothing in the Constitution\r\nor laws of the United States would have warranted.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, every danger of conflict is avoided when the\r\nsettlement of the question is referred to the several States. They can,\r\neach for itself, decide on the measure, and whether it is to be adopted\r\nat once and absolutely or introduced gradually and with conditions. In\r\nmy judgment the freedmen, if they show patience and manly virtues, will\r\nsooner obtain a participation in the elective franchise through the\r\nStates than through the General Government, even if it had power to\r\nintervene. When the tumult of emotions that have been raised by the\r\nsuddenness of the social change shall have subsided, it may prove that\r\nthey will receive the kindest usage from some of those on whom they have\r\nheretofore most closely depended.\r\n\r\nBut while I have no doubt that now, after the close of the war, it\r\nis not competent for the General Government to extend the elective\r\nfranchise in the several States, it is equally clear that good faith\r\nrequires the security of the freedmen in their liberty and their\r\nproperty, their right to labor, and their right to claim the just return\r\nof their labor. I can not too strongly urge a dispassionate treatment\r\nof this subject, which should be carefully kept aloof from all party\r\nstrife. We must equally avoid hasty assumptions of any natural\r\nimpossibility for the two races to live side by side in a state of\r\nmutual benefit and good will. The experiment involves us in no\r\ninconsistency; let us, then, go on and make that experiment in good\r\nfaith, and not be too easily disheartened. The country is in need of\r\nlabor, and the freedmen are in need of employment, culture, and\r\nprotection. While their right of voluntary migration and expatriation\r\nis not to be questioned, I would not advise their forced removal and\r\ncolonization. Let us rather encourage them to honorable and useful\r\nindustry, where it may be beneficial to themselves and to the country;\r\nand, instead of hasty anticipations of the certainty of failure,\r\nlet there be nothing wanting to the fair trial of the experiment.\r\nThe change in their condition is the substitution of labor by contract\r\nfor the status of slavery. The freedman can not fairly be accused of\r\nunwillingness to work so long as a doubt remains about his freedom\r\nof choice in his pursuits and the certainty of his recovering his\r\nstipulated wages. In this the interests of the employer and the employed\r\ncoincide. The employer desires in his workmen spirit and alacrity, and\r\nthese can be permanently secured in no other way. And if the one ought\r\nto be able to enforce the contract, so ought the other. The public\r\ninterest will be best promoted if the several States will provide\r\nadequate protection and remedies for the freedmen. Until this is in some\r\nway accomplished there is no chance for the advantageous use of their\r\nlabor, and the blame of ill success will not rest on them.\r\n\r\nI know that sincere philanthropy is earnest for the immediate\r\nrealization of its remotest aims; but time is always an element in\r\nreform. It is one of the greatest acts on record to have brought\r\n4,000,000 people into freedom. The career of free industry must be\r\nfairly opened to them, and then their future prosperity and condition\r\nmust, after all, rest mainly on themselves. If they fail, and so perish\r\naway, let us be careful that the failure shall not be attributable to\r\nany denial of justice. In all that relates to the destiny of the\r\nfreedmen we need not be too anxious to read the future; many incidents\r\nwhich, from a speculative point of view, might raise alarm will quietly\r\nsettle themselves. Now that slavery is at an end, or near its end, the\r\ngreatness of its evil in the point of view of public economy becomes\r\nmore and more apparent. Slavery was essentially a monopoly of labor, and\r\nas such locked the States where it prevailed against the incoming of\r\nfree industry. Where labor was the property of the capitalist, the white\r\nman was excluded from employment, or had but the second best chance of\r\nfinding it; and the foreign emigrant turned away from the region where\r\nhis condition would be so precarious. With the destruction of the\r\nmonopoly free labor will hasten from all parts of the civilized world to\r\nassist in developing various and immeasurable resources which have\r\nhitherto lain dormant. The eight or nine States nearest the Gulf of\r\nMexico have a soil of exuberant fertility, a climate friendly to long\r\nlife, and can sustain a denser population than is found as yet in any\r\npart of our country. And the future influx of population to them will\r\nbe mainly from the North or from the most cultivated nations in Europe.\r\nFrom the sufferings that have attended them during our late struggle let\r\nus look away to the future, which is sure to be laden for them with\r\ngreater prosperity than has ever before been known. The removal of the\r\nmonopoly of slave labor is a pledge that those regions will be peopled\r\nby a numerous and enterprising population, which will vie with any in\r\nthe Union in compactness, inventive genius, wealth, and industry.\r\n\r\nOur Government springs from and was made for the people--not the people\r\nfor the Government. To them it owes allegiance; from them it must derive\r\nits courage, strength, and wisdom. But while the Government is thus\r\nbound to defer to the people, from whom it derives its existence, it\r\nshould, from the very consideration of its origin, be strong in its\r\npower of resistance to the establishment of inequalities. Monopolies,\r\nperpetuities, and class legislation are contrary to the genius of free\r\ngovernment, and ought not to be allowed. Here there is no room for\r\nfavored classes or monopolies; the principle of our Government is that\r\nof equal laws and freedom of industry. Wherever monopoly attains a\r\nfoothold, it is sure to be a source of danger, discord, and trouble. We\r\nshall but fulfill our duties as legislators by according \"equal and\r\nexact justice to all men,\" special privileges to none. The Government is\r\nsubordinate to the people; but, as the agent and representative of the\r\npeople, it must be held superior to monopolies, which in themselves\r\nought never to be granted, and which, where they exist, must be\r\nsubordinate and yield to the Government.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution confers on Congress the right to regulate commerce\r\namong the several States. It is of the first necessity, for the\r\nmaintenance of the Union, that that commerce should be free and\r\nunobstructed. No State can be justified in any device to tax the transit\r\nof travel and commerce between States. The position of many States is\r\nsuch that if they were allowed to take advantage of it for purposes of\r\nlocal revenue the commerce between States might be injuriously burdened,\r\nor even virtually prohibited. It is best, while the country is still\r\nyoung and while the tendency to dangerous monopolies of this kind is\r\nstill feeble, to use the power of Congress so as to prevent any selfish\r\nimpediment to the free circulation of men and merchandise. A tax on\r\ntravel and merchandise in their transit constitutes one of the worst\r\nforms of monopoly, and the evil is increased if coupled with a denial of\r\nthe choice of route. When the vast extent of our country is considered,\r\nit is plain that every obstacle to the free circulation of commerce\r\nbetween the States ought to be sternly guarded against by appropriate\r\nlegislation within the limits of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior explains the condition of\r\nthe public lands, the transactions of the Patent Office and the Pension\r\nBureau, the management of our Indian affairs, the progress made in the\r\nconstruction of the Pacific Railroad, and furnishes information in\r\nreference to matters of local interest in the District of Columbia. It\r\nalso presents evidence of the successful operation of the homestead act,\r\nunder the provisions of which 1,160,533 acres of the public lands were\r\nentered during the last fiscal year--more than one-fourth of the whole\r\nnumber of acres sold or otherwise disposed of during that period. It is\r\nestimated that the receipts derived from this source are sufficient to\r\ncover the expenses incident to the survey and disposal of the lands\r\nentered under this act, and that payments in cash to the extent of from\r\n40 to 50 per cent will be made by settlers who may thus at any time\r\nacquire title before the expiration of the period at which it would\r\notherwise vest. The homestead policy was established only after long and\r\nearnest resistance; experience proves its wisdom. The lands in the hands\r\nof industrious settlers, whose labor creates wealth and contributes to\r\nthe public resources, are worth more to the United States than if they\r\nhad been reserved as a solitude for future purchasers.\r\n\r\nThe lamentable events of the last four years and the sacrifices made by\r\nthe gallant men of our Army and Navy have swelled the records of the\r\nPension Bureau to an unprecedented extent. On the 30th day of June last\r\nthe total number of pensioners was 85,986, requiring for their annual\r\npay, exclusive of expenses, the sum of $8,023,445. The number of\r\napplications that have been allowed since that date will require a large\r\nincrease of this amount for the next fiscal year, The means for the\r\npayment of the stipends due under existing laws to our disabled soldiers\r\nand sailors and to the families of such as have perished in the service\r\nof the country will no doubt be cheerfully and promptly granted.\r\nA grateful people will not hesitate to sanction any measures having\r\nfor their object the relief of soldiers mutilated and families made\r\nfatherless in the efforts to preserve our national existence.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General presents an encouraging exhibit\r\nof the operations of the Post-Office Department during the year. The\r\nrevenues of the past year, from the loyal States alone, exceeded the\r\nmaximum annual receipts from all the States previous to the rebellion\r\nin the sum of $6,038,091; and the annual average increase of revenue\r\nduring the last four years, compared with the revenues of the four\r\nyears immediately preceding the rebellion, was $3,533,845. The revenues\r\nof the last fiscal year amounted to $14,556,158 and the expenditures\r\nto $13,694,728, leaving a surplus of receipts over expenditures of\r\n$861,430. Progress has been made in restoring the postal service in the\r\nSouthern States. The views presented by the Postmaster-General against\r\nthe policy of granting subsidies to the ocean mail steamship lines upon\r\nestablished routes and in favor of continuing the present system, which\r\nlimits the compensation for ocean service to the postage earnings, are\r\nrecommended to the careful consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the report of the Secretary of the Navy that while at\r\nthe commencement of the present year there were in commission 530\r\nvessels of all classes and descriptions, armed with 3,000 guns and\r\nmanned by 51,000 men, the number of vessels at present in commission is\r\n117, with 830 guns and 12,128 men. By this prompt reduction of the naval\r\nforces the expenses of the Government have been largely diminished, and\r\na number of vessels purchased for naval purposes from the merchant\r\nmarine have been returned to the peaceful pursuits of commerce. Since\r\nthe suppression of active hostilities our foreign squadrons have been\r\nreestablished, and consist of vessels much more efficient than those\r\nemployed on similar service previous to the rebellion. The suggestion\r\nfor the enlargement of the navy-yards, and especially for the\r\nestablishment of one in fresh water for ironclad vessels, is deserving\r\nof consideration, as is also the recommendation for a different location\r\nand more ample grounds for the Naval Academy.\r\n\r\nIn the report of the Secretary of War a general summary is given of the\r\nmilitary campaigns of 1864 and 1865, ending in the suppression of armed\r\nresistance to the national authority in the insurgent States. The\r\noperations of the general administrative bureaus of the War Department\r\nduring the past year are detailed and an estimate made of the\r\nappropriations that will be required for military purposes in the fiscal\r\nyear commencing the 1st day of July, 1866. The national military force\r\non the 1st of May, 1865, numbered 1,000,516 men. It is proposed to\r\nreduce the military establishment to a peace footing, comprehending\r\n50,000 troops of all arms, organized so as to admit of an enlargement\r\nby filling up the ranks to 82,600 if the circumstances of the country\r\nshould require an augmentation of the Army. The volunteer force has\r\nalready been reduced by the discharge from service of over 800,000\r\ntroops, and the Department is proceeding rapidly in the work of further\r\nreduction. The war estimates are reduced from $516,240,131 to\r\n$33,814,461, which amount, in the opinion of the Department, is adequate\r\nfor a peace establishment. The measures of retrenchment in each bureau\r\nand branch of the service exhibit a diligent economy worthy of\r\ncommendation. Reference is also made in the report to the necessity of\r\nproviding for a uniform militia system and to the propriety of making\r\nsuitable provision for wounded and disabled officers and soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe revenue system of the country is a subject of vital interest to its\r\nhonor and prosperity, and should command the earnest consideration of\r\nCongress. The Secretary of the Treasury will lay before you a full and\r\ndetailed report of the receipts and disbursements of the last fiscal\r\nyear, of the first quarter of the present fiscal year, of the probable\r\nreceipts and expenditures for the other three quarters, and the\r\nestimates for the year following the 30th of June, 1866. I might content\r\nmyself with a reference to that report, in which you will find all the\r\ninformation required for your deliberations and decision, but the\r\nparamount importance of the subject so presses itself on my own mind\r\nthat I can not but lay before you my views of the measures which are\r\nrequired for the good character, and I might almost say for the\r\nexistence, of this people. The life of a republic lies certainly in the\r\nenergy, virtue, and intelligence of its citizens; but it is equally true\r\nthat a good revenue system is the life of an organized government. I\r\nmeet you at a time when the nation has voluntarily burdened itself with\r\na debt unprecedented in our annals. Vast as is its amount, it fades away\r\ninto nothing when compared with the countless blessings that will be\r\nconferred upon our country and upon man by the preservation of the\r\nnation's life. Now, on the first occasion of the meeting of Congress\r\nsince the return of peace, it is of the utmost importance to inaugurate\r\na just policy, which shall at once be put in motion, and which shall\r\ncommend itself to those who come after us for its continuance. We must\r\naim at nothing less than the complete effacement of the financial evils\r\nthat necessarily followed a state of civil war. We must endeavor to\r\napply the earliest remedy to the deranged state of the currency, and not\r\nshrink from devising a policy which, without being oppressive to the\r\npeople, shall immediately begin to effect a reduction of the debt, and,\r\nif persisted in, discharge it fully within a definitely fixed number of\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIt is our first duty to prepare in earnest for our recovery from the\r\never-increasing evils of an irredeemable currency without a sudden\r\nrevulsion, and yet without untimely procrastination. For that end we\r\nmust each, in our respective positions, prepare the way. I hold it the\r\nduty of the Executive to insist upon frugality in the expenditures, and\r\na sparing economy is itself a great national resource. Of the banks to\r\nwhich authority has been given to issue notes secured by bonds of the\r\nUnited States we may require the greatest moderation and prudence, and\r\nthe law must be rigidly enforced when its limits are exceeded. We may\r\neach one of us counsel our active and enterprising countrymen to be\r\nconstantly on their guard, to liquidate debts contracted in a paper\r\ncurrency, and by conducting business as nearly as possible on a system\r\nof cash payments or short credits to hold themselves prepared to return\r\nto the standard of gold and silver. To aid our fellow-citizens in the\r\nprudent management of their monetary affairs, the duty devolves on us to\r\ndiminish by law the amount of paper money now in circulation. Five years\r\nago the bank-note circulation of the country amounted to not much more\r\nthan two hundred millions; now the circulation, bank and national,\r\nexceeds seven hundred millions. The simple statement of the fact\r\nrecommends more strongly than any words of mine could do the necessity\r\nof our restraining this expansion. The gradual reduction of the currency\r\nis the only measure that can save the business of the country from\r\ndisastrous calamities, and this can be almost imperceptibly accomplished\r\nby gradually funding the national circulation in securities that may be\r\nmade redeemable at the pleasure of the Government.\r\n\r\nOur debt is doubly secure--first in the actual wealth and still greater\r\nundeveloped resources of the country, and next in the character of our\r\ninstitutions. The most intelligent observers among political economists\r\nhave not failed to remark that the public debt of a country is safe in\r\nproportion as its people are free; that the debt of a republic is the\r\nsafest of all. Our history confirms and establishes the theory, and is,\r\nI firmly believe, destined to give it a still more signal illustration.\r\nThe secret of this superiority springs not merely from the fact that in\r\na republic the national obligations are distributed more widely through\r\ncountless numbers in all classes of society; it has its root in the\r\ncharacter of our laws. Here all men contribute to the public welfare and\r\nbear their fair share of the public burdens. During the war, under the\r\nimpulses of patriotism, the men of the great body of the people, without\r\nregard to their own comparative want of wealth, thronged to our armies\r\nand filled our fleets of war, and held themselves ready to offer their\r\nlives for the public good. Now, in their turn, the property and income\r\nof the country should bear their just proportion of the burden of\r\ntaxation, while in our impost system, through means of which increased\r\nvitality is incidentally imparted to all the industrial interests of\r\nthe nation, the duties should be so adjusted as to fall most heavily\r\non articles of luxury, leaving the necessaries of life as free from\r\ntaxation as the absolute wants of the Government economically\r\nadministered will justify. No favored class should demand freedom from\r\nassessment, and the taxes should be so distributed as not to fall unduly\r\non the poor, but rather on the accumulated wealth of the country. We\r\nshould look at the national debt just as it is--not as a national\r\nblessing, but as a heavy burden on the industry of the country, to be\r\ndischarged without unnecessary delay.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated by the Secretary of the Treasury that the expenditures\r\nfor the fiscal year ending the 30th of June, 1866, will exceed the\r\nreceipts $112,194,947. It is gratifying, however, to state that it is\r\nalso estimated that the revenue for the year ending the 30th of June,\r\n1867, will exceed the expenditures in the sum of $111,682,818. This\r\namount, or so much as may be deemed sufficient for the purpose, may be\r\napplied to the reduction of the public debt, which on the 31st day of\r\nOctober, 1865, was $2,740,854,750. Every reduction will diminish the\r\ntotal amount of interest to be paid, and so enlarge the means of still\r\nfurther reductions, until the whole shall be liquidated; and this, as\r\nwill be seen from the estimates of the Secretary of the Treasury, may be\r\naccomplished by annual payments even within a period not exceeding\r\nthirty years. I have faith that we shall do all this within a reasonable\r\ntime; that as we have amazed the world by the suppression of a civil war\r\nwhich was thought to be beyond the control of any government, so we\r\nshall equally show the superiority of our institutions by the prompt and\r\nfaithful discharge of our national obligations.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture under its present direction is\r\naccomplishing much in developing and utilizing the vast agricultural\r\ncapabilities of the country, and for information respecting the details\r\nof its management reference is made to the annual report of the\r\nCommissioner.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt thus fully on our domestic affairs because of their\r\ntranscendent importance. Under any circumstances our great extent of\r\nterritory and variety of climate, producing almost everything that is\r\nnecessary for the wants and even the comforts of man, make us singularly\r\nindependent of the varying policy of foreign powers and protect us\r\nagainst every temptation to \"entangling alliances,\" while at the present\r\nmoment the reestablishment of harmony and the strength that comes from\r\nharmony will be our best security against \"nations who feel power and\r\nforget right.\" For myself, it has been and it will be my constant aim to\r\npromote peace and amity with all foreign nations and powers, and I have\r\nevery reason to believe that they all, without exception, are animated\r\nby the same disposition. Our relations with the Emperor of China, so\r\nrecent in their origin, are most friendly. Our commerce with his\r\ndominions is receiving new developments, and it is very pleasing to find\r\nthat the Government of that great Empire manifests satisfaction with our\r\npolicy and reposes just confidence in the fairness which marks our\r\nintercourse. The unbroken harmony between the United States and the\r\nEmperor of Russia is receiving a new support from an enterprise designed\r\nto carry telegraphic lines across the continent of Asia, through his\r\ndominions, and so to connect us with all Europe by a new channel of\r\nintercourse. Our commerce with South America is about to receive\r\nencouragement by a direct line of mail steamships to the rising Empire\r\nof Brazil. The distinguished party of men of science who have recently\r\nleft our country to make a scientific exploration of the natural history\r\nand rivers and mountain ranges of that region have received from the\r\nEmperor that generous welcome which was to have been expected from his\r\nconstant friendship for the United States and his well-known zeal in\r\npromoting the advancement of knowledge. A hope is entertained that our\r\ncommerce with the rich and populous countries that border the\r\nMediterranean Sea may be largely increased. Nothing will be wanting on\r\nthe part of this Government to extend the protection of our flag over\r\nthe enterprise of our fellow-citizens. We receive from the powers in\r\nthat region assurances of good will; and it is worthy of note that a\r\nspecial envoy has brought us messages of condolence on the death of our\r\nlate Chief Magistrate from the Bey of Tunis, whose rule includes the old\r\ndominions of Carthage, on the African coast.\r\n\r\nOur domestic contest, now happily ended, has left some traces in our\r\nrelations with one at least of the great maritime powers. The formal\r\naccordance of belligerent rights to the insurgent States was\r\nunprecedented, and has not been justified by the issue. But in the\r\nsystems of neutrality pursued by the powers which made that concession\r\nthere was a marked difference. The materials of war for the insurgent\r\nStates were furnished, in a great measure, from the workshops of Great\r\nBritain, and British ships, manned by British subjects and prepared for\r\nreceiving British armaments, sallied from the ports of Great Britain to\r\nmake war on American commerce under the shelter of a commission from the\r\ninsurgent States. These ships, having once escaped from British ports,\r\never afterwards entered them in every part of the world to refit, and so\r\nto renew their depredations. The consequences of this conduct were most\r\ndisastrous to the States then in rebellion, increasing their desolation\r\nand misery by the prolongation of our civil contest. It had, moreover,\r\nthe effect, to a great extent, to drive the American flag from the sea,\r\nand to transfer much of our shipping and our commerce to the very power\r\nwhose subjects had created the necessity for such a change. These events\r\ntook place before I was called to the administration of the Government.\r\nThe sincere desire for peace by which I am animated led me to approve\r\nthe proposal, already made, to submit the question which had thus arisen\r\nbetween the countries to arbitration. These questions are of such moment\r\nthat they must have commanded the attention of the great powers, and are\r\nso interwoven with the peace and interests of every one of them as to\r\nhave insured an impartial decision. I regret to inform you that Great\r\nBritain declined the arbitrament, but, on the other hand, invited us to\r\nthe formation of a joint commission to settle mutual claims between the\r\ntwo countries, from which those for the depredations before mentioned\r\nshould be excluded. The proposition, in that very unsatisfactory form,\r\nhas been declined.\r\n\r\nThe United States did not present the subject as an impeachment of the\r\ngood faith of a power which was professing the most friendly\r\ndispositions, but as involving questions of public law of which the\r\nsettlement is essential to the peace of nations; and though pecuniary\r\nreparation to their injured citizens would have followed incidentally\r\non a decision against Great Britain, such compensation was not their\r\nprimary object. They had a higher motive, and it was in the interests of\r\npeace and justice to establish important principles of international\r\nlaw. The correspondence will be placed before you. The ground on which\r\nthe British minister rests his justification is, substantially, that the\r\nmunicipal law of a nation and the domestic interpretations of that law\r\nare the measure of its duty as a neutral, and I feel bound to declare my\r\nopinion before you and before the world that that justification can not\r\nbe sustained before the tribunal of nations. At the same time, I do not\r\nadvise to any present attempt at redress by acts of legislation. For the\r\nfuture, friendship between the two countries must rest on the basis of\r\nmutual justice.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment of the establishment of our free Constitution the\r\ncivilized world has been convulsed by revolutions in the interests of\r\ndemocracy or of monarchy, but through all those revolutions the United\r\nStates have wisely and firmly refused to become propagandists of\r\nrepublicanism. It is the only government suited to our condition; but\r\nwe have never sought to impose it on others, and we have consistently\r\nfollowed the advice of Washington to recommend it only by the careful\r\npreservation and prudent use of the blessing. During all the intervening\r\nperiod the policy of European powers and of the United States has, on\r\nthe whole, been harmonious. Twice, indeed, rumors of the invasion of\r\nsome parts of America in the interest of monarchy have prevailed; twice\r\nmy predecessors have had occasion to announce the views of this nation\r\nin respect to such interference. On both occasions the remonstrance of\r\nthe United States was respected from a deep conviction on the part of\r\nEuropean Governments that the system of noninterference and mutual\r\nabstinence from propagandism was the true rule for the two hemispheres.\r\nSince those times we have advanced in wealth and power, but we retain\r\nthe same purpose to leave the nations of Europe to choose their own\r\ndynasties and form their own systems of government. This consistent\r\nmoderation may justly demand a corresponding moderation. We should\r\nregard it as a great calamity to ourselves, to the cause of good\r\ngovernment, and to the peace of the world should any European power\r\nchallenge the American people, as it were, to the defense of\r\nrepublicanism against foreign interference. We can not foresee and are\r\nunwilling to consider what opportunities might present themselves, what\r\ncombinations might offer to protect ourselves against designs inimical\r\nto our form of government. The United States desire to act in the\r\nfuture as they have ever acted heretofore; they never will be driven\r\nfrom that course but by the aggression of European powers, and we\r\nrely on the wisdom and justice of those powers to respect the system of\r\nnoninterference which has so long been sanctioned by time, and which by\r\nits good results has approved itself to both continents.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence between the United States and France in reference to\r\nquestions which have become subjects of discussion between the two\r\nGovernments will at a proper time be laid before Congress.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the organization of our Government under the Constitution, the\r\nPresident of the United States delivered his inaugural address to the\r\ntwo Houses of Congress, he said to them, and through them to the country\r\nand to mankind, that--\r\n\r\n  The preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the\r\n  republican model of government are justly considered, perhaps, as\r\n  _deeply_, as _finally_, staked on the experiment intrusted to the hands\r\n  of the American people.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the House of Representatives answered Washington by the voice of\r\nMadison:\r\n\r\n  We adore the Invisible Hand which has led the American people, through\r\n  so many difficulties, to cherish a conscious responsibility for the\r\n  destiny of republican liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore than seventy-six years have glided away since these words were\r\nspoken; the United States have passed through severer trials than were\r\nforeseen; and now, at this new epoch in our existence as one nation,\r\nwith our Union purified by sorrows and strengthened by conflict and\r\nestablished by the virtue of the people, the greatness of the occasion\r\ninvites us once more to repeat with solemnity the pledges of our fathers\r\nto hold ourselves answerable before our fellow-men for the success of\r\nthe republican form of government. Experience has proved its sufficiency\r\nin peace and in war; it has vindicated its authority through dangers and\r\nafflictions, and sudden and terrible emergencies, which would have\r\ncrushed any system that had been less firmly fixed in the hearts of the\r\npeople. At the inauguration of Washington the foreign relations of the\r\ncountry were few and its trade was repressed by hostile regulations; now\r\nall the civilized nations of the globe welcome our commerce, and their\r\ngovernments profess toward us amity. Then our country felt its way\r\nhesitatingly along an untried path, with States so little bound together\r\nby rapid means of communication as to be hardly known to one another,\r\nand with historic traditions extending over very few years; now\r\nintercourse between the States is swift and intimate; the experience of\r\ncenturies has been crowded into a few generations, and has created an\r\nintense, indestructible nationality. Then our jurisdiction did not reach\r\nbeyond the inconvenient boundaries of the territory which had achieved\r\nindependence; now, through cessions of lands, first colonized by Spain\r\nand France, the country has acquired a more complex character, and has\r\nfor its natural limits the chain of lakes, the Gulf of Mexico, and on\r\nthe east and the west the two great oceans. Other nations were wasted by\r\ncivil wars for ages before they could establish for themselves the\r\nnecessary degree of unity; the latent conviction that our form of\r\ngovernment is the best ever known to the world has enabled us to emerge\r\nfrom civil war within four years with a complete vindication of the\r\nconstitutional authority of the General Government and with our local\r\nliberties and State institutions unimpaired.\r\n\r\nThe throngs of emigrants that crowd to our shores are witnesses of the\r\nconfidence of all peoples in our permanence. Here is the great land of\r\nfree labor, where industry is blessed with unexampled rewards and the\r\nbread of the workingman is sweetened by the consciousness that the cause\r\nof the country \"is his own cause, his own safety, his own dignity.\" Here\r\neveryone enjoys the free use of his faculties and the choice of activity\r\nas a natural right. Here, under the combined influence of a fruitful\r\nsoil, genial climes, and happy institutions, population has increased\r\nfifteen-fold within a century. Here, through the easy development of\r\nboundless resources, wealth has increased with twofold greater rapidity\r\nthan numbers, so that we have become secure against the financial\r\nvicissitudes of other countries and, alike in business and in opinion,\r\nare self-centered and truly independent. Here more and more care is\r\ngiven to provide education for everyone born on our soil. Here religion,\r\nreleased from political connection with the civil government, refuses to\r\nsubserve the craft of statesmen, and becomes in its independence the\r\nspiritual life of the people. Here toleration is extended to every\r\nopinion, in the quiet certainty that truth needs only a fair field to\r\nsecure the victory. Here the human mind goes forth unshackled in the\r\npursuit of science, to collect stores of knowledge and acquire an\r\never-increasing mastery over the forces of nature. Here the national\r\ndomain is offered and held in millions of separate freeholds, so that\r\nour fellow-citizens, beyond the occupants of any other part of the\r\nearth, constitute in reality a people. Here exists the democratic form\r\nof government; and that form of government, by the confession of\r\nEuropean statesmen, \"gives a power of which no other form is capable,\r\nbecause it incorporates every man with the state and arouses everything\r\nthat belongs to the soul.\"\r\n\r\nWhere in past history does a parallel exist to the public happiness\r\nwhich is within the reach of the people of the United States? Where in\r\nany part of the globe can institutions be found so suited to their\r\nhabits or so entitled to their love as their own free Constitution?\r\nEvery one of them, then, in whatever part of the land he has his home,\r\nmust wish its perpetuity. Who of them will not now acknowledge, in the\r\nwords of Washington, that \"every step by which the people of the United\r\nStates have advanced to the character of an independent nation seems to\r\nhave been distinguished by some token of providential agency\"? Who will\r\nnot join with me in the prayer that the Invisible Hand which has led us\r\nthrough the clouds that gloomed around our path will so guide us onward\r\nto a perfect restoration of fraternal affection that we of this day may\r\nbe able to transmit our great inheritance of State governments in all\r\ntheir rights, of the General Government in its whole constitutional\r\nvigor, to our posterity, and they to theirs through countless\r\ngenerations?\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 11, 1865_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit a report of this date from the Secretary of State, and the\r\npapers referred to therein, concerning the Universal Exposition to be\r\nheld at Paris in the year 1867, in which the United States have been\r\ninvited by the Government of France to take part. I commend the subject\r\nto your early and favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 13, 1865_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 11th instant,\r\nrequesting information on the subject of a decree of the so-called\r\nEmperor of Mexico of the 3d of October last, I transmit a report from\r\nthe Secretary of State and the documents by which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 14, 1865_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n11th instant, requesting information relative to a so-called decree\r\nconcerning the reestablishment of slavery or peonage in the Republic\r\nof Mexico, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State and the\r\ndocuments by which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _December 18, 1865_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the requirements of the third section of the act\r\napproved March 3, 1865, I transmit herewith a communication from the\r\nSecretary of War, with the accompanying report and estimates of the\r\nCommissioner of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 18, 1865_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn reply to the resolution adopted by the Senate on the 12th instant,\r\nI have the honor to state that the rebellion waged by a portion of the\r\npeople against the properly constituted authority of the Government of\r\nthe United States has been suppressed; that the United States are in\r\npossession of every State in which the insurrection existed, and that,\r\nas far as it could be done, the courts of the United States have been\r\nrestored, post-offices reestablished, and steps taken to put into\r\neffective operation the revenue laws of the country.\r\n\r\nAs the result of the measures instituted by the Executive with the view\r\nof inducing a resumption of the functions of the States comprehended in\r\nthe inquiry of the Senate, the people of North Carolina, South Carolina,\r\nGeorgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee have\r\nreorganized their respective State governments, and \"are yielding\r\nobedience to the laws and Government of the United States\" with more\r\nwillingness and greater promptitude than under the circumstances could\r\nreasonably have been anticipated. The proposed amendment to the\r\nConstitution, providing for the abolition of slavery forever within the\r\nlimits of the country, has been ratified by each one of those States,\r\nwith the exception of Mississippi, from which no official information\r\nhas been received, and in nearly all of them measures have been adopted\r\nor are now pending to confer upon freedmen the privileges which are\r\nessential to their comfort, protection, and security. In Florida and\r\nTexas the people are making commendable progress in restoring their\r\nState governments, and no doubt is entertained that they will at an\r\nearly period be in a condition to resume all of their practical\r\nrelations with the General Government.\r\n\r\nIn \"that portion of the Union lately in rebellion\" the aspect of affairs\r\nis more promising than, in view of all the circumstances, could well\r\nhave been expected. The people throughout the entire South evince a\r\nlaudable desire to renew their allegiance to the Government and to\r\nrepair the devastations of war by a prompt and cheerful return to\r\npeaceful pursuits, and abiding faith is entertained that their actions\r\nwill conform to their professions, and that in acknowledging the\r\nsupremacy of the Constitution and laws of the United States their\r\nloyalty will be unreservedly given to the Government, whose leniency\r\nthey can not fail to appreciate and whose fostering care will soon\r\nrestore them to a condition of prosperity. It is true that in some of\r\nthe States the demoralizing effects of the war are to be seen in\r\noccasional disorders; but these are local in character, not frequent in\r\noccurrence, and are rapidly disappearing as the authority of civil law\r\nis extended and sustained. Perplexing questions are naturally to be\r\nexpected from the great and sudden change in the relations between the\r\ntwo races; but systems are gradually developing themselves under which\r\nthe freedman will receive the protection to which he is justly entitled,\r\nand, by means of his labor, make himself a useful and independent member\r\nin the community in which he has a home.\r\n\r\nFrom all the information in my possession and from that which I have\r\nrecently derived from the most reliable authority I am induced to\r\ncherish the belief that sectional animosity is surely and rapidly\r\nmerging itself into a spirit of nationality, and that representation,\r\nconnected with a properly adjusted system of taxation, will result in\r\na harmonious restoration of the relation of the States to the National\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nThe report of Carl Schurz is herewith transmitted, as requested by the\r\nSenate. No reports from the Hon. John Covode have been received by the\r\nPresident. The attention of the Senate is invited to the accompanying\r\nreport from Lieutenant-General Grant, who recently made a tour of\r\ninspection through several of the States whose inhabitants participated\r\nin the rebellion.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 20, 1865_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn reply to the resolution of the Senate of the 19th instant, requesting\r\nthat the President, if not inconsistent with the public service,\r\ncommunicate to the Senate the \"report of General Howard of his\r\nobservations of the condition of the seceded States and the operation of\r\nthe Freedmen's Bureau therein,\" I have to state that the report of the\r\nCommissioner of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands\r\nwas yesterday transmitted to both Houses of Congress, as required by the\r\nthird section of the act approved March 3, 1865.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 21, 1865_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 11th instant,\r\nrespecting the occupation by the French troops of the Republic of Mexico\r\nand the establishment of a monarchy there, I transmit a report from the\r\nSecretary of State and the documents by which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 5, 1866_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 19th ultimo,\r\nrequesting information in regard to any plans to induce the immigration\r\nof dissatisfied citizens of the United States into Mexico, their\r\norganization there with the view to create disturbances in the United\r\nStates, and especially in regard to the plans of Dr. William M. Gwin and\r\nM.F. Maury, and to the action taken by the Government of the United\r\nStates to prevent the success of such schemes, I transmit a report from\r\nthe Acting Secretary of State and the papers by which it was\r\naccompanied.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 5, 1866_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have received the following preamble and resolution, adopted by the\r\nSenate on the 21st ultimo:\r\n\r\n  Whereas the Constitution declares that \"in all criminal prosecutions\r\n  the accused shall enjoy the right of a speedy and public trial by an\r\n  impartial jury of the State or district wherein the crime shall have\r\n  been committed;\" and\r\n\r\n  Whereas several months have elapsed since Jefferson Davis, late\r\n  president of the so-called Confederate States, was captured and confined\r\n  for acts notoriously done by him as such, which acts, if duly proved,\r\n  render him guilty of treason against the United States and liable to the\r\n  penalties thereof; and\r\n\r\n  Whereas hostilities between the Government of the United States and the\r\n  insurgents have ceased, and not one of the latter, so far as is known to\r\n  the Senate, is now held in confinement for the part he may have acted in\r\n  the rebellion except said Jefferson Davis: Therefore,\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the President be respectfully requested, if compatible\r\n  with the public safety, to inform the Senate upon what charges or for\r\n  what reasons said Jefferson Davis is still held in confinement, and why\r\n  he has not been put upon his trial.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reply to the resolution I transmit the accompanying reports from the\r\nSecretary of War and the Attorney-General, and at the same time invite\r\nthe attention of the Senate to that portion of my message dated the 4th\r\nday of December last which refers to Congress the questions connected\r\nwith the holding of circuit courts of the United States within the\r\ndistricts where their authority has been interrupted.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 5, 1866_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of\r\nthe 18th ultimo, requesting information in regard to steps taken by the\r\nso-called Emperor of Mexico or by any European power to obtain from the\r\nUnited States a recognition of the so-called Empire of Mexico, and what\r\naction has been taken in the premises by the Government of the United\r\nStates, I transmit a report from the Acting Secretary of State and the\r\npapers by which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 10, 1866_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 8th\r\ninstant, asking for information in regard to the alleged kidnaping in\r\nMexico of the child of an American lady, I transmit a report from the\r\nActing Secretary of State, to whom the resolution was referred.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _January 12, 1866_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a communication addressed to me by Messrs. John\r\nEvans and J.B. Chaífee as \"United States Senators elect from the State\r\nof Colorado,\" together with the accompanying documents.\r\n\r\nUnder authority of the act of Congress approved the 21st day of\r\nMarch, 1864, the people of Colorado, through a convention, formed a\r\nconstitution making provision for a State government, which, when\r\nsubmitted to the qualified voters of the Territory, was rejected.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1865 a second convention was called by the executive\r\ncommittees of the several political parties in the Territory, which\r\nassembled at Denver on the 8th of August, 1865. On the 12th of that\r\nmonth this convention adopted a State constitution, which was submitted\r\nto the people on the 5th of September, 1865, and ratified by a majority\r\nof 155 of the qualified voters. The proceedings in the second instance\r\nfor the formation of a State government having differed in time and mode\r\nfrom those specified in the act of March 21, 1864, I have declined to\r\nissue the proclamation for which provision is made in the fifth section\r\nof the law, and therefore submit the question for the consideration and\r\nfurther action of Congress.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE OFFICE, _January 20, 1866_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to the Senate herewith, for its constitutional action\r\nthereon, the several treaties[5] with the Indians of the Southwest\r\nreferred to in the accompanying communication from the Secretary of\r\nthe Interior.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: With the confederated tribes of the Arapahoe and Cheyenne\r\nIndians, concluded October 14, 1865;

This period expired December 22, 1865.\r\nSixty-two miles had been previously accepted by the Government. Since\r\nthat date an additional section of 23 miles has been completed.\r\nCommissioners appointed for that purpose have examined and reported\r\nupon it, and an application has been made for its acceptance.\r\n\r\nThe failure to complete 100 miles of road within the period prescribed\r\nrenders it questionable whether the executive officers of the Government\r\nare authorized to issue the bonds and patents to which the company would\r\nbe entitled if this as well as the other requirements of the act had\r\nbeen faithfully observed.\r\n\r\nThis failure may to some extent be ascribed to the financial condition\r\nof the country incident to the recent civil war. As the company appear\r\nto be engaged in the energetic prosecution of their work and manifest a\r\ndisposition to comply with the conditions of the grant, I recommend that\r\nthe time for the completion of this part of the road be extended and\r\nthat authority be given for the issue of bonds and patents on account of\r\nthe section now offered for acceptance notwithstanding such failure,\r\nshould the company in other respects be thereunto entitled.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _April 28, 1866_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the constitutional action of the Senate, a\r\ntreaty this day concluded with the Choctaw and Chickasaw nations of\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 30, 1866_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 25th\r\ninstant, requesting information in regard to the rebel debt known as the\r\ncotton loan, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State, to whom\r\nthe resolution was referred.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _May 2, 1866_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn reply to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 23d\r\nultimo, I transmit a report from the Secretary of War, from which it\r\nwill be perceived that it is not deemed compatible with the public\r\ninterests to communicate to the House the report made by General Smith\r\nand the Hon. James T. Brady of their investigations at New Orleans, La.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _May 4, 1866_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 5th\r\nof March, 1866, requesting the names of persons worth more than $20,000\r\nto whom special pardons have been issued, and a statement of the amount\r\nof property which has been seized as belonging to the enemies of the\r\nGovernment, or as abandoned property, and returned to those who claimed\r\nto be the original owners, I transmit herewith reports from the\r\nSecretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of\r\nWar, and the Attorney-General, together with a copy of the amnesty\r\nproclamation of the 29th of May, 1865, and a copy of the warrants issued\r\nin cases in which special pardons are granted. The second, third, and\r\nfourth conditions of the warrant prescribe the terms, so far as property\r\nis concerned, upon which all such pardons are granted and accepted.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 4, 1866_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nReferring to my message of the 12th of March last, communicating\r\ninformation in regard to a proposed exposition of fishery and water\r\nculture at Arcachon, in France, I communicate a copy of another dispatch\r\nfrom the minister of the United States in Paris to the Secretary of\r\nState, and again invite the attention of Congress to the subject.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 7, 1866_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 19th ultimo,\r\nI transmit herewith a report from Benjamin C.

in regard to the departure of troops from\r\nAustria to Mexico, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State and\r\nthe documents by which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 16, 1866_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate herewith a report from the Acting Secretary of the\r\nInterior, furnishing, as requested by a resolution of the Senate of the\r\n25th ultimo, information touching the transactions of the executive\r\nbranch of the Government respecting the transportation, settlement,\r\nand colonization of persons of the African race.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 18, 1866_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn reply to a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 11th\r\ninstant, requesting information in regard to the dispatch of military\r\nforces from Austria for service in Mexico, I transmit a report from the\r\nSecretary of State on the subject.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _June 20, 1866_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n21st ultimo, requesting information as to the collection of the direct\r\ntax in the States whose inhabitants participated in the rebellion, I\r\ntransmit a communication from the Secretary of the Treasury, accompanied\r\nby a report from the Deputy Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _June 22, 1866_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI submit to Congress a report of the Secretary of State, to whom was\r\nreferred the concurrent resolution of the 18th instant, respecting a\r\nsubmission to the legislatures of the States of an additional article to\r\nthe Constitution of the United States. It will be seen from this report\r\nthat the Secretary of State had, on the 16th instant, transmitted to the\r\ngovernors of the several States certified copies of the joint resolution\r\npassed on the 13th instant, proposing an amendment to the Constitution.\r\n\r\nEven in ordinary times any question of amending the Constitution must be\r\njustly regarded as of paramount importance. This importance is at the\r\npresent time enhanced by the fact that the joint resolution was not\r\nsubmitted by the two Houses for the approval of the President and that\r\nof the thirty-six States which constitute the Union eleven are excluded\r\nfrom representation in either House of Congress, although, with the\r\nsingle exception of Texas, they have been entirely restored to all their\r\nfunctions as States in conformity with the organic law of the land, and\r\nhave appeared at the national capital by Senators and Representatives,\r\nwho have applied for and have been refused admission to the vacant\r\nseats. Nor have the sovereign people of the nation been afforded an\r\nopportunity of expressing their views upon the important questions which\r\nthe amendment involves. Grave doubts, therefore, may naturally and\r\njustly arise as to whether the action of Congress is in harmony with\r\nthe sentiments of the people, and whether State legislatures, elected\r\nwithout reference to such an issue, should be called upon by Congress\r\nto decide respecting the ratification of the proposed amendment.\r\n\r\nWaiving the question as to the constitutional validity of the\r\nproceedings of Congress upon the joint resolution proposing the\r\namendment or as to the merits of the article which it submits through\r\nthe executive department to the legislatures of the States, I deem it\r\nproper to observe that the steps taken by the Secretary of State, as\r\ndetailed in the accompanying report, are to be considered as purely\r\nministerial, and in no sense whatever committing the Executive to an\r\napproval or a recommendation of the amendment to the State legislatures\r\nor to the people. On the contrary, a proper appreciation of the letter\r\nand spirit of the Constitution, as well as of the interests of national\r\norder, harmony, and union, and a due deference for an enlightened public\r\njudgment may at this time well suggest a doubt whether any amendment to\r\nthe Constitution ought to be proposed by Congress and pressed upon the\r\nlegislatures of the several States for final decision until after the\r\nadmission of such loyal Senators and Representatives of the now\r\nunrepresented States as have been or as may hereafter be chosen in\r\nconformity with the Constitution and laws of the United States.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 22, 1866_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn further answer to recent

Senate_:\r\n\r\nI herewith submit, for the constitutional action of the Senate, a treaty\r\nnegotiated at the city of Washington, D.C., on the 19th instant, between\r\nthe United States, represented by Dennis N. Cooley, Commissioner of\r\nIndian Affairs, and Elijah Sells, superintendent of Indian affairs for\r\nthe southern superintendency, and the Cherokee Nation of Indians;\r\nrepresented by its delegates, James McDaniel, Smith Christie, White\r\nCatcher, L.H. Benge, J.B. Jones, and Daniel H. Ross.\r\n\r\nThe distracted condition of the Cherokee Nation and the peculiar\r\nrelation of many of its members to this Government during the rebellion\r\npresented almost insuperable difficulties to treating with them. The\r\ntreaty now submitted is a result of protracted negotiations. Its\r\nstipulations are, it is believed, as satisfactory to the contracting\r\nparties and furnish as just provisions for the welfare of the Indians\r\nand as strong guaranties for the maintenance of peaceful relations with\r\nthem as under the circumstances could be expected.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _July 24, 1866_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI hereby transmit, for the constitutional action of the Senate, a treaty\r\nconcluded on the 15th of November, 1865, between the United States and\r\nthe confederate tribes and bands of Indians of middle Oregon, the same\r\nbeing amendatory and supplemental to the treaty with said Indians of the\r\n25th of June, 1855.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _July 24, 1866_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe following \"Joint resolution, restoring Tennessee to her relations in\r\nthe Union,\" was last evening presented for my approval:\r\n\r\nWhereas in the year 1861 the government of the State of Tennessee was\r\nseized upon and taken possession of by persons in hostility to the\r\nUnited States, and the inhabitants of said State, in pursuance of an act\r\nof Congress, were declared to be in a state of insurrection against the\r\nUnited States; and\r\n\r\nWhereas said State government can only be restored to its former\r\npolitical relations in the Union by the consent of the lawmaking power\r\nof the United States; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the people of said State did, on the 22d day of February, 1865,\r\nby a large popular vote, adopt and ratify a constitution of government\r\nwhereby slavery was abolished and all ordinances and laws of secession\r\nand debts contracted under the same were declared void; and\r\n\r\nWhereas a State government has been organized under said constitution\r\nwhich has ratified the amendment to the Constitution of the United\r\nStates abolishing slavery, also the amendment proposed by the\r\nThirty-ninth Congress, and has done other acts proclaiming and denoting\r\nloyalty: Therefore,\r\n\r\n_Be it resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates in Congress assembled_, That the State of Tennessee is hereby\r\nrestored to her former proper practical relations to the Union, and is\r\nagain entitled to be represented by Senators and Representatives in\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe preamble simply consists of statements, some of which are assumed,\r\nwhile the resolution is merely a declaration of opinion. It comprises no\r\nlegislation, nor does it confer any power which is binding upon the\r\nrespective Houses, the Executive, or the States. It does not admit to\r\ntheir seats in Congress the Senators and Representatives from the State\r\nof Tennessee, for, notwithstanding the passage of the resolution, each\r\nHouse, in the exercise of the constitutional right to judge for itself\r\nof the elections, returns, and qualifications of its members, may, at\r\nits discretion, admit them or continue to exclude them. If a joint\r\nresolution of this kind were necessary and binding as a condition\r\nprecedent to the admission of members of Congress, it would happen, in\r\nthe event of a veto by the Executive, that Senators and Representatives\r\ncould only be admitted to the halls of legislation by a two-thirds vote\r\nof each of the Houses.\r\n\r\nAmong other reasons recited in the preamble for the declaration\r\ncontained in the resolution is the ratification by the State government\r\nof Tennessee of \"the amendment to the Constitution of the United States\r\nabolishing slavery, also the amendment proposed by the Thirty-ninth\r\nCongress.\" If, as is also declared in the preamble, \"said State\r\ngovernment can only be restored to its former political relations in the\r\nUnion by the consent of the lawmaking power of the United States,\" it\r\nwould really seem to follow that the joint resolution which at this late\r\nday has received the sanction of Congress should have been passed,\r\napproved, and placed on the statute books before any amendment to the\r\nConstitution was submitted to the legislature of Tennessee for\r\nratification. Otherwise the inference is plainly deducible that while,\r\nin the opinion of Congress, the people of a State may be too strongly\r\ndisloyal to be entitled to representation, they may nevertheless, during\r\nthe suspension of their \"former proper practical relations to the\r\nUnion,\" have an equally potent voice with other and loyal States in\r\npropositions to amend the Constitution, upon which so essentially depend\r\nthe stability, prosperity, and very existence of the nation.\r\n\r\nA brief reference to my annual message of the 4th of December last will\r\nshow the steps taken by the Executive for the restoration to their\r\nconstitutional relations to the Union of the States that had been\r\naffected by the rebellion. Upon the cessation of active hostilities\r\nprovisional governors were appointed, conventions called, governors\r\nelected by the people, legislatures assembled, and Senators and\r\nRepresentatives chosen to the Congress of the United States. At the same\r\ntime the courts of the United States were reopened, the blockade\r\nremoved, the custom-houses reestablished, and postal operations resumed.\r\nThe amendment to the Constitution abolishing slavery forever within the\r\nlimits of the country was also submitted to the States, and they were\r\nthus invited to and did participate in its ratification, thus exercising\r\nthe highest functions pertaining to a State. In addition nearly all of\r\nthese States, through their conventions and legislatures, had adopted\r\nand ratified constitutions \"of government whereby slavery was abolished\r\nand all ordinances and laws of secession and debts contracted under the\r\nsame were declared void.\" So far, then, the political existence of the\r\nStates and their relations to the Federal Government had been fully and\r\ncompletely recognized and acknowledged by the executive department of\r\nthe Government; and the completion of the work of restoration, which had\r\nprogressed so favorably, was submitted to Congress, upon which devolved\r\nall questions pertaining to the admission to their seats of the Senators\r\nand Representatives chosen from the States whose people had engaged in\r\nthe rebellion.\r\n\r\nAll these steps had been taken when, on the 4th day of December, 1865,\r\nthe Thirty-ninth Congress assembled. Nearly eight months have elapsed\r\nsince that time; and no other plan of restoration having been proposed\r\nby Congress for the measures instituted by the Executive, it is now\r\ndeclared, in the joint resolution submitted for my approval, \"that the\r\nState of Tennessee is hereby restored to her former proper practical\r\nrelations to the Union, and is again entitled to be represented by\r\nSenators and Representatives in Congress.\" Thus, after the lapse of\r\nnearly eight months, Congress proposes to pave the way to the admission\r\nto representation of one of the eleven States whose people arrayed\r\nthemselves in rebellion against the constitutional authority of the\r\nFederal Government.\r\n\r\nEarnestly desiring to remove every cause of further delay, whether real\r\nor imaginary, on the part of Congress to the admission to seats of loyal\r\nSenators and Representatives from the State of Tennessee, I have,\r\nnotwithstanding the anomalous character of this proceeding, affixed\r\nmy signature to the resolution. My approval, however, is not to be\r\nconstrued as an acknowledgment of the right of Congress to pass laws\r\npreliminary to the admission of duly qualified Representatives from any\r\nof the States. Neither is it to be considered as committing me to all\r\nthe statements made in the preamble, some of which are, in my opinion,\r\nwithout foundation in fact, especially the assertion that the State of\r\nTennessee has ratified the amendment to the Constitution of the United\r\nStates proposed by the Thirty-ninth Congress. No official notice of such\r\nratification has been received by the Executive or filed in the\r\nDepartment of State; on the contrary, unofficial information from the\r\nmost reliable sources induces the belief that the amendment has not yet\r\nbeen constitutionally sanctioned by the legislature of Tennessee. The\r\nright of each House under the Constitution to judge of the elections,\r\nreturns, and qualifications of its own members is undoubted, and my\r\napproval or disapproval of the resolution could not in the slightest\r\ndegree increase or diminish the authority in this respect conferred\r\nupon the two branches of Congress.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I can not too earnestly repeat my recommendation for the\r\nadmission of Tennessee, and all other States, to a fair and equal\r\nparticipation in national legislation when they present themselves in\r\nthe persons of loyal Senators and Representatives who can comply with\r\nall the requirements of the Constitution and the laws. By this means\r\nharmony and reconciliation will be effected, the practical relations of\r\nall the States to the Federal Government reestablished, and the work of\r\nrestoration, inaugurated upon the termination of the war, successfully\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 25, 1866_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI nominate Lieutenant-General Ulysses S. Grant to be General of the Army\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 26, 1866_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to two resolutions of the House of Representatives of the 23d\r\ninstant, in the following words, respectively--\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the House of Representatives respectfully request the\r\n  President of the United States to urge upon the Canadian authorities,\r\n  and also the British Government, the release of the Fenian prisoners\r\n  recently captured in Canada;\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That this House respectfully request the President to cause\r\n  the prosecutions instituted in the United States courts against the\r\n  Fenians to be discontinued, if compatible with the public interest--\r\n\r\n\r\nI transmit a report on the subject from the Secretary of State, together\r\nwith the documents which accompany it.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 19, 1866_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have examined with care the bill, which originated in the Senate and\r\nhas been passed by the two Houses of Congress, to amend an act entitled\r\n\"An act to establish a bureau for the relief of freedmen and refugees,\"\r\nand for other purposes. Having with much regret come to the conclusion\r\nthat it would not be consistent with the public welfare to give my\r\napproval to the measure, I return the bill to the Senate with my\r\nobjections to its becoming a law.\r\n\r\nI might call to mind in advance of these objections that there is no\r\nimmediate necessity for the proposed measure. The act to establish a\r\nbureau for the relief of freedmen and refugees, which was approved in\r\nthe month of March last, has not yet expired. It was thought stringent\r\nand extensive enough for the purpose in view in time of war. Before it\r\nceases to have effect further experience may assist to guide us to a\r\nwise conclusion as to the policy to be adopted in time of peace.\r\n\r\nI share with Congress the strongest desire to secure to the freedmen\r\nthe full enjoyment of their freedom and property and their entire\r\nindependence and equality in making contracts for their labor, but the\r\nbill before me contains provisions which in my opinion are not warranted\r\nby the Constitution and are not well suited to accomplish the end in\r\nview.\r\n\r\nThe bill proposes to establish by authority of Congress military\r\njurisdiction over all parts of the United States containing refugees and\r\nfreedmen. It would by its very nature apply with most force to those\r\nparts of the United States in which the freedmen most abound, and it\r\nexpressly extends the existing temporary jurisdiction of the Freedmen's\r\nBureau, with greatly enlarged powers, over those States \"in which the\r\nordinary course of judicial proceedings has been interrupted by the\r\nrebellion.\" The source from which this military jurisdiction is to\r\nemanate is none other than the President of the United States, acting\r\nthrough the War Department and the Commissioner of the Freedmen's\r\nBureau. The agents to carry out this military jurisdiction are to be\r\nselected either from the Army or from civil life; the country is to be\r\ndivided into districts and subdistricts, and the number of salaried\r\nagents to be employed may be equal to the number of counties or parishes\r\nin all the United States where freedmen and refugees are to be found.\r\n\r\nThe subjects over which this military jurisdiction is to extend in every\r\npart of the United States include protection to \"all employees, agents,\r\nand officers of this bureau in the exercise of the duties imposed\" upon\r\nthem by the bill. In eleven States it is further to extend over all\r\ncases affecting freedmen and refugees discriminated against \"by local\r\nlaw, custom, or prejudice.\" In those eleven States the bill subjects any\r\nwhite person who may be charged with depriving a freedman of \"any civil\r\nrights or immunities belonging to white persons\" to imprisonment or\r\nfine, or both, without, however, defining the \"civil rights and\r\nimmunities\" which are thus to be secured to the freedmen by military\r\nlaw. This military jurisdiction also extends to all questions that may\r\narise respecting contracts. The agent who is thus to exercise the office\r\nof a military judge may be a stranger, entirely ignorant of the laws of\r\nthe place, and exposed to the errors of judgment to which all men are\r\nliable. The exercise of power over which there is no legal supervision\r\nby so vast a number of agents as is contemplated by the bill must, by\r\nthe very nature of man, be attended by acts of caprice, injustice, and\r\npassion.\r\n\r\nThe trials having their origin under this bill are to take place without\r\nthe intervention of a jury and without any fixed rules of law or\r\nevidence. The rules on which offenses are to be \"heard and determined\"\r\nby the numerous agents are such rules and regulations as the President,\r\nthrough the War Department, shall prescribe. No previous presentment is\r\nrequired nor any indictment charging the commission of a crime against\r\nthe laws; but the trial must proceed on charges and specifications. The\r\npunishment will be, not what the law declares, but such as a\r\ncourt-martial may think proper; and from these arbitrary tribunals there\r\nlies no appeal, no writ of error to any of the courts in which the\r\nConstitution of the United States vests exclusively the judicial power\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nWhile the territory and the classes of actions and offenses that are\r\nmade subject to this measure are so extensive, the bill itself, should\r\nit become a law, will have no limitation in point of time, but will form\r\na part of the permanent legislation of the country. I can not reconcile\r\na system of military jurisdiction of this kind with the words of the\r\nConstitution which declare that \"no person shall be held to answer\r\nfor a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentment or\r\nindictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval\r\nforces, or in the militia when in actual service in time of war or\r\npublic danger,\" and that \"in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall\r\nenjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the\r\nState and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.\" The\r\nsafeguards which the experience and wisdom of ages taught our fathers\r\nto establish as securities for the protection of the innocent, the\r\npunishment of the guilty, and the equal administration of justice are\r\nto be set aside, and for the sake of a more vigorous interposition in\r\nbehalf of justice we are to take the risks of the many acts of injustice\r\nthat would necessarily follow from an almost countless number of agents\r\nestablished in every parish or county in nearly a third of the States of\r\nthe Union, over whose decisions there is to be no supervision or control\r\nby the Federal courts. The power that would be thus placed in the hands\r\nof the President is such as in time of peace certainly ought never to be\r\nintrusted to any one man.\r\n\r\nIf it be asked whether the creation of such a tribunal within a State is\r\nwarranted as a measure of war, the question immediately presents itself\r\nwhether we are still engaged in war. Let us not unnecessarily disturb\r\nthe commerce and credit and industry of the country by declaring to the\r\nAmerican people and to the world that the United States are still in a\r\ncondition of civil war. At present there is no part of our country in\r\nwhich the authority of the United States is disputed. Offenses that may\r\nbe committed by individuals should not work a forfeiture of the rights\r\nof whole communities. The country has returned, or is returning, to a\r\nstate of peace and industry, and the rebellion is in fact at an end.\r\nThe measure, therefore, seems to be as inconsistent with the actual\r\ncondition of the country as it is at variance with the Constitution of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nIf, passing from general considerations, we examine the bill in detail,\r\nit is open to weighty objections.\r\n\r\nIn time of war it was eminently proper that we should provide for\r\nthose who were passing suddenly from a condition of bondage to a state\r\nof freedom. But this bill proposes to make the Freedmen's Bureau,\r\nestablished by the act of 1865 as one of many great and extraordinary\r\nmilitary measures to suppress a formidable rebellion, a permanent branch\r\nof the public administration, with its powers greatly enlarged. I have\r\nno reason to suppose, and I do not understand it to be alleged, that\r\nthe act of March, 1865, has proved deficient for the purpose for which\r\nit was passed, although at that time and for a considerable period\r\nthereafter the Government of the United States remained unacknowledged\r\nin most of the States whose inhabitants had been involved in the\r\nrebellion. The institution of slavery, for the military destruction of\r\nwhich the Freedmen's Bureau was called into existence as an auxiliary,\r\nhas been already effectually and finally abrogated throughout the whole\r\ncountry by an amendment of the Constitution of the United States, and\r\npractically its eradication has received the assent and concurrence of\r\nmost of those States in which it at any time had an existence. I am not,\r\ntherefore, able to discern in the condition of the country anything to\r\njustify an apprehension that the powers and agencies of the Freedmen's\r\nBureau, which were effective for the protection of freedmen and refugees\r\nduring the actual continuance of hostilities and of African servitude,\r\nwill now, in a time of peace and after the abolition of slavery, prove\r\ninadequate to the same proper ends. If I am correct in these views,\r\nthere can be no necessity for the enlargement of the powers of the\r\nBureau, for which provision is made in the bill.\r\n\r\nThe third section of the bill authorizes a general and unlimited grant\r\nof support to the destitute and suffering refugees and freedmen, their\r\nwives and children. Succeeding sections make provision for the rent or\r\npurchase of landed estates for freedmen, and for the erection for their\r\nbenefit of suitable buildings for asylums and schools, the expenses to\r\nbe defrayed from the Treasury of the whole people. The Congress of the\r\nUnited States has never heretofore thought itself empowered to establish\r\nasylums beyond the limits of the District of Columbia, except for the\r\nbenefit of our disabled soldiers and sailors. It has never founded\r\nschools for any class of our own people, not even for the orphans of\r\nthose who have fallen in the defense of the Union, but has left the care\r\nof education to the much more competent and efficient control of the\r\nStates, of communities, of private associations, and of individuals.\r\nIt has never deemed itself authorized to expend the public money for\r\nthe rent or purchase of homes for the thousands, not to say millions,\r\nof the white race who are honestly toiling from day to day for their\r\nsubsistence. A system for the support of indigent persons in the United\r\nStates was never contemplated by the authors of the Constitution; nor\r\ncan any good reason be advanced why, as a permanent establishment,\r\nit should be founded for one class or color of our people more than\r\nanother. Pending the war many refugees and freedmen received support\r\nfrom the Government, but it was never intended that they should\r\nthenceforth be fed, clothed, educated, and sheltered by the United\r\nStates. The idea on which the slaves were assisted to freedom was that\r\non becoming free they would be a self-sustaining population. Any\r\nlegislation that shall imply that they are not expected to attain a\r\nself-sustaining condition must have a tendency injurious alike to their\r\ncharacter and their prospects.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of an agent for every county and parish will create an\r\nimmense patronage, and the expense of the numerous officers and their\r\nclerks, to be appointed by the President, will be great in the\r\nbeginning, with a tendency steadily to increase. The appropriations\r\nasked by the Freedmen's Bureau as now established, for the year 1866,\r\namount to $11,745,000. It may be safely estimated that the cost to be\r\nincurred under the pending bill will require double that amount--more\r\nthan the entire sum expended in any one year under the Administration of\r\nthe second Adams. If the presence of agents in every parish and county\r\nis to be considered as a war measure, opposition, or even resistance,\r\nmight be provoked; so that to give effect to their jurisdiction troops\r\nwould have to be stationed within reach of every one of them, and thus a\r\nlarge standing force be rendered necessary. Large appropriations would\r\ntherefore be required to sustain and enforce military jurisdiction in\r\nevery county or parish from the Potomac to the Rio Grande. The condition\r\nof our fiscal affairs is encouraging, but in order to sustain the\r\npresent measure of public confidence it is necessary that we practice\r\nnot merely customary economy, but, as far as possible, severe\r\nretrenchment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the objections already stated, the fifth section of the\r\nbill proposes to take away land from its former owners without any\r\nlegal proceedings being first had, contrary to that provision of the\r\nConstitution which declares that no person shall \"be deprived of life,\r\nliberty, or property without due process of law.\" It does not appear\r\nthat a part of the lands to which this section refers may not be owned\r\nby minors or persons of unsound mind, or by those who have been faithful\r\nto all their obligations as citizens of the United States. If any\r\nportion of the land is held by such persons, it is not competent for\r\nany authority to deprive them of it. If, on the other hand, it be found\r\nthat the property is liable to confiscation, even then it can not be\r\nappropriated to public purposes until by due process of law it shall\r\nhave been declared forfeited to the Government.\r\n\r\nThere is still further objection to the bill, on grounds seriously\r\naffecting the class of persons to whom it is designed to bring relief.\r\nIt will tend to keep the mind of the freedman in a state of uncertain\r\nexpectation and restlessness, while to those among whom he lives it will\r\nbe a source of constant and vague apprehension.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the freedman should be protected, but he should be protected\r\nby the civil authorities, especially by the exercise of all the\r\nconstitutional powers of the courts of the United States and of the\r\nStates. His condition is not so exposed as may at first be imagined.\r\nHe is in a portion of the country where his labor can not well be\r\nspared. Competition for his services from planters, from those who\r\nare constructing or repairing railroads, and from capitalists in his\r\nvicinage or from other States will enable him to command almost his own\r\nterms. He also possesses a perfect right to change his place of abode,\r\nand if, therefore, he does not find in one community or State a mode of\r\nlife suited to his desires or proper remuneration for his labor, he can\r\nmove to another where that labor is more esteemed and better rewarded.\r\nIn truth, however, each State, induced by its own wants and interests,\r\nwill do what is necessary and proper to retain within its borders all\r\nthe labor that is needed for the development of its resources. The laws\r\nthat regulate supply and demand will maintain their force, and the wages\r\nof the laborer will be regulated thereby. There is no danger that the\r\nexceedingly great demand for labor will not operate in favor of the\r\nlaborer.\r\n\r\nNeither is sufficient consideration given to the ability of the freedmen\r\nto protect and take care of themselves. It is no more than justice to\r\nthem to believe that as they have received their freedom with moderation\r\nand forbearance, so they will distinguish themselves by their industry\r\nand thrift, and soon show the world that in a condition of freedom they\r\nare self-sustaining, capable of selecting their own employment and\r\ntheir own places of abode, of insisting for themselves on a proper\r\nremuneration, and of establishing and maintaining their own asylums and\r\nschools. It is earnestly hoped that instead of wasting away they will by\r\ntheir own efforts establish for themselves a condition of respectability\r\nand prosperity. It is certain that they can attain to that condition\r\nonly through their own merits and exertions.\r\n\r\nIn this connection the query presents itself whether the system proposed\r\nby the bill will not, when put into complete operation, practically\r\ntransfer the entire care, support, and control of 4,000,000 emancipated\r\nslaves to agents, overseers, or taskmasters, who, appointed at\r\nWashington, are to be located in every county and parish throughout the\r\nUnited States containing freedmen and refugees. Such a system would\r\ninevitably tend to a concentration of power in the Executive which would\r\nenable him, if so disposed, to control the action of this numerous class\r\nand use them for the attainment of his own political ends.\r\n\r\nI can not but add another very grave objection to this bill. The\r\nConstitution imperatively declares, in connection with taxation, that\r\neach State _shall_ have at least one Representative, and fixes the rule\r\nfor the number to which, in future times, each State shall be entitled.\r\nIt also provides that the Senate of the United States _shall_ be\r\ncomposed of two Senators from each State, and adds with peculiar force\r\n\"that no State, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal\r\nsuffrage in the Senate.\" The original act was necessarily passed in the\r\nabsence of the States chiefly to be affected, because their people were\r\nthen contumaciously engaged in the rebellion. Now the case is changed,\r\nand some, at least, of those States are attending Congress by loyal\r\nrepresentatives, soliciting the allowance of the constitutional right\r\nfor representation. At the time, however, of the consideration and the\r\npassing of this bill there was no Senator or Representative in Congress\r\nfrom the eleven States which are to be mainly affected by its\r\nprovisions. The very fact that reports were and are made against the\r\ngood disposition of the people of that portion of the country is an\r\nadditional reason why they need and should have representatives of their\r\nown in Congress to explain their condition, reply to accusations,\r\nand assist by their local knowledge in the perfecting of measures\r\nimmediately affecting themselves. While the liberty of deliberation\r\nwould then be free and Congress would have full power to decide\r\naccording to its judgment, there could be no objection urged that the\r\nStates most interested had not been permitted to be heard. The principle\r\nis firmly fixed in the minds of the American people that there should be\r\nno taxation without representation. Great burdens have now to be borne\r\nby all the country, and we may best demand that they shall be borne\r\nwithout murmur when they are voted by a majority of the representatives\r\nof all the people. I would not interfere with the unquestionable right\r\nof Congress to judge, each House for itself, \"of the elections, returns,\r\nand qualifications of its own members;\" but that authority can not be\r\nconstrued as including the right to shut out in time of peace any State\r\nfrom the representation to which it is entitled by the Constitution.\r\nAt present all the people of eleven States are excluded--those who\r\nwere most faithful during the war not less than others. The State of\r\nTennessee, for instance, whose authorities engaged in rebellion, was\r\nrestored to all her constitutional relations to the Union by the\r\npatriotism and energy of her injured and betrayed people. Before the war\r\nwas brought to a termination they had placed themselves in relations\r\nwith the General Government, had established a State government of their\r\nown, and, as they were not included in the emancipation proclamation,\r\nthey by their own act had amended their constitution so as to abolish\r\nslavery within the limits of their State. I know no reason why the State\r\nof Tennessee, for example, should not fully enjoy \"all her\r\nconstitutional relations to the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States stands toward the country in\r\na somewhat different attitude from that of any member of Congress.\r\nEach member of Congress is chosen from a single district or State;\r\nthe President is chosen by the people of all the States. As eleven\r\nStates are not at this time represented in either branch of Congress, it\r\nwould seem to be his duty on all proper occasions to present their just\r\nclaims to Congress. There always will be differences of opinion in the\r\ncommunity, and individuals may be guilty of transgressions of the law,\r\nbut these do not constitute valid objections against the right of a\r\nState to representation. I would in no wise interfere with the\r\ndiscretion of Congress with regard to the qualifications of members; but\r\nI hold it my duty to recommend to you, in the interests of peace and the\r\ninterests of union, the admission of every State to its share in public\r\nlegislation when, however insubordinate, insurgent, or rebellious its\r\npeople may have been, it presents itself, not only in an attitude of\r\nloyalty and harmony, but in the persons of representatives whose loyalty\r\ncan not be questioned under any existing constitutional or legal test.\r\nIt is plain that an indefinite or permanent exclusion of any part of the\r\ncountry from representation must be attended by a spirit of disquiet and\r\ncomplaint. It is unwise and dangerous to pursue a course of measures\r\nwhich will unite a very large section of the country against another\r\nsection of the country, however much the latter may preponderate. The\r\ncourse of emigration, the development of industry and business, and\r\nnatural causes will raise up at the South men as devoted to the Union as\r\nthose of any other part of the land; but if they are all excluded from\r\nCongress, if in a permanent statute they are declared not to be in full\r\nconstitutional relations to the country, they may think they have cause\r\nto become a unit in feeling and sentiment against the Government. Under\r\nthe political education of the American people the idea is inherent and\r\nineradicable that the consent of the majority of the whole people is\r\nnecessary to secure a willing acquiescence in legislation.\r\n\r\nThe bill under consideration refers to certain of the States as though\r\nthey had not \"been fully restored in all their constitutional relations\r\nto the United States.\" If they have not, let us at once act together to\r\nsecure that desirable end at the earliest possible moment. It is hardly\r\nnecessary for me to inform Congress that in my own judgment most of\r\nthose States, so far, at least, as depends upon their own action, have\r\nalready been fully restored, and are to be deemed as entitled to enjoy\r\ntheir constitutional rights as members of the Union. Reasoning from the\r\nConstitution itself and from the actual situation of the country, I feel\r\nnot only entitled but bound to assume that with the Federal courts\r\nrestored and those of the several States in the full exercise of their\r\nfunctions the rights and interests of all classes of people will,\r\nwith the aid of the military in cases of resistance to the laws,\r\nbe essentially protected against unconstitutional infringement or\r\nviolation. Should this expectation unhappily fail, which I do not\r\nanticipate, then the Executive is already fully armed with the powers\r\nconferred by the act of March, 1865, establishing the Freedmen's Bureau,\r\nand hereafter, as heretofore, he can employ the land and naval forces of\r\nthe country to suppress insurrection or to overcome obstructions to the\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the Constitution, I return the bill to the Senate,\r\nin the earnest hope that a measure involving questions and interests so\r\nimportant to the country will not become a law, unless upon deliberate\r\nconsideration by the people it shall receive the sanction of an\r\nenlightened public judgment.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _March 27, 1866_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI regret that the bill, which has passed both Houses of Congress,\r\nentitled \"An act to protect all persons in the United States in their\r\ncivil rights and furnish the means of their vindication,\" contains\r\nprovisions which I can not approve consistently with my sense of duty to\r\nthe whole people and my obligations to the Constitution of the United\r\nStates. I am therefore constrained to return it to the Senate, the House\r\nin which it originated, with my objections to its becoming a law.\r\n\r\nBy the first section of the bill all persons born in the United States\r\nand not subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed, are\r\ndeclared to be citizens of the United States. This provision comprehends\r\nthe Chinese of the Pacific States, Indians subject to taxation, the\r\npeople called gypsies, as well as the entire race designated as blacks,\r\npeople of color, negroes, mulattoes, and persons of African blood. Every\r\nindividual of these races born in the United States is by the bill made\r\na citizen of the United States. It does not purport to declare or confer\r\nany other right of citizenship than Federal citizenship. It does not\r\npurport to give these classes of persons any status as citizens of\r\nStates, except that which may result from their status as citizens of\r\nthe United States. The power to confer the right of State citizenship is\r\njust as exclusively with the several States as the power to confer the\r\nright of Federal citizenship is with Congress.\r\n\r\nThe right of Federal citizenship thus to be conferred on the several\r\nexcepted races before mentioned is now for the first time proposed to be\r\ngiven by law. If, as is claimed by many, all persons who are native born\r\nalready are, by virtue of the Constitution, citizens of the United\r\nStates, the passage of the pending bill can not be necessary to make\r\nthem such. If, on the other hand, such persons are not citizens, as may\r\nbe assumed from the proposed legislation to make them such, the grave\r\nquestion presents itself whether, when eleven of the thirty-six States\r\nare unrepresented in Congress at the present time, it is sound policy\r\nto make our entire colored population and all other excepted classes\r\ncitizens of the United States. Four millions of them have just emerged\r\nfrom slavery into freedom. Can it be reasonably supposed that they\r\npossess the requisite qualifications to entitle them to all the\r\nprivileges and immunities of citizens of the United States? Have the\r\npeople of the several States expressed such a conviction? It may also be\r\nasked whether it is necessary that they should be declared citizens in\r\norder that they may be secured in the enjoyment of the civil rights\r\nproposed to be conferred by the bill. Those rights are, by Federal as\r\nwell as State laws, secured to all domiciled aliens and foreigners, even\r\nbefore the completion of the process of naturalization; and it may\r\nsafely be assumed that the same enactments are sufficient to give like\r\nprotection and benefits to those for whom this bill provides special\r\nlegislation. Besides, the policy of the Government from its origin to\r\nthe present time seems to have been that persons who are strangers to\r\nand unfamiliar with our institutions and our laws should pass through\r\na certain probation, at the end of which, before attaining the coveted\r\nprize, they must give evidence of their fitness to receive and to\r\nexercise the rights of citizens as contemplated by the Constitution of\r\nthe United States. The bill in effect proposes a discrimination against\r\nlarge numbers of intelligent, worthy, and patriotic foreigners, and in\r\nfavor of the negro, to whom, after long years of bondage, the avenues to\r\nfreedom and intelligence have just now been suddenly opened. He must of\r\nnecessity, from his previous unfortunate condition of servitude, be less\r\ninformed as to the nature and character of our institutions than he who,\r\ncoming from abroad, has, to some extent at least, familiarized himself\r\nwith the principles of a Government to which he voluntarily intrusts\r\n\"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" Yet it is now proposed,\r\nby a single legislative enactment, to confer the rights of citizens upon\r\nall persons of African descent born within the extended limits of the\r\nUnited States, while persons of foreign birth who make our land their\r\nhome must undergo a probation of five years, and can only then become\r\ncitizens upon proof that they are \"of good moral character, attached to\r\nthe principles of the Constitution of the United States, and well\r\ndisposed to the good order and happiness of the same.\"\r\n\r\nThe first section of the bill also contains an enumeration of the rights\r\nto be enjoyed by these classes so made citizens \"in every State and\r\nTerritory in the United States.\" These rights are \"to make and enforce\r\ncontracts; to sue, be parties, and give evidence; to inherit, purchase,\r\nlease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property,\" and to have\r\n\"full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of\r\nperson and property as is enjoyed by white citizens.\" So, too, they are\r\nmade subject to the same punishment, pains, and penalties in common with\r\nwhite citizens, and to none other. Thus a perfect equality of the white\r\nand colored races is attempted to be fixed by Federal law in every State\r\nof the Union over the vast field of State jurisdiction covered by these\r\nenumerated rights. In no one of these can any State ever exercise any\r\npower of discrimination between the different races. In the exercise of\r\nState policy over matters exclusively affecting the people of each State\r\nit has frequently been thought expedient to discriminate between the\r\ntwo races. By the statutes of some of the States, Northern as well\r\nas Southern, it is enacted, for instance, that no white person shall\r\nintermarry with a negro or mulatto. Chancellor Kent says, speaking of\r\nthe blacks, that--\r\n\r\n  Marriages between them and the whites are forbidden in some of the\r\n  States where slavery does not exist, and they are prohibited in all the\r\n  slaveholding States; and when not absolutely contrary to law, they are\r\n  revolting, and regarded as an offense against public decorum.\r\n\r\nI do not say that this bill repeals State laws on the subject of\r\nmarriage between the two races, for as the whites are forbidden to\r\nintermarry with the blacks, the blacks can only make such contracts as\r\nthe whites themselves are allowed to make, and therefore can not under\r\nthis bill enter into the marriage contract with the whites. I cite this\r\ndiscrimination, however, as an instance of the State policy as to\r\ndiscrimination, and to inquire whether if Congress can abrogate all\r\nState laws of discrimination between the two races in the matter of real\r\nestate, of suits, and of contracts generally Congress may not also\r\nrepeal the State laws as to the contract of marriage between the two\r\nraces. Hitherto every subject embraced in the enumeration of rights\r\ncontained in this bill has been considered as exclusively belonging to\r\nthe States. They all relate to the internal police and economy of the\r\nrespective States. They are matters which in each State concern the\r\ndomestic condition of its people, varying in each according to its own\r\npeculiar circumstances and the safety and well-being of its own\r\ncitizens. I do not mean to say that upon all these subjects there are\r\nnot Federal restraints--as, for instance, in the State power of\r\nlegislation over contracts there is a Federal limitation that no State\r\nshall pass a law impairing the obligations of contracts; and, as to\r\ncrimes, that no State shall pass an _ex post facto_ law; and, as to\r\nmoney, that no State shall make anything but gold and silver a legal\r\ntender; but where can we find a Federal prohibition against the power\r\nof any State to discriminate, as do most of them, between aliens and\r\ncitizens, between artificial persons, called corporations, and natural\r\npersons, in the right to hold real estate? If it be granted that\r\nCongress can repeal all State laws discriminating between whites and\r\nblacks in the subjects covered by this bill, why, it may be asked, may\r\nnot Congress repeal in the same way all State laws discriminating\r\nbetween the two races on the subjects of suffrage and office? If\r\nCongress can declare by law who shall hold lands, who shall testify, who\r\nshall have capacity to make a contract in a State, then Congress can by\r\nlaw also declare who, without regard to color or race, shall have the\r\nright to sit as a juror or as a judge, to hold any office, and, finally,\r\nto vote \"in every State and Territory of the United States.\" As respects\r\nthe Territories, they come within the power of Congress, for as to them\r\nthe lawmaking power is the Federal power; but as to the States no\r\nsimilar provision exists vesting in Congress the power \"to make rules\r\nand regulations\" for them.\r\n\r\nThe object of the second section of the bill is to afford discriminating\r\nprotection to colored persons in the full enjoyment of all the rights\r\nsecured to them by the preceding section. It declares--\r\n\r\n  That any person who, under color of any law, statute, ordinance,\r\n  regulation, or custom, shall subject, or cause to be subjected, any\r\n  inhabitant of any State or Territory to the deprivation of any right\r\n  secured or protected by this act, or to different punishment, pains, or\r\n  penalties on account of such person having at any time been held in a\r\n  condition of slavery or involuntary servitude, except as a punishment\r\n  for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, or by reason\r\n  of his color or race, than is prescribed for the punishment of white\r\n  persons, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction\r\n  shall be punished by fine not exceeding $1,000, or imprisonment not\r\n  exceeding one year, or both, in the discretion of the court.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis section seems to be designed to apply to some existing or future\r\nlaw of a State or Territory which may conflict with the provisions of\r\nthe bill now under consideration. It provides for counteracting such\r\nforbidden legislation by imposing fine and imprisonment upon the\r\nlegislators who may pass such conflicting laws, or upon the officers or\r\nagents who shall put or attempt to put them into execution. It means an\r\nofficial offense, not a common crime committed against law upon the\r\npersons or property of the black race. Such an act may deprive the black\r\nman of his property, but not of the _right_ to hold property. It means\r\na deprivation of the right itself, either by the State judiciary or\r\nthe State legislature. It is therefore assumed that under this section\r\nmembers of State legislatures who should vote for laws conflicting with\r\nthe provisions of the bill, that judges of the State courts who should\r\nrender judgments in antagonism with its terms, and that marshals and\r\nsheriffs who should, as ministerial officers, execute processes\r\nsanctioned by State laws and issued by State judges in execution of\r\ntheir judgments could be brought before other tribunals and there\r\nsubjected to fine and imprisonment for the performance of the duties\r\nwhich such State laws might impose. The legislation thus proposed\r\ninvades the judicial power of the State. It says to every State court or\r\njudge, If you decide that this act is unconstitutional; if you refuse,\r\nunder the prohibition of a State law, to allow a negro to testify; if\r\nyou hold that over such a subject-matter the State law is paramount, and\r\n\"under color\" of a State law refuse the exercise of the right to the\r\nnegro, your error of judgment, however conscientious, shall subject\r\nyou to fine and imprisonment. I do not apprehend that the conflicting\r\nlegislation which the bill seems to contemplate is so likely to occur as\r\nto render it necessary at this time to adopt a measure of such doubtful\r\nconstitutionality.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, this provision of the bill seems to be unnecessary,\r\nas adequate judicial remedies could be adopted to secure the desired end\r\nwithout invading the immunities of legislators, always important to be\r\npreserved in the interest of public liberty; without assailing the\r\nindependence of the judiciary, always essential to the preservation of\r\nindividual rights; and without impairing the efficiency of ministerial\r\nofficers, always necessary for the maintenance of public peace and\r\norder. The remedy proposed by this section seems to be in this respect\r\nnot only anomalous, but unconstitutional; for the Constitution\r\nguarantees nothing with certainty if it does not insure to the several\r\nStates the right of making and executing laws in regard to all matters\r\narising within their jurisdiction, subject only to the restriction that\r\nin cases of conflict with the Constitution and constitutional laws of\r\nthe United States the latter should be held to be the supreme law of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThe third section gives the district courts of the United States\r\nexclusive \"cognizance of all crimes and offenses committed against the\r\nprovisions of this act,\" and concurrent jurisdiction with the circuit\r\ncourts of the United States of all civil and criminal cases \"affecting\r\npersons who are denied or can not enforce in the courts or judicial\r\ntribunals of the State or locality where they may be any of the rights\r\nsecured to them by the first section.\" The construction which I have\r\ngiven to the second section is strengthened by this third section, for\r\nit makes clear what kind of denial or deprivation of the rights secured\r\nby the first section was in contemplation. It is a denial or deprivation\r\nof such rights \"in the courts or judicial tribunals of the State.\" It\r\nstands, therefore, clear of doubt that the offense and the penalties\r\nprovided in the second section are intended for the State judge who, in\r\nthe clear exercise of his functions as a judge, not acting ministerially\r\nbut judicially, shall decide contrary to this Federal law. In other\r\nwords, when a State judge, acting upon a question involving a conflict\r\nbetween a State law and a Federal law, and bound, according to his own\r\njudgment and responsibility, to give an impartial decision between the\r\ntwo, comes to the conclusion that the State law is valid and the Federal\r\nlaw is invalid, he must not follow the dictates of his own judgment, at\r\nthe peril of fine and imprisonment. The legislative department of the\r\nGovernment of the United States thus takes from the judicial department\r\nof the States the sacred and exclusive duty of judicial decision, and\r\nconverts the State judge into a mere ministerial officer, bound to\r\ndecide according to the will of Congress.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that in States which deny to persons whose rights are\r\nsecured by the first section of the bill any one of those rights all\r\ncriminal and civil cases affecting them will, by the provisions of the\r\nthird section, come under the exclusive cognizance of the Federal\r\ntribunals. It follows that if, in any State which denies to a colored\r\nperson any one of all those rights, that person should commit a crime\r\nagainst the laws of a State--murder, arson, rape, or any other\r\ncrime--all protection and punishment through the courts of the State are\r\ntaken away, and he can only be tried and punished in the Federal courts.\r\nHow is the criminal to be tried? If the offense is provided for and\r\npunished by Federal law, that law, and not the State law, is to govern.\r\nIt is only when the offense does not happen to be within the purview of\r\nFederal law that the Federal courts are to try and punish him under any\r\nother law. Then resort is to be had to \"the common law, as modified and\r\nchanged\" by State legislation, \"so far as the same is not inconsistent\r\nwith the Constitution and laws of the United States.\" So that over this\r\nvast domain of criminal jurisprudence provided by each State for the\r\nprotection of its own citizens and for the punishment of all persons who\r\nviolate its criminal laws, Federal law, whenever it can be made to\r\napply, displaces State law. The question here naturally arises, from\r\nwhat source Congress derives the power to transfer to Federal tribunals\r\ncertain classes of cases embraced in this section. The Constitution\r\nexpressly declares that the judicial power of the United States \"shall\r\nextend to all cases, in law and equity, arising under this Constitution,\r\nthe laws of the United States, and treaties made or which shall be made\r\nunder their authority; to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public\r\nministers, and consuls; to all cases of admiralty and maritime\r\njurisdiction; to controversies to which the United States shall be a\r\nparty; to controversies between two or more States, between a State and\r\ncitizens of another State, between citizens of different States, between\r\ncitizens of the same State claiming lands under grants of different\r\nStates, and between a State, or the citizens thereof, and foreign\r\nstates, citizens, or subjects.\" Here the judicial power of the United\r\nStates is expressly set forth and defined; and the act of September 24,\r\n1789, establishing the judicial courts of the United States, in\r\nconferring upon the Federal courts jurisdiction over cases originating\r\nin State tribunals, is careful to confine them to the classes enumerated\r\nin the above-recited clause of the Constitution. This section of the\r\nbill undoubtedly comprehends cases and authorizes the exercise of powers\r\nthat are not, by the Constitution, within the jurisdiction of the courts\r\nof the United States. To transfer them to those courts would be an\r\nexercise of authority well calculated to excite distrust and alarm on\r\nthe part of all the States, for the bill applies alike to all of\r\nthem--as well to those that have as to those that have not been engaged\r\nin rebellion.\r\n\r\nIt may be assumed that this authority is incident to the power granted\r\nto Congress by the Constitution, as recently amended, to enforce, by\r\nappropriate legislation, the article declaring that--\r\n\r\n  Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for\r\n  crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist\r\n  within the United States or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt can not, however, be justly claimed that, with a view to the\r\nenforcement of this article of the Constitution, there is at present any\r\nnecessity for the exercise of all the powers which this bill confers.\r\nSlavery has been abolished, and at present nowhere exists within the\r\njurisdiction of the United States; nor has there been, nor is it likely\r\nthere will be, any attempt to revive it by the people or the States.\r\nIf, however, any such attempt shall be made, it will then become the\r\nduty of the General Government to exercise any and all incidental powers\r\nnecessary and proper to maintain inviolate this great constitutional law\r\nof freedom.\r\n\r\nThe fourth section of the bill provides that officers and agents of the\r\nFreedmen's Bureau shall be empowered to make arrests, and also that\r\nother officers may be specially commissioned for that purpose by the\r\nPresident of the United States. It also authorizes circuit courts of the\r\nUnited States and the superior courts of the Territories to appoint,\r\nwithout limitation, commissioners, who are to be charged with the\r\nperformance of _quasi_ judicial duties. The fifth section empowers the\r\ncommissioners so to be selected by the courts to appoint in writing,\r\nunder their hands, one or more suitable persons from time to time to\r\nexecute warrants and other processes described by the bill. These\r\nnumerous official agents are made to constitute a sort of police,\r\nin addition to the military, and are authorized to summon a _posse\r\ncomitatus_, and even to call to their aid such portion of the land\r\nand naval forces of the United States, or of the militia, \"as may be\r\nnecessary to the performance of the duty with which they are charged.\"\r\nThis extraordinary power is to be conferred upon agents irresponsible to\r\nthe Government and to the people, to whose number the discretion of the\r\ncommissioners is the only limit, and in whose hands such authority might\r\nbe made a terrible engine of wrong, oppression, and fraud. The general\r\nstatutes regulating the land and naval forces of the United States, the\r\nmilitia, and the execution of the laws are believed to be adequate for\r\nevery emergency which can occur in time of peace. If it should prove\r\notherwise, Congress can at any time amend those laws in such manner as,\r\nwhile subserving the public welfare, not to jeopard the rights,\r\ninterests, and liberties of the people.\r\n\r\nThe seventh section provides that a fee of $10 shall be paid to each\r\ncommissioner in every case brought before him, and a fee of $5 to his\r\ndeputy or deputies \"for each person he or they may arrest and take\r\nbefore any such commissioner,\" \"with such other fees as may be deemed\r\nreasonable by such commissioner,\" \"in general for performing such other\r\nduties as may be required in the premises.\" All these fees are to be\r\n\"paid out of the Treasury of the United States,\" whether there is a\r\nconviction or not; but in case of conviction they are to be recoverable\r\nfrom the defendant. It seems to me that under the influence of such\r\ntemptations bad men might convert any law, however beneficent, into an\r\ninstrument of persecution and fraud.\r\n\r\nBy the eighth section of the bill the United States courts, which sit\r\nonly in one place for white citizens, must migrate with the marshal and\r\ndistrict attorney (and necessarily with the clerk, although he is not\r\nmentioned) to any part of the district upon the order of the President,\r\nand there hold a court, \"for the purpose of the more speedy arrest and\r\ntrial of persons charged with a violation of this act;\" and there the\r\njudge and officers of the court must remain, upon the order of the\r\nPresident, \"for the time therein designated.\"\r\n\r\nThe ninth section authorizes the President, or such person as he may\r\nempower for that purpose, \"to employ such part of the land or naval\r\nforces of the United States, or of the militia, as shall be necessary\r\nto prevent the violation and enforce the due execution of this act.\"\r\nThis language seems to imply a permanent military force, that is to be\r\nalways at hand, and whose only business is to be the enforcement of this\r\nmeasure over the vast region where it is intended to operate.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to consider the policy of this bill. To me the details\r\nof the bill seem fraught with evil. The white race and the black race of\r\nthe South have hitherto lived together under the relation of master and\r\nslave--capital owning labor. Now, suddenly, that relation is changed,\r\nand as to ownership capital and labor are divorced. They stand now each\r\nmaster of itself. In this new relation, one being necessary to the\r\nother, there will be a new adjustment, which both are deeply interested\r\nin making harmonious. Each has equal power in settling the terms, and\r\nif left to the laws that regulate capital and labor it is confidently\r\nbelieved that they will satisfactorily work out the problem. Capital, it\r\nis true, has more intelligence, but labor is never so ignorant as not to\r\nunderstand its own interests, not to know its own value, and not to see\r\nthat capital must pay that value.\r\n\r\nThis bill frustrates this adjustment. It intervenes between capital and\r\nlabor and attempts to settle questions of political economy through the\r\nagency of numerous officials whose interest it will be to foment discord\r\nbetween the two races, for as the breach widens their employment will\r\ncontinue, and when it is closed their occupation will terminate.\r\n\r\nIn all our history, in all our experience as a people living under\r\nFederal and State law, no such system as that contemplated by the\r\ndetails of this bill has ever before been proposed or adopted. They\r\nestablish for the security of the colored race safeguards which go\r\ninfinitely beyond any that the General Government has ever provided for\r\nthe white race. In fact, the distinction of race and color is by the\r\nbill made to operate in favor of the colored and against the white race.\r\nThey interfere with the municipal legislation of the States, with the\r\nrelations existing exclusively between a State and its citizens, or\r\nbetween inhabitants of the same State--an absorption and assumption of\r\npower by the General Government which, if acquiesced in, must sap and\r\ndestroy our federative system of limited powers and break down the\r\nbarriers which preserve the rights of the States. It is another step,\r\nor rather stride, toward centralization and the concentration of all\r\nlegislative powers in the National Government. The tendency of the\r\nbill must be to resuscitate the spirit of rebellion and to arrest the\r\nprogress of those influences which are more closely drawing around the\r\nStates the bonds of union and peace.\r\n\r\nMy lamented predecessor, in his proclamation of the 1st of January,\r\n1863, ordered and declared that all persons held as slaves within\r\ncertain States and parts of States therein designated were and\r\nthenceforward should be free; and further, that the executive government\r\nof the United States, including the military and naval authorities\r\nthereof, would recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons.\r\nThis guaranty has been rendered especially obligatory and sacred by the\r\namendment of the Constitution abolishing slavery throughout the United\r\nStates. I therefore fully recognize the obligation to protect and\r\ndefend that class of our people whenever and wherever it shall become\r\nnecessary, and to the full extent compatible with the Constitution of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nEntertaining these sentiments, it only remains for me to say that I will\r\ncheerfully cooperate with Congress in any measure that may be necessary\r\nfor the protection of the civil rights of the freedmen, as well as those\r\nof all other classes of persons throughout the United States, by\r\njudicial process, under equal and impartial laws, in conformity with the\r\nprovisions of the Federal Constitution.\r\n\r\nI now return the bill to the Senate, and regret that in considering the\r\nbills and joint resolutions--forty-two in number--which have been thus\r\nfar submitted for my approval I am compelled to withhold my assent from\r\na second measure that has received the sanction of both Houses of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _May 15, 1866_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI return to the Senate, in which House it originated, the bill, which\r\nhas passed both Houses of Congress, entitled \"An act for the admission\r\nof the State of Colorado into the Union,\" with my objections to its\r\nbecoming a law at this time.\r\n\r\nFirst. From the best information which I have been able to obtain\r\nI do not consider the establishment of a State government at present\r\nnecessary for the welfare of the people of Colorado. Under the existing\r\nTerritorial government all the rights, privileges, and interests of the\r\ncitizens are protected and secured. The qualified voters choose their\r\nown legislators and their own local officers, and are represented in\r\nCongress by a Delegate of their own selection. They make and execute\r\ntheir own municipal laws, subject only to revision by Congress--an\r\nauthority not likely to be exercised unless in extreme or extraordinary\r\ncases. The population is small, some estimating it so low as 25,000,\r\nwhile advocates of the bill reckon the number at from 35,000 to 40,000\r\nsouls. The people are principally recent settlers, many of whom are\r\nunderstood to be ready for removal to other mining districts beyond\r\nthe limits of the Territory if circumstances shall render them more\r\ninviting. Such a population can not but find relief from excessive\r\ntaxation if the Territorial system, which devolves the expenses of the\r\nexecutive, legislative, and judicial departments upon the United States,\r\nis for the present continued. They can not but find the security of\r\nperson and property increased by their reliance upon the national\r\nexecutive power for the maintenance of law and order against the\r\ndisturbances necessarily incident to all newly organized communities.\r\n\r\nSecond. It is not satisfactorily established that a majority of the\r\ncitizens of Colorado desire or are prepared for an exchange of a\r\nTerritorial for a State government. In September, 1864, under the\r\nauthority of Congress, an election was lawfully appointed and held for\r\nthe purpose of ascertaining the views of the people upon this particular\r\nquestion. Six thousand one hundred and ninety-two votes were cast, and\r\nof this number a majority of 3,152 was given against the proposed\r\nchange. In September, 1865, without any legal authority, the question\r\nwas again presented to the people of the Territory, with the view of\r\nobtaining a reconsideration of the result of the election held in\r\ncompliance with the act of Congress approved March 21, 1864. At this\r\nsecond election 5,905 votes were polled, and a majority of 155 was given\r\nin favor of a State organization. It does not seem to me entirely safe\r\nto receive this, the last-mentioned, result, so irregularly obtained, as\r\nsufficient to outweigh the one which had been legally obtained in the\r\nfirst election. Regularity and conformity to law are essential to the\r\npreservation of order and stable government, and should, as far as\r\npracticable, always be observed in the formation of new States.\r\n\r\nThird. The admission of Colorado at this time as a State into the\r\nFederal Union appears to me to be incompatible with the public interests\r\nof the country. While it is desirable that Territories, when\r\nsufficiently matured, should be organized as States, yet the spirit of\r\nthe Constitution seems to require that there should be an approximation\r\ntoward equality among the several States composing the Union. No State\r\ncan have less or more than two Senators in Congress. The largest State\r\nhas a population of 4,000,000; several of the States have a population\r\nexceeding 2,000,000, and many others have a population exceeding\r\n1,000,000. A population of 127,000 is the ratio of apportionment of\r\nRepresentatives among the several States.\r\n\r\nIf this bill should become a law, the people of Colorado, 30,000 in\r\nnumber, would have in the House of Representatives one member, while New\r\nYork, with a population of 4,000,000, has but thirty-one; Colorado would\r\nhave in the electoral college three votes, while New York has only\r\nthirty-three; Colorado would have in the Senate two votes, while New\r\nYork has no more.\r\n\r\nInequalities of this character have already occurred, but it is believed\r\nthat none have happened where the inequality was so great. When such\r\ninequality has been allowed, Congress is supposed to have permitted it\r\non the ground of some high public necessity and under circumstances\r\nwhich promised that it would rapidly disappear through the growth and\r\ndevelopment of the newly admitted State. Thus, in regard to the several\r\nStates in what was formerly called the \"Northwest Territory,\" lying east\r\nof the Mississippi, their rapid advancement in population rendered it\r\ncertain that States admitted with only one or two Representatives in\r\nCongress would in a very short period be entitled to a great increase\r\nof representation. So, when California was admitted, on the ground of\r\ncommercial and political exigencies, it was well foreseen that that\r\nState was destined rapidly to become a great, prosperous, and important\r\nmining and commercial community. In the case of Colorado, I am not aware\r\nthat any national exigency, either of a political or commercial nature,\r\nrequires a departure from the law of equality which has been so\r\ngenerally adhered to in our history.\r\n\r\nIf information submitted in connection with this bill is reliable,\r\nColorado, instead of increasing, has declined in population. At an\r\nelection for members of a Territorial legislature held in 1861, 10,580\r\nvotes were cast; at the election before mentioned, in 1864, the number\r\nof votes cast was 6,192; while at the irregular election held in 1865,\r\nwhich is assumed as a basis for legislative action at this time, the\r\naggregate of votes was 5,905. Sincerely anxious for the welfare and\r\nprosperity of every Territory and State, as well as for the prosperity\r\nand welfare of the whole Union, I regret this apparent decline of\r\npopulation in Colorado; but it is manifest that it is due to emigration\r\nwhich is going on from that Territory into other regions within the\r\nUnited States, which either are in fact or are believed by the\r\ninhabitants of Colorado to be richer in mineral wealth and agricultural\r\nresources. If, however, Colorado has not really declined in population,\r\nanother census or another election under the authority of Congress would\r\nplace the question beyond doubt, and cause but little delay in the\r\nultimate admission of the Territory as a State if desired by the people.\r\n\r\nThe tenor of these objections furnishes the reply which may be expected\r\nto an argument in favor of the measure derived from the enabling act\r\nwhich was passed by Congress on the 21st day of March, 1864. Although\r\nCongress then supposed that the condition of the Territory was such as\r\nto warrant its admission as a State, the result of two years' experience\r\nshows that every reason which existed for the institution of a\r\nTerritorial instead of a State government in Colorado at its first\r\norganization still continues in force.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the Union at the present moment is calculated to\r\ninspire caution in regard to the admission of new States. Eleven of the\r\nold States have been for some time, and still remain, unrepresented\r\nin Congress. It is a common interest of all the States, as well those\r\nrepresented as those unrepresented, that the integrity and harmony of\r\nthe Union should be restored as completely as possible, so that all\r\nthose who are expected to bear the burdens of the Federal Government\r\nshall be consulted concerning the admission of new States; and that\r\nin the meantime no new State shall be prematurely and unnecessarily\r\nadmitted to a participation in the political power which the Federal\r\nGovernment wields, not for the benefit of any individual State or\r\nsection, but for the common safety, welfare, and happiness of the whole\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _June 15, 1866_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe bill entitled \"An act to enable the New York and Montana Iron Mining\r\nand Manufacturing Company to purchase a certain amount of the public\r\nlands not now in market\" is herewith returned to the Senate, in which it\r\noriginated, with the objections which induce me to withhold my approval.\r\n\r\nBy the terms of this bill the New York and Montana Iron Mining and\r\nManufacturing Company are authorized, at any time within one year after\r\nthe date of approval, to _preempt_ two tracts of land in the Territory\r\nof Montana, not exceeding in the aggregate twenty sections, and not\r\nincluded in any Indian reservation or in any Government reservation for\r\nmilitary or other purposes. Three of these sections may be selected from\r\nlands containing _iron ore and coal_, and the remainder from _timber_\r\nlands lying near thereto. These selections are to be made under\r\nregulations from the Secretary of the Interior and be subject to his\r\napproval. The company, on the selection of the lands, may acquire\r\nimmediate possession by permanently marking their boundaries and\r\npublishing description thereof in any two newspapers of general\r\ncirculation in the Territory of Montana. Patents are to be issued on\r\nthe performance, within two years, of the following conditions:\r\n\r\nFirst. The lands to be surveyed at the expense of the company, and each\r\ntract to be \"as nearly in a square form as may be practicable.\"\r\n\r\nSecond. The company to furnish evidence satisfactory to the Secretary of\r\nthe Interior that they have erected and have in operation in one or more\r\nplaces on said lands iron works capable of manufacturing at least 1,500\r\ntons of iron per annum.\r\n\r\nThird. The company to have paid for said lands the minimum price of\r\n$1.25 per acre.\r\n\r\nIt is also provided that the \"patents shall convey no title to any\r\nmineral lands except iron and coal, or to any lands held by right of\r\npossession, or by any other title, _except Indian title_, valid at\r\nthe time of the selection of the said lands.\" The company are to have\r\nthe privileges of _ordinary preemptors_ and be subject to the same\r\nrestrictions as such preemptors with reference to wood and timber on the\r\nlands, with the exception of so much as may be necessarily used in the\r\nerection of buildings and in the legitimate business of manufacturing\r\niron.\r\n\r\nThe parties upon whom these privileges are conferred are designated in\r\nthe bill as \"The New York and Montana Iron Mining and Manufacturing\r\nCompany.\" Their names and residence not being disclosed, it must be\r\ninferred that this company is a corporation, which, under color of\r\ncorporate powers derived from some State or Territorial legislative\r\nauthority, proposes to carry on the business of mining and manufacturing\r\niron, and to accomplish these ends seeks this grant of public land in\r\nMontana. Two questions thus arise, viz, whether the privileges the bill\r\nwould confer should be granted to any person or persons, and, secondly,\r\nwhether, if unobjectionable in other respects, they should be conferred\r\nupon a corporation.\r\n\r\nThe public domain is a national trust, set apart and held for the\r\ngeneral welfare upon principles of equal justice, and not to be bestowed\r\nas a special privilege upon a favored class. The proper rules for the\r\ndisposal of public land have from the earliest period been the subject\r\nof earnest inquiry, grave discussion, and deliberate judgment. The\r\npurpose of _direct_ revenue was the first object, and this was attained\r\nby public sale to the highest bidder, and subsequently by the right of\r\nprivate purchase at a fixed minimum. It was soon discovered that the\r\nsurest and most speedy means of promoting the wealth and prosperity of\r\nthe country was by encouraging actual settlement and occupation, and\r\nhence a system of preemption rights, resulting most beneficially, in all\r\nthe Western Territories. By progressive steps it has advanced to the\r\nhomestead principle, securing to every head of a family, widow, and\r\nsingle man 21 years of age and to every soldier who has borne arms for\r\nhis country a landed estate sufficient, with industry, for the purpose\r\nof independent support.\r\n\r\nWithout tracing the system of preemption laws through the several\r\nstages, it is sufficient to observe that it rests upon certain just\r\nand plain principles, firmly established in all our legislation. The\r\nobject of these laws is to encourage the expansion of population and\r\nthe development of agricultural interests, and hence they have been\r\ninvariably restricted to settlers. Actual residence and cultivation are\r\nmade indispensable conditions; and, to guard the privilege from abuses\r\nof speculation or monopoly, the law is rigid as to the mode of\r\nestablishing claims by adequate testimony, with penalties for perjury.\r\nMining, trading, or any pursuit other than culture of the soil is\r\ninterdicted, mineral lands being expressly excluded from preemption\r\nprivileges, excepting those containing coal, which, in quantities not\r\nexceeding 160 acres, are restricted to individuals in actual possession\r\nand commerce, with an enhanced minimum of $20 per acre.\r\n\r\nFor a quarter of a century the quantity of land subject to agricultural\r\npreemption has been limited so as not to exceed a quarter section, or\r\n160 acres; and, still further to guard against monopoly, the privilege\r\nof preemption is not allowed to any person who owns 320 acres of land in\r\nany State or Territory of the United States, nor is any person entitled\r\nto more than one preemptive right, nor is it extended to lands to which\r\nthe Indian usufruct has not been extinguished. To restrict the\r\nprivilege within reasonable limits, credit to the ordinary preemptor on\r\n_offered_ land is not extended beyond twelve months, within which time\r\nthe minimum price must be paid. Where the settlement is upon _unoffered_\r\nterritory, the time for payment is limited to the day of public offering\r\ndesignated by proclamation of the President; while, to prevent\r\ndepreciation of the land by waste or destruction of what may constitute\r\nits value, penal enactments have been made for the punishment of persons\r\ndepredating upon public timber.\r\n\r\nNow, supposing the New York and Montana Iron Mining and Manufacturing\r\nCompany to be entitled to all the preemption rights which it has been\r\nfound just and expedient to bestow upon natural persons, it will be seen\r\nthat the privileges conferred by the bill in question are in direct\r\nconflict with every principle heretofore observed in respect to the\r\ndisposal of the public lands.\r\n\r\nThe bill confers preemption right to _mineral lands_, which, excepting\r\ncoal lands, at an enhanced minimum, have heretofore, as a general\r\nprinciple, been carefully excluded from preemption. The object of the\r\ncompany is not to cultivate the soil or to promote agriculture, but is\r\nfor the sole purpose of mining and manufacturing iron. The company is\r\nnot limited, like ordinary preemptors, to one preemptive claim of a\r\nquarter section, but may preempt two bodies of land, amounting in\r\nthe aggregate to twenty sections, containing 12,800 acres, or eighty\r\nordinary individual preemption rights. The timber is not protected, but,\r\non the contrary, is devoted to speedy destruction; for even before the\r\nconsummation of title the company are allowed to consume whatever may be\r\nnecessary in the erection of buildings and the business of manufacturing\r\niron. For these special privileges, in contravention of the land policy\r\nof so many years, the company are required to pay only the minimum price\r\nof $1.25 per acre, or one-sixteenth of the established minimum, and are\r\ngranted a credit of two years, or twice the time allowed ordinary\r\npreemptors on offered lands.\r\n\r\nNor is this all. The preemption right in question covers three sections\r\nof land containing iron ore and _coal_. The act passed on the 1st of\r\nJuly, 1864, made it lawful for the President to cause tracts embracing\r\ncoal beds or coal fields to be offered at public sale in suitable legal\r\nsubdivisions to the highest bidder, after public notice of not less than\r\nthree months, at a minimum price of $20 per acre, and any lands not thus\r\ndisposed of were thereafter to be liable to private entry at said\r\nminimum. By the act of March 3, 1865, the right of preemption to coal\r\nlands is granted to any citizen of the United States who at that date\r\nwas engaged in the business of coal mining on the public domain for\r\npurposes of commerce; and he is authorized to enter, according to legal\r\nsubdivisions, at the minimum price of $20 per acre, a quantity of land\r\nnot exceeding 160 acres, to embrace his improvements and mining\r\npremises. Under these acts the minimum price of three sections of coal\r\nlands would be thirty-eight thousand four hundred dollars ($38,400).\r\n\r\nBy the bill now in question these sections containing _coal and iron_\r\nare bestowed on this company at the nominal price of $1.25 per acre, or\r\ntwo thousand four hundred dollars ($2,400), thus making a gratuity or\r\ngift to the New York and Montana Iron Mining and Manufacturing Company\r\nof thirty-six thousand dollars ($36,000).\r\n\r\nOn what ground can such a gratuity to this company be justified,\r\nespecially at a time when the burdens of taxation bear so heavily upon\r\nall classes of the people?\r\n\r\nLess than two years ago it appears to have been the deliberate judgment\r\nof Congress that tracts of land containing coal beds or coal fields\r\nshould be sold, after three months' notice, to the bidder at public\r\nauction who would give the highest price over $20 per acre, and that\r\na citizen engaged in the business of actual coal mining on the public\r\ndomain should only secure a tract of 160 acres, at private entry, upon\r\npayment of $20 per acre and formal and satisfactory proof that he in all\r\nrespects came within the requirements of the statute. It can not be that\r\nthe coal fields of Montana have depreciated nearly twenty fold in value\r\nsince July, 1864. So complete a revolution in the land policy as is\r\nmanifested by this act can only be ascribed, therefore, to an\r\ninadvertence, which Congress will, I trust, promptly correct.\r\n\r\nBelieving that the preemption policy--so deliberately adopted, so long\r\npracticed, so carefully guarded with a view to the disposal of the\r\npublic lands in a manner that would promote the population and\r\nprosperity of the country--should not be perverted to the purposes\r\ncontemplated by this bill, I would be constrained to withhold my\r\nsanction even if this company were, as natural persons, entitled to the\r\nprivileges of ordinary preemptors; for if a corporation, as the name and\r\nthe absence of any designation of individuals would denote, the measure\r\nbefore me is liable to another fatal objection.\r\n\r\nWhy should incorporated companies have the privileges of individual\r\npreemptors? What principle of justice requires such a policy? What\r\nmotive of public welfare can fail to condemn it? Lands held by\r\ncorporations were regarded by ancient laws as held in mortmain, or by\r\n\"dead hand,\" and from the time of Magna Charta corporations required\r\nthe royal license to hold land, because such holding was regarded as in\r\nderogation of public policy and common right. Preemption is itself a\r\nspecial privilege, only authorized by its supposed public benefit in\r\npromoting the settlement and cultivation of vacant territory and in\r\nrewarding the enterprise of the persons upon whom the privilege is\r\nbestowed. \"Preemption rights,\" as declared by the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States, \"are founded in an enlightened public policy, rendered\r\nnecessary by the enterprise of our citizens. The adventurous pioneer,\r\nwho is found in advance of our settlements, encounters many hardships,\r\nand not unfrequently dangers from savage incursions. He is generally\r\npoor, and it is fit that his enterprise should be rewarded by the\r\nprivilege of purchasing the spot selected by him, not to exceed 160\r\nacres.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be said that this company, before they obtain a patent, must\r\nprove that within two years they \"have erected and have in operation\r\nin one or more places on the said lands iron works with a capacity for\r\nmanufacturing at least 1,500 tons of iron per annum.\" On the other hand,\r\nthey are to have possession for two years of more than 12,000 acres of\r\nthe choice land of the Territory, of which nearly 2,000 acres are to\r\ncontain _iron ore and coal_ and over 10,000 acres to be of _timber_\r\nland selected by themselves. They will thus have the first and exclusive\r\nchoice. In fact, they are the only parties who at this time would have\r\nany privilege whatever in the way of obtaining titles in that Territory.\r\nInasmuch as Montana has not yet been organized into a land district, the\r\ngeneral preemption laws for the benefit of individual settlers have not\r\nyet been extended to that country, nor has a single acre of public\r\nland in the Territory yet been surveyed. With such exclusive and\r\nextraordinary privileges, how many companies would be willing to\r\nundertake furnaces that would produce 5 tons per day in much less time\r\nthan two years?\r\n\r\nIt is plain the pretended consideration on which the patent is to issue\r\nbears no just proportion to that of the ordinary preemptor, and that\r\nthis bill is but the precursor of a system of land distribution to a\r\nprivileged class, unequal, unjust, and which ought not to receive the\r\nsanction of the General Government. Many thousand pioneers have turned\r\ntheir steps to the Western Territories, seeking, with their wives and\r\nchildren, homesteads to be acquired by sturdy industry under the\r\npreemption laws. On their arrival they should not find the timbered\r\nlands and the tracts containing iron ore and coal already surveyed and\r\nclaimed by corporate companies, favored by the special legislation of\r\nCongress, and with boundaries fixed even in advance of the public\r\nsurveys--a departure from the salutary provision requiring a settler\r\nupon unsurveyed lands to limit the boundaries of his claim to the lines\r\nof the public survey after they shall have been established. He receives\r\na title only to a legal subdivision, including his residence and\r\nimprovements. The survey of the company may not accord with that which\r\nwill hereafter be made by the Government, while the patent that issues\r\nwill be descriptive of and confer a title to the tract as surveyed by\r\nthe company.\r\n\r\nI am aware of no precedent for granting such exclusive rights to a\r\nmanufacturing company for a nominal consideration. Congress have made\r\nconcessions to railway companies of alternate sections within given\r\nlimits of the lines of their roads. This policy originated in the belief\r\nthat the facilities afforded by reaching the parts of the country remote\r\nfrom the great centers of population would expedite the settlement and\r\nsale of the public domain. These incidental advantages were secured\r\nwithout pecuniary loss to the Government, by reason of the enhanced\r\nvalue of the reserved sections, which are held at the double minimum.\r\nMining and manufacturing companies, however, have always been\r\ndistinguished from public-improvement corporations. The former are, in\r\nlaw and in fact, only private associations for trade and business on\r\nindividual account and for personal benefit. Admitting the proposition\r\nthat railroad grants can stand on sound principle, it is plain that such\r\ncan not be the case with concessions to companies like that contemplated\r\nby this measure. In view of the strong temptation to monopolize the\r\npublic lands, with the pernicious results, it would seem at least of\r\ndoubtful expediency to lift corporations above all competition with\r\nactual settlers by authorizing them to become purchasers of public lands\r\nin the Territories for any purpose, and particularly when clothed with\r\nthe special benefits of this bill. For myself, I am convinced that the\r\nprivileges of ordinary preemptors ought not to be extended to\r\nincorporated companies.\r\n\r\nA third objection may be mentioned, as it exemplifies the spirit in\r\nwhich special privileges are sought by incorporated companies.\r\n\r\nLand subject to Indian occupancy has always been scrupulously guarded by\r\nlaw from preemption settlement or encroachment under any pretext until\r\nthe Indian title should be extinguished. In the fourth section of this\r\nact, however, lands held by \"Indian title\" are excepted from prohibition\r\nagainst the patent to be issued to the New York and Montana Iron Mining\r\nand Manufacturing Company.\r\n\r\nThe bill provides that the patent \"shall convey no title to any mineral\r\nlands _except iron and coal_, or to any lands held by right of\r\npossession, or by any other title, _except Indian title_, valid at\r\nthe time of the selection of the said lands.\" It will be seen that by\r\nthe first section lands in \"Indian reservations\" are excluded from\r\nindividual preemption right, but by the fourth section the patent may\r\ncover any Indian title except a _reservation_; so that no matter what\r\nmay be the nature of the Indian title, unless it be in a reservation,\r\nit is unprotected from the privilege conceded by this bill.\r\n\r\nWithout further pursuing the subject, I return the bill to the Senate\r\nwithout my signature, and with the following as prominent objections to\r\nits becoming a law:\r\n\r\nFirst. That it gives to the New York and Montana Iron Mining and\r\nManufacturing Company preemption privileges to iron and coal lands on a\r\nlarge scale and at the ordinary minimum--a privilege denied to ordinary\r\npreemptors. It bestows upon the company large tracts of _coal_ lands at\r\none-sixteenth of the minimum price required from ordinary preemptors.\r\nIt also relieves the company from restrictions imposed upon ordinary\r\npreemptors in respect to _timber lands_; allows double the time for\r\npayment granted to preemptors on offered lands; and these privileges are\r\nfor purposes not heretofore authorized by the preemption laws, but for\r\ntrade and manufacturing.\r\n\r\nSecond. Preemption rights on such a scale to private corporations are\r\nunequal and hostile to the policy and principles which sanction\r\npreemption laws.\r\n\r\nThird. The bill allows this company to take possession of land, use it,\r\nand acquire a patent thereto before the Indian title is extinguished,\r\nand thus violates the good faith of the Government toward the aboriginal\r\ntribes.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _July 16, 1866_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nA careful examination of the bill passed by the two Houses of Congress\r\nentitled \"An act to continue in force and to amend 'An act to establish\r\na bureau for the relief of freedmen and refugees, and for other\r\npurposes'\" has convinced me that the legislation which it proposes would\r\nnot be consistent with the welfare of the country, and that it falls\r\nclearly within the reasons assigned in my message of the 19th of\r\nFebruary last, returning, without my signature, a similar measure which\r\noriginated in the Senate. It is not my purpose to repeat the objections\r\nwhich I then urged. They are yet fresh in your recollection, and can be\r\nreadily examined as a part of the records of one branch of the National\r\nLegislature. Adhering to the principles set forth in that message, I now\r\nreaffirm them and the line of policy therein indicated.\r\n\r\nThe only ground upon which this kind of legislation can be justified is\r\nthat of the war-making power. The act of which this bill is intended\r\nas amendatory was passed during the existence of the war. By its own\r\nprovisions it is to terminate within one year from the cessation of\r\nhostilities and the declaration of peace. It is therefore yet in\r\nexistence, and it is likely that it will continue in force as long\r\nas the freedmen may require the benefit of its provisions. It will\r\ncertainly remain in operation as a law until some months subsequent to\r\nthe meeting of the next session of Congress, when, if experience shall\r\nmake evident the necessity of additional legislation, the two Houses\r\nwill have ample time to mature and pass the requisite measures. In the\r\nmeantime the questions arise, Why should this war measure be continued\r\nbeyond the period designated in the original act, and why in time of\r\npeace should military tribunals be created to continue until each\r\n\"State shall be fully restored in its constitutional relations to the\r\nGovernment and shall be duly represented in the Congress of the United\r\nStates\"?\r\n\r\nIt was manifest, with respect to the act approved March 3, 1865, that\r\nprudence and wisdom alike required that jurisdiction over all cases\r\nconcerning the free enjoyment of the immunities and rights of\r\ncitizenship, as well as the protection of person and property, should\r\nbe conferred upon some tribunal in every State or district where the\r\nordinary course of judicial proceedings was interrupted by the\r\nrebellion, and until the same should be fully restored. At that time,\r\ntherefore, an urgent necessity existed for the passage of some such\r\nlaw. Now, however, war has substantially ceased; the ordinary course of\r\njudicial proceedings is no longer interrupted; the courts, both State\r\nand Federal, are in full, complete, and successful operation, and\r\nthrough them every person, regardless of race and color, is entitled to\r\nand can be heard. The protection granted to the white citizen is already\r\nconferred by law upon the freedman; strong and stringent guards, by way\r\nof penalties and punishments, are thrown around his person and property,\r\nand it is believed that ample protection will be afforded him by due\r\nprocess of law, without resort to the dangerous expedient of \"military\r\ntribunals,\" now that the war has been brought to a close. The necessity\r\nno longer existing for such tribunals, which had their origin in the\r\nwar, grave objections to their continuance must present themselves to\r\nthe minds of all reflecting and dispassionate men. Independently of the\r\ndanger, in representative republics, of conferring upon the military,\r\nin time of peace, extraordinary powers--so carefully guarded against\r\nby the patriots and statesmen of the earlier days of the Republic,\r\nso frequently the ruin of governments founded upon the same free\r\nprinciples, and subversive of the rights and liberties of the\r\ncitizen--the question of practical economy earnestly commends itself to\r\nthe consideration of the lawmaking power. With an immense debt already\r\nburdening the incomes of the industrial and laboring classes, a due\r\nregard for their interests, so inseparably connected with the welfare of\r\nthe country, should prompt us to rigid economy and retrenchment, and\r\ninfluence us to abstain from all legislation that would unnecessarily\r\nincrease the public indebtedness. Tested by this rule of sound political\r\nwisdom, I can see no reason for the establishment of the \"military\r\njurisdiction\" conferred upon the officials of the Bureau by the\r\nfourteenth section of the bill.\r\n\r\nBy the laws of the United States and of the different States competent\r\ncourts, Federal and State, have been established and are now in full\r\npractical operation. By means of these civil tribunals ample redress is\r\nafforded for all private wrongs, whether to the person or the property\r\nof the citizen, without denial or unnecessary delay. They are open to\r\nall, without regard to color or race. I feel well assured that it will\r\nbe better to trust the rights, privileges, and immunities of the citizen\r\nto tribunals thus established, and presided over by competent and\r\nimpartial judges, bound by fixed rules of law and evidence, and where\r\nthe right of trial by jury is guaranteed and secured, than to the\r\ncaprice or judgment of an officer of the Bureau, who it is possible\r\nmay be entirely ignorant of the principles that underlie the just\r\nadministration of the law. There is danger, too, that conflict of\r\njurisdiction will frequently arise between the civil courts and these\r\nmilitary tribunals, each having concurrent jurisdiction over the person\r\nand the cause of action--the one judicature administered and controlled\r\nby civil law, the other by the military. How is the conflict to be\r\nsettled, and who is to determine between the two tribunals when it\r\narises? In my opinion, it is wise to guard against such conflict by\r\nleaving to the courts and juries the protection of all civil rights\r\nand the redress of all civil grievances.\r\n\r\nThe fact can not be denied that since the actual cessation of\r\nhostilities many acts of violence, such, perhaps, as had never been\r\nwitnessed in their previous history, have occurred in the States\r\ninvolved in the recent rebellion. I believe, however, that public\r\nsentiment will sustain me in the assertion that such deeds of wrong are\r\nnot confined to any particular State or section, but are manifested over\r\nthe entire country, demonstrating that the cause that produced them\r\ndoes not depend upon any particular locality, but is the result of\r\nthe agitation and derangement incident to a long and bloody civil war.\r\nWhile the prevalence of such disorders must be greatly deplored, their\r\noccasional and temporary occurrence would seem to furnish no necessity\r\nfor the extension of the Bureau beyond the period fixed in the original\r\nact.\r\n\r\nBesides the objections which I have thus briefly stated, I may urge upon\r\nyour consideration the additional reason that recent developments in\r\nregard to the practical operations of the Bureau in many of the States\r\nshow that in numerous instances it is used by its agents as a means of\r\npromoting their individual advantage, and that the freedmen are employed\r\nfor the advancement of the personal ends of the officers instead of\r\ntheir own improvement and welfare, thus confirming the fears originally\r\nentertained by many that the continuation of such a Bureau for any\r\nunnecessary length of time would inevitably result in fraud, corruption,\r\nand oppression. It is proper to state that in cases of this character\r\ninvestigations have been promptly ordered, and the offender punished\r\nwhenever his guilt has been satisfactorily established.\r\n\r\nAs another reason against the necessity of the legislation contemplated\r\nby this measure, reference may be had to the \"civil-rights bill,\" now a\r\nlaw of the land, and which will be faithfully executed so long as it\r\nshall remain unrepealed and may not be declared unconstitutional by\r\ncourts of competent jurisdiction. By that act it is enacted--\r\n\r\n  That all persons born in the United States and not subject to any\r\n  foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed, are hereby declared to\r\n  be citizens of the United States; and such citizens, of every race\r\n  and color, without regard to any previous condition of slavery or\r\n  involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the\r\n  party shall have been duly convicted, shall have the same right in every\r\n  State and Territory in the United States to make and enforce contracts;\r\n  to sue, be parties, and give evidence; to inherit, purchase, lease,\r\n  sell, hold, and convey real and personal property, and to full and equal\r\n  benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and\r\n  property, as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like\r\n  punishment, pains, and penalties, and to none other, any law, statute,\r\n  ordinance, regulation, or custom to the contrary notwithstanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the provisions of the act full protection is afforded through the\r\ndistrict courts of the United States to all persons injured, and whose\r\nprivileges, as thus declared, are in any way impaired; and heavy\r\npenalties are denounced against the person who willfully violates the\r\nlaw. I need not state that that law did not receive my approval; yet its\r\nremedies are far more preferable than those proposed in the present\r\nbill--the one being civil and the other military.\r\n\r\nBy the sixth section of the bill herewith returned certain proceedings\r\nby which the lands in the \"parishes of St. Helena and St. Luke, South\r\nCarolina,\" were sold and bid in, and afterwards disposed of by the tax\r\ncommissioners, are ratified and confirmed. By the seventh, eighth,\r\nninth, tenth, and eleventh sections provisions by law are made for the\r\ndisposal of the lands thus acquired to a particular class of citizens.\r\nWhile the quieting of titles is deemed very important and desirable, the\r\ndiscrimination made in the bill seems objectionable, as does also the\r\nattempt to confer upon the commissioners judicial powers by which\r\ncitizens of the United States are to be deprived of their property in a\r\nmode contrary to that provision of the Constitution which declares that\r\nno person shall \"be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due\r\nprocess of law.\" As a general principle, such legislation is unsafe,\r\nunwise, partial, and unconstitutional. It may deprive persons of their\r\nproperty who are equally deserving objects of the nation's bounty as\r\nthose whom by this legislation Congress seeks to benefit. The title to\r\nthe land thus to be portioned out to a favored class of citizens must\r\ndepend upon the regularity of the tax sales under the law as it existed\r\nat the time of the sale, and no subsequent legislation can give\r\nvalidity to the right thus acquired as against the original claimants.\r\nThe attention of Congress is therefore invited to a more mature\r\nconsideration of the measures proposed in these sections of the bill.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I again urge upon Congress the danger of class\r\nlegislation, so well calculated to keep the public mind in a state of\r\nuncertain expectation, disquiet, and restlessness and to encourage\r\ninterested hopes and fears that the National Government will continue to\r\nfurnish to classes of citizens in the several States means for support\r\nand maintenance regardless of whether they pursue a life of indolence or\r\nof labor, and regardless also of the constitutional limitations of the\r\nnational authority in times of peace and tranquillity.\r\n\r\nThe bill is herewith returned to the House of Representatives, in which\r\nit originated, for its final action.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _July 28, 1866_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return, without my approval, the bill entitled \"An act\r\nerecting the Territory of Montana into a surveying district, and for\r\nother purposes.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill contains four sections, the first of which erects the Territory\r\ninto a surveying district and authorizes the appointment of a\r\nsurveyor-general; the second constitutes the Territory a land district;\r\nthe third authorizes the appointment of a register and receiver for said\r\ndistrict; and the fourth requires the surveyor-general to--\r\n\r\n  select and survey eighteen alternate odd sections of nonmineral timber\r\n  lands within said district for the New York and Montana Iron Mining and\r\n  Manufacturing Company, incorporated under the laws of the State of New\r\n  York, which lands the said company shall have immediate possession of on\r\n  the payment of _$1.25_ per acre, and shall have a patent for the same\r\n  whenever, within two years after their selection, they shall have\r\n  furnished evidence satisfactory to the Secretary of the Interior that\r\n  they have erected and have in operation on the said lands iron works\r\n  with a capacity for manufacturing 1,500 tons of iron per annum:\r\n  _Provided_, That the said lands shall revert to the United States in\r\n  case the above-mentioned iron works be not erected within the specified\r\n  time: _And provided_, That until the title to the said lands shall have\r\n  been perfected the timber shall not be cut off from more than one\r\n  section of the said lands.\r\n\r\nTo confer the special privileges specified in this fourth section\r\nappears to be the chief object of the bill, the provisions of which are\r\nsubject to some of the most important objections that induced me to\r\nreturn to the Senate with my disapproval the bill entitled \"An act to\r\nenable the New York and Montana Iron Mining and Manufacturing Company\r\nto purchase a certain amount of the public lands not now in market.\"\r\nThat bill authorized the same corporation to select and survey in the\r\nTerritory of Montana, in square form, twenty-one sections of land, three\r\nof which might contain coal and iron ore, for which the minimum rate of\r\n$1.25 per acre was to be paid. The present bill omits these sections of\r\nmineral lands, and directs the surveyor-general to select and survey the\r\ntimber lands; but it contains the objectionable feature of granting\r\nto a private mining and manufacturing corporation exclusive rights and\r\nprivileges in the public domain which are by law denied to individuals.\r\nThe first choice of timber land in the Territory is bestowed upon a\r\ncorporation foreign to the Territory and over which Congress has no\r\ncontrol. The surveyor-general of the district, a public officer who\r\nshould have no connection with any purchase of public land, is made the\r\nagent of the corporation to select the land, the selections to be made\r\nin the absence of all competition; and over 11,000 acres are bestowed\r\nat the lowest price of public lands. It is by no means certain that\r\nthe substitution of alternate sections for the compact body of lands\r\ncontemplated by the other bill is any less injurious to the public\r\ninterest, for alternate sections stripped of timber are not likely\r\nto enhance the value of those reserved by the Government. Be this as\r\nit may, this bill bestows a large monopoly of public lands without\r\nadequate consideration; confers a right and privilege in quantity\r\nequivalent to seventy-two preemption rights; introduces a dangerous\r\nsystem of privileges to private trading corporations; and is an unjust\r\ndiscrimination in favor of traders and speculators against individual\r\nsettlers and pioneers who are seeking homes and improving our Western\r\nTerritories. Such a departure from the long-established, wise, and just\r\npolicy which has heretofore governed the disposition of the public funds\r\n[lands] can not receive my sanction. The objections enumerated apply to\r\nthe fourth section of the bill. The first, second, and third sections,\r\nproviding for the appointment of a surveyor-general, register, and\r\nreceiver, are unobjectionable if any necessity requires the creation\r\nof these offices and the additional expenses of a new surveying land\r\ndistrict. But they appear in this instance to be only needed as a part\r\nof the machinery to enable the \"New York and Montana Iron Mining and\r\nManufacturing Company\" to secure these privileges; for I am informed by\r\nthe proper Department, in a communication hereto annexed, that there is\r\nno public necessity for a surveyor-general, register, or receiver in\r\nMontana Territory, since it forms part of an existing surveying and land\r\ndistrict, wherein the public business is, under present laws, transacted\r\nwith adequate facility, so that the provisions of the first, second, and\r\nthird sections would occasion needless expense to the General\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\n_To all whom it may concern_:\r\n\r\nAn exequatur, bearing date the 13th day of October, 1864, having been\r\nissued to Esteban Rogers, recognizing him as consul _ad interim_ of the\r\nRepublic of Chile for the port of New York and its dependencies and\r\ndeclaring him free to exercise and enjoy such functions, powers, and\r\nprivileges as are allowed to consuls by the law of nations or by the\r\nlaws of the United States and existing treaty stipulations between the\r\nGovernment of Chile and the United States; but as it is deemed advisable\r\nthat the said Esteban Rogers should no longer be permitted to continue\r\nin the exercise of said functions, powers, and privileges:\r\n\r\nThese are therefore to declare that I no longer recognize the said\r\nEsteban Rogers as consul _ad interim_ of the Republic of Chile for\r\nthe port of New York and its dependencies and will not permit him to\r\nexercise or enjoy any of the functions, powers, or privileges allowed to\r\na consular officer of that nation; and that I do hereby wholly revoke\r\nand annul the said exequatur heretofore given and do declare the same\r\nto be absolutely null and void from this day forward.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have caused these letters to be made patent and\r\nthe seal of the United States of America to be hereunto affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand, at Washington, this 12th day of February, A.D.\r\n1866, and of the Independence of the United States of America the\r\nninetieth.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  WILLIAM H.

that in\r\n  this national emergency Congress, banishing all feelings of mere passion\r\n  or resentment, will recollect only its duty to the whole country; that\r\n  this war is not waged upon our part in any spirit of oppression, nor for\r\n  any purpose of conquest or subjugation, nor purpose of overthrowing or\r\n  interfering with the rights or established institutions of those States,\r\n  but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution and to\r\n  preserve the Union, with all the dignity, equality, and rights of the\r\n  several States unimpaired; and that as soon as these objects are\r\n  accomplished the war ought to cease.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd whereas the Senate of the United States, on the 25th day of July,\r\n1861, adopted a resolution in the words following, to wit:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the present deplorable civil war has been forced upon\r\n  the country by the disunionists of the Southern States now in revolt\r\n  against the constitutional Government and in arms around the capital;\r\n  that in this national emergency Congress, banishing all feeling of\r\n  mere passion or resentment, will recollect only its duty to the whole\r\n  country; that this war is not prosecuted upon our part in any spirit\r\n  of oppression, nor for any purpose of conquest or subjugation, nor\r\n  purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights or established\r\n  institutions of those States, but to defend and maintain the supremacy\r\n  of the Constitution and all laws made in pursuance thereof and to\r\n  preserve the Union, with all the dignity, equality, and rights of\r\n  the several States unimpaired; that as soon as these objects are\r\n  accomplished the war ought to cease.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd whereas these resolutions, though not joint or concurrent in form,\r\nare substantially identical, and as such may be regarded as having\r\nexpressed the sense of Congress upon the subject to which they relate;\r\nand\r\n\r\nWhereas by my proclamation of the 13th day of June last the insurrection\r\nin the State of Tennessee was declared to have been suppressed, the\r\nauthority of the United States therein to be undisputed, and such United\r\nStates officers as had been duly commissioned to be in the undisturbed\r\nexercise of their official functions;

and\r\n\r\nWhereas, in view of the before-recited premises, it is the manifest\r\ndetermination of the American people that no State of its own will has\r\nthe right or the power to go out of, or separate itself from, or be\r\nseparated from, the American Union, and that therefore each State ought\r\nto remain and constitute an integral part of the United States; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the people of the several before-mentioned States have, in the\r\nmanner aforesaid, given satisfactory evidence that they acquiesce in\r\nthis sovereign and important resolution of national unity; and\r\n\r\nWhereas it is believed to be a fundamental principle of government that\r\npeople who have revolted and who have been overcome and subdued must\r\neither be dealt with so as to induce them voluntarily to become friends\r\nor else they must be held by absolute military power or devastated so as\r\nto prevent them from ever again doing harm as enemies, which last-named\r\npolicy is abhorrent to humanity and to freedom; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the Constitution of the United States provides for constituent\r\ncommunities only as States, and not as Territories, dependencies,\r\nprovinces, or protectorates; and\r\n\r\nWhereas such constituent States must necessarily be, and by the\r\nConstitution and laws of the United States are, made equals and placed\r\nupon a like footing as to political rights, immunities, dignity, and\r\npower with the several States with which they are united; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the observance of political equality, as a principle of right\r\nand justice, is well calculated to encourage the people of the aforesaid\r\nStates to be and become more and more constant and persevering in their\r\nrenewed allegiance; and\r\n\r\nWhereas standing armies, military occupation, martial law, military\r\ntribunals, and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of _habeas\r\ncorpus_ are in time of peace dangerous to public liberty, incompatible\r\nwith the individual rights of the citizen, contrary to the genius and\r\nspirit of our free institutions, and exhaustive of the national\r\nresources, and ought not, therefore, to be sanctioned or allowed except\r\nin cases of actual necessity for repelling invasion or suppressing\r\ninsurrection or rebellion; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the policy of the Government of the United States from the\r\nbeginning of the insurrection to its overthrow and final suppression has\r\nbeen in conformity with the principles herein set forth and enumerated:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, do\r\nhereby proclaim and declare that the insurrection which heretofore\r\nexisted in the States of Georgia, South Carolina, Virginia, North\r\nCarolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, and\r\nFlorida is at an end and is henceforth to be so regarded.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 2d day of April, A.D. 1866, and of\r\nthe Independence of the United States of America the ninetieth.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  WILLIAM H.

That year has, moreover,\r\nbeen crowned with many peculiar blessings.\r\n\r\nThe civil war that so recently closed among us has not been anywhere\r\nreopened; foreign intervention has ceased to excite alarm or\r\napprehension; intrusive pestilence has been benignly mitigated; domestic\r\ntranquillity has improved, sentiments of conciliation have largely\r\nprevailed, and affections of loyalty and patriotism have been widely\r\nrenewed; our fields have yielded quite abundantly, our mining industry\r\nhas been richly rewarded, and we have been allowed to extend our\r\nrailroad system far into the interior recesses of the country, while\r\nour commerce has resumed its customary activity in foreign seas.\r\n\r\nThese great national blessings demand a national acknowledgment.\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Andrew Johnson.

EDWIN M. STANTON,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\nSIR: In the report of General Grant of the 27th ultimo, inclosed in your\r\ncommunication of that date, reference is made to the force at present\r\nstationed in the Military Department of Washington (which embraces the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, the counties of Alexander and Fairfax, Va., and\r\nthe States of Maryland and Delaware), and it is stated that the entire\r\nnumber of troops comprised in the command is 2,224, of which only 1,550\r\nare enumerated as \"effective.\" In view of the prevalence in various\r\nportions of the country of a revolutionary and turbulent disposition,\r\nwhich might at any moment assume insurrectionary proportions and lead to\r\nserious disorders, and of the duty of the Government to be at all times\r\nprepared to act with decision and effect, this force is not deemed\r\nadequate for the protection and security of the seat of Government.\r\n\r\nI therefore request that you will at once take such measures as will\r\ninsure its safety, and thus discourage any attempt for its possession\r\nby insurgent or other illegal combinations.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, yours,\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington, D.C., November 2, 1866_.\r\n\r\nHon. EDWIN M. STANTON,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\nSIR: There is ground to apprehend danger of an insurrection in Baltimore\r\nagainst the constituted authorities of the State of Maryland on or about\r\nthe day of the election soon to be held in that city, and that in such\r\ncontingency the aid of the United States might be invoked under the acts\r\nof Congress which pertain to that subject. While I am averse to any\r\nmilitary demonstration that would have a tendency to interfere with the\r\nfree exercise of the elective franchise in Baltimore or be construed\r\ninto any interference in local questions, I feel great solicitude that\r\nshould an insurrection take place the Government should be prepared to\r\nmeet and promptly put it down. I accordingly desire you to call General\r\nGrant's attention to the subject, leaving to his own discretion and\r\njudgment the measures of preparation and precaution that should be\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, yours,\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 3, 1866_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAfter a brief interval the Congress of the United States resumes its\r\nannual legislative labors. An all-wise and merciful Providence has\r\nabated the pestilence which visited our shores, leaving its calamitous\r\ntraces upon some portions of our country. Peace, order, tranquillity,\r\nand civil authority have been formally declared to exist throughout the\r\nwhole of the United States. In all of the States civil authority has\r\nsuperseded the coercion of arms, and the people, by their voluntary\r\naction, are maintaining their governments in full activity and complete\r\noperation. The enforcement of the laws is no longer \"obstructed in any\r\nState by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary\r\ncourse of judicial proceedings,\" and the animosities engendered by the\r\nwar are rapidly yielding to the beneficent influences of our free\r\ninstitutions and to the kindly effects of unrestricted social and\r\ncommercial intercourse. An entire restoration of fraternal feeling\r\nmust be the earnest wish of every patriotic heart; and we will have\r\naccomplished our grandest national achievement when, forgetting the sad\r\nevents of the past and remembering only their instructive lessons, we\r\nresume our onward career as a free, prosperous, and united people.\r\n\r\nIn my message of the 4th of December, 1865, Congress was informed of the\r\nmeasures which had been instituted by the Executive with a view to the\r\ngradual restoration of the States in which the insurrection occurred to\r\ntheir relations with the General Government. Provisional governors had\r\nbeen appointed, conventions called, governors elected, legislatures\r\nassembled, and Senators and Representatives chosen to the Congress\r\nof the United States. Courts had been opened for the enforcement of\r\nlaws long in abeyance. The blockade had been removed, custom-houses\r\nreestablished, and the internal-revenue laws put in force, in order that\r\nthe people might contribute to the national income. Postal operations\r\nhad been renewed, and efforts were being made to restore them to their\r\nformer condition of efficiency. The States themselves had been asked to\r\ntake part in the high function of amending the Constitution, and of thus\r\nsanctioning the extinction of African slavery as one of the legitimate\r\nresults of our internecine struggle.\r\n\r\nHaving progressed thus far, the executive department found that it had\r\naccomplished nearly all that was within the scope of its constitutional\r\nauthority. One thing, however, yet remained to be done before the work\r\nof restoration could be completed, and that was the admission to\r\nCongress of loyal Senators and Representatives from the States whose\r\npeople had rebelled against the lawful authority of the General\r\nGovernment. This question devolved upon the respective Houses, which\r\nby the Constitution are made the judges of the elections, returns, and\r\nqualifications of their own members, and its consideration at once\r\nengaged the attention of Congress.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the executive department--no other plan having been\r\nproposed by Congress--continued its efforts to perfect, as far as was\r\npracticable, the restoration of the proper relations between the\r\ncitizens of the respective States, the States, and the Federal\r\nGovernment, extending from time to time, as the public interests seemed\r\nto require, the judicial, revenue, and postal systems of the country.\r\nWith the advice and consent of the Senate, the necessary officers were\r\nappointed and appropriations made by Congress for the payment of their\r\nsalaries. The proposition to amend the Federal Constitution, so as to\r\nprevent the existence of slavery within the United States or any place\r\nsubject to their jurisdiction, was ratified by the requisite number\r\nof States, and on the 18th day of December, 1865, it was officially\r\ndeclared to have become valid as a part of the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States. All of the States in which the insurrection had existed\r\npromptly amended their constitutions so as to make them conform to the\r\ngreat change thus effected in the organic law of the land; declared null\r\nand void all ordinances and laws of secession; repudiated all pretended\r\ndebts and obligations created for the revolutionary purposes of the\r\ninsurrection, and proceeded in good faith to the enactment of measures\r\nfor the protection and amelioration of the condition of the colored\r\nrace. Congress, however, yet hesitated to admit any of these States to\r\nrepresentation, and it was not until toward the close of the eighth\r\nmonth of the session that an exception was made in favor of Tennessee\r\nby the admission of her Senators and Representatives.\r\n\r\nI deem it a subject of profound regret that Congress has thus far\r\nfailed to admit to seats loyal Senators and Representatives from the\r\nother States whose inhabitants, with those of Tennessee, had engaged\r\nin the rebellion. Ten States--more than one-fourth of the whole\r\nnumber--remain without representation; the seats of fifty members in the\r\nHouse of Representatives and of twenty members in the Senate are yet\r\nvacant, not by their own consent, not by a failure of election, but by\r\nthe refusal of Congress to accept their credentials. Their admission,\r\nit is believed, would have accomplished much toward the renewal and\r\nstrengthening of our relations as one people and removed serious cause\r\nfor discontent on the part of the inhabitants of those States. It would\r\nhave accorded with the great principle enunciated in the Declaration\r\nof American Independence that no people ought to bear the burden of\r\ntaxation and yet be denied the right of representation. It would have\r\nbeen in consonance with the express provisions of the Constitution that\r\n\"each State shall have at least one Representative\" and \"that no State,\r\nwithout its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the\r\nSenate.\" These provisions were intended to secure to every State and\r\nto the people of every State the right of representation in each House\r\nof Congress; and so important was it deemed by the framers of the\r\nConstitution that the equality of the States in the Senate should be\r\npreserved that not even by an amendment of the Constitution can any\r\nState, without its consent, be denied a voice in that branch of the\r\nNational Legislature.\r\n\r\nIt is true it has been assumed that the existence of the States was\r\nterminated by the rebellious acts of their inhabitants, and that, the\r\ninsurrection having been suppressed, they were thenceforward to be\r\nconsidered merely as conquered territories. The legislative, executive,\r\nand judicial departments of the Government have, however, with great\r\ndistinctness and uniform consistency, refused to sanction an assumption\r\nso incompatible with the nature of our republican system and with the\r\nprofessed objects of the war. Throughout the recent legislation of\r\nCongress the undeniable fact makes itself apparent that these ten\r\npolitical communities are nothing less than States of this Union. At the\r\nvery commencement of the rebellion each House declared, with a unanimity\r\nas remarkable as it was significant, that the war was not \"waged upon\r\nour part in any spirit of oppression, nor for any purpose of conquest or\r\nsubjugation, nor purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights\r\nor established institutions of those States, but to defend and maintain\r\nthe supremacy of the Constitution and all laws made in pursuance\r\nthereof, and to preserve the Union, with all the dignity, equality,\r\nand rights of the several States unimpaired; and that as soon as these\r\nobjects\" were \"accomplished the war ought to cease.\" In some instances\r\nSenators were permitted to continue their legislative functions, while\r\nin other instances Representatives were elected and admitted to seats\r\nafter their States had formally declared their right to withdraw from\r\nthe Union and were endeavoring to maintain that right by force of arms.\r\nAll of the States whose people were in insurrection, as States, were\r\nincluded in the apportionment of the direct tax of $20,000,000 annually\r\nlaid upon the United States by the act approved 5th August, 1861.\r\nCongress, by the act of March 4, 1862, and by the apportionment of\r\nrepresentation thereunder also recognized their presence as States in\r\nthe Union; and they have, for judicial purposes, been divided into\r\ndistricts, as States alone can be divided. The same recognition appears\r\nin the recent legislation in reference to Tennessee, which evidently\r\nrests upon the fact that the functions of the State were not destroyed\r\nby the rebellion, but merely suspended; and that principle is of course\r\napplicable to those States which, like Tennessee, attempted to renounce\r\ntheir places in the Union.\r\n\r\nThe action of the executive department of the Government upon this\r\nsubject has been equally definite and uniform, and the purpose of the\r\nwar was specifically stated in the proclamation issued by my predecessor\r\non the 22d day of September, 1862. It was then solemnly proclaimed and\r\ndeclared \"that hereafter, as heretofore, the war will be prosecuted for\r\nthe object of practically restoring the constitutional relation between\r\nthe United States and each of the States and the people thereof in which\r\nStates that relation is or may be suspended or disturbed.\"\r\n\r\nThe recognition of the States by the judicial department of the\r\nGovernment has also been clear and conclusive in all proceedings\r\naffecting them as States had in the Supreme, circuit, and district\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\nIn the admission of Senators and Representatives from any and all of the\r\nStates there can be no just ground of apprehension that persons who are\r\ndisloyal will be clothed with the powers of legislation, for this could\r\nnot happen when the Constitution and the laws are enforced by a vigilant\r\nand faithful Congress. Each House is made the \"judge of the elections,\r\nreturns, and qualifications of its own members,\" and may, \"with the\r\nconcurrence of two-thirds, expel a member.\" When a Senator or\r\nRepresentative presents his certificate of election, he may at once\r\nbe admitted or rejected; or, should there be any question as to his\r\neligibility, his credentials may be referred for investigation to the\r\nappropriate committee. If admitted to a seat, it must be upon evidence\r\nsatisfactory to the House of which he thus becomes a member that\r\nhe possesses the requisite constitutional and legal qualifications.\r\nIf refused admission as a member for want of due allegiance to the\r\nGovernment and returned to his constituents, they are admonished that\r\nnone but persons loyal to the United States will be allowed a voice\r\nin the legislative councils of the nation, and the political power\r\nand moral influence of Congress are thus effectively exerted in the\r\ninterests of loyalty to the Government and fidelity to the Union. Upon\r\nthis question, so vitally affecting the restoration of the Union and the\r\npermanency of our present form of government, my convictions, heretofore\r\nexpressed, have undergone no change, but, on the contrary, their\r\ncorrectness has been confirmed by reflection and time. If the admission\r\nof loyal members to seats in the respective Houses of Congress was wise\r\nand expedient a year ago, it is no less wise and expedient now. If this\r\nanomalous condition is right now--if in the exact condition of these\r\nStates at the present time it is lawful to exclude them from\r\nrepresentation--I do not see that the question will be changed by the\r\nefflux of time. Ten years hence, if these States remain as they are, the\r\nright of representation will be no stronger, the right of exclusion will\r\nbe no weaker.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States makes it the duty of the President\r\nto recommend to the consideration of Congress \"such measures as he shall\r\njudge necessary and expedient.\" I know of no measure more imperatively\r\ndemanded by every consideration of national interest, sound policy,\r\nand equal justice than the admission of loyal members from the now\r\nunrepresented States. This would consummate the work of restoration\r\nand exert a most salutary influence in the reestablishment of peace,\r\nharmony, and fraternal feeling. It would tend greatly to renew the\r\nconfidence of the American people in the vigor and stability of their\r\ninstitutions. It would bind us more closely together as a nation and\r\nenable us to show to the world the inherent and recuperative power of a\r\ngovernment founded upon the will of the people and established upon the\r\nprinciples of liberty, justice, and intelligence. Our increased strength\r\nand enhanced prosperity would irrefragably demonstrate the fallacy of\r\nthe arguments against free institutions drawn from our recent national\r\ndisorders by the enemies of republican government. The admission of\r\nloyal members from the States now excluded from Congress, by allaying\r\ndoubt and apprehension, would turn capital now awaiting an opportunity\r\nfor investment into the channels of trade and industry. It would\r\nalleviate the present troubled condition of those States, and by\r\ninducing emigration aid in the settlement of fertile regions now\r\nuncultivated and lead to an increased production of those staples which\r\nhave added so greatly to the wealth of the nation and commerce of the\r\nworld. New fields of enterprise would be opened to our progressive\r\npeople, and soon the devastations of war would be repaired and all\r\ntraces of our domestic differences effaced from the minds of our\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\nIn our efforts to preserve \"the unity of government which constitutes\r\nus one people\" by restoring the States to the condition which they held\r\nprior to the rebellion, we should be cautious, lest, having rescued\r\nour nation from perils of threatened disintegration, we resort to\r\nconsolidation, and in the end absolute despotism, as a remedy for the\r\nrecurrence of similar troubles. The war having terminated, and with it\r\nall occasion for the exercise of powers of doubtful constitutionality,\r\nwe should hasten to bring legislation within the boundaries prescribed\r\nby the Constitution and to return to the ancient landmarks established\r\nby our fathers for the guidance of succeeding generations.\r\n\r\n  The constitution which at any time exists till changed by an explicit\r\n  and authentic act of the whole people is sacredly obligatory upon all.\r\n  * * * If in the opinion of the people the distribution or modification\r\n  of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be\r\n  corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution designates;\r\n  but let there be no change by usurpation, for * * * it is the customary\r\n  weapon by which free governments are destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington spoke these words to his countrymen when, followed by their\r\nlove and gratitude, he voluntarily retired from the cares of public\r\nlife. \"To keep in all things within the pale of our constitutional\r\npowers and cherish the Federal Union as the only rock of safety\" were\r\nprescribed by Jefferson as rules of action to endear to his \"countrymen\r\nthe true principles of their Constitution and promote a union of\r\nsentiment and action, equally auspicious to their happiness and safety.\"\r\nJackson held that the action of the General Government should always be\r\nstrictly confined to the sphere of its appropriate duties, and justly\r\nand forcibly urged that our Government is not to be maintained nor our\r\nUnion preserved \"by invasions of the rights and powers of the several\r\nStates. In thus attempting to make our General Government strong we make\r\nit weak. Its true strength consists in leaving individuals and States as\r\nmuch as possible to themselves; in making itself felt, not in its power,\r\nbut in its beneficence; not in its control, but in its protection; not\r\nin binding the States more closely to the center, but leaving each to\r\nmove unobstructed in its proper constitutional orbit.\" These are the\r\nteachings of men whose deeds and services have made them illustrious,\r\nand who, long since withdrawn from the scenes of life, have left to\r\ntheir country the rich legacy of their example, their wisdom, and their\r\npatriotism. Drawing fresh inspiration from their lessons, let us emulate\r\nthem in love of country and respect for the Constitution and the laws.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury affords much information\r\nrespecting the revenue and commerce of the country. His views upon\r\nthe currency and with reference to a proper adjustment of our revenue\r\nsystem, internal as well as impost, are commended to the careful\r\nconsideration of Congress. In my last annual message I expressed my\r\ngeneral views upon these subjects. I need now only call attention to the\r\nnecessity of carrying into every department of the Government a system\r\nof rigid accountability, thorough retrenchment, and wise economy.\r\nWith no exceptional nor unusual expenditures, the oppressive burdens of\r\ntaxation can be lessened by such a modification of our revenue laws as\r\nwill be consistent with the public faith and the legitimate and\r\nnecessary wants of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe report presents a much more satisfactory condition of our finances\r\nthan one year ago the most sanguine could have anticipated. During the\r\nfiscal year ending the 30th June, 1865 (the last year of the war), the\r\npublic debt was increased $941,902,537, and on the 31st of October,\r\n1865, it amounted to $2,740,854,750. On the 31st day of October, 1866,\r\nit had been reduced to $2,551,310,006, the diminution during a period of\r\nfourteen months, commencing September 1, 1865, and ending October 31,\r\n1866, having been $206,379,565. In the last annual report on the state\r\nof the finances it was estimated that during the three quarters of the\r\nfiscal year ending the 30th of June last the debt would be increased\r\n$112,194,947. During that period, however, it was reduced $31,196,387,\r\nthe receipts of the year having been $89,905,905 more and the\r\nexpenditures $200,529,235 less than the estimates. Nothing could more\r\nclearly indicate than these statements the extent and availability of\r\nthe national resources and the rapidity and safety with which, under\r\nour form of government, great military and naval establishments can be\r\ndisbanded and expenses reduced from a war to a peace footing.\r\n\r\nDuring the fiscal year ending June 30, 1866, the receipts were\r\n$558,032,620 and the expenditures $520,750,940, leaving an available\r\nsurplus of $37,281,680. It is estimated that the receipts for the fiscal\r\nyear ending the 30th June, 1867, will be $475,061,386, and that the\r\nexpenditures will reach the sum of $316,428,078, leaving in the Treasury\r\na surplus of $158,633,308. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1886, it\r\nis estimated that the receipts will amount to $436,000,000 and that the\r\nexpenditures will be $350,247,641, showing an excess of $85,752,359 in\r\nfavor of the Government. These estimated receipts may be diminished\r\nby a reduction of excise and import duties, but after all necessary\r\nreductions shall have been made the revenue of the present and of\r\nfollowing years will doubtless be sufficient to cover all legitimate\r\ncharges upon the Treasury and leave a large annual surplus to be applied\r\nto the payment of the principal of the debt. There seems now to be no\r\ngood reason why taxes may not be reduced as the country advances in\r\npopulation and wealth, and yet the debt be extinguished within the\r\nnext quarter of a century.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War furnishes valuable and important\r\ninformation in reference to the operations of his Department during the\r\npast year. Few volunteers now remain in the service, and they are being\r\ndischarged as rapidly as they can be replaced by regular troops. The\r\nArmy has been promptly paid, carefully provided with medical treatment,\r\nwell sheltered and subsisted, and is to be furnished with breech-loading\r\nsmall arms. The military strength of the nation has been unimpaired\r\nby the discharge of volunteers, the disposition of unserviceable or\r\nperishable stores, and the retrenchment of expenditure. Sufficient war\r\nmaterial to meet any emergency has been retained, and from the disbanded\r\nvolunteers standing ready to respond to the national call large armies\r\ncan be rapidly organized, equipped, and concentrated. Fortifications on\r\nthe coast and frontier have received or are being prepared for more\r\npowerful armaments; lake surveys and harbor and river improvements are\r\nin course of energetic prosecution. Preparations have been made for the\r\npayment of the additional bounties authorized during the recent session\r\nof Congress, under such regulations as will protect the Government from\r\nfraud and secure to the honorably discharged soldier the well-earned\r\nreward of his faithfulness and gallantry. More than 6,000 maimed\r\nsoldiers have received artificial limbs or other surgical apparatus,\r\nand 41 national cemeteries, containing the remains of 104,526 Union\r\nsoldiers, have already been established. The total estimate of military\r\nappropriations is $25,205,669.\r\n\r\nIt is stated in the report of the Secretary of the Navy that the naval\r\nforce at this time consists of 278 vessels, armed with 2,351 guns. Of\r\nthese, 115 vessels, carrying 1,029 guns, are in commission, distributed\r\nchiefly among seven squadrons. The number of men in the service is\r\n13,600. Great activity and vigilance have been displayed by all the\r\nsquadrons, and their movements have been judiciously and efficiently\r\narranged in such manner as would best promote American commerce and\r\nprotect the rights and interests of our countrymen abroad. The vessels\r\nunemployed are undergoing repairs or are laid up until their services\r\nmay be required. Most of the ironclad fleet is at League Island, in the\r\nvicinity of Philadelphia, a place which, until decisive action should be\r\ntaken by Congress, was selected by the Secretary of the Navy as the most\r\neligible location for that class of vessels. It is important that a\r\nsuitable public station should be provided for the ironclad fleet.\r\nIt is intended that these vessels shall be in proper condition for any\r\nemergency, and it is desirable that the bill accepting League Island for\r\nnaval purposes, which passed the House of Representatives at its last\r\nsession, should receive final action at an early period, in order that\r\nthere may be a suitable public station for this class of vessels, as\r\nwell as a navy-yard of area sufficient for the wants of the service\r\non the Delaware River. The naval pension fund amounts to $11,750,000,\r\nhaving been increased $2,750,000 during the year. The expenditures\r\nof the Department for the fiscal year ending 30th June last were\r\n$43,324,526, and the estimates for the coming year amount to\r\n$23,568,436. Attention is invited to the condition of our seamen and the\r\nimportance of legislative measures for their relief and improvement. The\r\nsuggestions in behalf of this deserving class of our fellow-citizens are\r\nearnestly recommended to the favorable attention of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General presents a most satisfactory\r\ncondition of the postal service and submits recommendations which\r\ndeserve the consideration of Congress. The revenues of the Department\r\nfor the year ending June 30, 1866, were $14,386,986 and the expenditures\r\n$15,352,079, showing an excess of the latter of $965,093. In\r\nanticipation of this deficiency, however, a special appropriation was\r\nmade by Congress in the act approved July 28, 1866. Including the\r\nstanding appropriation of $700,000 for free mail matter as a legitimate\r\nportion of the revenues, yet remaining unexpended, the actual deficiency\r\nfor the past year is only $265,093--a sum within $51,141 of the amount\r\nestimated in the annual report of 1864. The decrease of revenue compared\r\nwith the previous year was 1-1/5 per cent, and the increase of\r\nexpenditures, owing principally to the enlargement of the mail service\r\nin the South, was 12 per cent. On the 30th of June last there were in\r\noperation 6,930 mail routes, with an aggregate length of 180,921 miles,\r\nan aggregate annual transportation of 71,837,914 miles, and an aggregate\r\nannual cost, including all expenditures, of $8,410,184. The length of\r\nrailroad routes is 32,092 miles and the annual transportation 30,609,467\r\nmiles. The length of steamboat routes is 14,346 miles and the annual\r\ntransportation 3,411,962 miles. The mail service is rapidly increasing\r\nthroughout the whole country, and its steady extension in the Southern\r\nStates indicates their constantly improving condition. The growing\r\nimportance of the foreign service also merits attention. The post-office\r\ndepartment of Great Britain and our own have agreed upon a preliminary\r\nbasis for a new postal convention, which it is believed will prove\r\neminently beneficial to the commercial interests of the United States,\r\ninasmuch as it contemplates a reduction of the international letter\r\npostage to one-half the existing rates; a reduction of postage with\r\nall other countries to and from which correspondence is transmitted\r\nin the British mail, or in closed mails through the United Kingdom;\r\nthe establishment of uniform and reasonable charges for the sea\r\nand territorial transit of correspondence in closed mails; and an\r\nallowance to each post-office department of the right to use all mail\r\ncommunications established under the authority of the other for the\r\ndispatch of correspondence, either in open or closed mails, on the same\r\nterms as those applicable to the inhabitants of the country providing\r\nthe means of transmission.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior exhibits the condition\r\nof those branches of the public service which are committed to his\r\nsupervision. During the last fiscal year 4,629,312 acres of public\r\nland were disposed of, 1,892,516 acres of which were entered under the\r\nhomestead act. The policy originally adopted relative to the public\r\nlands has undergone essential modifications. Immediate revenue, and not\r\ntheir rapid settlement, was the cardinal feature of our land system.\r\nLong experience and earnest discussion have resulted in the conviction\r\nthat the early development of our agricultural resources and the\r\ndiffusion of an energetic population over our vast territory are objects\r\nof far greater importance to the national growth and prosperity than the\r\nproceeds of the sale of the land to the highest bidder in open market.\r\nThe preemption laws confer upon the pioneer who complies with the terms\r\nthey impose the privilege of purchasing a limited portion of \"unoffered\r\nlands\" at the minimum price. The homestead enactments relieve the\r\nsettler from the payment of purchase money, and secure him a permanent\r\nhome upon the condition of residence for a term of years. This liberal\r\npolicy invites emigration from the Old and from the more crowded\r\nportions of the New World. Its propitious results are undoubted, and\r\nwill be more signally manifested when time shall have given to it a\r\nwider development.\r\n\r\nCongress has made liberal grants of public land to corporations in\r\naid of the construction of railroads and other internal improvements.\r\nShould this policy hereafter prevail, more stringent provisions will\r\nbe required to secure a faithful application of the fund. The title to\r\nthe lands should not pass, by patent or otherwise, but remain in the\r\nGovernment and subject to its control until some portion of the road has\r\nbeen actually built. Portions of them might then from time to time be\r\nconveyed to the corporation, but never in a greater ratio to the whole\r\nquantity embraced by the grant than the completed parts bear to the\r\nentire length of the projected improvement. This restriction would not\r\noperate to the prejudice of any undertaking conceived in good faith\r\nand executed with reasonable energy, as it is the settled practice to\r\nwithdraw from market the lands falling within the operation of such\r\ngrants, and thus to exclude the inception of a subsequent adverse right.\r\nA breach of the conditions which Congress may deem proper to impose\r\nshould work a forfeiture of claim to the lands so withdrawn but\r\nunconveyed, and of title to the lands conveyed which remain unsold.\r\n\r\nOperations on the several lines of the Pacific Railroad have been\r\nprosecuted with unexampled vigor and success. Should no unforeseen\r\ncauses of delay occur, it is confidently anticipated that this great\r\nthoroughfare will be completed before the expiration of the period\r\ndesignated by Congress.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fiscal year the amount paid to pensioners, including the\r\nexpenses of disbursement, was $13,459,996, and 50,177 names were added\r\nto the pension rolls. The entire number of pensioners June 30, 1866,\r\nwas 126,722. This fact furnishes melancholy and striking proof of\r\nthe sacrifices made to vindicate the constitutional authority of the\r\nFederal Government and to maintain inviolate the integrity of the Union.\r\nThey impose upon us corresponding obligations. It is estimated that\r\n$33,000,000 will be required to meet the exigencies of this branch of\r\nthe service during the next fiscal year.\r\n\r\nTreaties have been concluded with the Indians, who, enticed into armed\r\nopposition to our Government at the outbreak of the rebellion, have\r\nunconditionally submitted to our authority and manifested an earnest\r\ndesire for a renewal of friendly relations.\r\n\r\nDuring the year ending September 30, 1866, 8,716 patents for useful\r\ninventions and designs were issued, and at that date the balance in\r\nthe Treasury to the credit of the patent fund was $228,297.\r\n\r\nAs a subject upon which depends an immense amount of the production and\r\ncommerce of the country, I recommend to Congress such legislation as\r\nmay be necessary for the preservation of the levees of the Mississippi\r\nRiver. It is a matter of national importance that early steps should\r\nbe taken, not only to add to the efficiency of these barriers against\r\ndestructive inundations, but for the removal of all obstructions to the\r\nfree and safe navigation of that great channel of trade and commerce.\r\n\r\nThe District of Columbia under existing laws is not entitled to that\r\nrepresentation in the national councils which from our earliest history\r\nhas been uniformly accorded to each Territory established from time to\r\ntime within our limits. It maintains peculiar relations to Congress, to\r\nwhom the Constitution has granted the power of exercising exclusive\r\nlegislation over the seat of Government. Our fellow-citizens residing\r\nin the District, whose interests are thus confided to the special\r\nguardianship of Congress, exceed in number the population of several of\r\nour Territories, and no just reason is perceived why a Delegate of their\r\nchoice should not be admitted to a seat in the House of Representatives.\r\nNo mode seems so appropriate and effectual of enabling them to make\r\nknown their peculiar condition and wants and of securing the local\r\nlegislation adapted to them. I therefore recommend the passage of a\r\nlaw authorizing the electors of the District of Columbia to choose a\r\nDelegate, to be allowed the same rights and privileges as a Delegate\r\nrepresenting a Territory. The increasing enterprise and rapid progress\r\nof improvement in the District are highly gratifying, and I trust that\r\nthe efforts of the municipal authorities to promote the prosperity of\r\nthe national metropolis will receive the efficient and generous\r\ncooperation of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioner of Agriculture reviews the operations of\r\nhis Department during the past year, and asks the aid of Congress in\r\nits efforts to encourage those States which, scourged by war, are now\r\nearnestly engaged in the reorganization of domestic industry.\r\n\r\nIt is a subject of congratulation that no foreign combinations\r\nagainst our domestic peace and safety or our legitimate influence\r\namong the nations have been formed or attempted. While sentiments of\r\nreconciliation, loyalty, and patriotism have increased at home, a more\r\njust consideration of our national character and rights has been\r\nmanifested by foreign nations.\r\n\r\nThe entire success of the Atlantic telegraph between the coast of\r\nIreland and the Province of Newfoundland is an achievement which has\r\nbeen justly celebrated in both hemispheres as the opening of an era in\r\nthe progress of civilization. There is reason to expect that equal\r\nsuccess will attend and even greater results follow the enterprise for\r\nconnecting the two continents through the Pacific Ocean by the projected\r\nline of telegraph between Kamchatka and the Russian possessions in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe resolution of Congress protesting against pardons by foreign\r\ngovernments of persons convicted of infamous offenses on condition of\r\nemigration to our country has been communicated to the states with which\r\nwe maintain intercourse, and the practice, so justly the subject of\r\ncomplaint on our part, has not been renewed.\r\n\r\nThe congratulations of Congress to the Emperor of Russia upon his escape\r\nfrom attempted assassination have been presented to that humane and\r\nenlightened ruler and received by him with expressions of grateful\r\nappreciation.\r\n\r\nThe Executive, warned of an attempt by Spanish American adventurers to\r\ninduce the emigration of freedmen of the United States to a foreign\r\ncountry, protested against the project as one which, if consummated,\r\nwould reduce them to a bondage even more oppressive than that from\r\nwhich they have just been relieved. Assurance has been received from\r\nthe Government of the State in which the plan was matured that the\r\nproceeding will meet neither its encouragement nor approval. It is\r\na question worthy of your consideration whether our laws upon this\r\nsubject are adequate to the prevention or punishment of the crime\r\nthus meditated.\r\n\r\nIn the month of April last, as Congress is aware, a friendly\r\narrangement was made between the Emperor of France and the President\r\nof the United States for the withdrawal from Mexico of the French\r\nexpeditionary military forces. This withdrawal was to be effected in\r\nthree detachments, the first of which, it was understood, would leave\r\nMexico in November, now past, the second in March next, and the third\r\nand last in November, 1867. Immediately upon the completion of the\r\nevacuation the French Government was to assume the same attitude of\r\nnonintervention in regard to Mexico as is held by the Government of the\r\nUnited States. Repeated assurances have been given by the Emperor since\r\nthat agreement that he would complete the promised evacuation within\r\nthe period mentioned, or sooner.\r\n\r\nIt was reasonably expected that the proceedings thus contemplated would\r\nproduce a crisis of great political interest in the Republic of Mexico.\r\nThe newly appointed minister of the United States, Mr. Campbell, was\r\ntherefore sent forward on the 9th day of November last to assume his\r\nproper functions as minister plenipotentiary of the United States to\r\nthat Republic. It was also thought expedient that he should be attended\r\nin the vicinity of Mexico by the Lieutenant-General of the Army of the\r\nUnited States, with the view of obtaining such information as might be\r\nimportant to determine the course to be pursued by the United States in\r\nreestablishing and maintaining necessary and proper intercourse with the\r\nRepublic of Mexico. Deeply interested in the cause of liberty and\r\nhumanity, it seemed an obvious duty on our part to exercise whatever\r\ninfluence we possessed for the restoration and permanent establishment\r\nin that country of a domestic and republican form of government.\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of our affairs in regard to Mexico when, on the\r\n22d of November last, official information was received from Paris that\r\nthe Emperor of France had some time before decided not to withdraw a\r\ndetachment of his forces in the month of November past, according to\r\nengagement, but that this decision was made with the purpose of\r\nwithdrawing the whole of those forces in the ensuing spring. Of this\r\ndetermination, however, the United States had not received any notice\r\nor intimation, and so soon as the information was received by the\r\nGovernment care was taken to make known its dissent to the Emperor of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nI can not forego the hope that France will reconsider the subject and\r\nadopt some resolution in regard to the evacuation of Mexico which will\r\nconform as nearly as practicable with the existing engagement, and thus\r\nmeet the just expectations of the United States. The papers relating\r\nto the subject will be laid before you. It is believed that with the\r\nevacuation of Mexico by the expeditionary forces no subject for serious\r\ndifferences between France and the United States would remain. The\r\nexpressions of the Emperor and people of France warrant a hope that the\r\ntraditionary friendship between the two countries might in that case be\r\nrenewed and permanently restored.\r\n\r\nA claim of a citizen of the United States for indemnity for spoliations\r\ncommitted on the high seas by the French authorities in the exercise of\r\na belligerent power against Mexico has been met by the Government of\r\nFrance with a proposition to defer settlement until a mutual convention\r\nfor the adjustment of all claims of citizens and subjects of both\r\ncountries arising out of the recent wars on this continent shall\r\nbe agreed upon by the two countries. The suggestion is not deemed\r\nunreasonable, but it belongs to Congress to direct the manner in which\r\nclaims for indemnity by foreigners as well as by citizens of the United\r\nStates arising out of the late civil war shall be adjudicated and\r\ndetermined. I have no doubt that the subject of all such claims will\r\nengage your attention at a convenient and proper time.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of regret that no considerable advance has been made\r\ntoward an adjustment of the differences between the United States and\r\nGreat Britain arising out of the depredations upon our national commerce\r\nand other trespasses committed during our civil war by British subjects,\r\nin violation of international law and treaty obligations. The delay,\r\nhowever, may be believed to have resulted in no small degree from the\r\ndomestic situation of Great Britain. An entire change of ministry\r\noccurred in that country during the last session of Parliament. The\r\nattention of the new ministry was called to the subject at an early day,\r\nand there is some reason to expect that it will now be considered in a\r\nbecoming and friendly spirit. The importance of an early disposition of\r\nthe question can not be exaggerated. Whatever might be the wishes of the\r\ntwo Governments, it is manifest that good will and friendship between\r\nthe two countries can not be established until a reciprocity in the\r\npractice of good faith and neutrality shall be restored between the\r\nrespective nations.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of June last, in violation of our neutrality laws, a military\r\nexpedition and enterprise against the British North American colonies\r\nwas projected and attempted to be carried on within the territory and\r\njurisdiction of the United States. In obedience to the obligation\r\nimposed upon the Executive by the Constitution to see that the laws are\r\nfaithfully executed, all citizens were warned by proclamation against\r\ntaking part in or aiding such unlawful proceedings, and the proper\r\ncivil, military, and naval officers were directed to take all necessary\r\nmeasures for the enforcement of the laws. The expedition failed, but it\r\nhas not been without its painful consequences. Some of our citizens who,\r\nit was alleged, were engaged in the expedition were captured, and have\r\nbeen brought to trial as for a capital offense in the Province of\r\nCanada. Judgment and sentence of death have been pronounced against\r\nsome, while others have been acquitted. Fully believing in the maxim of\r\ngovernment that severity of civil punishment for misguided persons who\r\nhave engaged in revolutionary attempts which have disastrously failed is\r\nunsound and unwise, such representations have been made to the British\r\nGovernment in behalf of the convicted persons as, being sustained by\r\nan enlightened and humane judgment, will, it is hoped, induce in their\r\ncases an exercise of clemency and a judicious amnesty to all who were\r\nengaged in the movement. Counsel has been employed by the Government to\r\ndefend citizens of the United States on trial for capital offenses in\r\nCanada, and a discontinuance of the prosecutions which were instituted\r\nin the courts of the United States against those who took part in the\r\nexpedition has been directed.\r\n\r\nI have regarded the expedition as not only political in its nature, but\r\nas also in a great measure foreign from the United States in its causes,\r\ncharacter, and objects. The attempt was understood to be made in\r\nsympathy with an insurgent party in Ireland, and by striking at a\r\nBritish Province on this continent was designed to aid in obtaining\r\nredress for political grievances which, it was assumed, the people of\r\nIreland had suffered at the hands of the British Government during a\r\nperiod of several centuries. The persons engaged in it were chiefly\r\nnatives of that country, some of whom had, while others had not, become\r\ncitizens of the United States under our general laws of naturalization.\r\nComplaints of misgovernment in Ireland continually engage the attention\r\nof the British nation, and so great an agitation is now prevailing in\r\nIreland that the British Government have deemed it necessary to suspend\r\nthe writ of _habeas corpus_ in that country. These circumstances must\r\nnecessarily modify the opinion which we might otherwise have entertained\r\nin regard to an expedition expressly prohibited by our neutrality laws.\r\nSo long as those laws remain upon our statute books they should be\r\nfaithfully executed, and if they operate harshly, unjustly, or\r\noppressively Congress alone can apply the remedy by their modification\r\nor repeal.\r\n\r\nPolitical and commercial interests of the United States are not unlikely\r\nto be affected in some degree by events which are transpiring in the\r\neastern regions of Europe, and the time seems to have come when our\r\nGovernment ought to have a proper diplomatic representation in Greece.\r\n\r\nThis Government has claimed for all persons not convicted or accused or\r\nsuspected of crime an absolute political right of self-expatriation and\r\na choice of new national allegiance. Most of the European States have\r\ndissented from this principle, and have claimed a right to hold such of\r\ntheir subjects as have emigrated to and been naturalized in the United\r\nStates and afterwards returned on transient visits to their native\r\ncountries to the performance of military service in like manner as\r\nresident subjects. Complaints arising from the claim in this respect\r\nmade by foreign states have heretofore been matters of controversy\r\nbetween the United States and some of the European powers, and the\r\nirritation consequent upon the failure to settle this question increased\r\nduring the war in which Prussia, Italy, and Austria were recently\r\nengaged. While Great Britain has never acknowledged the right of\r\nexpatriation, she has not for some years past practically insisted\r\nupon the opposite doctrine. France has been equally forbearing, and\r\nPrussia has proposed a compromise, which, although evincing increased\r\nliberality, has not been accepted by the United States. Peace is now\r\nprevailing everywhere in Europe, and the present seems to be a favorable\r\ntime for an assertion by Congress of the principle so long maintained by\r\nthe executive department that naturalization by one state fully exempts\r\nthe native-born subject of any other state from the performance of\r\nmilitary service under any foreign government, so long as he does not\r\nvoluntarily renounce its rights and benefits.\r\n\r\nIn the performance of a duty imposed upon me by the Constitution\r\nI have thus submitted to the representatives of the States and of the\r\npeople such information of our domestic and foreign affairs as the\r\npublic interests seem to require. Our Government is now undergoing its\r\nmost trying ordeal, and my earnest prayer is that the peril may be\r\nsuccessfully and finally passed without impairing its original strength\r\nand symmetry. The interests of the nation are best to be promoted by the\r\nrevival of fraternal relations, the complete obliteration of our past\r\ndifferences, and the reinauguration of all the pursuits of peace.\r\nDirecting our efforts to the early accomplishment of these great\r\nends, let us endeavor to preserve harmony between the coordinate\r\ndepartments of the Government, that each in its proper sphere may\r\ncordially cooperate with the other in securing the maintenance of\r\nthe Constitution, the preservation of the Union, and the perpetuity\r\nof our free institutions.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 8, 1866_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn reply to a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 5th\r\ninstant, inquiring if any portion of Mexican territory has been occupied\r\nby United States troops, I transmit the accompanying report upon the\r\nsubject from the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 8, 1866_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to communicate a report of the Secretary of State\r\nrelating to the discovery and arrest of John H.

Those provisions are\r\ncontained in the second section, which in certain cases virtually\r\ndeprives the President of his constitutional functions as Commander in\r\nChief of the Army, and in the sixth section, which denies to ten States\r\nof this Union their constitutional right to protect themselves in any\r\nemergency by means of their own militia. Those provisions are out of\r\nplace in an appropriation act. I am compelled to defeat these necessary\r\nappropriations if I withhold my signature to the act. Pressed by these\r\nconsiderations, I feel constrained to return the bill with my signature,\r\nbut to accompany it with my protest against the sections which I have\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 5, 1867_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have received and considered a bill entitled \"An act to regulate the\r\nelective franchise in the District of Columbia,\" passed by the Senate\r\non the 13th of December and by the House of Representatives on the\r\nsucceeding day. It was presented for my approval on the 26th ultimo--six\r\ndays after the adjournment of Congress--and is now returned with my\r\nobjections to the Senate, in which House it originated.\r\n\r\nMeasures having been introduced at the commencement of the first session\r\nof the present Congress for the extension of the elective franchise to\r\npersons of color in the District of Columbia, steps were taken by the\r\ncorporate authorities of Washington and Georgetown to ascertain and make\r\nknown the opinion of the people of the two cities upon a subject so\r\nimmediately affecting their welfare as a community. The question was\r\nsubmitted to the people at special elections held in the month of\r\nDecember, 1865, when the qualified voters of Washington and Georgetown,\r\nwith great unanimity of sentiment, expressed themselves opposed to\r\nthe contemplated legislation. In Washington, in a vote of 6,556--the\r\nlargest, with but two exceptions, ever polled in that city--only\r\nthirty-five ballots were cast for negro suffrage, while in Georgetown,\r\nin an aggregate of 813 votes--a number considerably in excess of the\r\naverage vote at the four preceding annual elections--but one was given\r\nin favor of the proposed extension of the elective franchise. As these\r\nelections seem to have been conducted with entire fairness, the result\r\nmust be accepted as a truthful expression of the opinion of the people\r\nof the District upon the question which evoked it. Possessing, as an\r\norganized community, the same popular right as the inhabitants of a\r\nState or Territory to make known their will upon matters which affect\r\ntheir social and political condition, they could have selected no more\r\nappropriate mode of memorializing Congress upon the subject of this\r\nbill than through the suffrages of their qualified voters.\r\n\r\nEntirely disregarding the wishes of the people of the District of\r\nColumbia, Congress has deemed it right and expedient to pass the measure\r\nnow submitted for my signature. It therefore becomes the duty of the\r\nExecutive, standing between the legislation of the one and the will of\r\nthe other, fairly expressed, to determine whether he should approve the\r\nbill, and thus aid in placing upon the statute books of the nation a law\r\nagainst which the people to whom it is to apply have solemnly and with\r\nsuch unanimity protested, or whether he should return it with his\r\nobjections in the hope that upon reconsideration Congress, acting as\r\nthe representatives of the inhabitants of the seat of Government, will\r\npermit them to regulate a purely local question as to them may seem best\r\nsuited to their interests and condition.\r\n\r\nThe District of Columbia was ceded to the United States by Maryland and\r\nVirginia in order that it might become the permanent seat of Government\r\nof the United States. Accepted by Congress, it at once became subject to\r\nthe \"exclusive legislation\" for which provision is made in the Federal\r\nConstitution. It should be borne in mind, however, that in exercising\r\nits functions as the lawmaking power of the District of Columbia the\r\nauthority of the National Legislature is not without limit, but that\r\nCongress is bound to observe the letter and spirit of the Constitution\r\nas well in the enactment of local laws for the seat of Government as\r\nin legislation common to the entire Union. Were it to be admitted that\r\nthe right \"to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever\"\r\nconferred upon Congress unlimited power within the District of Columbia,\r\ntitles of nobility might be granted within its boundaries; laws might be\r\nmade \"respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free\r\nexercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press,\r\nor the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the\r\nGovernment for a redress of grievances.\" Despotism would thus reign at\r\nthe seat of government of a free republic, and as a place of permanent\r\nresidence it would be avoided by all who prefer the blessings of liberty\r\nto the mere emoluments of official position.\r\n\r\nIt should also be remembered that in legislating for the District of\r\nColumbia under the Federal Constitution the relation of Congress to\r\nits inhabitants is analogous to that of a legislature to the people\r\nof a State under their own local constitution. It does not, therefore,\r\nseem to be asking too much that in matters pertaining to the District\r\nCongress should have a like respect for the will and interest of its\r\ninhabitants as is entertained by a State legislature for the wishes\r\nand prosperity of those for whom they legislate. The spirit of our\r\nConstitution and the genius of our Government require that in regard to\r\nany law which is to affect and have a permanent bearing upon a people\r\ntheir will should exert at least a reasonable influence upon those who\r\nare acting in the capacity of their legislators. Would, for instance,\r\nthe legislature of the State of New York, or of Pennsylvania, or of\r\nIndiana, or of any State in the Union, in opposition to the expressed\r\nwill of a large majority of the people whom they were chosen to\r\nrepresent, arbitrarily force upon them as voters all persons of the\r\nAfrican or negro race and make them eligible for office without any\r\nother qualification than a certain term of residence within the State?\r\nIn neither of the States named would the colored population, when acting\r\ntogether, be able to produce any great social or political result.\r\nYet in New York, before he can vote, the man of color must fulfill\r\nconditions that are not required of the white citizen; in Pennsylvania\r\nthe elective franchise is restricted to white freemen, while in Indiana\r\nnegroes and mulattoes are expressly excluded from the right of suffrage.\r\nIt hardly seems consistent with the principles of right and justice that\r\nrepresentatives of States where suffrage is either denied the colored\r\nman or granted to him on qualifications requiring intelligence or\r\nproperty should compel the people of the District of Columbia to\r\ntry an experiment which their own constituents have thus far shown\r\nan unwillingness to test for themselves. Nor does it accord with our\r\nrepublican ideas that the principle of self-government should lose its\r\nforce when applied to the residents of the District merely because their\r\nlegislators are not, like those of the States, responsible through the\r\nballot to the people for whom they are the lawmaking power.\r\n\r\nThe great object of placing the seat of Government under the exclusive\r\nlegislation of Congress was to secure the entire independence of the\r\nGeneral Government from undue State influence and to enable it to\r\ndischarge without danger of interruption or infringement of its\r\nauthority the high functions for which it was created by the people.\r\nFor this important purpose it was ceded to the United States by Maryland\r\nand Virginia, and it certainly never could have been contemplated\r\nas one of the objects to be attained by placing it under the exclusive\r\njurisdiction of Congress that it would afford to propagandists or\r\npolitical parties a place for an experimental test of their principles\r\nand theories. While, indeed, the residents of the seat of Government are\r\nnot citizens of any State and are not, therefore, allowed a voice in the\r\nelectoral college or representation in the councils of the nation, they\r\nare, nevertheless, American citizens, entitled as such to every guaranty\r\nof the Constitution, to every benefit of the laws, and to every right\r\nwhich pertains to citizens of our common country. In all matters, then,\r\naffecting their domestic affairs, the spirit of our democratic form of\r\ngovernment demands that their wishes should be consulted and respected\r\nand they taught to feel that although not permitted practically to\r\nparticipate in national concerns, they are, nevertheless, under a\r\npaternal government regardful of their rights, mindful of their wants,\r\nand solicitous for their prosperity. It was evidently contemplated that\r\nall local questions would be left to their decision, at least to an\r\nextent that would not be incompatible with the object for which Congress\r\nwas granted exclusive legislation over the seat of Government. When the\r\nConstitution was yet under consideration, it was assumed by Mr. Madison\r\nthat its inhabitants would be allowed \"a municipal legislature for local\r\npurposes, derived from their own suffrages.\" When for the first time\r\nCongress, in the year 1800, assembled at Washington, President Adams, in\r\nhis speech at its opening, reminded the two Houses that it was for them\r\nto consider whether the local powers over the District of Columbia,\r\nvested by the Constitution in the Congress of the United States, should\r\nbe immediately exercised, and he asked them to \"consider it as the\r\ncapital of a great nation, advancing with unexampled rapidity in arts,\r\nin commerce, in wealth, and in population, and possessing within itself\r\nthose resources which, if not thrown away or lamentably misdirected,\r\nwould secure to it a long course of prosperity and self-government.\"\r\nThree years had not elapsed when Congress was called upon to determine\r\nthe propriety of retroceding to Maryland and Virginia the jurisdiction\r\nof the territory which they had respectively relinquished to the\r\nGovernment of the United States. It was urged on the one hand that\r\nexclusive jurisdiction was not necessary or useful to the Government;\r\nthat it deprived the inhabitants of the District of their political\r\nrights; that much of the time of Congress was consumed in legislation\r\npertaining to it; that its government was expensive; that Congress was\r\nnot competent to legislate for the District, because the members were\r\nstrangers to its local concerns; and that it was an example of a\r\ngovernment without representation--an experiment dangerous to the\r\nliberties of the States. On the other hand it was held, among other\r\nreasons, and successfully, that the Constitution, the acts of cession\r\nof Virginia and Maryland, and the act of Congress accepting the grant\r\nall contemplated the exercise of exclusive legislation by Congress,\r\nand that its usefulness, if not its necessity, was inferred from the\r\ninconvenience which was felt for want of it by the Congress of the\r\nConfederation; that the people themselves, who, it was said, had been\r\ndeprived of their political rights, had not complained and did not\r\ndesire a retrocession; that the evil might be remedied by giving them a\r\nrepresentation in Congress when the District should become sufficiently\r\npopulous, and in the meantime a local legislature; that if the\r\ninhabitants had not political rights they had great political influence;\r\nthat the trouble and expense of legislating for the District would not\r\nbe great, but would diminish, and might in a great measure be avoided\r\nby a local legislature; and that Congress could not retrocede the\r\ninhabitants without their consent. Continuing to live substantially\r\nunder the laws that existed at the time of the cession, and such changes\r\nonly having been made as were suggested by themselves, the people of the\r\nDistrict have not sought by a local legislature that which has generally\r\nbeen willingly conceded by the Congress of the nation.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule sound policy requires that the legislature should\r\nyield to the wishes of a people, when not inconsistent with the\r\nconstitution and the laws. The measures suited to one community might\r\nnot be well adapted to the condition of another; and the persons best\r\nqualified to determine such questions are those whose interests are\r\nto be directly affected by any proposed law. In Massachusetts, for\r\ninstance, male persons are allowed to vote without regard to color,\r\nprovided they possess a certain degree of intelligence. In a population\r\nin that State of 1,231,066 there were, by the census of 1860, only 9,602\r\npersons of color, and of the males over 20 years of age there were\r\n339,086 white to 2,602 colored. By the same official enumeration there\r\nwere in the District of Columbia 60,764 whites to 14,316 persons of the\r\ncolored race. Since then, however, the population of the District has\r\nlargely increased, and it is estimated that at the present time there\r\nare nearly 100,000 whites to 30,000 negroes. The cause of the augmented\r\nnumbers of the latter class needs no explanation. Contiguous to Maryland\r\nand Virginia, the District during the war became a place of refuge for\r\nthose who escaped from servitude, and it is yet the abiding place of a\r\nconsiderable proportion of those who sought within its limits a shelter\r\nfrom bondage. Until then held in slavery and denied all opportunities\r\nfor mental culture, their first knowledge of the Government was acquired\r\nwhen, by conferring upon them freedom, it became the benefactor of their\r\nrace. The test of their capability for improvement began when for the\r\nfirst time the career of free industry and the avenues to intelligence\r\nwere opened to them. Possessing these advantages but a limited time--the\r\ngreater number perhaps having entered the District of Columbia during\r\nthe later years of the war, or since its termination--we may well\r\npause to inquire whether, after so brief a probation, they are as a\r\nclass capable of an intelligent exercise of the right of suffrage and\r\nqualified to discharge the duties of official position. The people\r\nwho are daily witnesses of their mode of living, and who have become\r\nfamiliar with their habits of thought, have expressed the conviction\r\nthat they are not yet competent to serve as electors, and thus become\r\neligible for office in the local governments under which they live.\r\nClothed with the elective franchise, their numbers, already largely in\r\nexcess of the demand for labor, would be soon increased by an influx\r\nfrom the adjoining States. Drawn from fields where employment is\r\nabundant, they would in vain seek it here, and so add to the\r\nembarrassments already experienced from the large class of idle persons\r\ncongregated in the District. Hardly yet capable of forming correct\r\njudgments upon the important questions that often make the issues\r\nof a political contest, they could readily be made subservient to the\r\npurposes of designing persons. While in Massachusetts, under the census\r\nof 1860, the proportion of white to colored males over 20 years of age\r\nwas 130 to 1, here the black race constitutes nearly one-third of the\r\nentire population, whilst the same class surrounds the District on all\r\nsides, ready to change their residence at a moment's notice, and with\r\nall the facility of a nomadic people, in order to enjoy here, after a\r\nshort residence, a privilege they find nowhere else. It is within their\r\npower in one year to come into the District in such numbers as to have\r\nthe supreme control of the white race, and to govern them by their own\r\nofficers and by the exercise of all the municipal authority--among\r\nthe rest, of the power of taxation over property in which they have\r\nno interest. In Massachusetts, where they have enjoyed the benefits\r\nof a thorough educational system, a qualification of intelligence\r\nis required, while here suffrage is extended to all without\r\ndiscrimination--as well to the most incapable who can prove a\r\nresidence in the District of one year as to those persons of color who,\r\ncomparatively few in number, are permanent inhabitants, and, having\r\ngiven evidence of merit and qualification, are recognized as useful and\r\nresponsible members of the community. Imposed upon an unwilling people\r\nplaced by the Constitution under the exclusive legislation of Congress,\r\nit would be viewed as an arbitrary exercise of power and as an\r\nindication by the country of the purpose of Congress to compel the\r\nacceptance of negro suffrage by the States. It would engender a feeling\r\nof opposition and hatred between the two races, which, becoming deep\r\nrooted and ineradicable, would prevent them from living together in\r\na state of mutual friendliness. Carefully avoiding every measure that\r\nmight tend to produce such a result, and following the clear and\r\nwell-ascertained popular will, we should assiduously endeavor to promote\r\nkindly relations between them, and thus, when that popular will leads\r\nthe way, prepare for the gradual and harmonious introduction of this\r\nnew element into the political power of the country.\r\n\r\nIt can not be urged that the proposed extension of suffrage in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia is necessary to enable persons of color to protect\r\neither their interests or their rights. They stand here precisely as\r\nthey stand in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana. Here as elsewhere, in all\r\nthat pertains to civil rights, there is nothing to distinguish this\r\nclass of persons from citizens of the United States, for they possess\r\nthe \"full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security\r\nof person and property as is enjoyed by white citizens,\" and are made\r\n\"subject to like punishment, pains, and penalties, and to none other,\r\nany law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding.\" Nor, as has been assumed, are their suffrages\r\nnecessary to aid a loyal sentiment here, for local governments already\r\nexist of undoubted fealty to the Government, and are sustained by\r\ncommunities which were among the first to testify their devotion to the\r\nUnion, and which during the struggle furnished their full quotas of men\r\nto the military service of the country.\r\n\r\nThe exercise of the elective franchise is the highest attribute of an\r\nAmerican citizen, and when guided by virtue, intelligence, patriotism,\r\nand a proper appreciation of our institutions constitutes the true basis\r\nof a democratic form of government, in which the sovereign power is\r\nlodged in the body of the people. Its influence for good necessarily\r\ndepends upon the elevated character and patriotism of the elector, for\r\nif exercised by persons who do not justly estimate its value and who are\r\nindifferent as to its results it will only serve as a means of placing\r\npower in the hands of the unprincipled and ambitious, and must eventuate\r\nin the complete destruction of that liberty of which it should be the\r\nmost powerful conservator. Great danger is therefore to be apprehended\r\nfrom an untimely extension of the elective franchise to any new class\r\nin our country, especially when the large majority of that class, in\r\nwielding the power thus placed in their hands, can not be expected\r\ncorrectly to comprehend the duties and responsibilities which pertain\r\nto suffrage. Yesterday, as it were, 4,000,000 persons were held in a\r\ncondition of slavery that had existed for generations; to-day they are\r\nfreemen and are assumed by law to be citizens. It can not be presumed,\r\nfrom their previous condition of servitude, that as a class they are as\r\nwell informed as to the nature of our Government as the intelligent\r\nforeigner who makes our land the home of his choice. In the case of\r\nthe latter neither a residence of five years and the knowledge of our\r\ninstitutions which it gives nor attachment to the principles of the\r\nConstitution are the only conditions upon which he can be admitted to\r\ncitizenship; he must prove in addition a good moral character, and thus\r\ngive reasonable ground for the belief that he will be faithful to the\r\nobligations which he assumes as a citizen of the Republic. Where a\r\npeople--the source of all political power--speak by their suffrages\r\nthrough the instrumentality of the ballot box, it must be carefully\r\nguarded against the control of those who are corrupt in principle and\r\nenemies of free institutions, for it can only become to our political\r\nand social system a safe conductor of healthy popular sentiment when\r\nkept free from demoralizing influences. Controlled through fraud and\r\nusurpation by the designing, anarchy and despotism must inevitably\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nIn the hands of the patriotic and worthy our Government will be\r\npreserved upon the principles of the Constitution inherited from our\r\nfathers. It follows, therefore, that in admitting to the ballot box\r\na new class of voters not qualified for the exercise of the elective\r\nfranchise we weaken our system of government instead of adding to its\r\nstrength and durability.\r\n\r\nIn returning this bill to the Senate I deeply regret that there should\r\nbe any conflict of opinion between the legislative and executive\r\ndepartments of the Government in regard to measures that vitally affect\r\nthe prosperity and peace of the country. Sincerely desiring to reconcile\r\nthe States with one another and the whole people to the Government of\r\nthe United States, it has been my earnest wish to cooperate with\r\nCongress in all measures having for their object a proper and complete\r\nadjustment of the questions resulting from our late civil war. Harmony\r\nbetween the coordinate branches of the Government, always necessary for\r\nthe public welfare, was never more demanded than at the present time,\r\nand it will therefore be my constant aim to promote as far as possible\r\nconcert of action between them. The differences of opinion that have\r\nalready occurred have rendered me only the more cautious, lest the\r\nExecutive should encroach upon any of the prerogatives of Congress,\r\nor by exceeding in any manner the constitutional limit of his duties\r\ndestroy the equilibrium which should exist between the several\r\ncoordinate departments, and which is so essential to the harmonious\r\nworking of the Government. I know it has been urged that the executive\r\ndepartment is more likely to enlarge the sphere of its action than\r\neither of the other two branches of the Government, and especially in\r\nthe exercise of the veto power conferred upon it by the Constitution. It\r\nshould be remembered, however, that this power is wholly negative and\r\nconservative in its character, and was intended to operate as a check\r\nupon unconstitutional, hasty, and improvident legislation and as a means\r\nof protection against invasions of the just powers of the executive and\r\njudicial departments. It is remarked by Chancellor Kent that--\r\n\r\n  To enact laws is a transcendent power, and if the body that possesses\r\n  it be a full and equal representation of the people there is danger of\r\n  its pressing with destructive weight upon all the other parts of the\r\n  machinery of Government. It has therefore been thought necessary by the\r\n  most skillful and most experienced artists in the science of civil\r\n  polity that strong barriers should be erected for the protection and\r\n  security of the other necessary powers of the Government. Nothing has\r\n  been deemed more fit and expedient for the purpose than the provision\r\n  that the head of the executive department should be so constituted as\r\n  to secure a requisite share of independence and that he should have a\r\n  negative upon the passing of laws; and that the judiciary power, resting\r\n  on a still more permanent basis, should have the right of determining\r\n  upon the validity of laws by the standard of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe necessity of some such check in the hands of the Executive is shown\r\nby reference to the most eminent writers upon our system of government,\r\nwho seem to concur in the opinion that encroachments are most to be\r\napprehended from the department in which all legislative powers are\r\nvested by the Constitution. Mr. Madison, in referring to the difficulty\r\nof providing some practical security for each against the invasion of\r\nthe others, remarks that \"the legislative department is everywhere\r\nextending the sphere of its activity and drawing all power into its\r\nimpetuous vortex.\" \"The founders of our Republic * * * seem never to\r\nhave recollected the danger from legislative usurpations, which by\r\nassembling all power in the same hands must lead to the same tyranny as\r\nis threatened by Executive usurpations.\" \"In a representative republic,\r\nwhere the executive magistracy is carefully limited both in the extent\r\nand the duration of its power, and where the legislative power is\r\nexercised by an assembly which is inspired, by a supposed influence over\r\nthe people, with an intrepid confidence in its own strength, which\r\nis sufficiently numerous to feel all the passions which actuate a\r\nmultitude, yet not so numerous as to be incapable of pursuing the\r\nobjects of its passions by means which reason prescribes, it is against\r\nthe enterprising ambition of this department that the people ought to\r\nindulge all their jealousy and exhaust all their precautions.\" \"The\r\nlegislative department derives a superiority in our governments from\r\nother circumstances. Its constitutional powers being at once more\r\nextensive and less susceptible of precise limits, it can with the\r\ngreater facility mask, under complicated and indirect measures, the\r\nencroachments which it makes on the coordinate departments.\" \"On the\r\nother side, the Executive power being restrained within a narrower\r\ncompass and being more simple in its nature, and the judiciary being\r\ndescribed by landmarks still less uncertain, projects of usurpation\r\nby either of these departments would immediately betray and defeat\r\nthemselves. Nor is this all. As the legislative department alone has\r\naccess to the pockets of the people and has in some constitutions full\r\ndiscretion and in all a prevailing influence over the pecuniary rewards\r\nof those who fill the other departments, a dependence is thus created in\r\nthe latter which gives still greater facility to encroachments of the\r\nformer.\" \"We have seen that the tendency of republican governments is\r\nto an aggrandizement of the legislative at the expense of the other\r\ndepartments.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson, in referring to the early constitution of\r\nVirginia, objected that by its provisions all the powers of\r\ngovernment--legislative, executive, and judicial--resulted to the\r\nlegislative body, holding that \"the concentrating these in the same\r\nhands is precisely the definition of despotic government. It will be no\r\nalleviation that these powers will be exercised by a plurality of hands,\r\nand not by a single one. One hundred and seventy-three despots would\r\nsurely be as oppressive as one.\" \"As little will it avail us that they\r\nare chosen by ourselves. An elective despotism was not the government we\r\nfought for, but one which should not only be founded on free principles,\r\nbut in which the powers of government should be so divided and balanced\r\namong several bodies of magistracy as that no one could transcend their\r\nlegal limits without being effectually checked and restrained by the\r\nothers. For this reason that convention which passed the ordinance of\r\ngovernment laid its foundation on this basis, that the legislative,\r\nexecutive, and judicial departments should be separate and distinct,\r\nso that no person should exercise the powers of more than one of them\r\nat the same time. But no barrier was provided between these several\r\npowers. The judiciary and executive members were left dependent on the\r\nlegislative for their subsistence in office, and some of them for their\r\ncontinuance in it. If, therefore, the legislature assumes executive and\r\njudiciary powers, no opposition is likely to be made, nor, if made, can\r\nbe effectual, because in that case they may put their proceedings into\r\nthe form of an act of assembly, which will render them obligatory on the\r\nother branches. They have accordingly in many instances decided rights\r\nwhich should have been left to judiciary controversy; and the direction\r\nof the executive, during the whole time of their session, is becoming\r\nhabitual and familiar.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Justice Story, in his Commentaries on the Constitution, reviews the\r\nsame subject, and says:\r\n\r\n  The truth is that the legislative power is the great and overruling\r\n  power in every free government. * * * The representatives of the people\r\n  will watch with jealousy every encroachment of the executive magistrate,\r\n  for it trenches upon their own authority. But who shall watch the\r\n  encroachment of these representatives themselves? Will they be as\r\n  jealous of the exercise of power by themselves as by others? * * *\r\n\r\n  There are many reasons which may be assigned for the engrossing\r\n  influence of the legislative department. In the first place, its\r\n  constitutional powers are more extensive, and less capable of being\r\n  brought within precise limits than those of either the other\r\n  departments. The bounds of the executive authority are easily marked\r\n  out and defined. It reaches few objects, and those are known. It can\r\n  not transcend them without being brought in contact with the other\r\n  departments. Laws may check and restrain and bound its exercise. The\r\n  same remarks apply with still greater force to the judiciary. The\r\n  jurisdiction is, or may be, bounded to a few objects or persons; or,\r\n  however general and unlimited, its operations are necessarily confined\r\n  to the mere administration of private and public justice. It can not\r\n  punish without law. It can not create controversies to act upon. It can\r\n  decide only upon rights and cases as they are brought by others before\r\n  it. It can do nothing for itself. It must do everything for others. It\r\n  must obey the laws, and if it corruptly administers them it is subjected\r\n  to the power of impeachment. On the other hand, the legislative power\r\n  except in the few cases of constitutional prohibition, is unlimited. It\r\n  is forever varying its means and its ends. It governs the institutions\r\n  and laws and public policy of the country. It regulates all its vast\r\n  interests. It disposes of all its property. Look but at the exercise\r\n  of two or three branches of its ordinary powers. It levies all taxes;\r\n  it directs and appropriates all supplies; it gives the rules for the\r\n  descent, distribution, and devises of all property held by individuals;\r\n  it controls the sources and the resources of wealth; it changes at its\r\n  will the whole fabric of the laws; it molds at its pleasure almost all\r\n  the institutions which give strength and comfort and dignity to society.\r\n\r\n  In the next place, it is the direct visible representative of the will\r\n  of the people in all the changes of times and circumstances. It has the\r\n  pride as well as the power of numbers. It is easily moved and steadily\r\n  moved by the strong impulses of popular feeling and popular odium. It\r\n  obeys without reluctance the wishes and the will of the majority for the\r\n  time being. The path to public favor lies open by such obedience, and it\r\n  finds not only support but impunity in whatever measures the majority\r\n  advises, even though they transcend the constitutional limits. It has no\r\n  motive, therefore, to be jealous or scrupulous in its own use of power;\r\n  and it finds its ambition stimulated and its arm strengthened by the\r\n  countenance and the courage of numbers. These views are not alone those\r\n  of men who look with apprehension upon the fate of republics, but they\r\n  are also freely admitted by some of the strongest advocates for popular\r\n  rights and the permanency of republican institutions. * * *\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  * * * Each department should have a will of its own. * * * Each should\r\n  have its own independence secured beyond the power of being taken away\r\n  by either or both of the others. But at the same time the relations of\r\n  each to the other should be so strong that there should be a mutual\r\n  interest to sustain and protect each other. There should not only be\r\n  constitutional means, but personal motives to resist encroachments of\r\n  one or either of the others. Thus ambition would be made to counteract\r\n  ambition, the desire of power to check power, and the pressure of\r\n  interest to balance an opposing interest.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  * * * The judiciary is naturally and almost necessarily, as has been\r\n  already said, the weakest department. It can have no means of influence\r\n  by patronage. Its powers can never be wielded for itself. It has no\r\n  command over the purse or the sword of the nation. It can neither lay\r\n  taxes, nor appropriate money, nor command armies, nor appoint to office.\r\n  It is never brought into contact with the people by constant appeals and\r\n  solicitations and private intercourse, which belong to all the other\r\n  departments of Government. It is seen only in controversies or in trials\r\n  and punishments. Its rigid justice and impartiality give it no claims to\r\n  favor, however they may to respect. It stands solitary and unsupported,\r\n  except by that portion of public opinion which is interested only in the\r\n  strict administration of justice. It can rarely secure the sympathy or\r\n  zealous support either of the Executive or the Legislature. If they\r\n  are not, as is not unfrequently the case, jealous of its prerogatives,\r\n  the constant necessity of scrutinizing the acts of each, upon the\r\n  application of any private person, and the painful duty of pronouncing\r\n  judgment that these acts are a departure from the law or Constitution\r\n  can have no tendency to conciliate kindness or nourish influence. It\r\n  would seem, therefore, that some additional guards would, under the\r\n  circumstances, be necessary to protect this department from the absolute\r\n  dominion of the others. Yet rarely have any such guards been applied,\r\n  and every attempt to introduce them has been resisted with a pertinacity\r\n  which demonstrates how slow popular leaders are to introduce checks upon\r\n  their own power and how slow the people are to believe that the\r\n  judiciary is the real bulwark of their liberties. * * *\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  * * * If any department of the Government has undue influence or\r\n  absorbing power, it certainly has not been the executive or judiciary.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to what has been said by these distinguished writers,\r\nit may also be urged that the dominant party in each House may, by the\r\nexpulsion of a sufficient number of members or by the exclusion from\r\nrepresentation of a requisite number of States, reduce the minority to\r\nless than one-third. Congress by these means might be enabled to pass a\r\nlaw, the objections of the President to the contrary notwithstanding,\r\nwhich would render impotent the other two departments of the Government\r\nand make inoperative the wholesome and restraining power which it was\r\nintended by the framers of the Constitution should be exerted by them.\r\nThis would be a practical concentration of all power in the Congress\r\nof the United States; this, in the language of the author of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, would be \"precisely the definition of\r\ndespotic government.\"\r\n\r\nI have preferred to reproduce these teachings of the great statesmen\r\nand constitutional lawyers of the early and later days of the Republic\r\nrather than to rely simply upon an expression of my own opinions.\r\nWe can not too often recur to them, especially at a conjuncture like\r\nthe present. Their application to our actual condition is so apparent\r\nthat they now come to us a living voice, to be listened to with more\r\nattention than at any previous period of our history. We have been and\r\nare yet in the midst of popular commotion. The passions aroused by a\r\ngreat civil war are still dominant. It is not a time favorable to that\r\ncalm and deliberate judgment which is the only safe guide when radical\r\nchanges in our institutions are to be made. The measure now before me is\r\none of those changes. It initiates an untried experiment for a people\r\nwho have said, with one voice, that it is not for their good. This alone\r\nshould make us pause, but it is not all. The experiment has not been\r\ntried, or so much as demanded, by the people of the several States for\r\nthemselves. In but few of the States has such an innovation been allowed\r\nas giving the ballot to the colored population without any other\r\nqualification than a residence of one year, and in most of them the\r\ndenial of the ballot to this race is absolute and by fundamental law\r\nplaced beyond the domain of ordinary legislation. In most of those\r\nStates the evil of such suffrage would be partial, but, small as it\r\nwould be, it is guarded by constitutional barriers. Here the innovation\r\nassumes formidable proportions, which may easily grow to such an extent\r\nas to make the white population a subordinate element in the body\r\npolitic.\r\n\r\nAfter full deliberation upon this measure, I can not bring myself to\r\napprove it, even upon local considerations, nor yet as the beginning of\r\nan experiment on a larger scale. I yield to no one in attachment to that\r\nrule of general suffrage which distinguishes our policy as a nation.\r\nBut there is a limit, wisely observed hitherto, which makes the ballot\r\na privilege and a trust, and which requires of some classes a time\r\nsuitable for probation and preparation. To give it indiscriminately to\r\na new class, wholly unprepared by previous habits and opportunities to\r\nperform the trust which it demands, is to degrade it, and finally to\r\ndestroy its power, for it may be safely assumed that no political truth\r\nis better established than that such indiscriminate and all-embracing\r\nextension of popular suffrage must end at last in its destruction.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 28, 1867_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI return to the Senate, in which House it originated, a bill entitled\r\n\"An act to admit the State of Colorado into the Union,\" to which I can\r\nnot, consistently with my sense of duty, give my approval. With the\r\nexception of an additional section, containing new provisions, it is\r\nsubstantially the same as the bill of a similar title passed by Congress\r\nduring the last session, submitted to the President for his approval,\r\nreturned with the objections contained in a message bearing date the\r\n15th of May last, and yet awaiting the reconsideration of the Senate.\r\n\r\nA second bill, having in view the same purpose, has now passed both\r\nHouses of Congress and been presented for my signature. Having again\r\ncarefully considered the subject, I have been unable to perceive any\r\nreason for changing the opinions which have already been communicated to\r\nCongress. I find, on the contrary, that there are many objections to the\r\nproposed legislation of which I was not at that time aware, and that\r\nwhile several of those which I then assigned have in the interval gained\r\nin strength, yet others have been created by the altered character of\r\nthe measures now submitted.\r\n\r\nThe constitution under which the State government is proposed to be\r\nformed very properly contains a provision that all laws in force at the\r\ntime of its adoption and the admission of the State into the Union shall\r\ncontinue as if the constitution had not been adopted. Among those laws\r\nis one absolutely prohibiting negroes and mulattoes from voting. At the\r\nrecent session of the Territorial legislature a bill for the repeal of\r\nthis law, introduced into the council, was almost unanimously rejected;\r\nand at the very time when Congress was engaged in enacting the bill now\r\nunder consideration the legislature passed an act excluding negroes and\r\nmulattoes from the right to sit as jurors. This bill was vetoed by the\r\ngovernor of the Territory, who held that by the laws of the United\r\nStates negroes and mulattoes are citizens, and subject to the duties, as\r\nwell as entitled to the rights, of citizenship. The bill, however, was\r\npassed, the objections of the governor to the contrary notwithstanding,\r\nand is now a law of the Territory. Yet in the bill now before me, by\r\nwhich it is proposed to admit the Territory as a State, it is provided\r\nthat \"there shall be no denial of the elective franchise or any other\r\nrights to any person by reason of race or color, excepting Indians not\r\ntaxed.\"\r\n\r\nThe incongruity thus exhibited between the legislation of Congress and\r\nthat of the Territory, taken in connection with the protest against the\r\nadmission of the State hereinafter referred to, would seem clearly to\r\nindicate the impolicy and injustice of the proposed enactment.\r\n\r\nIt might, indeed, be a subject of grave inquiry, and doubtless will\r\nresult in such inquiry if this bill becomes a law, whether it does not\r\nattempt to exercise a power not conferred upon Congress by the Federal\r\nConstitution. That instrument simply declares that Congress may admit\r\nnew States into the Union. It nowhere says that Congress may make new\r\nStates for the purpose of admitting them into the Union or for any other\r\npurpose; and yet this bill is as clear an attempt to make the\r\ninstitutions as any in which the people themselves could engage.\r\n\r\nIn view of this action of Congress, the house of representatives of the\r\nTerritory have earnestly protested against being forced into the Union\r\nwithout first having the question submitted to the people. Nothing could\r\nbe more reasonable than the position which they thus assume; and it\r\ncertainly can not be the purpose of Congress to force upon a community\r\nagainst their will a government which they do not believe themselves\r\ncapable of sustaining.\r\n\r\nThe following is a copy of the protest alluded to as officially\r\ntransmitted to me:\r\n\r\n  Whereas it is announced in the public prints that it is the intention\r\n  of Congress to admit Colorado as a State into the Union: Therefore,\r\n\r\n  _Resolved by the house of representatives of the Territory_, That,\r\n  representing, as we do, the last and only legal expression of public\r\n  opinion on this question, we earnestly protest against the passage of a\r\n  law admitting the State without first having the question submitted to\r\n  a vote of the people, for the reasons, first, that we have a right to a\r\n  voice in the selection of the character of our government; second, that\r\n  we have not a sufficient population to support the expenses of a State\r\n  government. For these reasons we trust that Congress will not force upon\r\n  us a government against our will.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon information which I considered reliable, I assumed in my message of\r\nthe 15th of May last that the population of Colorado was not more than\r\n30,000, and expressed the opinion that this number was entirely too\r\nsmall either to assume the responsibilities or to enjoy the privileges\r\nof a State.\r\n\r\nIt appears that previous to that time the legislature, with a view\r\nto ascertain the exact condition of the Territory, had passed a law\r\nauthorizing a census of the population to be taken. The law made it\r\nthe duty of the assessors in the several counties to take the census\r\nin connection with the annual assessments, and, in order to secure\r\na correct enumeration of the population, allowed them a liberal\r\ncompensation for the service by paying them for every name returned,\r\nand added to their previous oath of office an oath to perform this\r\nduty with fidelity.\r\n\r\nFrom the accompanying official report it appears that returns have been\r\nreceived from fifteen of the eighteen counties into which the State is\r\ndivided, and that their population amounts in the aggregate to 24,909.\r\nThe three remaining counties are estimated to contain 3,000, making a\r\ntotal population of 27,909.\r\n\r\nThis census was taken in the summer season, when it is claimed that the\r\npopulation is much larger than at any other period, as in the autumn\r\nminers in large numbers leave their work and return to the East with the\r\nresults of their summer enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe population, it will be observed, is but slightly in excess of\r\none-fifth of the number required as the basis of representation for a\r\nsingle Congressional district in any of the States--the number being\r\n127,000.\r\n\r\nI am unable to perceive any good reason for such great disparity in the\r\nright of representation, giving, as it would, to the people of Colorado\r\nnot only this vast advantage in the House of Representatives, but an\r\nequality in the Senate, where the other States are represented by\r\nmillions. With perhaps a single exception, no such inequality as this\r\nhas ever before been attempted. I know that it is claimed that the\r\npopulation of the different States at the time of their admission has\r\nvaried at different periods, but it has not varied much more than the\r\npopulation of each decade and the corresponding basis of representation\r\nfor the different periods.\r\n\r\nThe obvious intent of the Constitution was that no State should be\r\nadmitted with a less population than the ratio for a Representative at\r\nthe time of application. The limitation in the second section of the\r\nfirst article of the Constitution, declaring that \"each State shall have\r\nat least one Representative,\" was manifestly designed to protect the\r\nStates which originally composed the Union from being deprived, in\r\nthe event of a waning population, of a voice in the popular branch of\r\nCongress, and was never intended as a warrant to force a new State into\r\nthe Union with a representative population far below that which might at\r\nthe time be required of sister members of the Confederacy. This bill, in\r\nview of the prohibition of the same section, which declares that \"the\r\nnumber of Representatives shall not exceed one for every 30,000,\" is at\r\nleast a violation of the spirit if not the letter of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIt is respectfully submitted that however Congress, under the pressure\r\nof circumstances, may have admitted two or three States with less than\r\na representative population at the time, there has been no instance in\r\nwhich an application for admission has ever been entertained when the\r\npopulation, as officially ascertained, was below 30,000.\r\n\r\nWere there any doubt of this being the true construction of the\r\nConstitution, it would be dispelled by the early and long-continued\r\npractice of the Federal Government. For nearly sixty years after the\r\nadoption of the Constitution no State was admitted with a population\r\nbelieved at the time to be less than the current ratio for a\r\nRepresentative, and the first instance in which there appears to have\r\nbeen a departure from the principle was in 1845, in the case of Florida.\r\nObviously the result of sectional strife, we would do well to regard it\r\nas a warning of evil rather than as an example for imitation; and I\r\nthink candid men of all parties will agree that the inspiring cause of\r\nthe violation of this wholesome principle of restraint is to be found\r\nin a vain attempt to balance these antagonisms, which refused to be\r\nreconciled except through the bloody arbitrament of arms. The plain\r\nfacts of our history will attest that the great and leading States\r\nadmitted since 1845, viz, Iowa, Wisconsin, California, Minnesota, and\r\nKansas, including Texas, which was admitted that year, have all come\r\nwith an ample population for one Representative, and some of them with\r\nnearly or quite enough for two.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate the correctness of my views on this question, I subjoin\r\na table containing a list of the States admitted since the adoption\r\nof the Federal Constitution, with the date of admission, the ratio of\r\nrepresentation, and the representative population when admitted, deduced\r\nfrom the United States census tables, the calculation being made for the\r\nperiod of the decade corresponding with the date of admission.\r\n\r\nColorado, which it is now proposed to admit as a State, contains, as has\r\nalready been stated, a population less than 28,000, while the present\r\nratio of representation is 127,000.\r\n\r\nThere can be no reason that I can perceive for the admission of\r\nColorado that would not apply with equal force to nearly every other\r\nTerritory now organized; and I submit whether, if this bill become a\r\nlaw, it will be possible to resist the logical conclusion that such\r\nTerritories as Dakota, Montana, and Idaho must be received as States\r\nwhenever they present themselves, without regard to the number of\r\ninhabitants they may respectively contain. Eight or ten new Senators and\r\nfour or five new members of the House of Representatives would thus be\r\nadmitted to represent a population scarcely exceeding that which in any\r\nother portion of the nation is entitled to but a single member of the\r\nHouse of Representatives, while the average for two Senators in the\r\nUnion, as now constituted, is at least 1,000,000 people. It would surely\r\nbe unjust to all other sections of the Union to enter upon a policy with\r\nregard to the admission of new States which might result in conferring\r\nsuch a disproportionate share of influence in the National Legislature\r\nupon communities which, in pursuance of the wise policy of our fathers,\r\nshould for some years to come be retained under the fostering care\r\nand protection of the National Government. If it is deemed just and\r\nexpedient now to depart from the settled policy of the nation during\r\nall its history, and to admit all the Territories to the rights and\r\nprivileges of States, irrespective of their population or fitness\r\nfor such government, it is submitted whether it would not be well to\r\ndevise such measures as will bring the subject before the country for\r\nconsideration and decision. This would seem to be eminently wise,\r\nbecause, as has already been stated, if it is right to admit Colorado\r\nnow there is no reason for the exclusion of the other Territories.\r\n\r\nIt is no answer to these suggestions that an enabling act was passed\r\nauthorizing the people of Colorado to take action on this subject. It is\r\nwell known that that act was passed in consequence of representations\r\nthat the population reached, according to some statements, as high as\r\n80,000, and to none less than 50,000, and was growing with a rapidity\r\nwhich by the time the admission could be consummated would secure a\r\npopulation of over 100,000. These representations proved to have been\r\nwholly fallacious, and in addition the people of the Territory by a\r\ndeliberate vote decided that they would not assume the responsibilities\r\nof a State government. By that decision they utterly exhausted all power\r\nthat was conferred by the enabling act, and there has been no step taken\r\nsince in relation to the admission that has had the slightest sanction\r\nor warrant of law.\r\n\r\nThe proceeding upon which the present application is based was in the\r\nutter absence of all law in relation to it, and there is no evidence\r\nthat the votes on the question of the formation of a State government\r\nbear any relation whatever to the sentiment of the Territory. The\r\nprotest of the house of representatives previously quoted is conclusive\r\nevidence to the contrary.\r\n\r\nBut if none of these reasons existed against this proposed enactment,\r\nthe bill itself, besides being inconsistent in its provisions in\r\nconferring power upon a person unknown to the laws and who may never\r\nhave a legal existence, is so framed as to render its execution almost\r\nimpossible. It is, indeed, a question whether it is not in itself a\r\nnullity. To say the least, it is of exceedingly doubtful propriety to\r\nconfer the power proposed in this bill upon the \"governor elect,\" for as\r\nby its own terms the constitution is not to take effect until after the\r\nadmission of the State, he in the meantime has no more authority than\r\nany other private citizen. But even supposing him to be clothed with\r\nsufficient authority to convene the legislature, what constitutes the\r\n\"State legislature\" to which is to be referred the submission of the\r\nconditions imposed by Congress? Is it a new body to be elected and\r\nconvened by proclamation of the \"governor elect,\" or is it that body\r\nwhich met more than a year ago under the provisions of the State\r\nconstitution? By reference to the second section of the schedule and to\r\nthe eighteenth section of the fourth article of the State constitution\r\nit will be seen that the term of the members of the house of\r\nrepresentatives and that of one-half of the members of the senate\r\nexpired on the first Monday of the present month. It is clear that if\r\nthere were no intrinsic objections to the bill itself in relation to\r\npurposes to be accomplished this objection would be fatal, as, it is\r\napparent that the provisions of the third section of the bill to admit\r\nColorado have reference to a period and a state of facts entirely\r\ndifferent from the present and affairs as they now exist, and if carried\r\ninto effect must necessarily lead to confusion.\r\n\r\nEven if it were settled that the old and not a new body were to act, it\r\nwould be found impracticable to execute the law, because a considerable\r\nnumber of the members, as I am informed, have ceased to be residents of\r\nthe Territory, and in the sixty days within which the legislature is to\r\nbe convened after the passage of the act there would not be sufficient\r\ntime to fill the vacancies by new elections, were there any authority\r\nunder which they could be held.\r\n\r\nIt may not be improper to add that if these proceedings were all regular\r\nand the result to be obtained were desirable, simple justice to the\r\npeople of the Territory would require a longer period than sixty days\r\nwithin which to obtain action on the conditions proposed by the third\r\nsection of the bill. There are, as is well known, large portions of the\r\nTerritory with which there is and can be no general communication, there\r\nbeing several counties which from November to May can only be reached by\r\npersons traveling on foot, while with other regions of the Territory,\r\noccupied by a large portion of the population, there is very little more\r\nfreedom of access. Thus, if this bill should become a law, it would be\r\nimpracticable to obtain any expression of public sentiment in reference\r\nto its provisions, with a view to enlighten the legislature, if the old\r\nbody were called together, and, of course, equally impracticable to\r\nprocure the election of a new body. This defect might have been remedied\r\nby an extension of the time and a submission of the question to the\r\npeople, with a fair opportunity to enable them to express their\r\nsentiments.\r\n\r\nThe admission of a new State has generally been regarded as an epoch in\r\nour history marking the onward progress of the nation; but after the\r\nmost careful and anxious inquiry on the subject I can not perceive that\r\nthe proposed proceeding is in conformity with the policy which from the\r\norigin of the Government has uniformly prevailed in the admission of new\r\nStates. I therefore return the bill to the Senate without my signature.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n  States                                 Admitted. Ratio.

A bill having in\r\nview the same object was presented for my approval a few hours prior to\r\nthe adjournment of the last session, but, submitted at a time when there\r\nwas no opportunity for a proper consideration of the subject, I withheld\r\nmy signature and the measure failed to become a law.\r\n\r\nIt appears by the preamble of this bill that the people of Nebraska,\r\navailing themselves of the authority conferred upon them by the act\r\npassed on the 19th day of April, 1864, \"have adopted a constitution\r\nwhich, upon due examination, is found to conform to the provisions and\r\ncomply with the conditions of said act, and to be republican in its form\r\nof government, and that they now ask for admission into the Union.\"\r\nThis proposed law would therefore seem to be based upon the declaration\r\ncontained in the enabling act that upon compliance with its terms the\r\npeople of Nebraska should be admitted into the Union upon an equal\r\nfooting with the original States. Reference to the bill, however, shows\r\nthat while by the first section Congress distinctly accepts, ratifies,\r\nand confirms the Constitution and State government which the people of\r\nthe Territory have formed for themselves, declares Nebraska to be one\r\nof the United States of America, and admits her into the Union upon an\r\nequal footing with the original States in all respects whatsoever, the\r\nthird section provides that this measure \"shall not take effect except\r\nupon the fundamental condition that within the State of Nebraska there\r\nshall be no denial of the elective franchise, or of any other right,\r\nto any person by reason of race or color, excepting Indians not\r\ntaxed; and upon the further fundamental condition that the legislature\r\nof said State, by a solemn public act, shall declare the assent of\r\nsaid State to the said fundamental condition, and shall transmit to\r\nthe President of the United States an authentic copy of said act, upon\r\nreceipt whereof the President, by proclamation, shall forthwith announce\r\nthe fact, whereupon said fundamental condition shall be held as a part\r\nof the organic law of the State; and thereupon, and without any further\r\nproceeding on the part of Congress, the admission of said State into the\r\nUnion shall be considered as complete.\" This condition is not mentioned\r\nin the original enabling act; was not contemplated at the time of its\r\npassage; was not sought by the people themselves; has not heretofore\r\nbeen applied to the inhabitants of any State asking admission, and is in\r\ndirect conflict with the constitution adopted by the people and declared\r\nin the preamble \"to be republican in its form of government,\" for in\r\nthat instrument the exercise of the elective franchise and the right\r\nto hold office are expressly limited to white citizens of the United\r\nStates. Congress thus undertakes to authorize and compel the legislature\r\nto change a constitution which, it is declared in the preamble, has\r\nreceived the sanction of the people, and which by this bill is\r\n\"accepted, ratified, and confirmed\" by the Congress of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe first and third sections of the bill exhibit yet further\r\nincongruity. By the one Nebraska is \"admitted into the Union upon an\r\nequal footing with the original States in all respects whatsoever,\"\r\nwhile by the other Congress demands as a condition precedent to her\r\nadmission requirements which in our history have never been asked of\r\nany people when presenting a constitution and State government for the\r\nacceptance of the lawmaking power. It is expressly declared by the third\r\nsection that the bill \"shall not take effect except upon the fundamental\r\ncondition that within the State of Nebraska there shall be no denial of\r\nthe elective franchise, or of any other right, to any person by reason\r\nof race or color, excepting Indians not taxed.\" Neither more nor less\r\nthan the assertion of the right of Congress to regulate the elective\r\nfranchise of any State hereafter to be admitted, this condition is in\r\nclear violation of the Federal Constitution, under the provisions of\r\nwhich, from the very foundation of the Government, each State has been\r\nleft free to determine for itself the qualifications necessary for\r\nthe exercise of suffrage within its limits. Without precedent in our\r\nlegislation, it is in marked contrast with those limitations which,\r\nimposed upon States that from time to time have become members of the\r\nUnion, had for their object the single purpose of preventing any\r\ninfringement of the Constitution of the country.\r\n\r\nIf Congress is satisfied that Nebraska at the present time possesses\r\nsufficient population to entitle her to full representation in the\r\ncouncils of the nation, and that her people desire an exchange of a\r\nTerritorial for a State government, good faith would seem to demand that\r\nshe should be admitted without further requirements than those expressed\r\nin the enabling act, with all of which, it is asserted in the preamble,\r\nher inhabitants have complied. Congress may, under the Constitution,\r\nadmit new States or reject them, but the people of a State can alone\r\nmake or change their organic law and prescribe the qualifications\r\nrequisite for electors. Congress, however, in passing the bill in the\r\nshape in which it has been submitted for my approval, does not merely\r\nreject the application of the people of Nebraska for present admission\r\nas a State into the Union, on the ground that the constitution which\r\nthey have submitted restricts the exercise of the elective franchise to\r\nthe white population, but imposes conditions which, if accepted by the\r\nlegislature, may, without the consent of the people, so change the\r\norganic law as to make electors of all persons within the State without\r\ndistinction of race or color. In view of this fact, I suggest for the\r\nconsideration of Congress whether it would not be just, expedient, and\r\nin accordance with the principles of our Government to allow the people,\r\nby popular vote or through a convention chosen by themselves for that\r\npurpose, to declare whether or not they will accept the terms upon which\r\nit is now proposed to admit them into the Union. This course would\r\nnot occasion much greater delay than that which the bill contemplates\r\nwhen it requires that the legislature shall be convened within thirty\r\ndays after this measure shall have become a law for the purpose of\r\nconsidering and deciding the conditions which it imposes, and gains\r\nadditional force when we consider that the proceedings attending the\r\nformation of the State constitution were not in conformity with the\r\nprovisions of the enabling act; that in an aggregate vote of 7,776 the\r\nmajority in favor of the constitution did not exceed 100; and that it is\r\nalleged that, in consequence of frauds, even this result can not be\r\nreceived as a fair expression of the wishes of the people. As upon them\r\nmust fall the burdens of a State organization, it is but just that they\r\nshould be permitted to determine for themselves a question which so\r\nmaterially affects their interests. Possessing a soil and a climate\r\nadmirably adapted to those industrial pursuits which bring prosperity\r\nand greatness to a people, with the advantage of a central position\r\non the great highway that will soon connect the Atlantic and Pacific\r\nStates, Nebraska is rapidly gaining in numbers and wealth, and may\r\nwithin a very brief period claim admission on grounds which will\r\nchallenge and secure universal assent. She can therefore wisely and\r\npatiently afford to wait. Her population is said to be steadily and\r\neven rapidly increasing, being now generally conceded as high as 40,000,\r\nand estimated by some whose judgment is entitled to respect at a still\r\ngreater number. At her present rate of growth she will in a very short\r\ntime have the requisite population for a Representative in Congress,\r\nand, what is far more important to her own citizens, will have realized\r\nsuch an advance in material wealth as will enable the expenses of a\r\nState government to be borne without oppression to the taxpayer. Of new\r\ncommunities it may be said with special force--and it is true of old\r\nones--that the inducement to emigrants, other things being equal, is in\r\nalmost the precise ratio of the rate of taxation. The great States of\r\nthe Northwest owe their marvelous prosperity largely to the fact that\r\nthey were continued as Territories until they had growth to be wealthy\r\nand populous communities.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 2, 1867_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have carefully examined the bill \"to regulate the tenure of certain\r\ncivil offices.\" The material portion of the bill is contained in the\r\nfirst section, and is of the effect following, namely:\r\n\r\n  That every person holding any civil office to which he has been\r\n  appointed, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and every\r\n  person who shall hereafter be appointed to any such office and shall\r\n  become duly qualified to act therein, is and shall be entitled\r\n  to hold such office until a successor shall have been appointed\r\n  by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, and duly\r\n  qualified; and that the Secretaries of State, of the Treasury, of War,\r\n  of the Navy, and of the Interior, the Postmaster-General, and the\r\n  Attorney-General shall hold their offices respectively for and during\r\n  the term of the President by whom they may have been appointed and for\r\n  one month thereafter, subject to removal by and with the advice and\r\n  consent of the Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese provisions are qualified by a reservation in the fourth section,\r\n\"that nothing contained in the bill shall be construed to extend the\r\nterm of any office the duration of which is limited by law.\" In effect\r\nthe bill provides that the President shall not remove from their places\r\nany of the civil officers whose terms of service are not limited by law\r\nwithout the advice and consent of the Senate of the United States. The\r\nbill in this respect conflicts, in my judgment, with the Constitution\r\nof the United States. The question, as Congress is well aware, is by no\r\nmeans a new one. That the power of removal is constitutionally vested\r\nin the President of the United States is a principle which has been not\r\nmore distinctly declared by judicial authority and judicial commentators\r\nthan it has been uniformly practiced upon by the legislative and\r\nexecutive departments of the Government. The question arose in the House\r\nof Representatives so early as the 16th of June, 1789, on the bill for\r\nestablishing an Executive Department denominated \"the Department of\r\nForeign Affairs.\" The first clause of the bill, after recapitulating\r\nthe functions of that officer and defining his duties, had these words:\r\n\"To be removable from office by the President of the United States.\"\r\nIt was moved to strike out these words and the motion was sustained\r\nwith great ability and vigor. It was insisted that the President could\r\nnot constitutionally exercise the power of removal exclusively of the\r\nSenate; that the Federalist so interpreted the Constitution when arguing\r\nfor its adoption by the several States; that the Constitution had\r\nnowhere given the President power of removal, either expressly or by\r\nstrong implication, but, on the contrary, had distinctly provided for\r\nremovals from office by impeachment only.\r\n\r\nA construction which denied the power of removal by the President was\r\nfurther maintained by arguments drawn from the danger of the abuse of\r\nthe power; from the supposed tendency of an exposure of public officers\r\nto capricious removal to impair the efficiency of the civil service;\r\nfrom the alleged injustice and hardship of displacing incumbents\r\ndependent upon their official stations without sufficient consideration;\r\nfrom a supposed want of responsibility on the part of the President, and\r\nfrom an imagined defect of guaranties against a vicious President who\r\nmight incline to abuse the power. On the other hand, an exclusive power\r\nof removal by the President was defended as a true exposition of the\r\ntext of the Constitution. It was maintained that there are certain\r\ncauses for which persons ought to be removed from office without being\r\nguilty of treason, bribery, or malfeasance, and that the nature of\r\nthings demands that it should be so. \"Suppose,\" it was said, \"a man\r\nbecomes insane by the visitation of God and is likely to ruin our\r\naffairs; are the hands of the Government to be confined from warding off\r\nthe evil? Suppose a person in office not possessing the talents he was\r\njudged to have at the time of the appointment; is the error not to be\r\ncorrected? Suppose he acquires vicious habits and incurable indolence or\r\ntotal neglect of the duties of his office, which shall work mischief to\r\nthe public welfare; is there no way to arrest the threatened danger?\r\nSuppose he becomes odious and unpopular by reason of the measures he\r\npursues--and this he may do without committing any positive offense\r\nagainst the law; must he preserve his office in despite of the popular\r\nwill? Suppose him grasping for his own aggrandizement and the elevation\r\nof his connections by every means short of the treason defined by the\r\nConstitution, hurrying your affairs to the precipice of destruction,\r\nendangering your domestic tranquillity, plundering you of the means of\r\ndefense, alienating the affections of your allies and promoting the\r\nspirit of discord; must the tardy, tedious, desultory road by way of\r\nimpeachment be traveled to overtake the man who, barely confining\r\nhimself within the letter of the law, is employed in drawing off the\r\nvital principle of the Government? The nature of things, the great\r\nobjects of society, the express objects of the Constitution itself,\r\nrequire that this thing should be otherwise. To unite the Senate with\r\nthe President in the exercise of the power,\" it was said, \"would involve\r\nus in the most serious difficulty. Suppose a discovery of any of those\r\nevents should take place when the Senate is not in session; how is the\r\nremedy to be applied? The evil could be avoided in no other way than by\r\nthe Senate sitting always.\" In regard to the danger of the power being\r\nabused if exercised by one man it was said \"that the danger is as great\r\nwith respect to the Senate, who are assembled from various parts of the\r\ncontinent, with different impressions and opinions;\" \"that such a body\r\nis more likely to misuse the power of removal than the man whom the\r\nunited voice of America calls to the Presidential chair. As the nature\r\nof government requires the power of removal,\" it was maintained \"that it\r\nshould be exercised in this way by the hand capable of exerting itself\r\nwith effect; and the power must be conferred on the President by the\r\nConstitution as the executive officer of the Government.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Madison, whose adverse opinion in the Federalist had been relied\r\nupon by those who denied the exclusive power, now participated in the\r\ndebate. He declared that he had reviewed his former opinions, and he\r\nsummed up the whole case as follows:\r\n\r\n  The Constitution affirms that the executive power is vested in the\r\n  President. Are there exceptions to this proposition? Yes; there are.\r\n  The Constitution says that in appointing to office the Senate shall be\r\n  associated with the President, unless in the case of inferior officers,\r\n  when the law shall otherwise direct. Have we (that is, Congress) a\r\n  right to extend this exception? I believe not. If the Constitution has\r\n  invested all executive power in the President, I venture to assert\r\n  that the Legislature has no right to diminish or modify his executive\r\n  authority. The question now resolves itself into this: Is the power of\r\n  displacing an executive power? I conceive that if any power whatsoever\r\n  is in the Executive it is the power of appointing, overseeing, and\r\n  controlling those who execute the laws. If the Constitution had not\r\n  qualified the power of the President in appointing to office by\r\n  associating the Senate with him in that business, would it not be clear\r\n  that he would have the right by virtue of his executive power to make\r\n  such appointment? Should we be authorized in defiance of that clause\r\n  in the Constitution, \"The executive power shall be vested in the\r\n  President,\" to unite the Senate with the President in the appointment\r\n  to office? I conceive not. If it is admitted that we should not be\r\n  authorized to do this, I think it may be disputed whether we have a\r\n  right to associate them in removing persons from office, the one power\r\n  being as much of an executive nature as the other; and the first one is\r\n  authorized by being excepted out of the general rule established by the\r\n  Constitution in these words: \"The executive power shall be vested in the\r\n  President.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question, thus ably and exhaustively argued, was decided by the\r\nHouse of Representatives, by a vote of 34 to 20, in favor of the\r\nprinciple that the executive power of removal is vested by the\r\nConstitution in the Executive, and in the Senate by the casting vote\r\nof the Vice-President.\r\n\r\nThe question has often been raised in subsequent times of high\r\nexcitement, and the practice of the Government has, nevertheless,\r\nconformed in all cases to the decision thus early made.\r\n\r\nThe question was revived during the Administration of President Jackson,\r\nwho made, as is well recollected, a very large number of removals, which\r\nwere made an occasion of close and rigorous scrutiny and remonstrance.\r\nThe subject was long and earnestly debated in the Senate, and the early\r\nconstruction of the Constitution was, nevertheless, freely accepted as\r\nbinding and conclusive upon Congress.\r\n\r\nThe question came before the Supreme Court of the United States in\r\nJanuary, 1839, _ex parte_ Hennen. It was declared by the court on that\r\noccasion that the power of removal from office was a subject much\r\ndisputed, and upon which a great diversity of opinion was entertained in\r\nthe early history of the Government. This related, however, to the power\r\nof the President to remove officers appointed with the concurrence of\r\nthe Senate, and the great question was whether the removal was to be\r\nby the President alone or with the concurrence of the Senate, both\r\nconstituting the appointing power. No one denied the power of the\r\nPresident and Senate jointly to remove where the tenure of the office\r\nwas not fixed by the Constitution, which was a full recognition of the\r\nprinciple that the power of removal was incident to the power of\r\nappointment; but it was very early adopted as a practical construction\r\nof the Constitution that this power was vested in the President alone,\r\nand such would appear to have been the legislative construction of the\r\nConstitution, for in the organization of the three great Departments of\r\nState, War, and Treasury, in the year 1789, provision was made for the\r\nappointment of a subordinate officer by the head of the Department, who\r\nshould have charge of the records, books, and papers appertaining to the\r\noffice when the head of the Department should be removed from office\r\nby the President of the United States. When the Navy Department was\r\nestablished, in the year 1798, provision was made for the charge and\r\ncustody of the books, records, and documents of the Department in case\r\nof vacancy in the office of Secretary by removal or otherwise. It is not\r\nhere said \"by removal of the President,\" as is done with respect to the\r\nheads of the other Departments, yet there can be no doubt that he holds\r\nhis office with the same tenure as the other Secretaries and is\r\nremovable by the President. The change of phraseology arose, probably,\r\nfrom its having become the settled and well-understood construction of\r\nthe Constitution that the power of removal was vested in the President\r\nalone in such cases, although the appointment of the officer is by the\r\nPresident and Senate. (13 Peters, p. 139.)\r\n\r\nOur most distinguished and accepted commentators upon the Constitution\r\nconcur in the construction thus early given by Congress, and thus\r\nsanctioned by the Supreme Court. After a full analysis of the\r\nCongressional debate to which I have referred, Mr. Justice Story comes\r\nto this conclusion:\r\n\r\n  After a most animated discussion, the vote finally taken in the House\r\n  of Representatives was affirmative of the power of removal in the\r\n  President, without any cooperation of the Senate, by the vote of 34\r\n  members against 20. In the Senate the clause in the bill affirming the\r\n  power was carried by the casting vote of the Vice-President. That the\r\n  final decision of this question so made was greatly influenced by the\r\n  exalted character of the President then in office was asserted at the\r\n  time and has always been believed; yet the doctrine was opposed as well\r\n  as supported by the highest talents and patriotism of the country. The\r\n  public have acquiesced in this decision, and it constitutes, perhaps,\r\n  the most extraordinary case in the history of the Government of a power\r\n  conferred by implication on the Executive by the assent of a bare\r\n  majority of Congress which has not been questioned on many other\r\n  occasions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commentator adds:\r\n\r\n  Nor is this general acquiescence and silence without a satisfactory\r\n  explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\nChancellor Kent's remarks on the subject are as follows:\r\n\r\n  On the first organization of the Government it was made a question\r\n  whether the power of removal in case of officers appointed to hold\r\n  at pleasure resided nowhere but in the body which appointed, and, of\r\n  course, whether the consent of the Senate was not requisite to remove.\r\n  This was the construction given to the Constitution, while it was\r\n  pending for ratification before the State conventions, by the author of\r\n  the Federalist. But the construction which was given to the Constitution\r\n  by Congress, after great consideration and discussion, was different.\r\n  The words of the act [establishing the Treasury Department] are: \"And\r\n  whenever the same shall be removed from office by the President of\r\n  the United States, or in any other case of vacancy in the office, the\r\n  assistant shall act.\" This amounted to a legislative construction of the\r\n  Constitution, and it has ever since been acquiesced in and acted upon\r\n  as a decisive authority in the case. It applies equally to every other\r\n  officer of the Government appointed by the President, whose term of\r\n  duration is not specially declared. It is supported by the weighty\r\n  reason that the subordinate officers in the executive department ought\r\n  to hold at the pleasure of the head of the department, because he is\r\n  invested generally with the executive authority, and the participation\r\n  in that authority by the Senate was an exception to a general principle\r\n  and ought to be taken strictly. The President is the great responsible\r\n  officer for the faithful execution of the law, and the power of removal\r\n  was incidental to that duty, and might often be requisite to fulfill it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus has the important question presented by this bill been settled, in\r\nthe language of the late Daniel Webster (who, while dissenting from it,\r\nadmitted that it was settled), by construction, settled by precedent,\r\nsettled by the practice of the Government, and settled by statute. The\r\nevents of the last war furnished a practical confirmation of the wisdom\r\nof the Constitution as it has hitherto been maintained in many of its\r\nparts, including that which is now the subject of consideration. When\r\nthe war broke out, rebel enemies, traitors, abettors, and sympathizers\r\nwere found in every Department of the Government, as well in the civil\r\nservice as in the land and naval military service. They were found in\r\nCongress and among the keepers of the Capitol; in foreign missions; in\r\neach and all the Executive Departments; in the judicial service; in the\r\npost-office, and among the agents for conducting Indian affairs. Upon\r\nprobable suspicion they were promptly displaced by my predecessor, so\r\nfar as they held their offices under executive authority, and their\r\nduties were confided to new and loyal successors. No complaints against\r\nthat power or doubts of its wisdom were entertained in any quarter. I\r\nsincerely trust and believe that no such civil war is likely to occur\r\nagain. I can not doubt, however, that in whatever form and on whatever\r\noccasion sedition can raise an effort to hinder or embarrass or defeat\r\nthe legitimate action of this Government, whether by preventing the\r\ncollection of revenue, or disturbing the public peace, or separating the\r\nStates, or betraying the country to a foreign enemy, the power of\r\nremoval from office by the Executive, as it has heretofore existed and\r\nbeen practiced, will be found indispensable.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, as a depositary of the executive authority of\r\nthe nation, I do not feel at liberty to unite with Congress in reversing\r\nit by giving my approval to the bill. At the early day when this\r\nquestion was settled, and, indeed, at the several periods when it has\r\nsubsequently been agitated, the success of the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, as a new and peculiar system of free representative\r\ngovernment, was held doubtful in other countries, and was even a subject\r\nof patriotic apprehension among the American people themselves. A trial\r\nof nearly eighty years, through the vicissitudes of foreign conflicts\r\nand of civil war, is confidently regarded as having extinguished all\r\nsuch doubts and apprehensions for the future. During that eighty years\r\nthe people of the United States have enjoyed a measure of security,\r\npeace, prosperity, and happiness never surpassed by any nation. It can\r\nnot be doubted that the triumphant success of the Constitution is due\r\nto the wonderful wisdom with which the functions of government were\r\ndistributed between the three principal departments--the legislative,\r\nthe executive, and the judicial--and to the fidelity with which each\r\nhas confined itself or been confined by the general voice of the nation\r\nwithin its peculiar and proper sphere. While a just, proper, and\r\nwatchful jealousy of executive power constantly prevails, as it ought\r\never to prevail, yet it is equally true that an efficient Executive,\r\ncapable, in the language of the oath prescribed to the President, of\r\nexecuting the laws and, within the sphere of executive action, of\r\npreserving, protecting, and defending the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, is an indispensable security for tranquillity at home and peace,\r\nhonor, and safety abroad. Governments have been erected in many\r\ncountries upon our model. If one or many of them have thus far failed in\r\nfully securing to their people the benefits which we have derived from\r\nour system, it may be confidently asserted that their misfortune has\r\nresulted from their unfortunate failure to maintain the integrity of\r\neach of the three great departments while preserving harmony among\r\nthem all.\r\n\r\nHaving at an early period accepted the Constitution in regard to the\r\nExecutive office in the sense in which it was interpreted with the\r\nconcurrence of its founders, I have found no sufficient grounds in the\r\narguments now opposed to that construction or in any assumed necessity\r\nof the times for changing those opinions. For these reasons I return\r\nthe bill to the Senate, in which House it originated, for the further\r\nconsideration of Congress which the Constitution prescribes. Insomuch as\r\nthe several parts of the bill which I have not considered are matters\r\nchiefly of detail and are based altogether upon the theory of the\r\nConstitution from which I am obliged to dissent, I have not thought\r\nit necessary to examine them with a view to make them an occasion of\r\ndistinct and special objections.\r\n\r\nExperience, I think, has shown that it is the easiest, as it is\r\nalso the most attractive, of studies to frame constitutions for the\r\nself-government of free states and nations. But I think experience has\r\nequally shown that it is the most difficult of all political labors to\r\npreserve and maintain such free constitutions of self-government when\r\nonce happily established. I know no other way in which they can be\r\npreserved and maintained except by a constant adherence to them through\r\nthe various vicissitudes of national existence, with such adaptations\r\nas may become necessary, always to be effected, however, through the\r\nagencies and in the forms prescribed in the original constitutions\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nWhenever administration fails or seems to fail in securing any of the\r\ngreat ends for which republican government is established, the proper\r\ncourse seems to be to renew the original spirit and forms of the\r\nConstitution itself.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 2, 1867_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have examined the bill \"to provide for the more efficient government\r\nof the rebel States\" with the care and anxiety which its transcendent\r\nimportance is calculated to awaken. I am unable to give it my assent,\r\nfor reasons so grave that I hope a statement of them may have some\r\ninfluence on the minds of the patriotic and enlightened men with whom\r\nthe decision must ultimately rest.\r\n\r\nThe bill places all the people of the ten States therein named under the\r\nabsolute domination of military rulers; and the preamble undertakes to\r\ngive the reason upon which the measure is based and the ground upon\r\nwhich it is justified. It declares that there exists in those States no\r\nlegal governments and no adequate protection for life or property, and\r\nasserts the necessity of enforcing peace and good order within their\r\nlimits. Is this true as matter of fact?\r\n\r\nIt is not denied that the States in question have each of them\r\nan actual government, with all the powers--executive, judicial, and\r\nlegislative--which properly belong to a free state. They are organized\r\nlike the other States of the Union, and, like them, they make,\r\nadminister, and execute the laws which concern their domestic affairs.\r\nAn existing _de facto_ government, exercising such functions as these,\r\nis itself the law of the state upon all matters within its jurisdiction.\r\nTo pronounce the supreme law-making power of an established state\r\nillegal is to say that law itself is unlawful.\r\n\r\nThe provisions which these governments have made for the preservation\r\nof order, the suppression of crime, and the redress of private injuries\r\nare in substance and principle the same as those which prevail in the\r\nNorthern States and in other civilized countries. They certainly have\r\nnot succeeded in preventing the commission of all crime, nor has this\r\nbeen accomplished anywhere in the world. There, as well as elsewhere,\r\noffenders sometimes escape for want of vigorous prosecution, and\r\noccasionally, perhaps, by the inefficiency of courts or the prejudice of\r\njurors. It is undoubtedly true that these evils have been much increased\r\nand aggravated, North and South, by the demoralizing influences of civil\r\nwar and by the rancorous passions which the contest has engendered. But\r\nthat these people are maintaining local governments for themselves which\r\nhabitually defeat the object of all government and render their own\r\nlives and property insecure is in itself utterly improbable, and the\r\naverment of the bill to that effect is not supported by any evidence\r\nwhich has come to my knowledge. All the information I have on the\r\nsubject convinces me that the masses of the Southern people and those\r\nwho control their public acts, while they entertain diverse opinions\r\non questions of Federal policy, are completely united in the effort to\r\nreorganize their society on the basis of peace and to restore their\r\nmutual prosperity as rapidly and as completely as their circumstances\r\nwill permit.\r\n\r\nThe bill, however, would seem to show upon its face that the\r\nestablishment of peace and good order is not its real object. The fifth\r\nsection declares that the preceding sections shall cease to operate in\r\nany State where certain events shall have happened. These events are,\r\nfirst, the selection of delegates to a State convention by an election\r\nat which negroes shall be allowed to vote; second, the formation of a\r\nState constitution by the convention so chosen; third, the insertion\r\ninto the State constitution of a provision which will secure the right\r\nof voting at all elections to negroes and to such white men as may\r\nnot be disfranchised for rebellion or felony; fourth, the submission\r\nof the constitution for ratification to negroes and white men not\r\ndisfranchised, and its actual ratification by their vote; fifth, the\r\nsubmission of the State constitution to Congress for examination and\r\napproval, and the actual approval of it by that body; sixth, the\r\nadoption of a certain amendment to the Federal Constitution by a vote\r\nof the legislature elected under the new constitution; seventh, the\r\nadoption of said amendment by a sufficient number of other States to\r\nmake it a part of the Constitution of the United States. All these\r\nconditions must be fulfilled before the people of any of these States\r\ncan be relieved from the bondage of military domination; but when they\r\nare fulfilled, then immediately the pains and penalties of the bill are\r\nto cease, no matter whether there be peace and order or not, and without\r\nany reference to the security of life or property. The excuse given for\r\nthe bill in the preamble is admitted by the bill itself not to be real.\r\nThe military rule which it establishes is plainly to be used, not for\r\nany purpose of order or for the prevention of crime, but solely as\r\na means of coercing the people into the adoption of principles and\r\nmeasures to which it is known that they are opposed, and upon which\r\nthey have an undeniable right to exercise their own judgment.\r\n\r\nI submit to Congress whether this measure is not in its whole character,\r\nscope, and object without precedent and without authority, in palpable\r\nconflict with the plainest provisions of the Constitution, and utterly\r\ndestructive to those great principles of liberty and humanity for which\r\nour ancestors on both sides of the Atlantic have shed so much blood and\r\nexpended so much treasure.\r\n\r\nThe ten States named in the bill are divided into five districts.\r\nFor each district an officer of the Army, not below the rank of a\r\nbrigadier-general, is to be appointed to rule over the people; and he\r\nis to be supported with an efficient military force to enable him to\r\nperform his duties and enforce his authority. Those duties and that\r\nauthority, as defined by the third section of the bill, are \"to protect\r\nall persons in their rights of person and property, to suppress\r\ninsurrection, disorder, and violence, and to punish or cause to be\r\npunished all disturbers of the public peace or criminals.\" The power\r\nthus given to the commanding officer over all the people of each\r\ndistrict is that of an absolute monarch. His mere will is to take the\r\nplace of all law. The law of the States is now the only rule applicable\r\nto the subjects placed under his control, and that is completely\r\ndisplaced by the clause which declares all interference of State\r\nauthority to be null and void. He alone is permitted to determine what\r\nare rights of person or property, and he may protect them in such way as\r\nin his discretion may seem proper. It places at his free disposal all\r\nthe lands and goods in his district, and he may distribute them without\r\nlet or hindrance to whom he pleases. Being bound by no State law, and\r\nthere being no other law to regulate the subject, he may make a criminal\r\ncode of his own; and he can make it as bloody as any recorded in\r\nhistory, or he can reserve the privilege of acting upon the impulse of\r\nhis private passions in each case that arises. He is bound by no rules\r\nof evidence; there is, indeed, no provision by which he is authorized or\r\nrequired to take any evidence at all. Everything is a crime which he\r\nchooses to call so, and all persons are condemned whom he pronounces to\r\nbe guilty. He is not bound to keep any record or make any report of his\r\nproceedings. He may arrest his victims wherever he finds them, without\r\nwarrant, accusation, or proof of probable cause. If he gives them a\r\ntrial before he inflicts the punishment, he gives it of his grace and\r\nmercy, not because he is commanded so to do.\r\n\r\nTo a casual reader of the bill it might seem that some kind of trial was\r\nsecured by it to persons accused of crime, but such is not the case.\r\nThe officer \"may allow local civil tribunals to try offenders,\" but\r\nof course this does not require that he shall do so. If any State or\r\nFederal court presumes to exercise its legal jurisdiction by the trial\r\nof a malefactor without his special permission, he can break it up and\r\npunish the judges and jurors as being themselves malefactors. He can\r\nsave his friends from justice, and despoil his enemies contrary to\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nIt is also provided that \"he shall have power to organize military\r\ncommissions or tribunals:\" but this power he is not commanded to\r\nexercise. It is merely permissive, and is to be used only \"when in his\r\njudgment it may be necessary for the trial of offenders.\" Even if the\r\nsentence of a commission were made a prerequisite to the punishment\r\nof a party, it would be scarcely the slightest check upon the officer,\r\nwho has authority to organize it as he pleases, prescribe its mode of\r\nproceeding, appoint its members from his own subordinates, and revise\r\nall its decisions. Instead of mitigating the harshness of his single\r\nrule, such a tribunal would be used much more probably to divide the\r\nresponsibility of making it more cruel and unjust.\r\n\r\nSeveral provisions dictated by the humanity of Congress have\r\nbeen inserted in the bill, apparently to restrain the power of the\r\ncommanding officer; but it seems to me that they are of no avail for\r\nthat purpose. The fourth section provides: First. That trials shall not\r\nbe unnecessarily delayed; but I think I have shown that the power is\r\ngiven to punish without trial; and if so, this provision is practically\r\ninoperative. Second. Cruel or unusual punishment is not to be inflicted;\r\nbut who is to decide what is cruel and what is unusual? The words have\r\nacquired a legal meaning by long use in the courts. Can it be expected\r\nthat military officers will understand or follow a rule expressed in\r\nlanguage so purely technical and not pertaining in the least degree\r\nto their profession? If not, then each officer may define cruelty\r\naccording to his own temper, and if it is not usual he will make it\r\nusual. Corporal punishment, imprisonment, the gag, the ball and chain,\r\nand all the almost insupportable forms of torture invented for military\r\npunishment lie within the range of choice. Third. The sentence of\r\na commission is not to be executed without being approved by the\r\ncommander, if it affects life or liberty, and a sentence of death must\r\nbe approved by the President. This applies to cases in which there has\r\nbeen a trial and sentence. I take it to be clear, under this bill, that\r\nthe military commander may condemn to death without even the form of a\r\ntrial by a military commission, so that the life of the condemned may\r\ndepend upon the will of two men instead of one.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that the authority here given to the military officer\r\namounts to absolute despotism. But to make it still more unendurable,\r\nthe bill provides that it may be delegated to as many subordinates as he\r\nchooses to appoint, for it declares that he shall \"punish or cause to be\r\npunished.\" Such a power has not been wielded by any monarch in England\r\nfor more than five hundred years. In all that time no people who speak\r\nthe English language have borne such servitude. It reduces the whole\r\npopulation of the ten States--all persons, of every color, sex, and\r\ncondition, and every stranger within their limits--to the most abject\r\nand degrading slavery. No master ever had a control so absolute over the\r\nslaves as this bill gives to the military officers over both white and\r\ncolored persons.\r\n\r\nIt may be answered to this that the officers of the Army are too\r\nmagnanimous, just, and humane to oppress and trample upon a subjugated\r\npeople. I do not doubt that army officers are as well entitled to this\r\nkind of confidence as any other class of men. But the history of the\r\nworld has been written in vain if it does not teach us that unrestrained\r\nauthority can never be safely trusted in human hands. It is almost sure\r\nto be more or less abused under any circumstances, and it has always\r\nresulted in gross tyranny where the rulers who exercise it are strangers\r\nto their subjects and come among them as the representatives of a\r\ndistant power, and more especially when the power that sends them is\r\nunfriendly. Governments closely resembling that here proposed have been\r\nfairly tried in Hungary and Poland, and the suffering endured by those\r\npeople roused the sympathies of the entire world. It was tried in\r\nIreland, and, though tempered at first by principles of English law,\r\nit gave birth to cruelties so atrocious that they are never recounted\r\nwithout just indignation. The French Convention armed its deputies with\r\nthis power and sent them to the southern departments of the Republic.\r\nThe massacres, murders, and other atrocities which they committed show\r\nwhat the passions of the ablest men in the most civilized society will\r\ntempt them to do when wholly unrestrained by law.\r\n\r\nThe men of our race in every age have struggled to tie up the hands\r\nof their governments and keep them within the law, because their own\r\nexperience of all mankind taught them that rulers could not be relied\r\non to concede those lights which they were not legally bound to respect.\r\nThe head of a great empire has sometimes governed it with a mild and\r\npaternal sway, but the kindness of an irresponsible deputy never yields\r\nwhat the law does not extort from him. Between such a master and the\r\npeople subjected to his domination there can be nothing but enmity; he\r\npunishes them if they resist his authority, and if they submit to it\r\nhe hates them for their servility.\r\n\r\nI come now to a question which is, if possible, still more important.\r\nHave we the power to establish and carry into execution a measure like\r\nthis? I answer, Certainly not, if we derive our authority from the\r\nConstitution and if we are bound by the limitations which it imposes.\r\n\r\nThis proposition is perfectly clear, that no branch of the Federal\r\nGovernment--executive, legislative, or judicial--can have any just\r\npowers except those which it derives through and exercises under the\r\norganic law of the Union. Outside of the Constitution we have no legal\r\nauthority more than private citizens, and within it we have only so\r\nmuch as that instrument gives us. This broad principle limits all our\r\nfunctions and applies to all subjects. It protects not only the citizens\r\nof States which are within the Union, but it shields every human being\r\nwho comes or is brought under our jurisdiction. We have no right to do\r\nin one place more than in another that which the Constitution says we\r\nshall not do at all. If, therefore, the Southern States were in truth\r\nout of the Union, we could not treat their people in a way which the\r\nfundamental law forbids.\r\n\r\nSome persons assume that the success of our arms in crushing the\r\nopposition which was made in some of the States to the execution of the\r\nFederal laws reduced those States and all their people--the innocent as\r\nwell as the guilty--to the condition of vassalage and gave us a power\r\nover them which the Constitution does not bestow or define or limit.\r\nNo fallacy can be more transparent than this. Our victories subjected\r\nthe insurgents to legal obedience, not to the yoke of an arbitrary\r\ndespotism. When an absolute sovereign reduces his rebellious subjects,\r\nhe may deal with them according to his pleasure, because he had that\r\npower before. But when a limited monarch puts down an insurrection, he\r\nmust still govern according to law. If an insurrection should take place\r\nin one of our States against the authority of the State government and\r\nend in the overthrow of those who planned it, would that take away the\r\nrights of all the people of the counties where it was favored by a part\r\nor a majority of the population? Could they for such a reason be wholly\r\noutlawed and deprived of their representation in the legislature? I have\r\nalways contended that the Government of the United States was sovereign\r\nwithin its constitutional sphere; that it executed its laws, like\r\nthe States themselves, by applying its coercive power directly to\r\nindividuals, and that it could put down insurrection with the same\r\neffect as a State and no other. The opposite doctrine is the worst\r\nheresy of those who advocated secession, and can not be agreed to\r\nwithout admitting that heresy to be right.\r\n\r\nInvasion, insurrection, rebellion, and domestic violence were\r\nanticipated when the Government was framed, and the means of repelling\r\nand suppressing them were wisely provided for in the Constitution; but\r\nit was not thought necessary to declare that the States in which they\r\nmight occur should be expelled from the Union. Rebellions, which were\r\ninvariably suppressed, occurred prior to that out of which these\r\nquestions grow; but the States continued to exist and the Union remained\r\nunbroken. In Massachusetts, in Pennsylvania, in Rhode Island, and in New\r\nYork, at different periods in our history, violent and armed opposition\r\nto the United States was carried on; but the relations of those States\r\nwith the Federal Government were not supposed to be interrupted or\r\nchanged thereby after the rebellious portions of their population were\r\ndefeated and put down. It is true that in these earlier cases there was\r\nno formal expression of a determination to withdraw from the Union, but\r\nit is also true that in the Southern States the ordinances of secession\r\nwere treated by all the friends of the Union as mere nullities and are\r\nnow acknowledged to be so by the States themselves. If we admit that\r\nthey had any force or validity or that they did in fact take the States\r\nin which they were passed out of the Union, we sweep from under our feet\r\nall the grounds upon which we stand in justifying the use of Federal\r\nforce to maintain the integrity of the Government.\r\n\r\nThis is a bill passed by Congress in time of peace. There is not\r\nin any one of the States brought under its operation either war or\r\ninsurrection. The laws of the States and of the Federal Government are\r\nall in undisturbed and harmonious operation. The courts, State and\r\nFederal, are open and in the full exercise of their proper authority.\r\nOver every State comprised in these five military districts, life,\r\nliberty, and property are secured by State laws and Federal laws, and\r\nthe National Constitution is everywhere in force and everywhere obeyed.\r\nWhat, then, is the ground on which this bill proceeds? The title of the\r\nbill announces that it is intended \"for the more efficient government\"\r\nof these ten States. It is recited by way of preamble that no legal\r\nState governments \"nor adequate protection for life or property\" exist\r\nin those States, and that peace and good order should be thus enforced.\r\nThe first thing which arrests attention upon these recitals, which\r\nprepare the way for martial law, is this, that the only foundation\r\nupon which martial law can exist under our form of government is not\r\nstated or so much as pretended. Actual war, foreign invasion, domestic\r\ninsurrection--none of these appear; and none of these, in fact, exist.\r\nIt is not even recited that any sort of war or insurrection is\r\nthreatened. Let us pause here to consider, upon this question of\r\nconstitutional law and the power of Congress, a recent decision of\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States in _ex parte_ Milligan.\r\n\r\nI will first quote from the opinion of the majority of the court:\r\n\r\n  Martial law can not arise from a threatened invasion. The necessity\r\n  must be actual and present, the invasion real, such as effectually\r\n  closes the courts and deposes the civil administration.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe see that martial law comes in only when actual war closes the courts\r\nand deposes the civil authority; but this bill, in time of peace, makes\r\nmartial law operate as though we were in actual war, and becomes the\r\n_cause_ instead of the _consequence_ of the abrogation of civil\r\nauthority. One more quotation:\r\n\r\n  It follows from what has been said on this subject that there are\r\n  occasions when martial law can be properly applied. If in foreign\r\n  invasion or civil war the courts are actually closed, and it is\r\n  impossible to administer criminal justice according to law, _then_, on\r\n  the theater of active military operations, where war really prevails,\r\n  there is a necessity to furnish a substitute for the civil authority\r\n  thus overthrown, to preserve the safety of the army and society; and as\r\n  no power is left but the military, it is allowed to govern by martial\r\n  rule until the laws can have their free course.\r\n\r\n\r\nI now quote from the opinion of the minority of the court, delivered by\r\nChief Justice Chase:\r\n\r\n  We by no means assert that Congress can establish and apply the laws of\r\n  war where no war has been declared or exists. Where peace exists, the\r\n  laws of peace must prevail.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is sufficiently explicit. Peace exists in all the territory to\r\nwhich this bill applies. It asserts a power in Congress, in time of\r\npeace, to set aside the laws of peace and to substitute the laws of war.\r\nThe minority, concurring with the majority, declares that Congress does\r\nnot possess that power. Again, and, if possible, more emphatically, the\r\nChief Justice, with remarkable clearness and condensation, sums up the\r\nwhole matter as follows:\r\n\r\n  There are under the Constitution three kinds of military\r\n  jurisdiction--one to be exercised both in peace and war; another to be\r\n  exercised in time of foreign war without the boundaries of the United\r\n  States, or in time of rebellion and civil war within States or districts\r\n  occupied by rebels treated as belligerents; and a third to be exercised\r\n  in time of invasion or insurrection within the limits of the United\r\n  States, or during rebellion within the limits of the States maintaining\r\n  adhesion to the National Government, when the public danger requires its\r\n  exercise. The first of these may be called jurisdiction under military\r\n  law, and is found in acts of Congress prescribing rules and articles of\r\n  war or otherwise providing for the government of the national forces;\r\n  the second may be distinguished as military government, superseding\r\n  as far as may be deemed expedient the local law, and exercised by\r\n  the military commander under the direction of the President, with\r\n  the express or implied sanction of Congress; while the third may be\r\n  denominated martial law proper, and is called into action by Congress,\r\n  or temporarily, when the action of Congress can not be invited, and in\r\n  the case of justifying or excusing peril, by the President, in times of\r\n  insurrection or invasion or of civil or foreign war, within districts\r\n  or localities where ordinary law no longer adequately secures public\r\n  safety and private rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that of the three kinds of military jurisdiction\r\nwhich can be exercised or created under our Constitution there is but\r\none that can prevail in time of peace, and that is the code of laws\r\nenacted by Congress for the government of the national forces. That body\r\nof military law has no application to the citizen, nor even to the\r\ncitizen soldier enrolled in the militia in time of peace. But this bill\r\nis not a part of that sort of military law, for that applies only to the\r\nsoldier and not to the citizen, whilst, contrariwise, the military law\r\nprovided by this bill applies only to the citizen and not to the\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\nI need not say to the representatives of the American people that their\r\nConstitution forbids the exercise of judicial power in any way but\r\none--that is, by the ordained and established courts. It is equally well\r\nknown that in all criminal cases a trial by jury is made indispensable\r\nby the express words of that instrument. I will not enlarge on the\r\ninestimable value of the right thus secured to every freeman or speak\r\nof the danger to public liberty in all parts of the country which must\r\nensue from a denial of it anywhere or upon any pretense. A very recent\r\ndecision of the Supreme Court has traced the history, vindicated the\r\ndignity, and made known the value of this great privilege so clearly\r\nthat nothing more is needed. To what extent a violation of it might be\r\nexcused in time of war or public danger may admit of discussion, but we\r\nare providing now for a time of profound peace, when there is not an\r\narmed soldier within our borders except those who are in the service\r\nof the Government. It is in such a condition of things that an act of\r\nCongress is proposed which, if carried out, would deny a trial by the\r\nlawful courts and juries to 9,000,000 American citizens and to their\r\nposterity for an indefinite period. It seems to be scarcely possible\r\nthat anyone should seriously believe this consistent with a Constitution\r\nwhich declares in simple, plain, and unambiguous language that all\r\npersons shall have that right and that no person shall ever in any case\r\nbe deprived of it. The Constitution also forbids the arrest of the\r\ncitizen without judicial warrant, founded on probable cause. This bill\r\nauthorizes an arrest without warrant, at the pleasure of a military\r\ncommander. The Constitution declares that \"no person shall be held to\r\nanswer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on presentment\r\nby a grand jury.\" This bill holds every person not a soldier answerable\r\nfor all crimes and all charges without any presentment. The Constitution\r\ndeclares that \"no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property\r\nwithout due process of law.\" This bill sets aside all process of law,\r\nand makes the citizen answerable in his person and property to the\r\nwill of one man, and as to his life to the will of two. Finally, the\r\nConstitution declares that \"the privilege of the writ of _habeas corpus_\r\nshall not be suspended unless when, in case of rebellion or invasion,\r\nthe public safety may require it;\" whereas this bill declares martial\r\nlaw (which of itself suspends this great writ) in time of peace, and\r\nauthorizes the military to make the arrest, and gives to the prisoner\r\nonly one privilege, and that is a trial \"without unnecessary delay.\"\r\nHe has no hope of release from custody, except the hope, such as it is,\r\nof release by acquittal before a military commission.\r\n\r\nThe United States are bound to guarantee to each State a republican form\r\nof government. Can it be pretended that this obligation is not palpably\r\nbroken if we carry out a measure like this, which wipes away every\r\nvestige of republican government in ten States and puts the life,\r\nproperty, liberty, and honor of all the people in each of them under\r\nthe domination of a single person clothed with unlimited authority?\r\n\r\nThe Parliament of England, exercising the omnipotent power which it\r\nclaimed, was accustomed to pass bills of attainder; that is to say, it\r\nwould convict men of treason and other crimes by legislative enactment.\r\nThe person accused had a hearing, sometimes a patient and fair one, but\r\ngenerally party prejudice prevailed instead of justice. It often became\r\nnecessary for Parliament to acknowledge its error and reverse its own\r\naction. The fathers of our country determined that no such thing should\r\noccur here. They withheld the power from Congress, and thus forbade its\r\nexercise by that body, and they provided in the Constitution that no\r\nState should pass any bill of attainder. It is therefore impossible for\r\nany person in this country to be constitutionally convicted or punished\r\nfor any crime by a legislative proceeding of any sort. Nevertheless,\r\nhere is a bill of attainder against 9,000,000 people at once. It is\r\nbased upon an accusation so vague as to be scarcely intelligible and\r\nfound to be true upon no credible evidence. Not one of the 9,000,000 was\r\nheard in his own defense. The representatives of the doomed parties were\r\nexcluded from all participation in the trial. The conviction is to be\r\nfollowed by the most ignominious punishment ever inflicted on large\r\nmasses of men. It disfranchises them by hundreds of thousands and\r\ndegrades them all, even those who are admitted to be guiltless, from\r\nthe rank of freemen to the condition of slaves.\r\n\r\nThe purpose and object of the bill--the general intent which pervades it\r\nfrom beginning to end--is to change the entire structure and character\r\nof the State governments and to compel them by force to the adoption of\r\norganic laws and regulations which they are unwilling to accept if left\r\nto themselves. The negroes have not asked for the privilege of voting;\r\nthe vast majority of them have no idea what it means. This bill not only\r\nthrusts it into their hands, but compels them, as well as the whites, to\r\nuse it in a particular way. If they do not form a constitution with\r\nprescribed articles in it and afterwards elect a legislature which will\r\nact upon certain measures in a prescribed way, neither blacks nor whites\r\ncan be relieved from the slavery which the bill imposes upon them.\r\nWithout pausing here to consider the policy or impolicy of Africanizing\r\nthe southern part of our territory, I would simply ask the attention of\r\nCongress to that manifest, well-known, and universally acknowledged rule\r\nof constitutional law which declares that the Federal Government has no\r\njurisdiction, authority, or power to regulate such subjects for any\r\nState. To force the right of suffrage out of the hands of the white\r\npeople and into the hands of the negroes is an arbitrary violation of\r\nthis principle.\r\n\r\nThis bill imposes martial law at once, and its operations will begin\r\nso soon as the general and his troops can be put in place. The dread\r\nalternative between its harsh rule and compliance with the terms of this\r\nmeasure is not suspended, nor are the people afforded any time for free\r\ndeliberation. The bill says to them, take martial law first, _then_\r\ndeliberate. And when they have done all that this measure requires them\r\nto do other conditions and contingencies over which they have no control\r\nyet remain to be fulfilled before they can be relieved from martial law.\r\nAnother Congress must first approve the Constitution made in conformity\r\nwith the will of this Congress and must declare these States entitled to\r\nrepresentation in both Houses. The whole question thus remains open and\r\nunsettled and must again occupy the attention of Congress; and in the\r\nmeantime the agitation which now prevails will continue to disturb all\r\nportions of the people.\r\n\r\nThe bill also denies the legality of the governments of ten of the\r\nStates which participated in the ratification of the amendment to the\r\nFederal Constitution abolishing slavery forever within the jurisdiction\r\nof the United States and practically excludes them from the Union. If\r\nthis assumption of the bill be correct, their concurrence can not be\r\nconsidered as having been legally given, and the important fact is made\r\nto appear that the consent of three-fourths of the States--the requisite\r\nnumber--has not been constitutionally obtained to the ratification of\r\nthat amendment, thus leaving the question of slavery where it stood\r\nbefore the amendment was officially declared to have become a part of\r\nthe Constitution.\r\n\r\nThat the measure proposed by this bill does violate the Constitution\r\nin the particulars mentioned and in many other ways which I forbear\r\nto enumerate is too clear to admit of the least doubt. It only remains\r\nto consider whether the injunctions of that instrument ought to be\r\nobeyed or not. I think they ought to be obeyed, for reasons which I will\r\nproceed to give as briefly as possible.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is the only system of free government which we\r\ncan hope to have as a nation. When it ceases to be the rule of our\r\nconduct, we may perhaps take our choice between complete anarchy, a\r\nconsolidated despotism, and a total dissolution of the Union; but\r\nnational liberty regulated by law will have passed beyond our reach.\r\n\r\nIt is the best frame of government the world ever saw. No other is or\r\ncan be so well adapted to the genius, habits, or wants of the American\r\npeople. Combining the strength of a great empire with unspeakable\r\nblessings of local self-government, having a central power to defend the\r\ngeneral interests, and recognizing the authority of the States as the\r\nguardians of industrial rights, it is \"the sheet anchor of our safety\r\nabroad and our peace at home.\" It was ordained \"to form a more perfect\r\nunion, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, promote the\r\ngeneral welfare, provide for the common defense, and secure the\r\nblessings of liberty to ourselves and to our posterity.\" These great\r\nends have been attained heretofore, and will be again by faithful\r\nobedience to it; but they are certain to be lost if we treat with\r\ndisregard its sacred obligations.\r\n\r\nIt was to punish the gross crime of defying the Constitution and to\r\nvindicate its supreme authority that we carried on a bloody war of four\r\nyears' duration. Shall we now acknowledge that we sacrificed a million\r\nof lives and expended billions of treasure to enforce a Constitution\r\nwhich is not worthy of respect and preservation?\r\n\r\nThose who advocated the right of secession alleged in their own\r\njustification that we had no regard for law and that their rights of\r\nproperty, life, and liberty would not be safe under the Constitution as\r\nadministered by us. If we now verify their assertion, we prove that they\r\nwere in truth and in fact fighting for their liberty, and instead of\r\nbranding their leaders with the dishonoring name of traitors against a\r\nrighteous and legal government we elevate them in history to the rank\r\nof self-sacrificing patriots, consecrate them to the admiration of the\r\nworld, and place them by the side of Washington, Hampden, and Sidney.\r\nNo; let us leave them to the infamy they deserve, punish them as they\r\nshould be punished, according to law, and take upon ourselves no share\r\nof the odium which they should bear alone.\r\n\r\nIt is a part of our public history which can never be forgotten that\r\nboth Houses of Congress, in July, 1861, declared in the form of a solemn\r\nresolution that the war was and should be carried on for no purpose of\r\nsubjugation, but solely to enforce the Constitution and laws, and that\r\nwhen this was yielded by the parties in rebellion the contest should\r\ncease, with the constitutional rights of the States and of individuals\r\nunimpaired. This resolution was adopted and sent forth to the world\r\nunanimously by the Senate and with only two dissenting voices in the\r\nHouse. It was accepted by the friends of the Union in the South as well\r\nas in the North as expressing honestly and truly the object of the war.\r\nOn the faith of it many thousands of persons in both sections gave their\r\nlives and their fortunes to the cause. To repudiate it now by refusing\r\nto the States and to the individuals within them the rights which the\r\nConstitution and laws of the Union would secure to them is a breach of\r\nour plighted honor for which I can imagine no excuse and to which I\r\ncannot voluntarily become a party.\r\n\r\nThe evils which spring from the unsettled state of our Government will\r\nbe acknowledged by all. Commercial intercourse is impeded, capital is in\r\nconstant peril, public securities fluctuate in value, peace itself is\r\nnot secure, and the sense of moral and political duty is impaired. To\r\navert these calamities from our country it is imperatively required that\r\nwe should immediately decide upon some course of administration which\r\ncan be steadfastly adhered to. I am thoroughly convinced that any\r\nsettlement or compromise or plan of action which is inconsistent with\r\nthe principles of the Constitution will not only be unavailing, but\r\nmischievous; that it will but multiply the present evils, instead of\r\nremoving them. The Constitution, in its whole integrity and vigor,\r\nthroughout the length and breadth of the land, is the best of all\r\ncompromises. Besides, our duty does not, in my judgment, leave us a\r\nchoice between that and any other. I believe that it contains the remedy\r\nthat is so much needed, and that if the coordinate branches of the\r\nGovernment would unite upon its provisions they would be found broad\r\nenough and strong enough to sustain in time of peace the nation which\r\nthey bore safely through the ordeal of a protracted civil war. Among the\r\nmost sacred guaranties of that instrument are those which declare that\r\n\"each State shall have at least one Representative,\" and that \"no\r\nState, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in\r\nthe Senate.\" Each House is made the \"judge of the elections, returns,\r\nand qualifications of its own members,\" and may, \"with the concurrence\r\nof two-thirds, expel a member.\" Thus, as heretofore urged, \"in the\r\nadmission of Senators and Representatives from any and all of the\r\nStates there can be no just ground of apprehension that persons who are\r\ndisloyal will be clothed with the powers of legislation, for this could\r\nnot happen when the Constitution and the laws are enforced by a vigilant\r\nand faithful Congress.\" \"When a Senator or Representative presents his\r\ncertificate of election, he may at once be admitted or rejected; or,\r\nshould there be any question as to his eligibility, his credentials may\r\nbe referred for investigation to the appropriate committee. If admitted\r\nto a seat, it must be upon evidence satisfactory to the House of which\r\nhe thus becomes a member that he possesses the requisite constitutional\r\nand legal qualifications. If refused admission as a member for want of\r\ndue allegiance to the Government, and returned to his constituents, they\r\nare admonished that none but persons loyal to the United States will be\r\nallowed a voice in the legislative councils of the nation, and the\r\npolitical power and moral influence of Congress are thus effectively\r\nexerted in the interests of loyalty to the Government and fidelity to\r\nthe Union.\" And is it not far better that the work of restoration should\r\nbe accomplished by simple compliance with the plain requirements of the\r\nConstitution than by a recourse to measures which in effect destroy the\r\nStates and threaten the subversion of the General Government? All that\r\nis necessary to settle this simple but important question without\r\nfurther agitation or delay is a willingness on the part of all to\r\nsustain the Constitution and carry its provisions into practical\r\noperation. If to-morrow either branch of Congress would declare that\r\nupon the presentation of their credentials members constitutionally\r\nelected and loyal to the General Government would be admitted to seats\r\nin Congress, while all others would be excluded and their places remain\r\nvacant until the selection by the people of loyal and qualified persons,\r\nand if at the same time assurance were given that this policy would be\r\ncontinued until all the States were represented in Congress, it would\r\nsend a thrill of joy throughout the entire land, as indicating the\r\ninauguration of a system which must speedily bring tranquillity to the\r\npublic mind.\r\n\r\nWhile we are legislating upon subjects which are of great importance to\r\nthe whole people, and which must affect all parts of the country, not\r\nonly during the life of the present generation, but for ages to come, we\r\nshould remember that all men are entitled at least to a hearing in the\r\ncouncils which decide upon the destiny of themselves and their children.\r\nAt present ten States are denied representation, and when the Fortieth\r\nCongress assembles on the 4th day of the present month sixteen States\r\nwill be without a voice in the House of Representatives. This grave\r\nfact, with the important questions before us, should induce us to pause\r\nin a course of legislation which, looking solely to the attainment of\r\npolitical ends, fails to consider the rights it transgresses, the law\r\nwhich it violates, or the institutions which it imperils.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\n_To all whom it may concern_:\r\n\r\nWhereas exequaturs were heretofore issued to the following-named persons\r\nat the dates mentioned and for the places specified, recognizing them as\r\nconsular officers, respectively, of the Kingdom of Hanover, of the\r\nElectorate of Hesse, of the Duchy of Nassau, and of the city of\r\nFrankfort, and declaring them free to exercise and enjoy functions,\r\npowers, and privileges under the said exequaturs, viz:\r\n\r\n  FOR THE KINGDOM OF HANOVER.\r\n\r\n  Julius Frederich, consul at Galveston, Tex., July 28, 1848.\r\n  Otto Frank, consul at San Francisco, Cal., July 9, 1850.\r\n  Augustus Reichard, consul at New Orleans, La., January 22, 1853.\r\n  Kauffmann H.

The attention of\r\nCongress is invited to the subject of an appropriation for this payment,\r\nand also to that of proper legislation for the occupation and government\r\nof the territory as a part of the dominion of the United States.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 6, 1867_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a convention between the United States, Great Britain,\r\nFrance, the Netherlands, and Japan, concluded at Yedo on the 25th of\r\nJune, 1866.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 8, 1867_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Attorney-General, additional to\r\nthe reports submitted by him December 31, 1866, and March 2, 1867, in\r\nreply to a resolution of the House of Representatives of December 10,\r\n1866, requesting \"a list of names of all persons engaged in the late\r\nrebellion against the United States Government who have been pardoned by\r\nthe President from April 15, 1865, to this date; that said list shall\r\nalso state the rank of each person who has been so pardoned, if he has\r\nbeen engaged in the military service of the so-called Confederate\r\ngovernment, and the position if he shall have held any civil office\r\nunder said so-called Confederate government; and shall also further\r\nstate whether such person has at any time prior to April 14, 1861, held\r\nany office under the United States Government, and, if so, what office,\r\ntogether with the reasons for granting such pardon, and also the names\r\nof the person or persons at whose solicitation such pardon was granted.\"\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 9, 1867_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n5th of July, requesting the President \"to inform the House what States\r\nhave ratified the amendment to the Constitution of the United States\r\nproposed by concurrent resolution of the two Houses of Congress, June\r\n16, 1866,\" I transmit a report from the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 10, 1867_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with so much of the resolution of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the 8th instant as requests information in regard to\r\ncertain agreements said to have been entered into between the United\r\nStates, European and West Virginia Land and Mining Company and certain\r\nreputed agents of the Republic of Mexico, I transmit a report from the\r\nSecretary of State and the papers accompanying it.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 11, 1867_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n3d instant, requesting me to transmit all the official correspondence\r\nbetween the Department of State and the Hon. Lewis D. Campbell, late\r\nminister to Mexico, and also that with his successor, I communicate a\r\nreport from the Secretary of State and the papers accompanying it.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 12, 1867_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 8th instant,\r\nrequesting me to transmit \"all the official correspondence between the\r\nDepartment of State and the Hon. Lewis D. Campbell, late minister\r\nof the United States to the Republic of Mexico, from the time of his\r\nappointment, also the correspondence of the Department with his\r\nsuccessor,\" I communicate herewith a report on the subject from the\r\nSecretary of State, from which it appears that the correspondence\r\ncalled for by the Senate has already been communicated to the House\r\nof Representatives.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _July 15, 1867_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith reports from the Secretary of War and the\r\nAttorney-General, containing the information called for by the\r\nresolution of the Senate of the 3d instant, requesting the President \"to\r\ncommunicate to the Senate copies of all orders, instructions, circular\r\nletters, or letters of advice issued to the respective military officers\r\nassigned to the command of the several military districts under the act\r\npassed March 2, 1867, entitled 'An act to provide for the more efficient\r\ngovernment of the rebel States,' and the act supplementary thereto,\r\npassed March 23, 1867; also copies of all opinions given to him by the\r\nAttorney-General of the United States touching the construction and\r\ninterpretation of said acts, and of all correspondence relating to the\r\noperation, construction, or execution of said acts that may have taken\r\nplace between himself and any of said commanders, or between him and the\r\nGeneral of the Army, or between the latter and any of said commanders,\r\ntouching the same subjects; also copies of all orders issued by any of\r\nsaid commanders in carrying out the provisions of said acts or either of\r\nthem; also that he inform the Senate what progress has been made in the\r\nmatter of registration under said acts, and whether the sum of money\r\nheretofore appropriated for carrying them out is probably sufficient.\"\r\n\r\nIn answer to that portion of the resolution which inquires whether the\r\nsum of money heretofore appropriated for carrying these acts into effect\r\nis probably sufficient, reference is made to the accompanying report\r\nof the Secretary of War. It will be seen from that report that the\r\nappropriation of $500,000 made in the act approved March 30, 1867, for\r\nthe purpose of carrying into effect the \"Act to provide for the more\r\nefficient government of the rebel States,\" passed March 2, 1867, and the\r\nact supplementary thereto, passed March 23, 1867, has already been\r\nexpended by the commanders of the several military districts, and that,\r\nin addition, the sum of $1,648,277 is required for present purposes.\r\n\r\nIt is exceedingly difficult at the present time to estimate the probable\r\nexpense of carrying into full effect the two acts of March last and the\r\nbill which passed the two Houses of Congress on the 13th instant. If the\r\nexisting governments of ten States of the Union are to be deposed and\r\ntheir entire machinery is to be placed under the exclusive control and\r\nauthority of the respective district commanders, all the expenditures\r\nincident to the administration of such governments must necessarily be\r\nincurred by the Federal Government. It is believed that, in addition to\r\nthe $2,100,000 already expended or estimated for, the sum which would\r\nbe required for this purpose would not be less than $14,000,000--the\r\naggregate amount expended prior to the rebellion in the administration\r\nof their respective governments by the ten States embraced in the\r\nprovisions of these acts. This sum would no doubt be considerably\r\naugmented if the machinery of these States is to be operated by the\r\nFederal Government, and would be largely increased if the United States,\r\nby abolishing the existing State governments, should become responsible\r\nfor liabilities incurred by them before the rebellion in laudable\r\nefforts to develop their resources, and in no wise created for\r\ninsurrectionary or revolutionary purposes. The debts of these States,\r\nthus legitimately incurred, when accurately ascertained will, it is\r\nbelieved, approximate $100,000,000; and they are held not only by our\r\nown citizens, among whom are residents of portions of the country which\r\nhave ever remained loyal to the Union, but by persons who are the\r\nsubjects of foreign governments. It is worthy the consideration of\r\nCongress and the country whether, if the Federal Government by its\r\naction were to assume such obligations, so large an addition to our\r\npublic expenditures would not seriously impair the credit of the nation,\r\nor, on the other hand, whether the refusal of Congress to guarantee\r\nthe payment of the debts of these States, after having displaced or\r\nabolished their State governments, would not be viewed as a violation of\r\ngood faith and a repudiation by the national legislature of liabilities\r\nwhich these States had justly and legally incurred.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 18, 1867_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 8th instant,\r\nrequesting me to furnish to that body copies of any correspondence on\r\nthe files of the Department of State relating to any recent events in\r\nMexico, I communicate a report from the Secretary of State, with the\r\npapers accompanying it.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 18, 1867_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with that part of the resolution of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the 8th instant which requests me to transmit to\r\nthe House of Representatives any official correspondence or other\r\ninformation relating to the capture and execution of Maximilian and\r\nthe arrest and reported execution of Santa Anna in Mexico, I inclose\r\nherewith a report from the Secretary of State, from which it appears\r\nthat the correspondence called for by the House of Representatives has\r\nalready been communicated to the Senate of the United States.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 20, 1867_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have received a resolution adopted by the House of Representatives\r\non the 8th instant, inquiring \"whether the publication which appeared\r\nin the National Intelligencer and other public prints on the 21st of\r\nJune last, and which contained a statement of the proceedings of the\r\nPresident and Cabinet in respect to an interpretation of the acts of\r\nCongress commonly known as the reconstruction acts, was made by the\r\nauthority of the President or with his knowledge and consent,\" and\r\n\"whether the full and complete record or minute of all the proceedings,\r\nconclusions, and determinations of the President and Cabinet relating to\r\nsaid acts of Congress and their interpretation is embraced or given in\r\nsaid publication,\" and also requesting that \"a true copy of the full\r\nand complete record or minute of such proceedings, conclusions, and\r\ndeterminations in regard to the interpretation of said reconstruction\r\nacts\" be furnished to the House.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the request of the House of Representatives, I have\r\nto state that the publication to which the resolution refers was made\r\nby proper authority, and that it comprises the proceedings in Cabinet\r\nrelating to the acts of Congress mentioned in the inquiry, upon which,\r\nafter taking the opinions of the heads of the several Executive\r\nDepartments of the Government, I had announced my own conclusions. Other\r\nquestions arising from these acts have been under consideration, upon\r\nwhich, however, no final conclusion has been reached. No publication in\r\nreference to them has, therefore, been authorized by me; but should it\r\nat any time be deemed proper and advantageous to the interests of the\r\ncountry to make public those or any other proceedings of the Cabinet,\r\nauthority for their promulgation will be given by the President.\r\n\r\nA correct copy of the record of the proceedings, published in the\r\nNational Intelligencer and other newspapers on the 21st ultimo, is\r\nherewith transmitted, together with a copy of the instructions based\r\nupon the conclusions of the President and Cabinet and sent to the\r\ncommanders of the several military districts created by act of Congress\r\nof March 2, 1867.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n  IN CABINET, _June 18, 1867_.\r\n\r\n  Present: The President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of\r\n  the Treasury, the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, the\r\n  Postmaster-General, the Attorney-General, the Acting Secretary of\r\n  the Interior.\r\n\r\n  The President announced that he had under consideration the two opinions\r\n  from the Attorney-General as to the legal questions arising upon the\r\n  acts of Congress commonly known as the reconstruction acts, and that in\r\n  view of the great magnitude of the subject and of the various interests\r\n  involved he deemed it proper to have it considered fully in the Cabinet\r\n  and to avail himself of all the light which could be afforded by the\r\n  opinions and advice of the members of the Cabinet, to enable him to see\r\n  that these laws be faithfully executed and to decide what orders and\r\n  instructions are necessary and expedient to be given to the military\r\n  commanders.\r\n\r\n  The President said further that the branch of the subject that seemed to\r\n  him first in order for consideration was as to the instructions to be\r\n  sent to the military commanders for their guidance and for the guidance\r\n  of persons offering for registration. The instructions proposed by the\r\n  Attorney-General, as set forth in the summary contained in his last\r\n  opinion, will therefore be now considered.\r\n\r\n  The summary was then read at length.\r\n\r\n  The reading of the summary having been concluded, each section was then\r\n  considered, discussed, and voted upon as follows:\r\n\r\n  1. The oath prescribed in the supplemental act defines all the\r\n  qualifications required, and every person who can take that oath is\r\n  entitled to have his name entered upon the list of voters.\r\n\r\n  All vote \"aye\" except the Secretary of War, who votes \"nay.\"\r\n\r\n  2. The board of registration have no authority to administer any other\r\n  oath to the person applying for registration than this prescribed\r\n  oath, nor to administer any oath to any other person touching the\r\n  qualifications of the applicant or the falsity of the oath so taken\r\n  by him.\r\n\r\n  No provision is made for challenging the qualifications of the applicant\r\n  or entering upon any trial or investigation of his qualifications,\r\n  either by witnesses or any other form of proof.\r\n\r\n  All vote \"aye\" except the Secretary of War, who votes \"nay.\"\r\n\r\n  3. As to citizenship and residence:\r\n\r\n  The applicant for registration must be a citizen of the State and of the\r\n  United States, and must be a resident of a county or parish included in\r\n  the election district. He may be registered if he has been such citizen\r\n  for a period less than twelve months at the time he applies for\r\n  registration, but he can not vote at any election unless his citizenship\r\n  has then extended to the full term of one year. As to such a person, the\r\n  exact length of his citizenship should be noted opposite his name on the\r\n  list, so that it may appear on the day of election, upon reference to\r\n  the list, whether the full term has then been accomplished.\r\n\r\n  Concurred in unanimously.\r\n\r\n  4. An unnaturalized person can not take this oath, but an alien who has\r\n  been naturalized can take it, and no other proof of naturalization can\r\n  be required from him.\r\n\r\n  All vote \"aye\" except the Secretary of War, who votes \"nay.\"\r\n\r\n  5. No one who is not 21 years of age at the time of registration can\r\n  take the oath, for he must swear that he has then attained that age.\r\n\r\n  Concurred in unanimously.\r\n\r\n  6. No one who has been disfranchised for participation in any rebellion\r\n  against the United States or for felony committed against the laws of\r\n  any State or of the United States can take this oath.\r\n\r\n  The actual participation in a rebellion or the actual commission of a\r\n  felony does not amount to disfranchisement. The sort of disfranchisement\r\n  here meant is that which is declared by law passed by competent\r\n  authority, or which has been fixed upon the criminal by the sentence of\r\n  the court which tried him for the crime.\r\n\r\n  No law of the United States has declared the penalty of disfranchisement\r\n  for participation in rebellion alone; nor is it known that any such law\r\n  exists in either of these ten States, except, perhaps, Virginia, as to\r\n  which State special instructions will be given.\r\n\r\n  All vote \"aye\" except the Secretary of War, who dissents as to the\r\n  second and third paragraphs.\r\n\r\n  7. As to disfranchisement arising from having held office followed by\r\n  participation in rebellion:\r\n\r\n  This is the most important part of the oath, and requires strict\r\n  attention to arrive at its meaning. The applicant must swear or affirm\r\n  as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"That I have never been a member of any State legislature, nor held any\r\n  executive or judicial office in any State, and afterwards engaged in an\r\n  insurrection or rebellion against the United States or given aid or\r\n  comfort to the enemies thereof; that I have never taken an oath as a\r\n  member of Congress of the United States, or as an officer of the United\r\n  States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or\r\n  judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United\r\n  States, and afterwards engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the\r\n  United States or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.\"\r\n\r\n  Two elements must concur in order to disqualify a person under these\r\n  clauses: First, the office and official oath to support the Constitution\r\n  of the United States; second, engaging afterwards in rebellion. Both\r\n  must exist to work disqualification, and must happen in the order of\r\n  time mentioned.\r\n\r\n  A person who has held an office and taken the oath to support the\r\n  Federal Constitution and has not afterwards engaged in rebellion is not\r\n  disqualified. So, too, a person who has engaged in rebellion, but has\r\n  not theretofore held an office and taken that oath, is not disqualified.\r\n\r\n  All vote \"aye\" except the Secretary of War, who votes \"nay.\"\r\n\r\n  8. Officers of the United States:\r\n\r\n  As to these the language is without limitation. The person who has at\r\n  any time prior to the rebellion held any office, civil or military,\r\n  under the United States, and has taken an official oath to support the\r\n  Constitution of the United States, is subject to disqualification.\r\n\r\n  Concurred in unanimously.\r\n\r\n  9. Militia officers of any State prior to the rebellion are not subject\r\n  to disqualification.\r\n\r\n  All vote \"aye\" except the Secretary of War, who votes \"nay.\"\r\n\r\n  10. Municipal officers--that is to say, officers of incorporated cities,\r\n  towns, and villages, such as mayors, aldermen, town council, police, and\r\n  other city or town officers--are not subject to disqualification.\r\n\r\n  Concurred in unanimously.\r\n\r\n  11. Persons who have prior to the rebellion been members of the Congress\r\n  of the United States or members of a State legislature are subject to\r\n  disqualification, but those who have been members of conventions framing\r\n  or amending the constitution of a State prior to the rebellion are not\r\n  subject to disqualification.\r\n\r\n  Concurred in unanimously.\r\n\r\n  12. All the executive or judicial officers of any State who took an\r\n  oath to support the Constitution of the United States are subject\r\n  to disqualification, including county officers. They are subject to\r\n  disqualification if they were required to take as a part of their\r\n  official oath the oath to support the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\n  Concurred in unanimously.\r\n\r\n  13. Persons who exercised mere employments under State authority are\r\n  not disqualified; such as commissioners to lay out roads, commissioners\r\n  of public works, visitors of State institutions, directors of State\r\n  institutions, examiners of banks, notaries public, commissioners to\r\n  take acknowledgments of deeds.\r\n\r\n  Concurred in unanimously; but the Secretary of State, the Secretary of\r\n  the Treasury, and the Secretary of War express the opinion that lawyers\r\n  are such officers as are disqualified if they participated in the\r\n  rebellion. Two things must exist as to any person to disqualify him from\r\n  voting: First, the office held prior to the rebellion, and, afterwards,\r\n  participation in the rebellion.\r\n\r\n  14. An act to fix upon a person the offense of engaging in rebellion\r\n  under this law must be an overt and voluntary act, done with the intent\r\n  of aiding or furthering the common unlawful purpose. A person forced\r\n  into the rebel service by conscription or under a paramount authority\r\n  which he could not safely disobey, and who would not have entered such\r\n  service if left to the free exercise of his own will, can not be held\r\n  to be disqualified from voting.\r\n\r\n  All vote \"aye\" except the Secretary of War, who votes \"nay\" as the\r\n  proposition is stated.\r\n\r\n  15. Mere acts of charity, where the intent is to relieve the wants of\r\n  the object of such charity, and not done in aid of the cause in which he\r\n  may have been engaged, do not disqualify; but organized contributions\r\n  of food and clothing for the general relief of persons engaged in the\r\n  rebellion, and not of a merely sanitary character, but contributed to\r\n  enable them to perform their unlawful object, maybe classed with acts\r\n  which do disqualify. Forced contributions to the rebel cause in the form\r\n  of taxes or military assessments, which a person was compelled to pay or\r\n  contribute, do not disqualify; but voluntary contributions to the rebel\r\n  cause, even such indirect contributions as arise from the voluntary loan\r\n  of money to the rebel authorities or purchase of bonds or securities\r\n  created to afford the means of carrying on the rebellion, will work\r\n  disqualification.\r\n\r\n  Concurred in unanimously.\r\n\r\n  16. All those who in legislative or other official capacity were engaged\r\n  in the furtherance of the common unlawful purpose, where the duties of\r\n  the office necessarily had relation to the support of the rebellion,\r\n  such as members of the rebel conventions, congresses, and legislatures,\r\n  diplomatic agents of the rebel Confederacy, and other officials whose\r\n  offices were created for the purpose of more effectually carrying on\r\n  hostilities or whose duties appertained to the support of the rebel\r\n  cause, must be held to be disqualified; but officers who during the\r\n  rebellion discharged official duties not incident to war, but only such\r\n  duties as belong even to a state of peace and were necessary to the\r\n  preservation of order and the administration of law, are not to be\r\n  considered as thereby engaging in rebellion or as disqualified. Disloyal\r\n  sentiments, opinions, or sympathies would not disqualify, but where a\r\n  person has by speech or writing incited others to engage in rebellion he\r\n  must come under the disqualification.\r\n\r\n  All vote \"aye\" except the Secretary of War, who dissents to the second\r\n  paragraph, with the exception of the words \"where a person has by speech\r\n  or by writing incited others to engage in rebellion he must come under\r\n  the disqualification.\"\r\n\r\n  17. The duties of the board appointed to superintend the elections.\r\n\r\n  This board, having the custody of the list of registered voters in the\r\n  district for which it is constituted, must see that the name of the\r\n  person offering to vote is found upon the registration list, and if such\r\n  proves to be the fact it is the duty of the board to receive his vote if\r\n  then qualified by residence. They can not receive the vote of any person\r\n  whose name is not upon the list, though he may be ready to take the\r\n  registration oath, and although he may satisfy them that he was unable\r\n  to have his name registered at the proper time, in consequence of\r\n  absence, sickness, or other cause.\r\n\r\n  The board can not enter into any inquiry as to the qualifications of\r\n  any person whose name is not on the registration list, or as to the\r\n  qualifications of any person whose name is on that list..\r\n\r\n  Concurred in unanimously.\r\n\r\n  18. The mode of voting is provided in the act to be by ballot. The board\r\n  will keep a record and poll book of the election, showing the votes,\r\n  list of voters, and the persons elected by a plurality of the votes cast\r\n  at the election, and make returns of these to the commanding general of\r\n  the district.\r\n\r\n  Concurred in unanimously.\r\n\r\n  19. The board appointed for registration and for superintending the\r\n  elections must take the oath prescribed by the act of Congress approved\r\n  July 2, 1862, entitled \"An act to prescribe an oath of office.\"\r\n\r\n  Concurred in unanimously.\r\n\r\n\r\n  IN CABINET, _June 20, 1867_.\r\n\r\n  Present: The same Cabinet officers as on the 18th, except the Acting\r\n  Secretary of the Interior.\r\n\r\n  The President announced to the Cabinet that after full deliberation he\r\n  concurred with the majority upon the sections of the summary upon which\r\n  the Secretary of War expressed his dissent, and that he concurred with\r\n  the Cabinet upon those sections approved by unanimous vote; that as it\r\n  appeared the military commanders entertained doubts upon the points\r\n  covered by the summary, and as their action hitherto had not been\r\n  uniform, he deemed it proper, without further delay, to communicate in\r\n  a general order[27] to the respective commanders the points set forth\r\n  in the summary.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: See Executive order of June 20, 1867, pp. 552-556.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 23, 1867_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have considered the bill entitled \"An act supplementary to an act\r\nentitled 'An act to provide for the more efficient government of the\r\nrebel States,' passed March 2, 1867, and to facilitate restoration,\"\r\nand now return it to the House of Representatives with my objections.\r\n\r\nThis bill provides for elections in the ten States brought under the\r\noperation of the original act to which it is supplementary. Its details\r\nare principally directed to the elections for the formation of the State\r\nconstitutions, but by the sixth section of the bill \"all elections\"\r\nin these States occurring while the original act remains in force are\r\nbrought within its purview. Referring to these details, it will be found\r\nthat, first of all, there is to be a registration of the voters. No one\r\nwhose name has not been admitted on the list is to be allowed to vote at\r\nany of these elections. To ascertain who is entitled to registration,\r\nreference is made necessary, by the express language of the supplement,\r\nto the original act and to the pending bill. The fifth section of the\r\noriginal act provides, as to voters, that they shall be \"male citizens\r\nof the State, 21 years old and upward, of whatever race, color, or\r\nprevious condition, who have been residents of said State for one\r\nyear.\" This is the general qualification, followed, however, by many\r\nexceptions. No one can be registered, according to the original act,\r\n\"who may be disfranchised for participation in the rebellion\"--a\r\nprovision which left undetermined the question as to what amounted to\r\ndisfranchisement, and whether without a judicial sentence the act\r\nitself produced that effect. This supplemental bill superadds an oath,\r\nto be taken by every person before his name can be admitted upon the\r\nregistration, that he has \"not been disfranchised for participation in\r\nany rebellion or civil war against the United States.\" It thus imposes\r\nupon every person the necessity and responsibility of deciding for\r\nhimself, under the peril of punishment by a military commission if\r\nhe makes a mistake, what works disfranchisement by participation in\r\nrebellion and what amounts to such participation. Almost every man--the\r\nnegro as well as the white--above 21 years of age who was resident in\r\nthese ten States during the rebellion, voluntarily or involuntarily, at\r\nsome time and in some way did participate in resistance to the lawful\r\nauthority of the General Government. The question with the citizen to\r\nwhom this oath is to be proposed must be a fearful one, for while the\r\nbill does not declare that perjury may be assigned for such false\r\nswearing nor fix any penalty for the offense, we must not forget that\r\nmartial law prevails; that every person is answerable to a military\r\ncommission, without previous presentment by a grand jury, for any charge\r\nthat may be made against him, and that the supreme authority of the\r\nmilitary commander determines the question as to what is an offense\r\nand what is to be the measure of punishment.\r\n\r\nThe fourth section of the bill provides \"that the commanding general of\r\neach district shall appoint as many boards of registration as may be\r\nnecessary, consisting of three loyal officers or persons.\" The only\r\nqualification stated for these officers is that they must be \"loyal.\"\r\nThey may be persons in the military service or civilians, residents of\r\nthe State or strangers. Yet these persons are to exercise most important\r\nduties and are vested with unlimited discretion. They are to decide what\r\nnames shall be placed upon the register and from their decision there is\r\nto be no appeal. They are to superintend the elections and to decide all\r\nquestions which may arise. They are to have the custody of the ballots\r\nand to make return of the persons elected. Whatever frauds or errors\r\nthey may commit must pass without redress. All that is left for the\r\ncommanding general is to receive the returns of the elections, open the\r\nsame, and ascertain who are chosen \"according to the returns of the\r\nofficers who conducted said elections.\" By such means and with this\r\nsort of agency are the conventions of delegates to be constituted.\r\n\r\nAs the delegates are to speak for the people, common justice would seem\r\nto require that they should have authority from the people themselves.\r\nNo convention so constituted will in any sense represent the wishes of\r\nthe inhabitants of these States, for under the all-embracing exceptions\r\nof these laws, by a construction which the uncertainty of the clause as\r\nto disfranchisement leaves open to the board of officers, the great body\r\nof the people may be excluded from the polls and from all opportunity of\r\nexpressing their own wishes or voting for delegates who will faithfully\r\nreflect their sentiments.\r\n\r\nI do not deem it necessary further to investigate the details of this\r\nbill. No consideration could induce me to give my approval to such an\r\nelection law for any purpose, and especially for the great purpose of\r\nframing the constitution of a State. If ever the American citizen should\r\nbe left to the free exercise of his own judgment it is when he is\r\nengaged in the work of forming the fundamental law under which he is to\r\nlive. That work is his work, and it can not properly be taken out of his\r\nhands. All this legislation proceeds upon the contrary assumption that\r\nthe people of each of these States shall have no constitution except\r\nsuch as may be arbitrarily dictated by Congress and formed under the\r\nrestraint of military rule. A plain statement of facts makes this\r\nevident.\r\n\r\nIn all these States there are existing constitutions, framed in the\r\naccustomed way by the people. Congress, however, declares that these\r\nconstitutions are not \"loyal and republican,\" and requires the people to\r\nform them anew. What, then, in the opinion of Congress, is necessary to\r\nmake the constitution of a State \"loyal and republican\"? The original\r\nact answers the question: It is universal negro suffrage--a question\r\nwhich the Federal Constitution leaves exclusively to the States\r\nthemselves. All this legislative machinery of martial law, military\r\ncoercion, and political disfranchisement is avowedly for that purpose\r\nand none other. The existing constitutions of the ten States conform to\r\nthe acknowledged standards of loyalty and republicanism. Indeed, if\r\nthere are degrees in republican forms of government, their constitutions\r\nare more republican now than when these States, four of which were\r\nmembers of the original thirteen, first became members of the Union.\r\n\r\nCongress does not now demand that a single provision of their\r\nconstitutions be changed except such as confine suffrage to the white\r\npopulation. It is apparent, therefore, that these provisions do not\r\nconform to the standard of republicanism which Congress seeks to\r\nestablish. That there may be no mistake, it is only necessary that\r\nreference should be made to the original act, which declares \"such\r\nconstitution shall provide that the elective franchise shall be enjoyed\r\nby all such persons as have the qualifications herein stated for\r\nelectors of delegates.\" What class of persons is here meant clearly\r\nappears in the same section; that is to say, \"the male citizens of said\r\nState 21 years old and upward, of whatever race, color, or previous\r\ncondition, who have been resident in said State for one year previous\r\nto the day of such election.\"\r\n\r\nWithout these provisions no constitution which can be framed in any one\r\nof the ten States will be of any avail with Congress. This, then, is the\r\ntest of what the constitution of a State of this Union must contain to\r\nmake it republican. Measured by such a standard, how few of the States\r\nnow composing the Union have republican constitutions! If in the\r\nexercise of the constitutional guaranty that Congress shall secure to\r\nevery State a republican form of government universal suffrage for\r\nblacks as well as whites is a _sine qua non_, the work of reconstruction\r\nmay as well begin in Ohio as in Virginia, in Pennsylvania as in North\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\nWhen I contemplate the millions of our fellow-citizens of the South\r\nwith no alternative left but to impose upon themselves this fearful\r\nand untried experiment of complete negro enfranchisement--and white\r\ndisfranchisement, it may be, almost as complete--or submit indefinitely\r\nto the rigor of martial law, without a single attribute of freemen,\r\ndeprived of all the sacred guaranties of our Federal Constitution, and\r\nthreatened with even worse wrongs, if any worse are possible, it seems\r\nto me their condition is the most deplorable to which any people can be\r\nreduced. It is true that they have been engaged in rebellion and that\r\ntheir object being a separation of the States and a dissolution of the\r\nUnion there was an obligation resting upon every loyal citizen to treat\r\nthem as enemies and to wage war against their cause.\r\n\r\nInflexibly opposed to any movement imperiling the integrity of the\r\nGovernment, I did not hesitate to urge the adoption of all measures\r\nnecessary for the suppression of the insurrection. After a long and\r\nterrible struggle the efforts of the Government were triumphantly\r\nsuccessful, and the people of the South, submitting to the stern\r\narbitrament, yielded forever the issues of the contest. Hostilities\r\nterminated soon after it became my duty to assume the responsibilities\r\nof the chief executive officer of the Republic, and I at once endeavored\r\nto repress and control the passions which our civil strife had\r\nengendered, and, no longer regarding these erring millions as enemies,\r\nagain acknowledged them as our friends and our countrymen. The war had\r\naccomplished its objects. The nation was saved and that seminal\r\nprinciple of mischief which from the birth of the Government had\r\ngradually but inevitably brought on the rebellion was totally\r\neradicated. Then, it seemed to me, was the auspicious time to commence\r\nthe work of reconciliation; then, when these people sought once more our\r\nfriendship and protection, I considered it our duty generously to meet\r\nthem in the spirit of charity and forgiveness and to conquer them even\r\nmore effectually by the magnanimity of the nation than by the force of\r\nits arms. I yet believe that if the policy of reconciliation then\r\ninaugurated, and which contemplated an early restoration of these people\r\nto all their political rights, had received the support of Congress,\r\nevery one of these ten States and all their people would at this moment\r\nbe fast anchored in the Union and the great work which gave the war all\r\nits sanction and made it just and holy would have been accomplished.\r\nThen over all the vast and fruitful regions of the South peace and its\r\nblessings would have prevailed, while now millions are deprived of\r\nrights guaranteed by the Constitution to every citizen and after nearly\r\ntwo years of legislation find themselves placed under an absolute\r\nmilitary despotism. \"A military republic, a government founded on mock\r\nelections and supported only by the sword,\" was nearly a quarter of a\r\ncentury since pronounced by Daniel Webster, when speaking of the South\r\nAmerican States, as \"a movement, indeed, but a retrograde and disastrous\r\nmovement, from the regular and old-fashioned monarchical systems;\" and\r\nhe added:\r\n\r\n  If men would enjoy the blessings of republican government, they must\r\n  govern themselves by reason, by mutual counsel and consultation, by a\r\n  sense and feeling of general interest, and by the acquiescence of the\r\n  minority in the will of the majority, properly expressed; and, above\r\n  all, the military must be kept, according to the language of our bill of\r\n  rights, in strict subordination to the civil authority. Wherever this\r\n  lesson is not both learned and practiced there can be no political\r\n  freedom. Absurd, preposterous is it, a scoff and a satire on free forms\r\n  of constitutional liberty, for frames of government to be prescribed by\r\n  military leaders and the right of suffrage to be exercised at the point\r\n  of the sword.\r\n\r\nI confidently believe that a time will come when these States will again\r\noccupy their true positions in the Union. The barriers which now seem so\r\nobstinate must yield to the force of an enlightened and just public\r\nopinion, and sooner or later unconstitutional and oppressive legislation\r\nwill be effaced from our statute books. When this shall have been\r\nconsummated, I pray God that the errors of the past may be forgotten and\r\nthat once more we shall be a happy, united, and prosperous people, and\r\nthat at last, after the bitter and eventful experience through which the\r\nnation has passed, we shall all come to know that our only safety is in\r\nthe preservation of our Federal Constitution and in according to every\r\nAmerican citizen and to every State the rights which that Constitution\r\nsecures.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _April 10, 1867_.[28]\r\n\r\nThe first session of the Fortieth Congress adjourned on the 30th day\r\nof March, 1867. This bill,[29] which was passed during that session,\r\nwas not presented for my approval by the Hon. Edmund G. Ross, of the\r\nSenate of the United States, and a member of the Committee on Enrolled\r\nBills, until Monday, the 1st day of April, 1867, two days after the\r\nadjournment. It is not believed that the approval of any bill after\r\nthe adjournment of Congress, whether presented before or after such\r\nadjournment, is authorized by the Constitution of the United States,\r\nthat instrument expressly declaring that no bill shall become a law the\r\nreturn of which may have been prevented by the adjournment of Congress.\r\nTo concede that under the Constitution the President, after the\r\nadjournment of Congress, may, without limitation in respect to time,\r\nexercise the power of approval, and thus determine at his discretion\r\nwhether or not bills shall become laws, might subject the executive and\r\nlegislative departments of the Government to influences most pernicious\r\nto correct legislation and sound public morals, and--with a single\r\nexception, occurring during the prevalence of civil war--would be\r\ncontrary to the established practice of the Government from its\r\ninauguration to the present time. This bill will therefore be filed\r\nin the office of the Secretary of State without my approval.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Pocket veto. Was never sent to Congress, but was deposited\r\nin the Department of State.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: Joint resolution placing certain troops of Missouri on an\r\nequal footing with others as to bounties.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _July 19, 1867_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith the bill entitled \"An act supplementary to an act\r\nentitled 'An act to provide for the more efficient government of the\r\nrebel States,' passed on the 2d day of March, 1867, and the act\r\nsupplementary thereto, passed, on the 23d day of March, 1867,\" and will\r\nstate as briefly as possible some of the reasons which prevent me from\r\ngiving it my approval.\r\n\r\nThis is one of a series of measures passed by Congress during the last\r\nfour months on the subject of reconstruction. The message returning the\r\nact of the 2d of March last states at length my objections to the\r\npassage of that measure. They apply equally well to the bill now before\r\nme, and I am content merely to refer to them and to reiterate my\r\nconviction that they are sound and unanswerable.\r\n\r\nThere are some points peculiar to this bill, which I will proceed at\r\nonce to consider.\r\n\r\nThe first section purports to declare \"the true intent and meaning,\"\r\nin some particulars, of the two prior acts upon this subject.\r\n\r\nIt is declared that the intent of those acts was, first, that the\r\nexisting governments in the ten \"rebel States\" \"were not legal State\r\ngovernments,\" and, second, \"that thereafter said governments, if\r\ncontinued, were to be continued subject in all respects to the military\r\ncommanders of the respective districts and to the paramount authority\r\nof Congress.\"\r\n\r\nCongress may by a declaratory act fix upon a prior act a\r\nconstruction altogether at variance with its apparent meaning, and\r\nfrom the time, at least, when such a construction is fixed the original\r\nact will be construed to mean exactly what it is stated to mean by the\r\ndeclaratory statute. There will be, then, from the time this bill may\r\nbecome a law no doubt, no question, as to the relation in which the\r\n\"existing governments\" in those States, called in the original act \"the\r\nprovisional governments,\" stand toward the military authority. As those\r\nrelations stood before the declaratory act, these \"governments,\" it is\r\ntrue, were made subject to absolute military authority in many important\r\nrespects, but not in all, the language of the act being \"subject to the\r\nmilitary authority of the United States, as hereinafter prescribed.\"\r\nBy the sixth section of the original act these governments were made\r\n\"in all respects subject to the paramount authority of the United\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\nNow by this declaratory act it appears that Congress did not by the\r\noriginal act intend to limit the military authority to any particulars\r\nor subjects therein \"prescribed,\" but meant to make it universal. Thus\r\nover all of these ten States this military government is now declared to\r\nhave unlimited authority. It is no longer confined to the preservation\r\nof the public peace, the administration of criminal law, the\r\nregistration of voters, and the superintendence of elections, but\r\n\"in all respects\" is asserted to be paramount to the existing civil\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to conceive any state of society more intolerable than\r\nthis; and yet it is to this condition that 12,000,000 American citizens\r\nare reduced by the Congress of the United States. Over every foot of the\r\nimmense territory occupied by these American citizens the Constitution\r\nof the United States is theoretically in full operation. It binds all\r\nthe people there and should protect them; yet they are denied every\r\none of its sacred guaranties.\r\n\r\nOf what avail will it be to any one of these Southern people when\r\nseized by a file of soldiers to ask for the cause of arrest or for the\r\nproduction of the warrant? Of what avail to ask for the privilege of\r\nbail when in military custody, which knows no such thing as bail? Of\r\nwhat avail to demand a trial by jury, process for witnesses, a copy of\r\nthe indictment, the privilege of counselor that greater privilege, the\r\nwrit of _habeas corpus_?\r\n\r\nThe veto of the original bill of the 2d of March was based on two\r\ndistinct grounds--the interference of Congress in matters strictly\r\nappertaining to the reserved powers of the States and the establishment\r\nof military tribunals for the trial of citizens in time of peace.\r\nThe impartial reader of that message will understand that all that\r\nit contains with respect to military despotism and martial law has\r\nreference especially to the fearful power conferred on the district\r\ncommanders to displace the criminal courts and assume jurisdiction to\r\ntry and to punish by military boards; that, potentially, the suspension\r\nof the _habeas corpus_ was martial law and military despotism. The act\r\nnow before me not only declares that the intent was to confer such\r\nmilitary authority, but also to confer unlimited military authority over\r\nall the other courts of the State and over all the officers of the\r\nState--legislative, executive, and judicial. Not content with the\r\ngeneral grant of power, Congress, in the second section of this bill,\r\nspecifically gives to each military commander the power \"to suspend or\r\nremove from office, or from the performance of official duties and\r\nthe exercise of official powers, any officer or person holding or\r\nexercising, or professing to hold or exercise, any civil or military\r\noffice or duty in such district under any power, election, appointment,\r\nor authority derived from, or granted by, or claimed under any so-called\r\nState, or the government thereof, or any municipal or other division\r\nthereof.\"\r\n\r\nA power that hitherto all the departments of the Federal Government,\r\nacting in concert or separately, have not dared to exercise is here\r\nattempted to be conferred on a subordinate military officer. To him,\r\nas a military officer of the Federal Government, is given the power,\r\nsupported by \"a sufficient military force,\" to remove every civil\r\nofficer of the State. What next? The district commander, who has thus\r\ndisplaced the civil officer, is authorized to fill the vacancy by the\r\ndetail of an officer or soldier of the Army, or by the appointment of\r\n\"some other person.\"\r\n\r\nThis military appointee, whether an officer, a soldier, or \"some\r\nother person,\" is to perform \"the duties of such officer or person so\r\nsuspended or removed.\" In other words, an officer or soldier of the Army\r\nis thus transformed into a civil officer. He may be made a governor,\r\na legislator, or a judge. However unfit he may deem himself for such\r\ncivil duties, he must obey the order. The officer of the Army must, if\r\n\"detailed,\" go upon the supreme bench of the State with the same prompt\r\nobedience as if he were detailed to go upon a court-martial. The\r\nsoldier, if detailed to act as a justice of the peace, must obey as\r\nquickly as if he were detailed for picket duty.\r\n\r\nWhat is the character of such a military civil officer? This bill\r\ndeclares that he shall perform the duties of the civil office to which\r\nhe is detailed. It is clear, however, that he does not lose his position\r\nin the military service. He is still an officer or soldier of the Army;\r\nhe is still subject to the rules and regulations which govern it, and\r\nmust yield due deference, respect, and obedience toward his superiors.\r\n\r\nThe clear intent of this section is that the officer or soldier\r\ndetailed to fill a civil office must execute its duties according to the\r\nlaws of the State. If he is appointed a governor of a State, he is to\r\nexecute the duties as provided by the laws of that State, and for the\r\ntime being his military character is to be suspended in his new civil\r\ncapacity. If he is appointed a State treasurer, he must at once assume\r\nthe custody and disbursement of the funds of the State, and must perform\r\nthose duties precisely according to the laws of the State, for he is\r\nintrusted with no other official duty or other official power. Holding\r\nthe office of treasurer and intrusted with funds, it happens that he is\r\nrequired by the State laws to enter into bond with security and to take\r\nan oath of office; yet from the beginning of the bill to the end there\r\nis no provision for any bond or oath of office, or for any single\r\nqualification required under the State law, such as residence,\r\ncitizenship, or anything else. The only oath is that provided for in the\r\nninth section, by the terms of which everyone detailed or appointed to\r\nany civil office in the State is required \"to take and to subscribe the\r\noath of office prescribed by law for officers of the United States.\"\r\nThus an officer of the Army of the United States detailed to fill a\r\ncivil office in one of these States gives no official bond and takes\r\nno official oath for the performance of his new duties, but as a civil\r\nofficer of the State only takes the same oath which he had already taken\r\nas a military officer of the United States. He is, at last, a military\r\nofficer performing civil duties, and the authority under which he acts\r\nis Federal authority only; and the inevitable result is that the Federal\r\nGovernment, by the agency of its own sworn officers, in effect assumes\r\nthe civil government of the State.\r\n\r\nA singular contradiction is apparent here. Congress declares these local\r\nState governments to be illegal governments, and then provides that\r\nthese illegal governments shall be carried on by Federal officers, who\r\nare to perform the very duties imposed on its own officers by this\r\nillegal State authority. It certainly would be a novel spectacle if\r\nCongress should attempt to carry on a _legal_ State government by the\r\nagency of its own officers. It is yet more strange that Congress\r\nattempts to sustain and carry on an _illegal_ State government by the\r\nsame Federal agency.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I must call attention to the tenth and eleventh\r\nsections of the bill, which provide that none of the officers or\r\nappointees of these military commanders \"shall be bound in his action by\r\nany opinion of any civil officer of the United States,\" and that all the\r\nprovisions of the act \"shall be construed liberally, to the end that all\r\nthe intents thereof may be fully and perfectly carried out.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems Congress supposed that this bill might require construction,\r\nand they fix, therefore, the rule to be applied. But where is the\r\nconstruction to come from? Certainly no one can be more in want of\r\ninstruction than a soldier or an officer of the Army detailed for a\r\ncivil service, perhaps the most important in a State, with the duties of\r\nwhich he is altogether unfamiliar. This bill says he shall not be bound\r\nin his action by the opinion of any civil officer of the United States.\r\nThe duties of the office are altogether civil, but when he asks for an\r\nopinion he can only ask the opinion of another military officer, who,\r\nperhaps, understands as little of his duties as he does himself; and as\r\nto his \"action,\" he is answerable to the military authority, and to the\r\nmilitary authority alone. Strictly, no opinion of any civil officer\r\nother than a judge has a binding force.\r\n\r\nBut these military appointees would not be bound even by a judicial\r\nopinion. They might very well say, even when their action is in conflict\r\nwith the Supreme Court of the United States, \"That court is composed of\r\ncivil officers of the United States, and we are not bound to conform our\r\naction to any opinion of any such authority.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill and the acts to which it is supplementary are all founded upon\r\nthe assumption that these ten communities are not States and that their\r\nexisting governments are not legal. Throughout the legislation upon this\r\nsubject they are called \"rebel States,\" and in this particular bill they\r\nare denominated \"so-called States,\" and the vice of illegality is\r\ndeclared to pervade all of them. The obligations of consistency bind a\r\nlegislative body as well as the individuals who compose it. It is now\r\ntoo late to say that these ten political communities are not States of\r\nthis Union. Declarations to the contrary made in these three acts are\r\ncontradicted again and again by repeated acts of legislation enacted by\r\nCongress from the year 1861 to the year 1867.\r\n\r\nDuring that period, while these States were in actual rebellion, and\r\nafter that rebellion was brought to a close, they have been again and\r\nagain recognized as States of the Union. Representation has been\r\napportioned to them as States. They have been divided into judicial\r\ndistricts for the holding of district and circuit courts of the United\r\nStates, as States of the Union only can be districted. The last act on\r\nthis subject was passed July 23, 1866, by which every one of these ten\r\nStates was arranged into districts and circuits.\r\n\r\nThey have been called upon by Congress to act through their legislatures\r\nupon at least two amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\r\nAs States they have ratified one amendment, which required the vote\r\nof twenty-seven States of the thirty-six then composing the Union.\r\nWhen the requisite twenty-seven votes were given in favor of that\r\namendment--seven of which votes were given by seven of these ten\r\nStates--it was proclaimed to be a part of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, and slavery was declared no longer to exist within the United\r\nStates or any place subject to their jurisdiction. If these seven States\r\nwere not legal States of the Union, it follows as an inevitable\r\nconsequence that in some of the States slavery yet exists. It does not\r\nexist in these seven States, for they have abolished it also in their\r\nState constitutions; but Kentucky not having done so, it would still\r\nremain in that State. But, in truth, if this assumption that these\r\nStates have no legal State governments be true, then the abolition of\r\nslavery by these illegal governments binds no one, for Congress now\r\ndenies to these States the power to abolish slavery by denying to them\r\nthe power to elect a legal State legislature, or to frame a constitution\r\nfor any purpose, even for such a purpose as the abolition of slavery.\r\n\r\nAs to the other constitutional amendment, having reference to suffrage,\r\nit happens that these States have not accepted it. The consequence is\r\nthat it has never been proclaimed or understood, even by Congress, to be\r\na part of the Constitution of the United States. The Senate of the\r\nUnited States has repeatedly given its sanction to the appointment of\r\njudges, district attorneys, and marshals for every one of these States;\r\nyet, if they are not legal States, not one of these judges is authorized\r\nto hold a court. So, too, both Houses of Congress have passed\r\nappropriation bills to pay all these judges, attorneys, and officers of\r\nthe United States for exercising their functions in these States. Again,\r\nin the machinery of the internal-revenue laws all these States are\r\ndistricted, not as \"Territories,\" but as \"States.\"\r\n\r\nSo much for continuous legislative recognition. The instances cited,\r\nhowever, fall far short of all that might be enumerated. Executive\r\nrecognition, as is well known, has been frequent and unwavering. The\r\nsame maybe said as to judicial recognition through the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States. That august tribunal, from first to last, in the\r\nadministration of its duties _in banc_ and upon the circuit, has never\r\nfailed to recognize these ten communities as legal States of the Union.\r\nThe cases depending in that court upon appeal and writ of error from\r\nthese States when the rebellion began have not been dismissed upon any\r\nidea of the cessation of jurisdiction. They were carefully continued\r\nfrom term to term until the rebellion was entirely subdued and peace\r\nreestablished, and then they were called for argument and consideration\r\nas if no insurrection had intervened. New cases, occurring since the\r\nrebellion, have come from these States before that court by writ of\r\nerror and appeal, and even by original suit, where only \"a State\" can\r\nbring such a suit. These cases are entertained by that tribunal in the\r\nexercise of its acknowledged jurisdiction, which could not attach to\r\nthem if they had come from any political body other than a State of the\r\nUnion. Finally, in the allotment of their circuits made by the judges at\r\nthe December term, 1865, every one of these States is put on the same\r\nfooting of legality with all the other States of the Union. Virginia\r\nand North Carolina, being a part of the fourth circuit, are allotted to\r\nthe Chief Justice. South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and\r\nFlorida constitute the fifth circuit, and are allotted to the late Mr.\r\nJustice Wayne. Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas are allotted to the sixth\r\njudicial circuit, as to which there is a vacancy on the bench.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Justice, in the exercise of his circuit duties, has recently\r\nheld a circuit court in the State of North Carolina. If North Carolina\r\nis not a State of this Union, the Chief Justice had no authority to hold\r\na court there, and every order, judgment, and decree rendered by him in\r\nthat court were _coram non judice_ and void.\r\n\r\nAnother ground on which these reconstruction acts are attempted to be\r\nsustained is this: That these ten States are conquered territory; that\r\nthe constitutional relation in which they stood as States toward the\r\nFederal Government prior to the rebellion has given place to a new\r\nrelation; that their territory is a conquered country and their citizens\r\na conquered people, and that in this new relation Congress can govern\r\nthem by military power.\r\n\r\nA title by conquest stands on clear ground; it is a new title acquired\r\nby war; it applies only to territory; for goods or movable things\r\nregularly captured in war are called \"booty,\" or, if taken by individual\r\nsoldiers, \"plunder.\"\r\n\r\nThere is not a foot of the land in any one of these ten States which\r\nthe United States holds by conquest, save only such land as did not\r\nbelong to either of these States or to any individual owner. I mean such\r\nlands as did belong to the pretended government called the Confederate\r\nStates. These lands we may claim to hold by conquest. As to all other\r\nland or territory, whether belonging to the States or to individuals,\r\nthe Federal Government has now no more title or right to it than\r\nit had before the rebellion. Our own forts, arsenals, navy-yards,\r\ncustom-houses, and other Federal property situate in those States we\r\nnow hold, not by the title of conquest, but by our old title, acquired\r\nby purchase or condemnation for public use, with compensation to\r\nformer owners. We have not conquered these places, but have simply\r\n\"repossessed\" them.\r\n\r\nIf we require more sites for forts, custom-houses, or other public use,\r\nwe must acquire the title to them by purchase or appropriation in the\r\nregular mode. At this moment the United States, in the acquisition of\r\nsites for national cemeteries in these States, acquires title in the\r\nsame way. The Federal courts sit in court-houses owned or leased by the\r\nUnited States, not in the court-houses of the States. The United States\r\npays each of these States for the use of its jails. Finally, the United\r\nStates levies its direct taxes and its internal revenue upon the\r\nproperty in these States, including the productions of the lands within\r\ntheir territorial limits, not by way of levy and contribution in the\r\ncharacter of a conqueror, but in the regular way of taxation, under the\r\nsame laws which apply to all the other States of the Union.\r\n\r\nFrom first to last, during the rebellion and since, the title of each of\r\nthese States to the lands and public buildings owned by them has never\r\nbeen disturbed, and not a foot of it has ever been acquired by the\r\nUnited States, even under a title by confiscation, and not a foot of\r\nit has ever been taxed under Federal law.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I must respectfully ask the attention of Congress to the\r\nconsideration of one more question arising under this bill. It vests in\r\nthe military commander, subject only to the approval of the General of\r\nthe Army of the United States, an unlimited power to remove from office\r\nany civil or military officer in each of these ten States, and the\r\nfurther power, subject to the same approval, to detail or appoint any\r\nmilitary officer or soldier of the United States to perform the duties\r\nof the officer so removed, and to fill all vacancies occurring in those\r\nStates by death, resignation, or otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe military appointee thus required to perform the duties of a\r\ncivil office according to the laws of the State, and, as such, required\r\nto take an oath, is for the time being a civil officer. What is his\r\ncharacter? Is he a civil officer of the State or a civil officer of the\r\nUnited States? If he is a civil officer of the State, where is the\r\nFederal power under our Constitution which authorizes his appointment by\r\nany Federal officer? If, however, he is to be considered a civil officer\r\nof the United States, as his appointment and oath would seem to\r\nindicate, where is the authority for his appointment vested by the\r\nConstitution? The power of appointment of all officers of the United\r\nStates, civil or military, where not provided for in the Constitution,\r\nis vested in the President, by and with the advice and consent of the\r\nSenate, with this exception, that Congress \"may by law vest the\r\nappointment of such inferior officers as they think proper in the\r\nPresident alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of Departments.\"\r\nBut this bill, if these are to be considered inferior officers within\r\nthe meaning of the Constitution, does not provide for their appointment\r\nby the President alone, or by the courts of law, or by the heads of\r\nDepartments, but vests the appointment in one subordinate executive\r\nofficer, subject to the approval of another subordinate executive\r\nofficer. So that, if we put this question and fix the character of this\r\nmilitary appointee either way, this provision of the bill is equally\r\nopposed to the Constitution.\r\n\r\nTake the case of a soldier or officer appointed to perform the office\r\nof judge in one of these States, and, as such, to administer the\r\nproper laws of the State. Where is the authority to be found in the\r\nConstitution for vesting in a military or an executive officer strict\r\njudicial functions to be exercised under State law? It has been again\r\nand again decided by the Supreme Court of the United States that acts\r\nof Congress which have attempted to vest _executive_ powers in the\r\n_judicial_ courts or judges of the United States are not warranted by\r\nthe Constitution. If Congress can not clothe _a judge_ with merely\r\n_executive_ duties, how can they clothe _an officer_ or _soldier_ of the\r\nArmy with _judicial_ duties over citizens of the United States who are\r\nnot in the military or naval service? So, too, it has been repeatedly\r\ndecided that Congress can not require a State officer, executive or\r\njudicial, to perform any duty enjoined upon him by a law of the United\r\nStates. How, then, can Congress confer power upon an executive officer\r\nof the United States to perform such duties in a State? If Congress\r\ncould not vest in a judge of one of these States any judicial authority\r\nunder the United States by direct enactment, how can it accomplish the\r\nsame thing indirectly, by removing the State judge and putting an\r\nofficer of the United States in his place?\r\n\r\nTo me these considerations are conclusive of the unconstitutionality\r\nof this part of the bill now before me, and I earnestly commend their\r\nconsideration to the deliberate judgment of Congress.\r\n\r\nWithin a period less than a year the legislation of Congress has\r\nattempted to strip the executive department of the Government of some\r\nof its essential powers. The Constitution and the oath provided in it\r\ndevolve upon the President the power and duty to see that the laws are\r\nfaithfully executed. The Constitution, in order to carry out this power,\r\ngives him the choice of the agents, and makes them subject to his\r\ncontrol and supervision. But in the execution of these laws the\r\nconstitutional obligation upon the President remains, but the power\r\nto exercise that constitutional duty is effectually taken away. The\r\nmilitary commander is as to the power of appointment made to take the\r\nplace of the President, and the General of the Army the place of the\r\nSenate; and any attempt on the part of the President to assert his own\r\nconstitutional power may, under pretense of law, be met by official\r\ninsubordination. It is to be feared that these military officers,\r\nlooking to the authority given by these laws rather than to the letter\r\nof the Constitution, will recognize no authority but the commander of\r\nthe district and the General of the Army.\r\n\r\nIf there were no other objection than this to this proposed legislation,\r\nit would be sufficient. Whilst I hold the chief executive authority of\r\nthe United States, whilst the obligation rests upon me to see that all\r\nthe laws are faithfully executed, I can never willingly surrender that\r\ntrust or the powers given for its execution. I can never give my assent\r\nto be made responsible for the faithful execution of laws, and at the\r\nsame time surrender that trust and the powers which accompany it to any\r\nother executive officer, high or low, or to any number of executive\r\nofficers. If this executive trust, vested by the Constitution in the\r\nPresident, is to be taken from him and vested in a subordinate officer,\r\nthe responsibility will be with Congress in clothing the subordinate\r\nwith unconstitutional power and with the officer who assumes its\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\nThis interference with the constitutional authority of the executive\r\ndepartment is an evil that will inevitably sap the foundations of our\r\nfederal system; but it is not the worst evil of this legislation. It is\r\na great public wrong to take from the President powers conferred on him\r\nalone by the Constitution, but the wrong is more flagrant and more\r\ndangerous when the powers so taken from the President are conferred upon\r\nsubordinate executive officers, and especially upon military officers.\r\nOver nearly one-third of the States of the Union military power,\r\nregulated by no fixed law, rules supreme. Each one of the five district\r\ncommanders, though not chosen by the people or responsible to them,\r\nexercises at this hour more executive power, military and civil, than\r\nthe people have ever been willing to confer upon the head of the\r\nexecutive department, though chosen by and responsible to themselves.\r\nThe remedy must come from the people themselves. They know what it is\r\nand how it is to be applied. At the present time they can not, according\r\nto the forms of the Constitution, repeal these laws; they can not remove\r\nor control this military despotism. The remedy is, nevertheless, in\r\ntheir hands; it is to be found in the ballot, and is a sure one if\r\nnot controlled by fraud, overawed by arbitrary power, or, from apathy\r\non their part, too long delayed. With abiding confidence in their\r\npatriotism, wisdom, and integrity, I am still hopeful of the future, and\r\nthat in the end the rod of despotism will be broken, the armed heel of\r\npower lifted from the necks of the people, and the principles of a\r\nviolated Constitution preserved.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _July 19, 1867_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nFor reasons heretofore stated in my several veto messages to Congress\r\nupon the subject of reconstruction, I return without my approval the\r\n\"Joint resolution to carry into effect the several acts providing for\r\nthe more efficient government of the rebel States,\" and appropriating\r\nfor that purpose the sum of $1,000,000.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas by the Constitution of the United States the executive power is\r\nvested in a President of the United States of America, who is bound by\r\nsolemn oath faithfully to execute the office of President and to the\r\nbest of his ability to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of\r\nthe United States, and is by the same instrument made Commander in Chief\r\nof the Army and Navy of the United States and is required to take care\r\nthat the laws be faithfully executed; and\r\n\r\nWhereas by the same Constitution it is provided that the said\r\nConstitution and the laws of the United States which shall be made in\r\npursuance thereof shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges\r\nin every State shall be bound thereby;

and\r\n\r\nWhereas all officers, civil and military, are bound by oath that they\r\nwill support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign\r\nand domestic, and will bear true faith and allegiance to the same;

SEWARD,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas in the month of July, A.D. 1861, the two Houses of Congress,\r\nwith extraordinary unanimity, solemnly declared that the war then\r\nexisting was not waged on the part of the Government in any spirit of\r\noppression nor for any purpose of conquest or subjugation, nor purpose\r\nof overthrowing or interfering with the rights or established\r\ninstitutions of the States, but to defend and maintain the supremacy\r\nof the Constitution and to preserve the Union, with all the dignity,\r\nequality, and rights of the several States unimpaired, and that as soon\r\nas these objects should be accomplished the war ought to cease; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the President of the United States, on the 8th day of December,\r\nA.D. 1863, and on the 26th day of March, A.D. 1864, did, with the\r\nobjects of suppressing the then existing rebellion, of inducing all\r\npersons to return to their loyalty, and of restoring the authority of\r\nthe United States, issue proclamations offering amnesty and pardon to\r\nall persons who had, directly or indirectly, participated in the then\r\nexisting rebellion, except as in those proclamations was specified and\r\nreserved; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the President of the United States did on the 29th day of May,\r\nA.D. 1865, issue a further proclamation, with the same objects before\r\nmentioned, and to the end that the authority of the Government of the\r\nUnited States might be restored and that peace, order, and freedom might\r\nbe established, and the President did by the said last-mentioned\r\nproclamation proclaim and declare that he thereby granted to all persons\r\nwho had, directly or indirectly, participated in the then existing\r\nrebellion, except as therein excepted, amnesty and pardon, with\r\nrestoration of all rights of property, except as to slaves, and except\r\nin certain cases where legal proceedings had been instituted, but upon\r\ncondition that such persons should take and subscribe an oath therein\r\nprescribed, which oath should be registered for permanent preservation;\r\nand\r\n\r\nWhereas in and by the said last-mentioned proclamation of the 29th\r\nday of May, A.D. 1865, fourteen extensive classes of persons therein\r\nspecially described were altogether excepted and excluded from the\r\nbenefits thereof; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the President of the United States did, on the 2d day of April,\r\nA.D. 1866, issue a proclamation declaring that the insurrection was at\r\nan end and was thenceforth to be so regarded; and\r\n\r\nWhereas there now exists no organized armed resistance of misguided\r\ncitizens or others to the authority of the United States in the\r\nStates of Georgia, South Carolina, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee,\r\nAlabama, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Florida, and Texas, and the\r\nlaws can be sustained and enforced therein by the proper civil\r\nauthority, State or Federal, and the people of said States are well and\r\nloyally disposed, and have conformed, or, if permitted to do so, will\r\nconform in their legislation to the condition of affairs growing out\r\nof the amendment to the Constitution of the United States prohibiting\r\nslavery within the limits and jurisdiction of the United States; and\r\n\r\nWhereas there no longer exists any reasonable ground to apprehend within\r\nthe States which were involved in the late rebellion any renewal thereof\r\nor any unlawful resistance by the people of said States to the\r\nConstitution and laws of the United States; and\r\n\r\nWhereas large standing armies, military occupation, martial law,\r\nmilitary tribunals, and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of\r\n_habeas corpus_ and the right of trial by jury are in time of peace\r\ndangerous to public liberty, incompatible with the individual rights of\r\nthe citizen, contrary to the genius and spirit of our free institutions,\r\nand exhaustive of the national resources, and ought not, therefore,\r\nto be sanctioned or allowed except in cases of actual necessity for\r\nrepelling invasion or suppressing insurrection or rebellion; and\r\n\r\nWhereas a retaliatory or vindictive policy, attended by unnecessary\r\ndisqualifications, pains, penalties, confiscations, and disfranchisements,\r\nnow, as always, could only tend to hinder reconciliation among the people\r\nand national restoration, while it must seriously embarrass, obstruct,\r\nand repress popular energies and national industry and enterprise; and\r\n\r\nWhereas for these reasons it is now deemed essential to the public\r\nwelfare and to the more perfect restoration of constitutional law and\r\norder that the said last-mentioned proclamation so as aforesaid issued\r\non the 29th day of May, A.D. 1865, should be modified, and that the full\r\nand beneficent pardon conceded thereby should be opened and further\r\nextended to a large number of the persons who by its aforesaid\r\nexceptions have been hitherto excluded from Executive clemency:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it known that I, Andrew Johnson, President of the\r\nUnited States, do hereby proclaim and declare that the full pardon\r\ndescribed in the said proclamation of the 29th day of May, A.D. 1865,\r\nshall henceforth be opened and extended to all persons who, directly or\r\nindirectly, participated in the late rebellion, with the restoration\r\nof all privileges, immunities, and rights of property, except as to\r\nproperty with regard to slaves, and except in cases of legal proceedings\r\nunder the laws of the United States; but upon this condition,\r\nnevertheless, that every such person who shall seek to avail himself of\r\nthis proclamation shall take and subscribe the following oath and shall\r\ncause the same to be registered for permanent preservation in the same\r\nmanner and with the same effect as with the oath prescribed in the said\r\nproclamation of the 29th day of May, 1865, namely:\r\n\r\n  I, ---- ----, do solemnly swear (or affirm), in presence of Almighty\r\n  God, that I will henceforth faithfully support, protect, and defend\r\n  the Constitution of the United States and the Union of the States\r\n  thereunder, and that I will in like manner abide by and faithfully\r\n  support all laws and proclamations which have been made during the late\r\n  rebellion with reference to the emancipation of slaves.

He has permitted us to\r\nmultiply ships upon our lakes and rivers and upon the high seas, and at\r\nthe same time to extend our iron roads so far into the secluded places\r\nof the continent as to guarantee speedy overland intercourse between\r\nthe two oceans. He has inclined our hearts to turn away from domestic\r\ncontentions and commotions consequent upon a distracting and desolating\r\ncivil war, and to walk more and more in the ancient ways of loyalty,\r\nconciliation, and brotherly love. He has blessed the peaceful efforts\r\nwith which we have established new and important commercial treaties\r\nwith foreign nations, while we have at the same time strengthened our\r\nnational defenses and greatly enlarged our national borders.\r\n\r\nWhile thus rendering the unanimous and heartfelt tribute of national\r\npraise and thanksgiving which is so justly due to Almighty God, let us\r\nnot fail to implore Him that the same divine protection and care which\r\nwe have hitherto so undeservedly and yet so constantly enjoyed may be\r\ncontinued to our country and our people throughout all their generations\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 26th day of October, A.D. 1867, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States the ninety-second.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  WILLIAM H.

The oath prescribed in the supplemental act defines all the\r\nqualifications required, and every person who can take that oath is\r\nentitled to have his name entered upon the list of voters.\r\n\r\n2. The board of registration have no authority to administer any other\r\noath to the person applying for registration than this prescribed oath,\r\nnor to administer an oath to any other person touching the\r\nqualifications of the applicant or the falsity of the oath so taken by\r\nhim. The act, to guard against falsity in the oath, provides that if\r\nfalse the person taking it shall be tried and punished for perjury.\r\n\r\nNo provision is made for challenging the qualifications of the applicant\r\nor entering upon any trial or investigation of his qualifications,\r\neither by witnesses or any other form of proof.\r\n\r\n3. _As to citizenship and residence_:\r\n\r\nThe applicant for registration must be a citizen of the State and of the\r\nUnited States, and must be a resident of a county or parish included in\r\nthe election district. He may be registered if he has been such citizen\r\nfor a period less than twelve months at the time he applies for\r\nregistration, but he can not vote at any election unless his citizenship\r\nhas _then_ extended to the full term of one year. As to such a person,\r\nthe exact length of his citizenship should be noted opposite his name on\r\nthe list, so that it may appear on the day of election, upon reference\r\nto the list, whether the full term has then been accomplished.\r\n\r\n4. An unnaturalized person can not take this oath, but an alien who has\r\nbeen naturalized can take it, and no other proof of naturalization can\r\nbe required from him.\r\n\r\n5. No one who is not 21 years of age at the time of registration can\r\ntake the oath, for he must swear that he has then attained that age.\r\n\r\n6. No one who has been disfranchised for participation in any rebellion\r\nagainst the United States or for felony committed against the laws of\r\nany State or of the United States can take this oath.\r\n\r\nThe actual participation in a rebellion or the actual commission of a\r\nfelony does not amount to disfranchisement. The sort of disfranchisement\r\nhere meant is that which is declared by law passed by competent\r\nauthority, or which has been fixed upon the criminal by the sentence of\r\nthe court which tried him for the crime.\r\n\r\nNo law of the United States has declared the penalty of disfranchisement\r\nfor participation in rebellion alone; nor is it known that any such law\r\nexists in either of these ten States, except, perhaps, Virginia, as to\r\nwhich State special instructions will be given.\r\n\r\n7. _As to disfranchisement arising from having held office followed by\r\nparticipation in rebellion_:\r\n\r\nThis is the most important part of the oath, and requires strict\r\nattention to arrive at its meaning. The applicant must swear or affirm\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  That I have never been a member of any State legislature, nor held any\r\n  executive or judicial office in any State, and afterwards engaged in\r\n  an insurrection or rebellion against the United States or given aid or\r\n  comfort to the enemies thereof; that I have never taken an oath as a\r\n  member of Congress of the United States, or as an officer of the United\r\n  States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive\r\n  or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the\r\n  United States, and afterwards engaged in insurrection or rebellion\r\n  against the United States or given aid or comfort to the enemies\r\n  thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo elements must concur in order to disqualify a person under these\r\nclauses: First, the office and official oath to support the Constitution\r\nof the United States; second, engaging afterwards in rebellion. Both\r\nmust exist to work disqualification, and must happen in the order of\r\ntime mentioned.\r\n\r\nA person who has held an office and taken the oath to support the\r\nFederal Constitution and has not afterwards engaged in rebellion is not\r\ndisqualified. So, too, a person who has engaged in rebellion, but has\r\nnot theretofore held an office and taken that oath, is not disqualified.\r\n\r\n8. _Officers of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAs to these the language is without limitation. The person who has at\r\nany time prior to the rebellion held an office, civil or military, under\r\nthe United States, and has taken an official oath to support the\r\nConstitution of the United States, is subject to disqualification.\r\n\r\n9. _Militia officers_ of any State prior to the rebellion are not\r\nsubject to disqualification.\r\n\r\n10. _Municipal officers_--that is to say, officers of incorporated\r\ncities, towns, and villages, such as mayors, aldermen, town council,\r\npolice, and other city or town officers--are not subject to\r\ndisqualification.\r\n\r\n11. Persons who have prior to the rebellion been members of the Congress\r\nof the United States or members of a State legislature are subject to\r\ndisqualification, but those who have been members of conventions framing\r\nor amending the Constitution of a State prior to the rebellion are not\r\nsubject to disqualification.\r\n\r\n12. All the executive or judicial officers of any State who took an oath\r\nto support the Constitution of the United States are subject to\r\ndisqualification, including county officers. They are subject to\r\ndisqualification if they were required to take as a part of their\r\nofficial oath _the oath to support the Constitution of the United\r\nStates_.\r\n\r\n13. Persons who exercised mere employment under State authority are not\r\ndisqualified; such as commissioners to lay out roads, commissioners of\r\npublic works, visitors of State institutions, directors of State\r\ninstitutions, examiners of banks, notaries public, and commissioners to\r\ntake acknowledgments of deeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGAGING IN REBELLION.\r\n\r\nHaving specified what offices held by anyone prior to the rebellion come\r\nwithin the meaning of the law, it is necessary next to set forth what\r\nsubsequent conduct fixes upon such person the offense of engaging in\r\nrebellion. Two things must exist as to any person to disqualify him from\r\nvoting: First, the office held prior to the rebellion, and, afterwards,\r\nparticipation in the rebellion.\r\n\r\n14. An act to fix upon a person the offense of engaging in the rebellion\r\nunder this law must be an overt and voluntary act, done with the intent\r\nof aiding or furthering the common unlawful purpose. A person forced\r\ninto the rebel service by conscription or under a paramount authority\r\nwhich he could not safely disobey, and who would not have entered such\r\nservice if left to the free exercise of his own will, can not be held\r\nto be disqualified from voting.\r\n\r\n15. Mere acts of charity, where the intent is to relieve the wants of\r\nthe object of such charity, and not done in aid of the cause in which he\r\nmay have been engaged, do not disqualify; but organized contributions\r\nof food and clothing for the general relief of persons engaged in the\r\nrebellion, and not of a merely sanitary character, but contributed to\r\nenable them to perform their unlawful object, may be classed with acts\r\nwhich do disqualify.\r\n\r\nForced contributions to the rebel cause in the form of taxes or military\r\nassessments, which a person was compelled to pay or contribute, do not\r\ndisqualify; but voluntary contributions to the rebel cause, even such\r\nindirect contributions as arise from the voluntary loan of money to\r\nrebel authorities or purchase of bonds or securities created to afford\r\nthe means of carrying on the rebellion, will work disqualification.\r\n\r\n16. All those who in legislative or other official capacity were engaged\r\nin the furtherance of the common unlawful purpose, where the duties of\r\nthe office necessarily had relation to the support of the rebellion,\r\nsuch as members of the rebel conventions, congresses, and legislatures,\r\ndiplomatic agents of the rebel Confederacy, and other officials whose\r\noffices were created for the purpose of more effectually carrying on\r\nhostilities or whose duties appertained to the support of the rebel\r\ncause, must be held to be disqualified.\r\n\r\nBut officers who during the rebellion discharged official duties not\r\nincident to war, but only such duties as belong even to a state of peace\r\nand were necessary to the preservation of order and the administration\r\nof law, are not to be considered as thereby engaging in rebellion or as\r\ndisqualified. Disloyal sentiments, opinions, or sympathies would not\r\ndisqualify, but where a person has by speech or by writing incited\r\nothers to engage in rebellion he must come under the disqualification.\r\n\r\n17. _The duties of the board appointed to superintend the elections_:\r\n\r\nThis board, having the custody of the list of registered voters in the\r\ndistrict for which it is constituted, must see that the name of the\r\nperson offering to vote is found upon the registration list, and if such\r\nproves to be the fact it is the duty of the board to receive his vote if\r\nthen qualified by residence. They can not receive the vote of any person\r\nwhose name is not upon the list, though he may be ready to take the\r\nregistration oath, and although he may satisfy them that he was unable\r\nto have his name registered at the proper time, in consequence of\r\nabsence, sickness, or other cause.\r\n\r\nThe board can not enter into any inquiry as to the qualifications of any\r\nperson whose name is not on the registration list, or as to the\r\nqualifications of any person whose name is on the list.\r\n\r\n18. _The mode of voting_ is provided in the act to be _by ballot_. The\r\nboard will keep a record and poll book of the election, showing the\r\nvotes, list of voters, and the persons elected by a plurality of the\r\nvotes cast at the election, and make returns of these to the commanding\r\ngeneral of the district.\r\n\r\n19. The board appointed for registration and for superintending the\r\nelections must take the oath prescribed by the act of Congress approved\r\nJuly 2, 1862, entitled \"An act to prescribe an oath of office.\"\r\n\r\nBy order of the President:\r\n\r\nE.D.

We may, however, find some relief from that\r\nanxiety in the reflection that the painful political situation, although\r\nbefore untried by ourselves, is not new in the experience of nations.\r\nPolitical science, perhaps as highly perfected in our own time and\r\ncountry as in any other, has not yet disclosed any means by which civil\r\nwars can be absolutely prevented. An enlightened nation, however, with a\r\nwise and beneficent constitution of free government, may diminish their\r\nfrequency and mitigate their severity by directing all its proceedings\r\nin accordance with its fundamental law.\r\n\r\nWhen a civil war has been brought to a close, it is manifestly the first\r\ninterest and duty of the state to repair the injuries which the war has\r\ninflicted, and to secure the benefit of the lessons it teaches as fully\r\nand as speedily as possible. This duty was, upon the termination of the\r\nrebellion, promptly accepted, not only by the executive department, but\r\nby the insurrectionary States themselves, and restoration in the first\r\nmoment of peace was believed to be as easy and certain as it was\r\nindispensable. The expectations, however, then so reasonably and\r\nconfidently entertained were disappointed by legislation from which\r\nI felt constrained by my obligations to the Constitution to withhold\r\nmy assent.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore a source of profound regret that in complying with the\r\nobligation imposed upon the President by the Constitution to give to\r\nCongress from time to time information of the state of the Union I am\r\nunable to communicate any definitive adjustment, satisfactory to the\r\nAmerican people, of the questions which since the close of the rebellion\r\nhave agitated the public mind. On the contrary, candor compels me to\r\ndeclare that at this time there is no Union as our fathers understood\r\nthe term, and as they meant it to be understood by us. The Union which\r\nthey established can exist only where all the States are represented in\r\nboth Houses of Congress; where one State is as free as another to\r\nregulate its internal concerns according to its own will, and where the\r\nlaws of the central Government, strictly confined to matters of national\r\njurisdiction, apply with equal force to all the people of every section.\r\nThat such is not the present \"state of the Union\" is a melancholy fact,\r\nand we must all acknowledge that the restoration of the States to their\r\nproper legal relations with the Federal Government and with one another,\r\naccording to the terms of the original compact, would be the greatest\r\ntemporal blessing which God, in His kindest providence, could bestow\r\nupon this nation. It becomes our imperative duty to consider whether\r\nor not it is impossible to effect this most desirable consummation.\r\n\r\nThe Union and the Constitution are inseparable. As long as one is obeyed\r\nby all parties, the other will be preserved; and if one is destroyed,\r\nboth must perish together. The destruction of the Constitution will be\r\nfollowed by other and still greater calamities. It was ordained not only\r\nto form a more perfect union between the States, but to \"establish\r\njustice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defense,\r\npromote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to\r\nourselves and our posterity.\" Nothing but implicit obedience to its\r\nrequirements in all parts of the country will accomplish these great\r\nends. Without that obedience we can look forward only to continual\r\noutrages upon individual rights, incessant breaches of the public peace,\r\nnational weakness, financial dishonor, the total loss of our prosperity,\r\nthe general corruption of morals, and the final extinction of popular\r\nfreedom. To save our country from evils so appalling as these, we should\r\nrenew our efforts again and again.\r\n\r\nTo me the process of restoration seems perfectly plain and simple. It\r\nconsists merely in a faithful application of the Constitution and laws.\r\nThe execution of the laws is not now obstructed or opposed by physical\r\nforce. There is no military or other necessity, real or pretended, which\r\ncan prevent obedience to the Constitution, either North or South.\r\nAll the rights and all the obligations of States and individuals\r\ncan be protected and enforced by means perfectly consistent with the\r\nfundamental law. The courts may be everywhere open, and if open their\r\nprocess would be unimpeded. Crimes against the United States can be\r\nprevented or punished by the proper judicial authorities in a manner\r\nentirely practicable and legal. There is therefore no reason why the\r\nConstitution should not be obeyed, unless those who exercise its powers\r\nhave determined that it shall be disregarded and violated. The mere\r\nnaked will of this Government, or of some one or more of its branches,\r\nis the only obstacle that can exist to a perfect union of all the\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nOn this momentous question and some of the measures growing out of it\r\nI have had the misfortune to differ from Congress, and have expressed\r\nmy convictions without reserve, though with becoming deference to the\r\nopinion of the legislative department. Those convictions are not only\r\nunchanged, but strengthened by subsequent events and further reflection.\r\nThe transcendent importance of the subject will be a sufficient excuse\r\nfor calling your attention to some of the reasons which have so strongly\r\ninfluenced my own judgment. The hope that we may all finally concur in a\r\nmode of settlement consistent at once with our true interests and with\r\nour sworn duties to the Constitution is too natural and too just to be\r\neasily relinquished.\r\n\r\nIt is clear to my apprehension that the States lately in rebellion are\r\nstill members of the National Union. When did they cease to be so? The\r\n\"ordinances of secession\" adopted by a portion (in most of them a very\r\nsmall portion) of their citizens were mere nullities. If we admit now\r\nthat they were valid and effectual for the purpose intended by their\r\nauthors, we sweep from under our feet the whole ground upon which we\r\njustified the war. Were those States afterwards expelled from the Union\r\nby the war? The direct contrary was averred by this Government to be its\r\npurpose, and was so understood by all those who gave their blood and\r\ntreasure to aid in its prosecution. It can not be that a successful\r\nwar, waged for the preservation of the Union, had the legal effect of\r\ndissolving it. The victory of the nation's arms was not the disgrace\r\nof her policy; the defeat of secession on the battlefield was not the\r\ntriumph of its lawless principle. Nor could Congress, with or without\r\nthe consent of the Executive, do anything which would have the effect,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, of separating the States from each other.\r\nTo dissolve the Union is to repeal the Constitution which holds it\r\ntogether, and that is a power which does not belong to any department\r\nof this Government, or to all of them united.\r\n\r\nThis is so plain that it has been acknowledged by all branches of the\r\nFederal Government. The Executive (my predecessor as well as myself) and\r\nthe heads of all the Departments have uniformly acted upon the principle\r\nthat the Union is not only undissolved, but indissoluble. Congress\r\nsubmitted an amendment of the Constitution to be ratified by the\r\nSouthern States, and accepted their acts of ratification as a necessary\r\nand lawful exercise of their highest function. If they were not States,\r\nor were States out of the Union, their consent to a change in the\r\nfundamental law of the Union would have been nugatory, and Congress in\r\nasking it committed a political absurdity. The judiciary has also given\r\nthe solemn sanction of its authority to the same view of the case. The\r\njudges of the Supreme Court have included the Southern States in their\r\ncircuits, and they are constantly, _in banc_ and elsewhere, exercising\r\njurisdiction which does not belong to them unless those States are\r\nStates of the Union.\r\n\r\nIf the Southern States are component parts of the Union, the\r\nConstitution is the supreme law for them, as it is for all the other\r\nStates. They are bound to obey it, and so are we. The right of the\r\nFederal Government, which is clear and unquestionable, to enforce the\r\nConstitution upon them implies the correlative obligation on our part\r\nto observe its limitations and execute its guaranties. Without the\r\nConstitution we are nothing; by, through, and under the Constitution we\r\nare what it makes us. We may doubt the wisdom of the law, we may not\r\napprove of its provisions, but we can not violate it merely because it\r\nseems to confine our powers within limits narrower than we could wish.\r\nIt is not a question of individual or class or sectional interest, much\r\nless of party predominance, but of duty--of high and sacred duty--which\r\nwe are all sworn to perform. If we can not support the Constitution with\r\nthe cheerful alacrity of those who love and believe in it, we must give\r\nto it at least the fidelity of public servants who act under solemn\r\nobligations and commands which they dare not disregard.\r\n\r\nThe constitutional duty is not the only one which requires the States\r\nto be restored. There is another consideration which, though of minor\r\nimportance, is yet of great weight. On the 22d day of July, 1861,\r\nCongress declared by an almost unanimous vote of both Houses that the\r\nwar should be conducted solely for the purpose of preserving the Union\r\nand maintaining the supremacy of the Federal Constitution and laws,\r\nwithout impairing the dignity, equality, and rights of the States or of\r\nindividuals, and that when this was done the war should cease. I do not\r\nsay that this declaration is personally binding on those who joined in\r\nmaking it; any more than individual members of Congress are personally\r\nbound to pay a public debt created under a law for which they voted.\r\nBut it was a solemn, public, official pledge of the national honor,\r\nand I can not imagine upon what grounds the repudiation of it is to\r\nbe justified. If it be said that we are not bound to keep faith with\r\nrebels, let it be remembered that this promise was not made to rebels\r\nonly. Thousands of true men in the South were drawn to our standard by\r\nit, and hundreds of thousands in the North gave their lives in the\r\nbelief that it would be carried out. It was made on the day after the\r\nfirst great battle of the war had been fought and lost. All patriotic\r\nand intelligent men then saw the necessity of giving such an assurance,\r\nand believed that without it the war would end in disaster to our cause.\r\nHaving given that assurance in the extremity of our peril, the violation\r\nof it now, in the day of our power, would be a rude rending of that good\r\nfaith which holds the moral world together; our country would cease to\r\nhave any claim upon the confidence of men; it would make the war not\r\nonly a failure, but a fraud.\r\n\r\nBeing sincerely convinced that these views are correct, I would be\r\nunfaithful to my duty if I did not recommend the repeal of the acts of\r\nCongress which place ten of the Southern States under the domination of\r\nmilitary masters. If calm reflection shall satisfy a majority of your\r\nhonorable bodies that the acts referred to are not only a violation of\r\nthe national faith, but in direct conflict with the Constitution, I dare\r\nnot permit myself to doubt that you will immediately strike them from\r\nthe statute book.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate the unconstitutional character of those acts I need do no\r\nmore than refer to their general provisions. It must be seen at once\r\nthat they are not authorized. To dictate what alterations shall be made\r\nin the constitutions of the several States; to control the elections of\r\nState legislators and State officers, members of Congress and electors\r\nof President and Vice-President, by arbitrarily declaring who shall\r\nvote and who shall be excluded from that privilege; to dissolve State\r\nlegislatures or prevent them from assembling; to dismiss judges and\r\nother civil functionaries of the State and appoint others without regard\r\nto State law; to organize and operate all the political machinery of the\r\nStates; to regulate the whole administration of their domestic and local\r\naffairs according to the mere will of strange and irresponsible agents,\r\nsent among them for that purpose--these are powers not granted to the\r\nFederal Government or to any one of its branches. Not being granted, we\r\nviolate our trust by assuming them as palpably as we would by acting in\r\nthe face of a positive interdict; for the Constitution forbids us to do\r\nwhatever it does not affirmatively authorize, either by express words or\r\nby clear implication. If the authority we desire to use does not come to\r\nus through the Constitution, we can exercise it only by usurpation, and\r\nusurpation is the most dangerous of political crimes. By that crime the\r\nenemies of free government in all ages have worked out their designs\r\nagainst public liberty and private right. It leads directly and\r\nimmediately to the establishment of absolute rule, for undelegated\r\npower is always unlimited and unrestrained.\r\n\r\nThe acts of Congress in question are not only objectionable for their\r\nassumption of ungranted power, but many of their provisions are in\r\nconflict with the direct prohibitions of the Constitution. The\r\nConstitution commands that a republican form of government shall be\r\nguaranteed to all the States; that no person shall be deprived of life,\r\nliberty, or property without due process of law, arrested without a\r\njudicial warrant, or punished without a fair trial before an impartial\r\njury; that the privilege of _habeas corpus_ shall not be denied in time\r\nof peace, and that no bill of attainder shall be passed even against a\r\nsingle individual. Yet the system of measures established by these acts\r\nof Congress does totally subvert and destroy the form as well as the\r\nsubstance of republican government in the ten States to which they\r\napply. It binds them hand and foot in absolute slavery, and subjects\r\nthem to a strange and hostile power, more unlimited and more likely to\r\nbe abused than any other now known among civilized men. It tramples down\r\nall those rights in which the essence of liberty consists, and which a\r\nfree government is always most careful to protect. It denies the _habeas\r\ncorpus_ and the trial by jury. Personal freedom, property, and life, if\r\nassailed by the passion, the prejudice, or the rapacity of the ruler,\r\nhave no security whatever. It has the effect of a bill of attainder or\r\nbill of pains and penalties, not upon a few individuals, but upon whole\r\nmasses, including the millions who inhabit the subject States, and even\r\ntheir unborn children. These wrongs, being expressly forbidden, can not\r\nbe constitutionally inflicted upon any portion of our people, no matter\r\nhow they may have come within our jurisdiction, and no matter whether\r\nthey live in States, Territories, or districts.\r\n\r\nI have no desire to save from the proper and just consequences of their\r\ngreat crime those who engaged in rebellion against the Government, but\r\nas a mode of punishment the measures under consideration are the most\r\nunreasonable that could be invented. Many of those people are perfectly\r\ninnocent; many kept their fidelity to the Union untainted to the last;\r\nmany were incapable of any legal offense; a large proportion even of the\r\npersons able to bear arms were forced into rebellion against their will,\r\nand of those who are guilty with their own consent the degrees of guilt\r\nare as various as the shades of their character and temper. But these\r\nacts of Congress confound them all together in one common doom.\r\nIndiscriminate vengeance upon classes, sects, and parties, or upon whole\r\ncommunities, for offenses committed by a portion of them against the\r\ngovernments to which they owed obedience was common in the barbarous\r\nages of the world; but Christianity and civilization have made such\r\nprogress that recourse to a punishment so cruel and unjust would meet\r\nwith the condemnation of all unprejudiced and right-minded men. The\r\npunitive justice of this age, and especially of this country, does not\r\nconsist in stripping whole States of their liberties and reducing all\r\ntheir people, without distinction, to the condition of slavery. It deals\r\nseparately with each individual, confines itself to the forms of law,\r\nand vindicates its own purity by an impartial examination of every case\r\nbefore a competent judicial tribunal. If this does not satisfy all our\r\ndesires with regard to Southern rebels, let us console ourselves by\r\nreflecting that a free Constitution, triumphant in war and unbroken in\r\npeace, is worth far more to us and our children than the gratification\r\nof any present feeling.\r\n\r\nI am aware it is assumed that this system of government for the\r\nSouthern States is not to be perpetual. It is true this military\r\ngovernment is to be only provisional, but it is through this temporary\r\nevil that a greater evil is to be made perpetual. If the guaranties\r\nof the Constitution can be broken provisionally to serve a temporary\r\npurpose, and in a part only of the country, we can destroy them\r\neverywhere and for all time. Arbitrary measures often change, but they\r\ngenerally change for the worse. It is the curse of despotism that it has\r\nno halting place. The intermitted exercise of its power brings no sense\r\nof security to its subjects, for they can never know what more they will\r\nbe called to endure when its red right hand is armed to plague them\r\nagain. Nor is it possible to conjecture how or where power, unrestrained\r\nby law, may seek its next victims. The States that are still free may be\r\nenslaved at any moment; for if the Constitution does not protect all, it\r\nprotects none.\r\n\r\nIt is manifestly and avowedly the object of these laws to confer upon\r\nnegroes the privilege of voting and to disfranchise such a number of\r\nwhite citizens as will give the former a clear majority at all elections\r\nin the Southern States. This, to the minds of some persons, is so\r\nimportant that a violation of the Constitution is justified as a means\r\nof bringing it about. The morality is always false which excuses a wrong\r\nbecause it proposes to accomplish a desirable end. We are not permitted\r\nto do evil that good may come. But in this case the end itself is evil,\r\nas well as the means. The subjugation of the States to negro domination\r\nwould be worse than the military despotism under which they are now\r\nsuffering. It was believed beforehand that the people would endure any\r\namount of military oppression for any length of time rather than degrade\r\nthemselves by subjection to the negro race. Therefore they have been\r\nleft without a choice. Negro suffrage was established by act of\r\nCongress, and the military officers were commanded to superintend the\r\nprocess of clothing the negro race with the political privileges torn\r\nfrom white men.\r\n\r\nThe blacks in the South are entitled to be well and humanely governed,\r\nand to have the protection of just laws for all their rights of person\r\nand property. If it were practicable at this time to give them a\r\nGovernment exclusively their own, under which they might manage their\r\nown affairs in their own way, it would become a grave question whether\r\nwe ought to do so, or whether common humanity would not require us to\r\nsave them from themselves. But under the circumstances this is only a\r\nspeculative point. It is not proposed merely that they shall govern\r\nthemselves, but that they shall rule the white race, make and administer\r\nState laws, elect Presidents and members of Congress, and shape to a\r\ngreater or less extent the future destiny of the whole country. Would\r\nsuch a trust and power be safe in such hands?\r\n\r\nThe peculiar qualities which should characterize any people who are fit\r\nto decide upon the management of public affairs for a great state have\r\nseldom been combined. It is the glory of white men to know that they\r\nhave had these qualities in sufficient measure to build upon this\r\ncontinent a great political fabric and to preserve its stability for\r\nmore than ninety years, while in every other part of the world all\r\nsimilar experiments have failed. But if anything can be proved by known\r\nfacts, if all reasoning upon evidence is not abandoned, it must be\r\nacknowledged that in the progress of nations negroes have shown less\r\ncapacity for government than any other race of people. No independent\r\ngovernment of any form has ever been successful in their hands. On the\r\ncontrary, wherever they have been left to their own devices they have\r\nshown a constant tendency to relapse into barbarism. In the Southern\r\nStates, however, Congress has undertaken to confer upon them the\r\nprivilege of the ballot. Just released from slavery, it may be doubted\r\nwhether as a class they know more than their ancestors how to organize\r\nand regulate civil society. Indeed, it is admitted that the blacks of\r\nthe South are not only regardless of the rights of property, but so\r\nutterly ignorant of public affairs that their voting can consist in\r\nnothing more than carrying a ballot to the place where they are directed\r\nto deposit it. I need not remind you that the exercise of the elective\r\nfranchise is the highest attribute of an American citizen, and that when\r\nguided by virtue, intelligence, patriotism, and a proper appreciation of\r\nour free institutions it constitutes the true basis of a democratic form\r\nof government, in which the sovereign power is lodged in the body of the\r\npeople. A trust artificially created, not for its own sake, but solely\r\nas a means of promoting the general welfare, its influence for good must\r\nnecessarily depend upon the elevated character and true allegiance of\r\nthe elector. It ought, therefore, to be reposed in none except those who\r\nare fitted morally and mentally to administer it well; for if conferred\r\nupon persons who do not justly estimate its value and who are\r\nindifferent as to its results, it will only serve as a means of placing\r\npower in the hands of the unprincipled and ambitious, and must eventuate\r\nin the complete destruction of that liberty of which it should be the\r\nmost powerful conservator. I have therefore heretofore urged upon your\r\nattention the great danger--\r\n\r\n  to be apprehended from an untimely extension of the elective franchise\r\n  to any new class in our country, especially when the large majority of\r\n  that class, in wielding the power thus placed in their hands, can not be\r\n  expected correctly to comprehend the duties and responsibilities which\r\n  pertain to suffrage. Yesterday, as it were, 4,000,000 persons were held\r\n  in a condition of slavery that had existed for generations; to-day they\r\n  are freemen and are assumed by law to be citizens. It can not be\r\n  presumed, from their previous condition of servitude, that as a class\r\n  they are as well informed as to the nature of our Government as the\r\n  intelligent foreigner who makes our land the home of his choice. In the\r\n  case of the latter neither a residence of five years and the knowledge\r\n  of our institutions which it gives nor attachment to the principles of\r\n  the Constitution are the only conditions upon which he can be admitted\r\n  to citizenship; he must prove in addition a good moral character, and\r\n  thus give reasonable ground for the belief that he will be faithful to\r\n  the obligations which he assumes as a citizen of the Republic. Where\r\n  a people--the source of all political power--speak by their suffrages\r\n  through the instrumentality of the ballot box, it must be carefully\r\n  guarded against the control of those who are corrupt in principle and\r\n  enemies of free institutions, for it can only become to our political\r\n  and social system a safe conductor of healthy popular sentiment when\r\n  kept free from demoralizing influences. Controlled through fraud and\r\n  usurpation by the designing, anarchy and despotism must inevitably\r\n  follow. In the hands of the patriotic and worthy our Government will be\r\n  preserved upon the principles of the Constitution inherited from our\r\n  fathers. It follows, therefore, that in admitting to the ballot box\r\n  a new class of voters not qualified for the exercise of the elective\r\n  franchise we weaken our system of government instead of adding to its\r\n  strength and durability.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  I yield to no one in attachment to that rule of general suffrage which\r\n  distinguishes our policy as a nation. But there is a limit, wisely\r\n  observed hitherto, which makes the ballot a privilege and a trust,\r\n  and which requires of some classes a time suitable for probation\r\n  and preparation. To give it indiscriminately to a new class, wholly\r\n  unprepared by previous habits and opportunities to perform the trust\r\n  which it demands, is to degrade it, and finally to destroy its power,\r\n  for it may be safely assumed that no political truth is better\r\n  established than that such indiscriminate and all-embracing extension\r\n  of popular suffrage must end at last in its destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nI repeat the expression of my willingness to join in any plan within\r\nthe scope of our constitutional authority which promises to better the\r\ncondition of the negroes in the South, by encouraging them in industry,\r\nenlightening their minds, improving their morals, and giving protection\r\nto all their just rights as freedmen. But the transfer of our political\r\ninheritance to them would, in my opinion, be an abandonment of a duty\r\nwhich we owe alike to the memory of our fathers and the rights of our\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nThe plan of putting the Southern States wholly and the General\r\nGovernment partially into the hands of negroes is proposed at a time\r\npeculiarly unpropitious. The foundations of society have been broken\r\nup by civil war. Industry must be reorganized, justice reestablished,\r\npublic credit maintained, and order brought out of confusion. To\r\naccomplish these ends would require all the wisdom and virtue of the\r\ngreat men who formed our institutions originally. I confidently believe\r\nthat their descendants will be equal to the arduous task before them,\r\nbut it is worse than madness to expect that negroes will perform it for\r\nus. Certainly we ought not to ask their assistance till we despair of\r\nour own competency.\r\n\r\nThe great difference between the two races in physical, mental,\r\nand moral characteristics will prevent an amalgamation or fusion\r\nof them together in one homogeneous mass. If the inferior obtains the\r\nascendency over the other, it will govern with reference only to its own\r\ninterests--for it will recognize no common interest--and create such a\r\ntyranny as this continent has never yet witnessed. Already the negroes\r\nare influenced by promises of confiscation and plunder. They are taught\r\nto regard as an enemy every white man who has any respect for the rights\r\nof his own race. If this continues it must become worse and worse, until\r\nall order will be subverted, all industry cease, and the fertile fields\r\nof the South grow up into a wilderness. Of all the dangers which our\r\nnation has yet encountered, none are equal to those which must result\r\nfrom the success of the effort now making to Africanize the half of\r\nour country.\r\n\r\nI would not put considerations of money in competition with justice and\r\nright; but the expenses incident to \"reconstruction\" under the system\r\nadopted by Congress aggravate what I regard as the intrinsic wrong of\r\nthe measure itself. It has cost uncounted millions already, and if\r\npersisted in will add largely to the weight of taxation, already too\r\noppressive to be borne without just complaint, and may finally reduce\r\nthe Treasury of the nation to a condition of bankruptcy. We must not\r\ndelude ourselves. It will require a strong standing army and probably\r\nmore than $200,000,000 per annum to maintain the supremacy of negro\r\ngovernments after they are established. The sum thus thrown away would,\r\nif properly used, form a sinking fund large enough to pay the whole\r\nnational debt in less than fifteen years. It is vain to hope that\r\nnegroes will maintain their ascendency themselves. Without military\r\npower they are wholly incapable of holding in subjection the white\r\npeople of the South.\r\n\r\nI submit to the judgment of Congress whether the public credit may not\r\nbe injuriously affected by a system of measures like this. With our debt\r\nand the vast private interests which are complicated with it, we can not\r\nbe too cautious of a policy which might by possibility impair the\r\nconfidence of the world in our Government. That confidence can only be\r\nretained by carefully inculcating the principles of justice and honor\r\non the popular mind and by the most scrupulous fidelity to all our\r\nengagements of every sort. Any serious breach of the organic law,\r\npersisted in for a considerable time, can not but create fears for the\r\nstability of our institutions. Habitual violation of prescribed rules,\r\nwhich we bind ourselves to observe, must demoralize the people. Our only\r\nstandard of civil duty being set at naught, the sheet anchor of our\r\npolitical morality is lost, the public conscience swings from its\r\nmoorings and yields to every impulse of passion and interest. If we\r\nrepudiate the Constitution, we will not be expected to care much for\r\nmere pecuniary obligations. The violation of such a pledge as we made on\r\nthe 22d day of July, 1861, will assuredly diminish the market value of\r\nour other promises. Besides, if we acknowledge that the national debt\r\nwas created, not to hold the States in the Union, as the taxpayers were\r\nled to suppose, but to expel them from it and hand them over to be\r\ngoverned by negroes, the moral duty to pay it may seem much less clear.\r\nI say it may _seem_ so, for I do not admit that this or any other\r\nargument in favor of repudiation can be entertained as sound; but\r\nits influence on some classes of minds may well be apprehended. The\r\nfinancial honor of a great commercial nation, largely indebted and with\r\na republican form of government administered by agents of the popular\r\nchoice, is a thing of such delicate texture and the destruction of it\r\nwould be followed by such unspeakable calamity that every true patriot\r\nmust desire to avoid whatever might expose it to the slightest danger.\r\n\r\nThe great interests of the country require immediate relief from these\r\nenactments. Business in the South is paralyzed by a sense of general\r\ninsecurity, by the terror of confiscation, and the dread of negro\r\nsupremacy. The Southern trade, from which the North would have derived\r\nso great a profit under a government of law, still languishes, and can\r\nnever be revived until it ceases to be fettered by the arbitrary power\r\nwhich makes all its operations unsafe. That rich country--the richest in\r\nnatural resources the world ever saw--is worse than lost if it be not\r\nsoon placed under the protection of a free constitution. Instead of\r\nbeing, as it ought to be, a source of wealth and power, it will become\r\nan intolerable burden upon the rest of the nation.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for retracing our steps will doubtless be seen by\r\nCongress in the late manifestations of public opinion upon this subject.\r\nWe live in a country where the popular will always enforces obedience\r\nto itself, sooner or later. It is vain to think of opposing it with\r\nanything short of legal authority backed by overwhelming force. It can\r\nnot have escaped your attention that from the day on which Congress\r\nfairly and formally presented the proposition to govern the Southern\r\nStates by military force, with a view to the ultimate establishment of\r\nnegro supremacy, every expression of the general sentiment has been more\r\nor less adverse to it. The affections of this generation can not be\r\ndetached from the institutions of their ancestors. Their determination\r\nto preserve the inheritance of free government in their own hands and\r\ntransmit it undivided and unimpaired to their own posterity is too\r\nstrong to be successfully opposed. Every weaker passion will disappear\r\nbefore that love of liberty and law for which the American people are\r\ndistinguished above all others in the world.\r\n\r\nHow far the duty of the President \"to preserve, protect, and defend\r\nthe Constitution\" requires him to go in opposing an unconstitutional\r\nact of Congress is a very serious and important question, on which\r\nI have deliberated much and felt extremely anxious to reach a proper\r\nconclusion. Where an act has been passed according to the forms of the\r\nConstitution by the supreme legislative authority, and is regularly\r\nenrolled among the public statutes of the country, Executive resistance\r\nto it, especially in times of high party excitement, would be likely to\r\nproduce violent collision between the respective adherents of the two\r\nbranches of the Government. This would be simply civil war, and civil\r\nwar must be resorted to only as the last remedy for the worst of evils.\r\nWhatever might tend to provoke it should be most carefully avoided.\r\nA faithful and conscientious magistrate will concede very much to honest\r\nerror, and something even to perverse malice, before he will endanger\r\nthe public peace; and he will not adopt forcible measures, or such as\r\nmight lead to force, as long as those which are peaceable remain open to\r\nhim or to his constituents. It is true that cases may occur in which the\r\nExecutive would be compelled to stand on its rights, and maintain them\r\nregardless of all consequences. If Congress should pass an act which is\r\nnot only in palpable conflict with the Constitution, but will certainly,\r\nif carried out, produce immediate and irreparable injury to the organic\r\nstructure of the Government, and if there be, neither judicial remedy\r\nfor the wrongs it inflicts nor power in the people to protect themselves\r\nwithout the official aid of their elected defender--if, for instance,\r\nthe legislative department should pass an act even through all the forms\r\nof law to abolish a coordinate department of the Government--in such a\r\ncase the President must take the high responsibilities of his office and\r\nsave the life of the nation at all hazards. The so-called reconstruction\r\nacts, though as plainly unconstitutional as any that can be imagined,\r\nwere not believed to be within the class last mentioned. The people were\r\nnot wholly disarmed of the power of self-defense. In all the Northern\r\nStates they still held in their hands the sacred right of the ballot,\r\nand it was safe to believe that in due time they would come to the\r\nrescue of their own institutions. It gives me pleasure to add that the\r\nappeal to our common constituents was not taken in vain, and that my\r\nconfidence in their wisdom and virtue seems not to have been misplaced.\r\n\r\nIt is well and publicly known that enormous frauds have been perpetrated\r\non the Treasury and that colossal fortunes have been made at the public\r\nexpense. This species of corruption has increased, is increasing, and\r\nif not diminished will soon bring us into total ruin and disgrace. The\r\npublic creditors and the taxpayers are alike interested in an honest\r\nadministration of the finances, and neither class will long endure the\r\nlarge-handed robberies of the recent past. For this discreditable state\r\nof things there are several causes. Some of the taxes are so laid as\r\nto present an irresistible temptation to evade payment. The great sums\r\nwhich officers may win by connivance at fraud create a pressure which is\r\nmore than the virtue of many can withstand, and there can be no doubt\r\nthat the open disregard of constitutional obligations avowed by some of\r\nthe highest and most influential men in the country has greatly weakened\r\nthe moral sense of those who serve in subordinate places. The expenses\r\nof the United States, including interest on the public debt, are more\r\nthan six times as much as they were seven years ago. To collect and\r\ndisburse this vast amount requires careful supervision as well as\r\nsystematic vigilance. The system, never perfected, was much disorganized\r\nby the \"tenure-of-office bill,\" which has almost destroyed official\r\naccountability. The President may be thoroughly convinced that an\r\nofficer is incapable, dishonest, or unfaithful to the Constitution, but\r\nunder the law which I have named the utmost he can do is to complain to\r\nthe Senate and ask the privilege of supplying his place with a better\r\nman. If the Senate be regarded as personally or politically hostile to\r\nthe President, it is natural, and not altogether unreasonable, for the\r\nofficer to expect that it will take his part as far as possible, restore\r\nhim to his place, and give him a triumph over his Executive superior.\r\nThe officer has other chances of impunity arising from accidental\r\ndefects of evidence, the mode of investigating it, and the secrecy of\r\nthe hearing. It is not wonderful that official malfeasance should become\r\nbold in proportion as the delinquents learn to think themselves safe.\r\nI am entirely persuaded that under such a rule the President can not\r\nperform the great duty assigned to him of seeing the laws faithfully\r\nexecuted, and that it disables him most especially from enforcing that\r\nrigid accountability which is necessary to the due execution of the\r\nrevenue laws.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution invests the President with authority to _decide_\r\nwhether a removal should be made in any given case; the act of Congress\r\ndeclares in substance that he shall only _accuse_ such as he supposes to\r\nbe unworthy of their trust. The Constitution makes him _sole judge_ in\r\nthe premises, but the statute takes away his jurisdiction, transfers\r\nit to the Senate, and leaves him nothing but the odious and sometimes\r\nimpracticable duty of becoming a _prosecutor_. The prosecution is to be\r\nconducted before a tribunal whose members are not, like him, responsible\r\nto the whole people, but to separate constituent bodies, and who may\r\nhear his accusation with great disfavor. The Senate is absolutely\r\nwithout any known standard of decision applicable to such a case. Its\r\njudgment can not be anticipated, for it is not governed by any rule.\r\nThe law does not define what shall be deemed good cause for removal.\r\nIt is impossible even to conjecture what may or may not be so considered\r\nby the Senate. The nature of the subject forbids clear proof. If the\r\ncharge be incapacity, what evidence will support it? Fidelity to the\r\nConstitution may be understood or misunderstood in a thousand different\r\nways, and by violent party men, in violent party times, unfaithfulness\r\nto the Constitution may even come to be considered meritorious. If the\r\nofficer be accused of dishonesty, how shall it be made out? Will it be\r\ninferred from acts unconnected with public duty, from private history,\r\nor from general reputation, or must the President await the commission\r\nof an actual misdemeanor in office? Shall he in the meantime risk the\r\ncharacter and interest of the nation in the hands of men to whom he\r\ncan not give his confidence? Must he forbear his complaint until the\r\nmischief is done and can not be prevented? If his zeal in the public\r\nservice should impel him to anticipate the overt act, must he move at\r\nthe peril of being tried himself for the offense of slandering his\r\nsubordinate? In the present circumstances of the country someone must be\r\nheld responsible for official delinquency of every kind. It is extremely\r\ndifficult to say where that responsibility should be thrown if it be\r\nnot left where it has been placed by the Constitution. But all just men\r\nwill admit that the President ought to be entirely relieved from such\r\nresponsibility if he can not meet it by reason of restrictions placed\r\nby law upon his action.\r\n\r\nThe unrestricted power of removal from office is a very great one to be\r\ntrusted even to a magistrate chosen by the general suffrage of the whole\r\npeople and accountable directly to them for his acts. It is undoubtedly\r\nliable to abuse, and at some periods of our history perhaps has been\r\nabused. If it be thought desirable and constitutional that it should be\r\nso limited as to make the President merely a common informer against\r\nother public agents, he should at least be permitted to act in that\r\ncapacity before some open tribunal, independent of party politics, ready\r\nto investigate the merits of every case, furnished with the means of\r\ntaking evidence, and bound to decide according to established rules.\r\nThis would guarantee the safety of the accuser when he acts in good\r\nfaith, and at the same time secure the rights of the other party. I\r\nspeak, of course, with all proper respect for the present Senate, but it\r\ndoes not seem to me that any legislative body can be so constituted as\r\nto insure its fitness for these functions.\r\n\r\nIt is not the theory of this Government that public offices are the\r\nproperty of those who hold them. They are given merely as a trust for\r\nthe public benefit, sometimes for a fixed period, sometimes during good\r\nbehavior, but generally they are liable to be terminated at the pleasure\r\nof the appointing power, which represents the collective majesty and\r\nspeaks the will of the people. The forced retention in office of a\r\nsingle dishonest person may work great injury to the public interests.\r\nThe danger to the public service comes not from the power to remove,\r\nbut from the power to appoint. Therefore it was that the framers of the\r\nConstitution left the power of removal unrestricted, while they gave\r\nthe Senate a right to reject all appointments which in its opinion were\r\nnot fit to be made. A little reflection on this subject will probably\r\nsatisfy all who have the good of the country at heart that our best\r\ncourse is to take the Constitution for our guide, walk in the path\r\nmarked out by the founders of the Republic, and obey the rules made\r\nsacred by the observance of our great predecessors.\r\n\r\nThe present condition of our finances and circulating medium is one to\r\nwhich your early consideration is invited.\r\n\r\nThe proportion which the currency of any country should bear to\r\nthe whole value of the annual produce circulated by its means is a\r\nquestion upon which political economists have not agreed. Nor can it\r\nbe controlled by legislation, but must be left to the irrevocable laws\r\nwhich everywhere regulate commerce and trade. The circulating medium\r\nwill ever irresistibly flow to those points where it is in greatest\r\ndemand. The law of demand and supply is as unerring as that which\r\nregulates the tides of the ocean; and, indeed, currency, like the\r\ntides, has its ebbs and flows throughout the commercial world.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the rebellion the bank-note circulation of the\r\ncountry amounted to not much more than $200,000,000; now the circulation\r\nof national-bank notes and those known as \"legal-tenders\" is nearly\r\nseven hundred millions. While it is urged by some that this amount\r\nshould be increased, others contend that a decided reduction is\r\nabsolutely essential to the best interests of the country. In view of\r\nthese diverse opinions, it may be well to ascertain the real value of\r\nour paper issues when compared with a metallic or convertible currency.\r\nFor this purpose let us inquire how much gold and silver could be\r\npurchased by the seven hundred millions of paper money now in\r\ncirculation. Probably not more than half the amount of the latter,\r\nshowing that when our paper currency is compared with gold and silver\r\nits commercial value is compressed into three hundred and fifty\r\nmillions. This striking fact makes it the obvious duty of the\r\nGovernment, as early as may be consistent with the principles of sound\r\npolitical economy, to take such measures as will enable the holder of\r\nits notes and those of the national banks to convert them without loss\r\ninto specie or its equivalent. A reduction of our paper circulating\r\nmedium need not necessarily follow. This, however, would depend upon\r\nthe law of demand and supply, though it should be borne in mind that\r\nby making legal-tender and bank notes convertible into coin or its\r\nequivalent their present specie value in the hands of their holders\r\nwould be enhanced 100 per cent.\r\n\r\nLegislation for the accomplishment of a result so desirable is demanded\r\nby the highest public considerations. The Constitution contemplates that\r\nthe circulating medium of the country shall be uniform in quality and\r\nvalue. At the time of the formation of that instrument the country had\r\njust emerged from the War of the Revolution, and was suffering from the\r\neffects of a redundant and worthless paper currency. The sages of that\r\nperiod were anxious to protect their posterity from the evils that they\r\nthemselves had experienced. Hence in providing a circulating medium they\r\nconferred upon Congress the power to coin money and regulate the value\r\nthereof, at the same time prohibiting the States from making anything\r\nbut gold and silver a tender in payment of debts.\r\n\r\nThe anomalous condition of our currency is in striking contrast with\r\nthat which was originally designed. Our circulation now embraces, first,\r\nnotes of the national banks, which are made receivable for all dues to\r\nthe Government, excluding imposts, and by all its creditors, excepting\r\nin payment of interest upon its bonds and the securities themselves;\r\nsecond, legal-tender notes, issued by the United States, and which the\r\nlaw requires shall be received as well in payment of all debts between\r\ncitizens as of all Government dues, excepting imposts; and, third, gold\r\nand silver coin. By the operation of our present system of finance,\r\nhowever, the metallic currency, when collected, is reserved only for one\r\nclass of Government creditors, who, holding its bonds, semiannually\r\nreceive their interest in coin from the National Treasury. They are thus\r\nmade to occupy an invidious position, which may be used to strengthen\r\nthe arguments of those who would bring into disrepute the obligations\r\nof the nation. In the payment of all its debts the plighted faith of\r\nthe Government should be inviolably maintained. But while it acts with\r\nfidelity toward the bondholder who loaned his money that the integrity\r\nof the Union might be preserved, it should at the same time observe good\r\nfaith with the great masses of the people, who, having rescued the Union\r\nfrom the perils of rebellion, now bear the burdens of taxation, that the\r\nGovernment may be able to fulfill its engagements. There is no reason\r\nwhich will be accepted as satisfactory by the people why those who\r\ndefend us on the land and protect us on the sea; the pensioner upon the\r\ngratitude of the nation, bearing the scars and wounds received while\r\nin its service; the public servants in the various Departments of the\r\nGovernment; the farmer who supplies the soldiers of the Army and the\r\nsailors of the Navy; the artisan who toils in the nation's workshops,\r\nor the mechanics and laborers who build its edifices and construct\r\nits forts and vessels of war, should, in payment of their just and\r\nhard-earned dues, receive depreciated paper, while another class of\r\ntheir countrymen, no more deserving, are paid in coin of gold and\r\nsilver. Equal and exact justice requires that all the creditors of the\r\nGovernment should be paid in a currency possessing a uniform value.\r\nThis can only be accomplished by the restoration of the currency to the\r\nstandard established by the Constitution; and by this means we would\r\nremove a discrimination which may, if it has not already done so, create\r\na prejudice that may become deep rooted and widespread and imperil the\r\nnational credit.\r\n\r\nThe feasibility of making our currency correspond with the\r\nconstitutional standard may be seen by reference to a few facts derived\r\nfrom our commercial statistics.\r\n\r\nThe production of precious metals in the United States from 1849\r\nto 1857, inclusive, amounted to $579,000,000; from 1858 to 1860,\r\ninclusive, to $137,500,000, and from 1861 to 1867, inclusive, to\r\n$457,500,000--making the grand aggregate of products since 1849\r\n$1,174,000,000. The amount of specie coined from 1849 to 1857 inclusive,\r\nwas $439,000,000; from 1858 to 1860, inclusive, $125,000,000, and from\r\n1861 to 1867, inclusive, $310,000,000--making the total coinage since\r\n1849 $874,000,000. From 1849 to 1857, inclusive, the net exports of\r\nspecie amounted to $271,000,000; from 1858 to 1860, inclusive, to\r\n$148,000,000, and from 1861 to 1867, inclusive, $322,000,000--making the\r\naggregate of net exports since 1849 $741,000,000. These figures show an\r\nexcess of product over net exports of $433,000,000. There are in the\r\nTreasury $111,000,000 in coin, something more than $40,000,000 in\r\ncirculation on the Pacific Coast, and a few millions in the national\r\nand other banks--in all about $160,000,000. This, however, taking into\r\naccount the specie in the country prior to 1849, leaves more than\r\n$300,000,000 which have not been accounted for by exportation, and\r\ntherefore may yet remain in the country.\r\n\r\nThese are important facts and show how completely the inferior currency\r\nwill supersede the better, forcing it from circulation among the masses\r\nand causing it to be exported as a mere article of trade, to add to the\r\nmoney capital of foreign lands. They show the necessity of retiring our\r\npaper money, that the return of gold and silver to the avenues of trade\r\nmay be invited and a demand created which will cause the retention\r\nat home of at least so much of the productions of our rich and\r\ninexhaustible gold-bearing fields as may be sufficient for purposes\r\nof circulation. It is unreasonable to expect a return to a sound\r\ncurrency so long as the Government by continuing to issue irredeemable\r\nnotes fills the channels of circulation with depreciated paper.\r\nNotwithstanding a coinage by our mints, since 1849, of $874,000,000,\r\nthe people are now strangers to the currency which was designed for\r\ntheir use and benefit, and specimens of the precious metals bearing\r\nthe national device are seldom seen, except when produced to gratify\r\nthe interest excited by their novelty. If depreciated paper is to be\r\ncontinued as the permanent currency of the country, and all our coin is\r\nto become a mere article of traffic and speculation, to the enhancement\r\nin price of all that is indispensable to the comfort of the people, it\r\nwould be wise economy to abolish our mints, thus saving the nation the\r\ncare and expense incident to such establishments, and let all our\r\nprecious metals be exported in bullion. The time has come, however, when\r\nthe Government and national banks should be required to take the most\r\nefficient steps and make all necessary arrangements for a resumption\r\nof specie payments at the earliest practicable period. Specie payments\r\nhaving been once resumed by the Government and banks, all notes or bills\r\nof paper issued by either of a less denomination than $20 should by law\r\nbe excluded from circulation, so that the people may have the benefit\r\nand convenience of a gold and silver currency which in all their\r\nbusiness transactions will be uniform in value at home and abroad.\r\n\r\n  Every man of property or industry, every man who desires to preserve\r\n  what he honestly possesses or to obtain what he can honestly earn, has a\r\n  direct interest in maintaining a safe circulating medium--such a medium\r\n  as shall be real and substantial, not liable to vibrate with opinions,\r\n  not subject to be blown up or blown down by the breath of speculation,\r\n  but to be made stable and secure. A disordered currency is one of the\r\n  greatest political evils. It undermines the virtues necessary for the\r\n  support of the social system and encourages propensities destructive of\r\n  its happiness; it wars against industry, frugality, and economy, and it\r\n  fosters the evil spirits of extravagance and speculation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted by one of our profound and most gifted statesmen\r\nthat--\r\n\r\n  Of all the contrivances for cheating the laboring classes of mankind,\r\n  none has been more effectual than that which deludes them with paper\r\n  money. This is the most effectual of inventions to fertilize the rich\r\n  man's fields by the sweat of the poor man's brow. Ordinary tyranny,\r\n  oppression, excessive taxation--these bear lightly on the happiness of\r\n  the mass of the community compared with a fraudulent currency and the\r\n  robberies committed by depreciated paper. Our own history has recorded\r\n  for our instruction enough, and more than enough, of the demoralizing\r\n  tendency, the injustice, and the intolerable oppression on the virtuous\r\n  and well disposed of a degraded paper currency authorized by law or in\r\n  any way countenanced by government.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most successful devices, in times of peace or war,\r\nexpansions or revulsions, to accomplish the transfer of all the precious\r\nmetals from the great mass of the people into the hands of the few,\r\nwhere they are hoarded in secret places or deposited in strong boxes\r\nunder bolts and bars, while the people are left to ensure all the\r\ninconvenience, sacrifice, and demoralization resulting from the use\r\nof a depreciated and worthless paper money.\r\n\r\nThe condition of our finances and the operations of our revenue\r\nsystem are set forth and fully explained in the able and instructive\r\nreport of the Secretary of the Treasury. On the 30th of June, 1866,\r\nthe public debt amounted to $2,783,425,879; on the 30th of June last\r\nit was $2,692,199,215, showing a reduction during the fiscal year of\r\n$91,226,664. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1867, the receipts\r\nwere $490,634,010 and the expenditures $346,729,129, leaving an\r\navailable surplus of $143,904,880. It is estimated that the receipts for\r\nthe fiscal year ending June 30, 1868, will be $417,161,928 and that the\r\nexpenditures will reach the sum of $393,269,226, leaving in the Treasury\r\na surplus of $23,892,702. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1869, it\r\nis estimated that the receipts will amount to $381,000,000 and that the\r\nexpenditures will be $372,000,000, showing an excess of $9,000,000 in\r\nfavor of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress is earnestly invited to the necessity of a\r\nthorough revision of our revenue system. Our internal-revenue laws and\r\nimpost system should be so adjusted as to bear most heavily on articles\r\nof luxury, leaving the necessaries of life as free from taxation as\r\nmay be consistent with the real wants of the Government, economically\r\nadministered. Taxation would not then fall unduly on the man of moderate\r\nmeans; and while none would be entirely exempt from assessment, all, in\r\nproportion to their pecuniary abilities, would contribute toward the\r\nsupport of the State. A modification of the internal-revenue system, by\r\na large reduction in the number of articles now subject to tax, would\r\nbe followed by results equally advantageous to the citizen and the\r\nGovernment. It would render the execution of the law less expensive and\r\nmore certain, remove obstructions to industry, lessen the temptations to\r\nevade the law, diminish the violations and frauds perpetrated upon its\r\nprovisions, make its operations less inquisitorial, and greatly reduce\r\nin numbers the army of taxgatherers created by the system, who \"take\r\nfrom the mouth of honest labor the bread it has earned.\" Retrenchment,\r\nreform, and economy should be carried into every branch of the public\r\nservice, that the expenditures of the Government may be reduced and the\r\npeople relieved from oppressive taxation; a sound currency should be\r\nrestored, and the public faith in regard to the national debt sacredly\r\nobserved. The accomplishment of these important results, together with\r\nthe restoration of the Union of the States upon the principles of\r\nthe Constitution, would inspire confidence at home and abroad in the\r\nstability of our institutions and bring to the nation prosperity,\r\npeace, and good will.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War _ad interim_ exhibits the operations\r\nof the Army and of the several bureaus of the War Department. The\r\naggregate strength of our military force on the 30th of September\r\nlast was 56,315. The total estimate for military appropriations is\r\n$77,124,707, including a deficiency in last year's appropriation of\r\n$13,600,000. The payments at the Treasury on account of the service\r\nof the War Department from January 1 to October 29, 1867--a period of\r\nten months--amounted to $109,807,000. The expenses of the military\r\nestablishment, as well as the numbers of the Army, are now three\r\ntimes as great as they have ever been in time of peace, while the\r\ndiscretionary power is vested in the Executive to add millions to this\r\nexpenditure by an increase of the Army to the maximum strength allowed\r\nby the law.\r\n\r\nThe comprehensive report of the Secretary of the Interior furnishes\r\ninteresting information in reference to the important branches of the\r\npublic service connected with his Department. The menacing attitude of\r\nsome of the warlike bands of Indians inhabiting the district of country\r\nbetween the Arkansas and Platte rivers and portions of Dakota Territory\r\nrequired the presence of a large military force in that region.\r\nInstigated by real or imaginary grievances, the Indians occasionally\r\ncommitted acts of barbarous violence upon emigrants and our frontier\r\nsettlements; but a general Indian war has been providentially averted.\r\nThe commissioners under the act of 20th July, 1867, were invested with\r\nfull power to adjust existing difficulties, negotiate treaties with the\r\ndisaffected bands, and select for them reservations remote from the\r\ntraveled routes between the Mississippi and the Pacific. They entered\r\nwithout delay upon the execution of their trust, but have not yet made\r\nany official report of their proceedings. It is of vital importance that\r\nour distant Territories should be exempt from Indian outbreaks, and\r\nthat the construction of the Pacific Railroad, an object of national\r\nimportance, should not be interrupted by hostile tribes. These objects,\r\nas well as the material interests and the moral and intellectual\r\nimprovement of the Indians, can be most effectually secured by\r\nconcentrating them upon portions of country set apart for their\r\nexclusive use and located at points remote from our highways and\r\nencroaching white settlements.\r\n\r\nSince the commencement of the second session of the Thirty-ninth\r\nCongress 510 miles of road have been constructed on the main line\r\nand branches of the Pacific Railway. The line from Omaha is rapidly\r\napproaching the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains, while the terminus\r\nof the last section of constructed road in California, accepted by the\r\nGovernment on the 24th day of October last, was but 11 miles distant\r\nfrom the summit of the Sierra Nevada. The remarkable energy evinced by\r\nthe companies offers the strongest assurance that the completion of the\r\nroad from Sacramento to Omaha will not be long deferred.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fiscal year 7,041,114 acres of public land were\r\ndisposed of, and the cash receipts from sales and fees exceeded by\r\none-half million dollars the sum realized from those sources during the\r\npreceding year. The amount paid to pensioners, including expenses of\r\ndisbursements, was $18,619,956, and 36,482 names were added to the\r\nrolls. The entire number of pensioners on the 30th of June last was\r\n155,474. Eleven thousand six hundred and fifty-five patents and designs\r\nwere issued during the year ending September 30, 1867, and at that\r\ndate the balance in the Treasury to the credit of the patent fund\r\nwas $286,607.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy states that we have seven\r\nsquadrons actively and judiciously employed, under efficient and able\r\ncommanders, in protecting the persons and property of American citizens,\r\nmaintaining the dignity and power of the Government, and promoting the\r\ncommerce and business interests of our countrymen in every part of the\r\nworld. Of the 238 vessels composing the present Navy of the United\r\nStates, 56, carrying 507 guns, are in squadron service. During the year\r\nthe number of vessels in commission has been reduced 12, and there\r\nare 13 less on squadron duty than there were at the date of the last\r\nreport. A large number of vessels were commenced and in the course of\r\nconstruction when the war terminated, and although Congress had made the\r\nnecessary appropriations for their completion, the Department has either\r\nsuspended work upon them or limited the slow completion of the steam\r\nvessels, so as to meet the contracts for machinery made with private\r\nestablishments. The total expenditures of the Navy Department for the\r\nfiscal year ending June 30, 1867, were $31,034,011. No appropriations\r\nhave been made or required since the close of the war for the\r\nconstruction and repair of vessels, for steam machinery, ordnance,\r\nprovisions and clothing, fuel, hemp, etc., the balances under these\r\nseveral heads having been more than sufficient for current expenditures.\r\nIt should also be stated to the credit of the Department that, besides\r\nasking no appropriations for the above objects for the last two years,\r\nthe Secretary of the Navy, on the 30th of September last, in accordance\r\nwith the act of May 1, 1820, requested the Secretary of the Treasury to\r\ncarry to the surplus fund the sum of $65,000,000, being the amount\r\nreceived from the sales of vessels and other war property and the\r\nremnants of former appropriations.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General shows the business of the\r\nPost-Office Department and the condition of the postal service in a\r\nvery favorable light, and the attention of Congress is called to its\r\npractical recommendations. The receipts of the Department for the\r\nyear ending June 30, 1867, including all special appropriations for\r\nsea and land service and for free mail matter, were $19,978,693. The\r\nexpenditures for all purposes were $19,235,483, leaving an unexpended\r\nbalance in favor of the Department of $743,210, which can be applied\r\ntoward the expenses of the Department for the current year. The increase\r\nof postal revenue, independent of specific appropriations, for the year\r\n1867 over that of 1866 was $850,040. The increase of revenue from the\r\nsale of stamps and stamped envelopes was $783,404. The increase of\r\nexpenditures for 1867 over those of the previous year was owing chiefly\r\nto the extension of the land and ocean mail service. During the past\r\nyear new postal conventions have been ratified and exchanged with the\r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands,\r\nSwitzerland, the North German Union, Italy, and the colonial government\r\nat Hong Kong, reducing very largely the rates of ocean and land postages\r\nto and from and within those countries.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Acting Commissioner of Agriculture concisely presents\r\nthe condition, wants, and progress of an interest eminently worthy the\r\nfostering care of Congress, and exhibits a large measure of useful\r\nresults achieved during the year to which it refers.\r\n\r\nThe reestablishment of peace at home and the resumption of extended\r\ntrade, travel, and commerce abroad have served to increase the number\r\nand variety of questions in the Department for Foreign Affairs. None of\r\nthese questions, however, have seriously disturbed our relations with\r\nother states.\r\n\r\nThe Republic of Mexico, having been relieved from foreign intervention,\r\nis earnestly engaged in efforts to reestablish her constitutional system\r\nof government. A good understanding continues to exist between our\r\nGovernment and the Republics of Hayti and San Domingo, and our cordial\r\nrelations with the Central and South American States remain unchanged.\r\nThe tender, made in conformity with a resolution of Congress, of the\r\ngood offices of the Government with a view to an amicable adjustment\r\nof peace between Brazil and her allies on one side and Paraguay on the\r\nother, and between Chile and her allies on the one side and Spain on the\r\nother, though kindly received, has in neither case been fully accepted\r\nby the belligerents. The war in the valley of the Parana is still\r\nvigorously maintained. On the other hand, actual hostilities between\r\nthe Pacific States and Spain have been more than a year suspended.\r\nI shall, on any proper occasion that may occur, renew the conciliatory\r\nrecommendations which have been already made. Brazil, with enlightened\r\nsagacity and comprehensive statesmanship, has opened the great channels\r\nof the Amazon and its tributaries to universal commerce. One thing more\r\nseems needful to assure a rapid and cheering progress in South America.\r\nI refer to those peaceful habits without which states and nations can\r\nnot in this age well expect material prosperity or social advancement.\r\n\r\nThe Exposition of Universal Industry at Paris has passed, and seems to\r\nhave fully realized the high expectations of the French Government. If\r\ndue allowance be made for the recent political derangement of industry\r\nhere, the part which the United States has borne in this exhibition of\r\ninvention and art may be regarded with very high satisfaction. During\r\nthe exposition a conference was held of delegates from several nations,\r\nthe United States being one, in which the inconveniences of commerce and\r\nsocial intercourse resulting from the diverse standards of money value\r\nwere very fully discussed, and plans were developed for establishing\r\nby universal consent a common principle for the coinage of gold. These\r\nconferences are expected to be renewed, with the attendance of many\r\nforeign states not hitherto represented. A report of these interesting\r\nproceedings will be submitted to Congress, which will, no doubt, justly\r\nappreciate the great object and be ready to adopt any measure which may\r\ntend to facilitate its ultimate accomplishment.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of February, 1862, Congress declared by law that Treasury\r\nnotes, without interest, authorized by that act should be legal tender\r\nin payment of all debts, public and private, within the United States.\r\nAn annual remittance of $30,000, less stipulated expenses, accrues\r\nto claimants under the convention made with Spain in 1834. These\r\nremittances, since the passage of that act, have been paid in such\r\nnotes. The claimants insist that the Government ought to require\r\npayment in coin. The subject may be deemed worthy of your attention.\r\n\r\nNo arrangement has yet been reached for the settlement of our claims\r\nfor British depredations upon the commerce of the United States. I have\r\nfelt it my duty to decline the proposition of arbitration made by\r\nHer Majesty's Government, because it has hitherto been accompanied by\r\nreservations and limitations incompatible with the rights, interest, and\r\nhonor of our country. It is not to be apprehended that Great Britain\r\nwill persist in her refusal to satisfy these just and reasonable claims,\r\nwhich involve the sacred principle of nonintervention--a principle\r\nhenceforth not more important to the United States than to all other\r\ncommercial nations.\r\n\r\nThe West India islands were settled and colonized by European States\r\nsimultaneously with the settlement and colonization of the American\r\ncontinent. Most of the colonies planted here became independent nations\r\nin the close of the last and the beginning of the present century. Our\r\nown country embraces communities which at one period were colonies of\r\nGreat Britain, France, Spain, Holland, Sweden, and Russia. The people\r\nin the West Indies, with the exception of those of the island of Hayti,\r\nhave neither attained nor aspired to independence, nor have they become\r\nprepared for self-defense. Although possessing considerable commercial\r\nvalue, they have been held by the several European States which\r\ncolonized or at some time conquered them, chiefly for purposes of\r\nmilitary and naval strategy in carrying out European policy and designs\r\nin regard to this continent. In our Revolutionary War ports and harbors\r\nin the West India islands were used by our enemy, to the great injury\r\nand embarrassment of the United States. We had the same experience in\r\nour second war with Great Britain. The same European policy for a long\r\ntime excluded us even from trade with the West Indies, while we were at\r\npeace with all nations. In our recent civil war the rebels and their\r\npiratical and blockade-breaking allies found facilities in the same\r\nports for the work, which they too successfully accomplished, of\r\ninjuring and devastating the commerce which we are now engaged in\r\nrebuilding. We labored especially under this disadvantage, that\r\nEuropean steam vessels employed by our enemies found friendly shelter,\r\nprotection, and supplies in West Indian ports, while our naval\r\noperations were necessarily carried on from our own distant shores.\r\nThere was then a universal feeling of the want of an advanced naval\r\noutpost between the Atlantic coast and Europe. The duty of obtaining\r\nsuch an outpost peacefully and lawfully, while neither doing nor\r\nmenacing injury to other states, earnestly engaged the attention of the\r\nexecutive department before the close of the war, and it has not been\r\nlost sight of since that time. A not entirely dissimilar naval want\r\nrevealed itself during the same period on the Pacific coast. The\r\nrequired foothold there was fortunately secured by our late treaty with\r\nthe Emperor of Russia, and it now seems imperative that the more obvious\r\nnecessities of the Atlantic coast should not be less carefully provided\r\nfor. A good and convenient port and harbor, capable of easy defense,\r\nwill supply that want. With the possession of such a station by the\r\nUnited States, neither we nor any other American nation need longer\r\napprehend injury or offense from any transatlantic enemy. I agree with\r\nour early statesmen that the West Indies naturally gravitate to, and\r\nmay be expected ultimately to be absorbed by, the continental States,\r\nincluding our own. I agree with them also that it is wise to leave the\r\nquestion of such absorption to this process of natural political\r\ngravitation. The islands of St. Thomas and St. John, which constitute\r\na part of the group called the Virgin Islands, seemed to offer us\r\nadvantages immediately desirable, while their acquisition could be\r\nsecured in harmony with the principles to which I have alluded. A treaty\r\nhas therefore been concluded with the King of Denmark for the cession of\r\nthose islands, and will be submitted to the Senate for consideration.\r\n\r\nIt will hardly be necessary to call the attention of Congress to the\r\nsubject of providing for the payment to Russia of the sum stipulated in\r\nthe treaty for the cession of Alaska. Possession having been formally\r\ndelivered to our commissioner, the territory remains for the present in\r\ncare of a military force, awaiting such civil organization as shall be\r\ndirected by Congress.\r\n\r\nThe annexation of many small German States to Prussia and the\r\nreorganization of that country under a new and liberal constitution have\r\ninduced me to renew the effort to obtain a just and prompt settlement of\r\nthe long-vexed question concerning the claims of foreign states for\r\nmilitary service from their subjects naturalized in the United States.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject the attention of Congress is\r\nrespectfully called to a singular and embarrassing conflict of laws.\r\nThe executive department of this Government has hitherto uniformly held,\r\nas it now holds, that naturalization in conformity with the Constitution\r\nand laws of the United States absolves the recipient from his native\r\nallegiance. The courts of Great Britain hold that allegiance to the\r\nBritish Crown is indefeasible, and is not absolved by our laws of\r\nnaturalization. British judges cite courts and law authorities of the\r\nUnited States in support of that theory against the position held by the\r\nexecutive authority of the United States. This conflict perplexes the\r\npublic mind concerning the rights of naturalized citizens and impairs\r\nthe national authority abroad. I called attention to this subject in my\r\nlast annual message, and now again respectfully appeal to Congress to\r\ndeclare the national will unmistakably upon this important question.\r\n\r\nThe abuse of our laws by the clandestine prosecution of the African\r\nslave trade from American ports or by American citizens has altogether\r\nceased, and under existing circumstances no apprehensions of its renewal\r\nin this part of the world are entertained. Under these circumstances\r\nit becomes a question whether we shall not propose to Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment a suspension or discontinuance of the stipulations for\r\nmaintaining a naval force for the suppression of that trade.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 3, 1867_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit, for consideration with a view to ratification, a treaty\r\nbetween the United States and His Majesty the King of Denmark,\r\nstipulating for the cession of the islands of St. Thomas and St. John,\r\nin the West Indies.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 3, 1867_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit, for consideration with a view to ratification, a treaty of\r\nfriendship, commerce, and navigation between the United States and the\r\nRepublic of Nicaragua, signed at the city of Managua on the 21st day of\r\nJune last.

EDWIN M. STANTON,\r\n    _Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n  SIR: By virtue of the power and authority vested in me as President by\r\n  the Constitution and laws of the United States, you are hereby suspended\r\n  from office as Secretary of War, and will cease to exercise any and all\r\n  functions pertaining to the same.\r\n\r\n  You will at once transfer to General Ulysses S. Grant, who has this day\r\n  been authorized and empowered to act as Secretary of War _ad interim_,\r\n  all records, books, and other property now in your custody and charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n  EXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n    _Washington, D.C., August 12, 1867_.\r\n\r\n  General ULYSSES S. GRANT,\r\n    _Washington, D.C._\r\n\r\n  SIR: The Hon. Edwin M. Stanton having been this day suspended as\r\n  Secretary of War, you are hereby authorized and empowered to act as\r\n  Secretary of War _ad interim_, and will at once enter upon the discharge\r\n  of the duties of the office.\r\n\r\n  The Secretary of War has been instructed to transfer to you all the\r\n  records, books, papers, and other public property now in his custody and\r\n  charge.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following communication was received from Mr. Stanton:\r\n\r\n\r\n  WAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n    _Washington City, August 12, 1867_.\r\n\r\n  The PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n  SIR: Your note of this date has been received, informing me that by\r\n  virtue of the powers and authority vested in you as President by the\r\n  Constitution and laws of the United States I am suspended from office\r\n  as Secretary of War, and will cease to exercise any and all functions\r\n  pertaining to the same, and also directing me at once to transfer to\r\n  General Ulysses S. Grant, who has this day been authorized and empowered\r\n  to act as Secretary of War _ad interim_, all records, books, papers, and\r\n  other public property now in my custody and charge.\r\n\r\n  Under a sense of public duty I am compelled to deny your right under\r\n  the Constitution and laws of the United States, without the advice and\r\n  consent of the Senate and without any legal cause, to suspend me from\r\n  office as Secretary of War or the exercise of any or all functions\r\n  pertaining to the same, or without such advice and consent to compel\r\n  me to transfer to any person the records, books, papers, and public\r\n  property in my custody as Secretary.\r\n\r\n  But inasmuch as the General Commanding the armies of the United States\r\n  has been appointed _ad interim_, and has notified me that he has\r\n  accepted the appointment, I have no alternative but to submit, under\r\n  protest, to superior force.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe suspension has not been revoked, and the business of the War\r\nDepartment is conducted by the Secretary _ad interim_.\r\n\r\nPrior to the date of this suspension I had come to the conclusion that\r\nthe time had arrived when it was proper Mr. Stanton should retire from\r\nmy Cabinet. The mutual confidence and general accord which should exist\r\nin such a relation had ceased. I supposed that Mr. Stanton was well\r\nadvised that his continuance in the Cabinet was contrary to my wishes,\r\nfor I had repeatedly given him so to understand by every mode short of\r\nan express request that he should resign. Having waited full time for\r\nthe voluntary action of Mr. Stanton, and seeing no manifestation on his\r\npart of an intention to resign, I addressed him the following note on\r\nthe 5th of August:\r\n\r\n\r\n  SIR: Public considerations of a high character constrain me to say\r\n  that your resignation as Secretary of War will be accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this note I received the following reply:\r\n\r\n\r\n  WAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n    _Washington, August 5, 1867_.\r\n\r\n  SIR: Your note of this day has been received, stating that public\r\n  considerations of a high character constrain you to say that my\r\n  resignation as Secretary of War will be accepted.\r\n\r\n  In reply I have the honor to say that public considerations of a high\r\n  character, which alone have induced me to continue at the head of this\r\n  Department, constrain me not to resign the office of Secretary of War\r\n  before the next meeting of Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis reply of Mr. Stanton was not merely a disinclination of compliance\r\nwith the request for his resignation; it was a defiance, and something\r\nmore. Mr. Stanton does not content himself with assuming that public\r\nconsiderations bearing upon his continuance in office form as fully\r\na rule of action for himself as for the President, and that upon so\r\ndelicate a question as the fitness of an officer for continuance in his\r\noffice the officer is as competent and as impartial to decide as his\r\nsuperior, who is responsible for his conduct. But he goes further, and\r\nplainly intimates what he means by \"public considerations of a high\r\ncharacter,\" and this is nothing else than his loss of confidence in his\r\nsuperior. He says that these public considerations have \"alone induced\r\nme to continue at the head of this Department,\" and that they \"constrain\r\nme not to resign the office of Secretary of War before the next meeting\r\nof Congress.\"\r\n\r\nThis language is very significant. Mr. Stanton holds the position\r\nunwillingly. He continues in office only under a sense of high public\r\nduty. He is ready to leave when it is safe to leave, and as the danger\r\nhe apprehends from his removal then will not exist when Congress is\r\nhere, he is constrained to remain during the interim. What, then, is\r\nthat danger which can only be averted by the presence of Mr. Stanton or\r\nof Congress? Mr. Stanton does not say that \"public considerations of a\r\nhigh character\" constrain him to hold on to the office indefinitely. He\r\ndoes not say that no one other than himself can at any time be found to\r\ntake his place and perform its duties. On the contrary, he expresses a\r\ndesire to leave the office at the earliest moment consistent with these\r\nhigh public considerations. He says, in effect, that while Congress is\r\naway he must remain, but that when Congress is here he can go. In other\r\nwords, he has lost confidence in the President. He is unwilling to leave\r\nthe War Department in his hands or in the hands of anyone the President\r\nmay appoint or designate to perform its duties. If he resigns, the\r\nPresident may appoint a Secretary of War that Mr. Stanton does not\r\napprove; therefore he will not resign. But when Congress is in session\r\nthe President can not appoint a Secretary of War which the Senate does\r\nnot approve; consequently when Congress meets Mr. Stanton is ready to\r\nresign.\r\n\r\nWhatever cogency these \"considerations\" may have had on Mr. Stanton,\r\nwhatever right he may have had to entertain such considerations,\r\nwhatever propriety there might be in the expression of them to others,\r\none thing is certain, it was official misconduct, to say the least of\r\nit, to parade them before his superior officer.\r\n\r\nUpon the receipt of this extraordinary note I only delayed the order of\r\nsuspension long enough to make the necessary arrangements to fill the\r\noffice. If this were the only cause for his suspension, it would be\r\nample. Necessarily it must end our most important official relations,\r\nfor I can not imagine a degree of effrontery which would embolden the\r\nhead of a Department to take his seat at the council table in the\r\nExecutive Mansion after such an act; nor can I imagine a President so\r\nforgetful of the proper respect and dignity which belong to his office\r\nas to submit to such intrusion. I will not do Mr. Stanton the wrong to\r\nsuppose that he entertained any idea of offering to act as one of my\r\nconstitutional advisers after that note was written. There was an\r\ninterval of a week between that date and the order of suspension, during\r\nwhich two Cabinet meetings were held. Mr. Stanton did not present\r\nhimself at either, nor was he expected.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of August Mr. Stanton was notified of his suspension and\r\nthat General Grant had been authorized to take charge of the Department.\r\nIn his answer to this notification, of the same date, Mr. Stanton\r\nexpresses himself as follows:\r\n\r\n  Under a sense of public duty I am compelled to deny your right under\r\n  the Constitution and laws of the United States, without the advice and\r\n  consent of the Senate and without any legal cause, to suspend me from\r\n  office as Secretary of War or the exercise of any or all functions\r\n  pertaining to the same, or without such advice and consent to compel\r\n  me to transfer to any person the records, books, papers, and public\r\n  property in my custody as Secretary.\r\n\r\n  But inasmuch as the General Commanding the armies of the United States\r\n  has been appointed _ad interim_, and has notified me that he has\r\n  accepted the appointment, I have no alternative but to submit, under\r\n  protest, to superior force.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will not escape attention that in his note of August 5 Mr. Stanton\r\nstated that he had been constrained to continue in the office, even\r\nbefore he was requested to resign, by considerations of a high public\r\ncharacter. In this note of August 12 a new and different sense of public\r\nduty compels him to deny the President's right to suspend him from\r\noffice without the consent of the Senate. This last is the public duty\r\nof resisting an act contrary to law, and he charges the President with\r\nviolation of the law in ordering his suspension.\r\n\r\nMr. Stanton refers generally to the Constitution and laws of the \"United\r\nStates,\" and says that a sense of public duty \"under\" these compels him\r\nto deny the right of the President to suspend him from office. As to his\r\nsense of duty under the Constitution, that will be considered in the\r\nsequel. As to his sense of duty under \"the laws of the United States,\"\r\nhe certainly can not refer to the law which creates the War Department,\r\nfor that expressly confers upon the President the unlimited right to\r\nremove the head of the Department. The only other law bearing upon\r\nthe question is the tenure-of-office act, passed by Congress over the\r\nPresidential veto March 2, 1867. This is the law which, under a sense\r\nof public duty, Mr. Stanton volunteers to defend.\r\n\r\nThere is no provision in this law which compels any officer coming\r\nwithin its provisions to remain in office. It forbids removals--not\r\nresignations. Mr. Stanton was perfectly free to resign at any moment,\r\neither upon his own motion or in compliance with a request or an order.\r\nIt was a matter of choice or of taste. There was nothing compulsory in\r\nthe nature of legal obligation. Nor does he put his action upon that\r\nimperative ground. He says he acts under a \"sense of public duty,\" not\r\nof legal obligation, compelling him to hold on and leaving him no\r\nchoice. The public duty which is upon him arises from the respect which\r\nhe owes to the Constitution and the laws, violated in his own case.\r\nHe is therefore compelled by this sense of public duty to vindicate\r\nviolated law and to stand as its champion.\r\n\r\nThis was not the first occasion in which Mr. Stanton, in discharge of\r\na public duty, was called upon to consider the provisions of that law.\r\nThat tenure-of-office law did not pass without notice. Like other acts,\r\nit was sent to the President for approval. As is my custom, I submitted\r\nits consideration to my Cabinet for their advice upon the question\r\nwhether I should approve it or not. It was a grave question of\r\nconstitutional law, in which I would, of course, rely most upon the\r\nopinion of the Attorney-General and of Mr. Stanton, who had once been\r\nAttorney-General.\r\n\r\nEvery member of my Cabinet advised me that the proposed law was\r\nunconstitutional. All spoke without doubt or reservation, but Mr.\r\nStanton's condemnation of the law was the most elaborate and emphatic.\r\nHe referred to the constitutional provisions, the debates in Congress,\r\nespecially to the speech of Mr. Buchanan when a Senator, to the\r\ndecisions of the Supreme Court, and to the usage from the beginning of\r\nthe Government through every successive Administration, all concurring\r\nto establish the right of removal as vested by the Constitution in the\r\nPresident. To all these he added the weight of his own deliberate\r\njudgment, and advised me that it was my duty to defend the power of\r\nthe President from usurpation and to veto the law.\r\n\r\nI do not know when a sense of public duty is more imperative upon a head\r\nof Department than upon such an occasion as this. He acts then under the\r\ngravest obligations of law, for when he is called upon by the President\r\nfor advice it is the Constitution which speaks to him. All his other\r\nduties are left by the Constitution to be regulated by statute, but this\r\nduty was deemed so momentous that it is imposed by the Constitution\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nAfter all this I was not prepared for the ground taken by Mr. Stanton in\r\nhis note of August 12. I was not prepared to find him compelled by a new\r\nand indefinite sense of public duty, under \"the Constitution,\" to assume\r\nthe vindication of a law which, under the solemn obligations of public\r\nduty imposed by the Constitution itself, he advised me was a violation\r\nof that Constitution. I make great allowance for a change of opinion,\r\nbut such a change as this hardly falls within the limits of greatest\r\nindulgence.\r\n\r\nWhere our opinions take the shape of advice, and influence the action\r\nof others, the utmost stretch of charity will scarcely justify us in\r\nrepudiating them when they come to be applied to ourselves.\r\n\r\nBut to proceed with the narrative. I was so much struck with the full\r\nmastery of the question manifested by Mr. Stanton, and was at the time\r\nso fully occupied with the preparation of another veto upon the pending\r\nreconstruction act, that I requested him to prepare the veto upon this\r\ntenure-of-office bill. This he declined, on the ground of physical\r\ndisability to undergo at the time the labor of writing, but stated his\r\nreadiness to furnish what aid might be required in the preparation of\r\nmaterials for the paper.\r\n\r\nAt the time this subject was before the Cabinet it seemed to be taken\r\nfor granted that as to those members of the Cabinet who had been\r\nappointed by Mr. Lincoln their tenure of office was not fixed by the\r\nprovisions of the act. I do not remember that the point was distinctly\r\ndecided, but I well recollect that it was suggested by one member of the\r\nCabinet who was appointed by Mr. Lincoln, and that no dissent was\r\nexpressed.\r\n\r\nWhether the point was well taken or not did not seem to me of any\r\nconsequence, for the unanimous expression of opinion against the\r\nconstitutionality and policy of the act was so decided that I felt no\r\nconcern, so far as the act had reference to the gentlemen then present,\r\nthat I would be embarrassed in the future. The bill had not then become\r\na law. The limitation upon the power of removal was not yet imposed, and\r\nthere was yet time to make any changes. If any one of these gentlemen\r\nhad then said to me that he would avail himself of the provisions of\r\nthat bill in case it became a law, I should not have hesitated a moment\r\nas to his removal. No pledge was then expressly given or required.\r\nBut there are circumstances when to give an expressed pledge is not\r\nnecessary, and when to require it is an imputation of possible bad\r\nfaith. I felt that if these gentlemen came within the purview of the\r\nbill it was as to them a dead letter, and that none of them would ever\r\ntake refuge under its provisions.\r\n\r\nI now pass to another subject. When, on the 15th of April, 1865, the\r\nduties of the Presidential office devolved upon me, I found a full\r\nCabinet of seven members, all of them selected by Mr. Lincoln.\r\nI made no change. On the contrary, I shortly afterwards ratified a\r\nchange determined upon by Mr. Lincoln, but not perfected at his death,\r\nand admitted his appointee, Mr. Harlan, in the place of Mr. Usher, who\r\nwas in office at the time.\r\n\r\nThe great duty of the time was to reestablish government, law, and order\r\nin the insurrectionary States. Congress was then in recess, and the\r\nsudden overthrow of the rebellion required speedy action. This grave\r\nsubject had engaged the attention of Mr. Lincoln in the last days of his\r\nlife, and the plan according to which it was to be managed had been\r\nprepared and was ready for adoption. A leading feature of that plan was\r\nthat it should be carried out by the Executive authority, for, so far as\r\nI have been informed, neither Mr. Lincoln nor any member of his Cabinet\r\ndoubted his authority to act or proposed to call an extra session of\r\nCongress to do the work. The first business transacted in Cabinet after\r\nI became President was this unfinished business of my predecessor.\r\nA plan or scheme of reconstruction was produced which had been prepared\r\nfor Mr. Lincoln by Mr. Stanton, his Secretary of War. It was approved,\r\nand at the earliest moment practicable was applied in the form of a\r\nproclamation to the State of North Carolina, and afterwards became the\r\nbasis of action in turn for the other States.\r\n\r\nUpon the examination of Mr. Stanton before the Impeachment Committee he\r\nwas asked the following question:\r\n\r\n  Did any one of the Cabinet express a doubt of the power of the executive\r\n  branch of the Government to reorganize State governments which had been\r\n  in rebellion without the aid of Congress?\r\n\r\n\r\nHe answered:\r\n\r\n  None whatever. I had myself entertained no doubt of the authority of the\r\n  President to take measures for the organization of the rebel States on\r\n  the plan proposed during the vacation of Congress and agreed in the plan\r\n  specified in the proclamation in the case of North Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps no act of my Administration for which I have been more\r\ndenounced than this. It was not originated by me, but I shrink from no\r\nresponsibility on that account, for the plan approved itself to my own\r\njudgment, and I did not hesitate to carry it into execution.\r\n\r\nThus far and upon this vital policy there was perfect accord between the\r\nCabinet and myself, and I saw no necessity for a change. As time passed\r\non there was developed an unfortunate difference of opinion and of\r\npolicy between Congress and the President upon this same subject and\r\nupon the ultimate basis upon which the reconstruction of these States\r\nshould proceed, especially upon the question of negro suffrage. Upon\r\nthis point three members of the Cabinet found themselves to be in\r\nsympathy with Congress. They remained only long enough to see that the\r\ndifference of policy could not be reconciled. They felt that they should\r\nremain no longer, and a high sense of duty and propriety constrained\r\nthem to resign their positions. We parted with mutual respect for the\r\nsincerity of each other in opposite opinions, and mutual regret that the\r\ndifference was on points so vital as to require a severance of official\r\nrelations. This was in the summer of 1866. The subsequent sessions of\r\nCongress developed new complications, when the suffrage bill for the\r\nDistrict of Columbia and the reconstruction acts of March 2 and March\r\n23, 1867, all passed over the veto. It was in Cabinet consultations upon\r\nthese bills that a difference of opinion upon the most vital points was\r\ndeveloped. Upon these questions there was perfect accord between all the\r\nmembers of the Cabinet and myself, except Mr. Stanton. He stood alone,\r\nand the difference of opinion could not be reconciled. That unity of\r\nopinion which, upon great questions of public policy or administration,\r\nis so essential to the Executive was gone.\r\n\r\nI do not claim that a head of Department should have no other opinions\r\nthan those of the President. He has the same right, in the conscientious\r\ndischarge of duty, to entertain and express his own opinions as has the\r\nPresident. What I do claim is that the President is the responsible head\r\nof the Administration, and when the opinions of a head of Department are\r\nirreconcilably opposed to those of the President in grave matters of\r\npolicy and administration there is but one result which can solve the\r\ndifficulty, and that is a severance of the official relation. This in\r\nthe past history of the Government has always been the rule, and it is a\r\nwise one, for such differences of opinion among its members must impair\r\nthe efficiency of any Administration.\r\n\r\nI have now referred to the general grounds upon which the withdrawal\r\nor Mr. Stanton from my Administration seemed to me to be proper and\r\nnecessary, but I can not omit to state a special ground, which, if it\r\nstood alone, would vindicate my action.\r\n\r\nThe sanguinary riot which occurred in the city of New Orleans on the\r\n30th of August, 1866, justly aroused public indignation and public\r\ninquiry, not only as to those who were engaged in it, but as to those\r\nwho, more or less remotely, might be held to responsibility for its\r\noccurrence. I need not remind the Senate of the effort made to fix that\r\nresponsibility on the President. The charge was openly made, and again\r\nand again reiterated all through the land, that the President was warned\r\nin time, but refused to interfere.\r\n\r\nBy telegrams from the lieutenant-governor and attorney-general of\r\nLouisiana, dated the 27th and 28th of August, I was advised that a body\r\nof delegates claiming to be a constitutional convention were about to\r\nassemble in New Orleans; that the matter was before the grand jury, but\r\nthat it would be impossible to execute civil process without a riot; and\r\nthis question was asked:\r\n\r\n  Is the military to interfere to prevent process of court?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis question was asked at a time when the civil courts were in the full\r\nexercise of their authority, and the answer sent by telegraph on the\r\nsame 28th of August was this:\r\n\r\n  The military will be expected to sustain, and not to interfere with,\r\n  the proceedings of the courts.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the same 28th of August the following telegram was sent to Mr.\r\nStanton by Major-General Baird, then (owing to the absence of General\r\nSheridan) in command of the military at New Orleans:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Hon. EDWIN M. STANTON,\r\n    _Secretary of War_:\r\n\r\n  A convention has been called, with the sanction of Governor Wells, to\r\n  meet here on Monday. The lieutenant-governor and city authorities think\r\n  it unlawful, and propose to break it up by arresting the delegates.\r\n  I have given no orders on the subject, but have warned the parties that\r\n  I could not countenance or permit such action without instructions to\r\n  that effect from the President. Please instruct me at once by telegraph.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 28th of August was on Saturday. The next morning, the 29th, this\r\ndispatch was received by Mr. Stanton at his residence in this city. He\r\ntook no action upon it, and neither sent instructions to General Baird\r\nhimself nor presented it to me for such instructions. On the next day\r\n(Monday) the riot occurred. I never saw this dispatch from General Baird\r\nuntil some ten days or two weeks after the riot, when, upon my call for\r\nall the dispatches, with a view to their publication, Mr. Stanton sent\r\nit to me.\r\n\r\nThese facts all appear in the testimony of Mr. Stanton before the\r\nJudiciary Committee in the impeachment investigation.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th, the day of the riot, and after it was suppressed, General\r\nBaird wrote to Mr. Stanton a long letter, from which I make the\r\nfollowing extract:\r\n\r\n  SIR: I have the honor to inform you that a very serious riot has\r\n  occurred here to-day. I had not been applied to by the convention\r\n  for protection, but the lieutenant-governor and the mayor had freely\r\n  consulted with me, and I was so fully convinced that it was so strongly\r\n  the intent of the city authorities to preserve the peace, in order to\r\n  prevent military interference, that I did not regard an outbreak as a\r\n  thing to be apprehended. The lieutenant-governor had assured me that\r\n  even if a writ of arrest was issued by the court the sheriff would not\r\n  attempt to serve it without my permission, and for to-day they designed\r\n  to suspend it. I inclose herewith copies of my correspondence with the\r\n  mayor and of a dispatch which the lieutenant-governor claims to have\r\n  received from the President. I regret that no reply to my dispatch to\r\n  you of Saturday has yet reached me. General Sheridan is still absent\r\n  in Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dispatch of General Baird of the 28th asks for immediate\r\ninstructions, and his letter of the 30th, after detailing the terrible\r\nriot which had just happened, ends with the expression of regret that\r\nthe instructions which he asked for were not sent. It is not the fault\r\nor the error or the omission of the President that this military\r\ncommander was left without instructions; but for all omissions, for\r\nall errors, for all failures to instruct when instruction might have\r\naverted this calamity, the President was openly and persistently held\r\nresponsible. Instantly, without waiting for proof, the delinquency of\r\nthe President was heralded in every form of utterance. Mr. Stanton knew\r\nthen that the President was not responsible for this delinquency. The\r\nexculpation was in his power, but it was not given by him to the public,\r\nand only to the President in obedience to a requisition for all the\r\ndispatches.\r\n\r\nNo one regrets more than myself that General Baird's request was not\r\nbrought to my notice. It is clear from his dispatch and letter that if\r\nthe Secretary of War had given him proper instructions the riot which\r\narose on the assembling of the convention would have been averted.\r\n\r\nThere may be those ready to say that I would have given no instructions\r\neven if the dispatch had reached me in time, but all must admit that\r\nI ought to have had the opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe following is the testimony given by Mr. Stanton before the\r\nimpeachment investigation committee as to this dispatch:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Q. Referring to the dispatch of the 28th of July by General Baird, I ask\r\n  you whether that dispatch on its receipt was communicated?\r\n\r\n  A. I received that dispatch on Sunday forenoon. I examined it carefully,\r\n  and considered the question presented. I did not see that I could give\r\n  any instructions different from the line of action which General Baird\r\n  proposed, and made no answer to the dispatch.\r\n\r\n  Q. I see it stated that this was received at 10.20 p.m. Was that the\r\n  hour at which it was received by you?\r\n\r\n  A. That is the date of its reception in the telegraph office Saturday\r\n  night. I received it on Sunday forenoon at my residence. A copy of the\r\n  dispatch was furnished to the President several days afterwards, along\r\n  with all the other dispatches and communications on that subject, but it\r\n  was not furnished by me before that time. I suppose it may have been ten\r\n  or fifteen days afterwards.\r\n\r\n  Q. The President himself being in correspondence with those parties upon\r\n  the same subject, would it not have been proper to have advised him of\r\n  the reception of that dispatch?\r\n\r\n  A. I know nothing about his correspondence, and know nothing about any\r\n  correspondence except this one dispatch. We had intelligence of the riot\r\n  on Thursday morning. The riot had taken place on Monday.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a difficult matter to define all the relations which exist between\r\nthe heads of Departments and the President. The legal relations are well\r\nenough defined. The Constitution places these officers in the relation\r\nof his advisers when he calls upon them for advice. The acts of Congress\r\ngo further. Take, for example, the act of 1789 creating the War\r\nDepartment. It provides that--\r\n\r\n  There shall be a principal officer therein to be called the Secretary\r\n  for the Department of War, who shall perform and execute such duties\r\n  as shall from time to time be enjoined on or intrusted to him by the\r\n  President of the United States; and, furthermore, the said principal\r\n  officer shall conduct the business of the said Department in such manner\r\n  as the President of the United States shall from time to time order and\r\n  instruct.\r\n\r\n\r\nProvision is also made for the appointment of an inferior officer by the\r\nhead of the Department, to be called the chief clerk, \"who, whenever\r\nsaid principal officer shall be removed from office by the President\r\nof the United States,\" shall have the charge and custody of the books,\r\nrecords, and papers of the Department.\r\n\r\nThe legal relation is analogous to that of principal and agent. It is\r\nthe President upon whom the Constitution devolves, as head of the\r\nexecutive department, the duty to see that the laws are faithfully\r\nexecuted; but as he can not execute them in person, he is allowed to\r\nselect his agents, and is made responsible for their acts within just\r\nlimits. So complete is this presumed delegation of authority in the\r\nrelation of a head of Department to the President that the Supreme Court\r\nof the United States have decided that an order made by a head of\r\nDepartment is presumed to be made by the President himself.\r\n\r\nThe principal, upon whom such responsibility is placed for the acts\r\nof a subordinate, ought to be left as free as possible in the matter\r\nof selection and of dismissal. To hold him to responsibility for an\r\nofficer beyond his control; to leave the question of the fitness of\r\nsuch an agent to be decided _for_ him and not _by_ him; to allow such\r\na subordinate, when the President, moved by \"public considerations of\r\na high character,\" requests his resignation, to assume for himself an\r\nequal right to act upon his own views of \"public considerations\" and to\r\nmake his own conclusions paramount to those of the President--to allow\r\nall this is to reverse the just order of administration and to place\r\nthe subordinate above the superior.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, other relations between the President and\r\na head of Department beyond these defined legal relations, which\r\nnecessarily attend them, though not expressed. Chief among these is\r\nmutual confidence. This relation is so delicate that it is sometimes\r\nhard to say when or how it ceases. A single flagrant act may end\r\nit at once, and then there is no difficulty. But confidence may be\r\njust as effectually destroyed by a series of causes too subtle for\r\ndemonstration. As it is a plant of slow growth, so, too, it may be\r\nslow in decay. Such has been the process here. I will not pretend to say\r\nwhat acts or omissions have broken up this relation. They are hardly\r\nsusceptible of statement, and still less of formal proof. Nevertheless,\r\nno one can read the correspondence of the 5th of August without being\r\nconvinced that this relation was effectually gone on both sides, and\r\nthat while the President was unwilling to allow Mr. Stanton to remain\r\nin his Administration, Mr. Stanton was equally unwilling to allow the\r\nPresident to carry on his Administration without his presence.\r\n\r\nIn the great debate which took place in the House of Representatives\r\nin 1789, in the first organization of the principal Departments, Mr.\r\nMadison spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  It is evidently the intention of the Constitution that the first\r\n  magistrate should be responsible for the executive department. So far,\r\n  therefore, as we do not make the officers who are to aid him in the\r\n  duties of that department responsible to him, he is not responsible\r\n  to the country. Again: Is there no danger that an officer, when he is\r\n  appointed by the concurrence of the Senate and has friends in that body,\r\n  may choose rather to risk his establishment on the favor of that branch\r\n  than rest it upon the discharge of his duties to the satisfaction of the\r\n  executive branch, which is constitutionally authorized to inspect and\r\n  control his conduct? And if it should happen that the officers connect\r\n  themselves with the Senate, they may mutually support each other, and\r\n  for want of efficacy reduce the power of the President to a mere\r\n  vapor, in which case his responsibility would be annihilated, and the\r\n  expectation of it is unjust. The high executive officers, joined in\r\n  cabal with the Senate, would lay the foundation of discord, and end in\r\n  an assumption of the executive power only to be removed by a revolution\r\n  in the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Sedgwick, in the same debate, referring to the proposition that\r\na head of Department should only be removed or suspended by the\r\nconcurrence of the Senate, used this language:\r\n\r\n  But if proof be necessary, what is then the consequence? Why, in nine\r\n  cases out of ten, where the case is very clear to the mind of the\r\n  President that the man ought to be removed, the effect can not be\r\n  produced, because it is absolutely impossible to produce the necessary\r\n  evidence. Are the Senate to proceed without evidence? Some gentlemen\r\n  contend not. Then the object will be lost. Shall a man under these\r\n  circumstances be saddled upon the President who has been appointed for\r\n  no other purpose but to aid the President in performing certain duties?\r\n  Shall he be continued, I ask again, against the will of the President?\r\n  If he is, where is the responsibility? Are you to look for it in the\r\n  President, who has no control over the officer, no power to remove him\r\n  if he acts unfeelingly or unfaithfully? Without you make him responsible\r\n  you weaken and destroy the strength and beauty of your system. What is\r\n  to be done in cases which can only be known from a long acquaintance\r\n  with the conduct of an officer?\r\n\r\n\r\nI had indulged the hope that upon the assembling of Congress\r\nMr. Stanton would have ended this unpleasant complication according\r\nto his intimation given in his note of August 12. The duty which I have\r\nfelt myself called upon to perform was by no means agreeable, but I feel\r\nthat I am not responsible for the controversy or for the consequences.\r\n\r\nUnpleasant as this necessary change in my Cabinet has been to me upon\r\npersonal considerations, I have the consolation to be assured that so\r\nfar as the public interests are involved there is no cause for regret.\r\n\r\nSalutary reforms have been introduced by the Secretary _ad interim_, and\r\ngreat reductions of expenses have been effected under his administration\r\nof the War Department, to the saving of millions to the Treasury.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 14, 1867_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n9th instant, I transmit herewith a copy of the papers relating to the\r\ntrial by a military commission of Albert M.D.C. Lusk, of Louisiana.\r\nNo action in the case has yet been taken by the President.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 17, 1867_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit for the information of the House of Representatives a report\r\nfrom the Secretary of State, with an accompanying paper.[32]\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: Report of George H. Sharpe relative to the assassination\r\nof President Lincoln and the attempted assassination of Secretary\r\nSeward.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 17, 1867_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 6th instant,\r\nconcerning the International Monetary Conference held at Paris in\r\nJune last, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State, which\r\nis accompanied by the papers called for by the resolution.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 17, 1867_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit, for the consideration of the Senate, an agreement between\r\nthe diplomatic representatives of certain foreign powers in Japan,\r\nincluding the minister of the United States, on the one part, and\r\nplenipotentiaries on the part of the Japanese Government, relative\r\nto the settlement of Yokohama.\r\n\r\nThis instrument can not be legally binding upon the United States unless\r\nsanctioned by the Senate. There appears to be no objection to its\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nA copy of General Van Valkenburgh's dispatch to the Secretary of State,\r\nby which the agreement was accompanied, and of the map to which it\r\nrefers, are also herewith transmitted.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _December 18, 1867_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAn official copy of the order issued by Major-General Winfield S.\r\nHancock, commander of the Fifth Military District, dated headquarters in\r\nNew Orleans, La., on the 29th day of November, has reached me through\r\nthe regular channels of the War Department, and I herewith communicate\r\nit to Congress for such action as may seem to be proper in view of all\r\nthe circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived that General Hancock announces that he will make\r\nthe law the rule of his conduct; that he will uphold the courts and\r\nother civil authorities in the performance of their proper duties, and\r\nthat he will use his military power only to preserve the peace and\r\nenforce the law. He declares very explicitly that the sacred right of\r\nthe trial by jury and the privilege of the writ of _habeas corpus_ shall\r\nnot be crushed out or trodden under foot. He goes further, and in one\r\ncomprehensive sentence asserts that the principles of American liberty\r\nare still the inheritance of this people and ever should be.\r\n\r\nWhen a great soldier, with unrestricted power in his hands to oppress\r\nhis fellow-men, voluntarily foregoes the chance of gratifying his\r\nselfish ambition and devotes himself to the duty of building up the\r\nliberties and strengthening the laws of his country, he presents an\r\nexample of the highest public virtue that human nature is capable of\r\npracticing. The strongest claim of Washington to be \"first in war,\r\nfirst in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen\" is founded\r\non the great fact that in all his illustrious career he scrupulously\r\nabstained from violating the legal and constitutional rights of his\r\nfellow-citizens. When he surrendered his commission to Congress, the\r\nPresident of that body spoke his highest praise in saying that he had\r\n\"always regarded the rights of the civil authorities through all dangers\r\nand disasters.\" Whenever power above the law courted his acceptance, he\r\ncalmly put the temptation aside. By such magnanimous acts of forbearance\r\nhe won the universal admiration of mankind and left a name which has no\r\nrival in the history of the world.\r\n\r\nI am far from saying that General Hancock is the only officer of the\r\nAmerican Army who is influenced by the example of Washington. Doubtless\r\nthousands of them are faithfully devoted to the principles for which the\r\nmen of the Revolution laid down their lives. But the distinguished honor\r\nbelongs to him of being the first officer in high command south of the\r\nPotomac, since the close of the civil war, who has given utterance to\r\nthese noble sentiments in the form of a military order.\r\n\r\nI respectfully suggest to Congress that some public recognition of\r\nGeneral Hancock's patriotic conduct is due, if not to him, to the friends\r\nof law and justice throughout the country. Of such an act as his at such\r\na time it is but fit that the dignity should be vindicated and the virtue\r\nproclaimed, so that its value as an example may not be lost to the nation.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 19, 1867_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, in answer to a resolution of that body\r\nof the 16th instant, a report[33] from the Secretary of State, with\r\naccompanying papers.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: Relating to the removal of Governor Ballard, of the\r\nTerritory of Idaho.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 20, 1867_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to Congress a report, dated the 20th instant,\r\nwith the accompanying papers, received from the Secretary of State in\r\ncompliance with the requirements of the eighteenth section of the act\r\nentitled \"An act to regulate the diplomatic and consular systems of\r\nthe United States,\" approved August 18, 1856.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 31, 1867_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n18th instant, requesting information concerning alleged interference\r\nby Russian naval vessels with whaling vessels of the United States,\r\nI transmit a report from the Secretary of State and the papers referred\r\nto therein.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 6, 1868_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the Senate a report from the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, containing the information requested in their resolution of\r\nthe 16th ultimo, relative to the amount of United States bonds issued to\r\nthe Union Pacific Railroad Company and each of its branches, including\r\nthe Central Pacific Railroad Company of California.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 7, 1868_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit a report from the Secretary of State, in answer to a\r\nresolution of the House of Representatives of yesterday, making inquiry\r\nhow many and what State legislatures have ratified the proposed\r\namendment to the Constitution of the United States known as the\r\nfourteenth article.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 7, 1868_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nA Spanish steamer named _Nuestra Señora_ being in the harbor of Port\r\nRoyal, S.C., on the 1st of December, 1861, Brigadier General T.W.\r\nSherman, who was in command of the United States forces there, received\r\ninformation which he supposed justified him in seizing her, as she was\r\non her way from Charleston to Havana with insurgent correspondence on\r\nboard. The seizure was made accordingly, and during the ensuing spring\r\nthe vessel was sent to New York, in order that the legality of the\r\nseizure might be tried.\r\n\r\nBy a decree of June 20, 1863, Judge Betts ordered the vessel to be\r\nrestored, and by a subsequent decree, of October 15, 1863, he referred\r\nthe adjustment of damages to amicable negotiations between the two\r\nGovernments.\r\n\r\nWhile the proceeding in admiralty was pending, the vessel was appraised\r\nand taken by the Navy Department at the valuation of $28,000, which sum\r\nthat Department paid into the Treasury.\r\n\r\nAs the amount of this valuation can not legally be drawn from the\r\nTreasury without authority from Congress, I recommend an appropriation\r\nfor that purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to appoint a commissioner on the part of this Government\r\nto adjust, informally in this case, with a similar commissioner on the\r\npart of Spain, the question of damages, the commissioners to name an\r\narbiter for points upon which they may disagree. When the amount of the\r\ndamages shall thus have been ascertained, application will be made to\r\nCongress for a further appropriation toward paying them.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _January 14, 1868_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a communication from the Secretary of War _ad\r\ninterim_, with the accompanying papers, prepared in compliance with a\r\nresolution of the House of Representatives of March 15, 1867, requesting\r\ninformation in reference to contracts for ordnance projectiles and small\r\narms.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _January 14, 1868_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith the report made by the commissioners appointed under\r\nthe act of Congress approved on the 20th day of July, 1867, entitled\r\n\"An act to establish peace with certain hostile Indian tribes,\" together\r\nwith the accompanying papers.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 14, 1868_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of yesterday, calling for\r\ninformation relating to the appointment of the American minister at\r\nPekin to a diplomatic or other mission on behalf of the Chinese\r\nGovernment by the Emperor of China, I transmit a report from the\r\nSecretary of State upon the subject, together with the accompanying\r\npapers.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _January 14, 1868_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith lay before the Senate, for its constitutional action thereon,\r\nthe following treaties, concluded at \"Medicine Lodge Creek,\" Kansas,\r\nbetween the Indian tribes therein named and the United States, by their\r\ncommissioners appointed by the act of Congress approved July 20, 1867,\r\nentitled \"An act to establish peace with certain hostile Indian tribes,\"\r\nviz:\r\n\r\nA treaty with the Kiowa and Comanche tribes, concluded October 21, 1867.\r\n\r\nA treaty with the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache tribes, concluded October\r\n28, 1867.\r\n\r\nA treaty with the Arapahoe and Cheyenne tribes, dated October 28, 1867.\r\n\r\nA letter of this date from the Secretary of the Interior, transmitting\r\nsaid treaties, is herewith inclosed.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 17, 1868_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nWith reference to the convention between the United States and Denmark\r\nfor the cession of the islands of St. Thomas and St. John, in the West\r\nIndies, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State on the subject\r\nof the vote of St. Thomas on the question of accepting the cession.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _January 23, 1868_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the request of the Senate of yesterday, I return\r\nherewith their resolution of the 21st instant, calling for information\r\nin reference to James A. Seddon, late Secretary of War of the so-called\r\nConfederate States.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 23, 1868_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have received the following preamble and resolution, adopted by the\r\nSenate on the 8th instant:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Whereas Senate bill No. 141, and entitled \"An act for the further\r\n  security of equal rights in the District of Columbia,\" having at this\r\n  present session passed both Houses of Congress, was afterwards, on the\r\n  11th day of December, 1867, duly presented to the President of the\r\n  United States for his approval and signature; and\r\n\r\n  Whereas more than ten days, exclusive of Sundays, have since elapsed in\r\n  this session without said bill having been returned, either approved or\r\n  disapproved: Therefore,\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the President of the United States be requested to\r\n  inform the Senate whether said bill has been delivered to and received\r\n  by the Secretary of State, as provided by the second section of the act\r\n  of the 27th day of July, 1789.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the act which the resolution mentions has no relevancy to the subject\r\nunder inquiry, it is presumed that it was the intention of the Senate to\r\nrefer to the law of the 15th September, 1789, the second section of\r\nwhich prescribes--\r\n\r\n  That whenever a bill, order, resolution, or vote of the Senate and\r\n  House of Representatives, having been approved and signed by the\r\n  President of the United States, or not having been returned by him with\r\n  his objections, shall become a law or take effect, it shall forthwith\r\n  thereafter be received by the said Secretary from the President; and\r\n  whenever a bill, order, resolution, or vote shall be returned by the\r\n  President with his objections, and shall, on being reconsidered, be\r\n  agreed to be passed, and be approved by two-thirds of both Houses of\r\n  Congress, and thereby become a law or take effect, it shall in such\r\n  case be received by the said Secretary from the President of the Senate\r\n  or the Speaker of the House of Representatives, in whichsoever House it\r\n  shall last have been so approved.\r\n\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the bill \"for the further security of equal rights in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia\" has not become a law in either of the modes\r\ndesignated in the section above quoted, it has not been delivered to\r\nthe Secretary of State for record and promulgation. The Constitution\r\nexpressly declares that--\r\n\r\n  If any bill shall not be returned by the President within ten days\r\n  (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the\r\n  same shall be a law in like manner as if he had signed it, unless\r\n  the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return, in which case\r\n  it shall not be a law.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs stated in the preamble to the resolution, the bill to which it refers\r\nwas presented for my approval on the 11th day of December, 1867. On the\r\n20th of same month, and before the expiration of the ten days after the\r\npresentation of the bill to the President, the two Houses, in accordance\r\nwith a concurrent resolution adopted on the 3d [13th] of December,\r\nadjourned until the 6th of January, 1868. Congress by their adjournment\r\nthus prevented the return of the bill within the time prescribed by the\r\nConstitution, and it was therefore left in the precise condition in\r\nwhich that instrument positively declares a bill \"shall not be a law.\"\r\n\r\nIf the adjournment in December did not cause the failure of this bill,\r\nbecause not such an adjournment as is contemplated by the Constitution\r\nin the clause which I have cited, it must follow that such was the\r\nnature of the adjournments during the past year, on the 30th day of\r\nMarch until the first Wednesday of July and from the 20th of July until\r\nthe 21st of November. Other bills will therefore be affected by the\r\ndecision which may be rendered in this case, among them one having the\r\nsame title as that named in the resolution, and containing similar\r\nprovisions, which, passed by both Houses in the month of July last,\r\nfailed to become a law by reason of the adjournment of Congress before\r\nten days for its consideration had been allowed the Executive.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 27, 1868_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n22d instant, calling for a copy of the report of Abram S.

Copies of the letters which they have addressed to me upon the\r\nsubject are accordingly herewith inclosed.\r\n\r\nYou speak of my letter of the 31st ultimo[36] as a reiteration of the\r\n\"many and gross misrepresentations\" contained in certain newspaper\r\narticles, and reassert the correctness of the statements contained in\r\nyour communication of the 28th ultimo,[37] adding--and here I give your\r\nown words--\"anything in yours in reply to it to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding.\"\r\n\r\nWhen a controversy upon matters of fact reaches the point to which this\r\nhas been brought, further assertion or denial between the immediate\r\nparties should cease, especially where upon either side it loses\r\nthe character of the respectful discussion which is required by the\r\nrelations in which the parties stand to each other and degenerates in\r\ntone and temper. In such a case, if there is nothing to rely upon but\r\nthe opposing statements, conclusions must be drawn from those statements\r\nalone and from whatever intrinsic probabilities they afford in favor of\r\nor against either of the parties. I should not shrink from this test in\r\nthis controversy; but, fortunately, it is not left to this test alone.\r\nThere were five Cabinet officers present at the conversation the detail\r\nof which in my letter of the 28th [31st[37]] ultimo you allow yourself\r\nto say contains \"many and gross misrepresentations.\" These gentlemen\r\nheard that conversation and have read my statement. They speak for\r\nthemselves, and I leave the proof without a word of comment.\r\n\r\nI deem it proper before concluding this communication to notice some of\r\nthe statements contained in your letter.\r\n\r\nYou say that a performance of the promises alleged to have been made by\r\nyou to the President \"would have involved a resistance to law and an\r\ninconsistency with the whole history of my connection with the\r\nsuspension of Mr. Stanton.\" You then state that you had fears the\r\nPresident would, on the removal of Mr. Stanton, appoint someone in his\r\nplace who would embarrass the Army in carrying out the reconstruction\r\nacts, and add:\r\n\r\n\"It was to prevent such an appointment that I accepted the office of\r\nSecretary of War _ad interim_, and not for the purpose of enabling you\r\nto get rid of Mr. Stanton by withholding it from him in opposition to\r\nlaw, or, not doing so myself, surrendering it to one who would, as the\r\nstatements and assumptions in your communication plainly indicate was\r\nsought.\"\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you here admit that from the very beginning of what\r\nyou term \"the whole history\" of your connection with Mr. Stanton's\r\nsuspension you intended to circumvent the President. It was to carry out\r\nthat intent that you accepted the appointment. This was in your mind at\r\nthe time of your acceptance. It was not, then, in obedience to the order\r\nof your superior, as has heretofore been supposed, that you assumed the\r\nduties of the office. You knew it was the President's purpose to prevent\r\nMr. Stanton from resuming the office of Secretary of War, and you\r\nintended to defeat that purpose. You accepted the office, not in the\r\ninterest of the President but of Mr. Stanton. If this purpose, so\r\nentertained by you, had been confined to yourself; if when accepting\r\nthe office you had done so with a mental reservation to frustrate the\r\nPresident, it would have been a tacit deception. In the ethics of some\r\npersons such a course is allowable. But you can not stand even upon\r\nthat questionable ground. The \"history\" of your connection with this\r\ntransaction, as written by yourself, places you in a different\r\npredicament, and shows that you not only concealed your design from\r\nthe President, but induced him to suppose that you would carry out his\r\npurpose to keep Mr. Stanton out of office by retaining it yourself after\r\nan attempted restoration by the Senate, so as to require Mr. Stanton to\r\nestablish his right by judicial decision.\r\n\r\nI now give that part of this \"history\" as written by yourself in your\r\nletter of the 28th ultimo:[38]\r\n\r\n\"Some time after I assumed the duties of Secretary of War _ad interim_\r\nthe President asked me my views as to the course Mr. Stanton would have\r\nto pursue, in case the Senate should not concur in his suspension, to\r\nobtain possession of his office. My reply was, in substance, that\r\nMr. Stanton would have to appeal to the courts to reinstate him,\r\nillustrating my position by citing the ground I had taken in the case\r\nof the Baltimore police commissioners.\"\r\n\r\nNow, at that time, as you admit in your letter of the 3d instant,[39]\r\nyou held the office for the very object of defeating an appeal to the\r\ncourts. In that letter you say that in accepting the office one motive\r\nwas to prevent the President from appointing some other person who would\r\nretain possession, and thus make judicial proceedings necessary. You\r\nknew the President was unwilling to trust the office with anyone who\r\nwould not by holding it compel Mr. Stanton to resort to the courts.\r\nYou perfectly understood that in this interview, \"some time\" after\r\nyou accepted the office, the President, not content with your silence,\r\ndesired an expression of your views, and you answered him that Mr.\r\nStanton \"would have to appeal to the courts.\" If the President reposed\r\nconfidence _before_ he knew your views, and that confidence had been\r\nviolated, it might have been said he made a mistake; but a violation of\r\nconfidence reposed _after_ that conversation was no mistake of his nor\r\nof yours. It is the fact only that needs be stated, that at the date of\r\nthis conversation you did not intend to hold the office with the purpose\r\nof forcing Mr. Stanton into court, but did hold it then and had accepted\r\nit to prevent that course from being carried out. In other words, you\r\nsaid to the President, \"That is the proper course,\" and you said to\r\nyourself, \"I have accepted this office, and now hold it to defeat that\r\ncourse.\" The excuse you make in a subsequent paragraph of that letter\r\nof the 28th ultimo,[38] that afterwards you changed your views as to\r\nwhat would be a proper course, has nothing to do with the point now\r\nunder consideration. The point is that _before_ you changed your views\r\nyou had secretly determined to do the very thing which at last you\r\ndid--surrender the office to Mr. Stanton. You may have changed your\r\nviews as to the law, but you certainly did not change your views as\r\nto the course you had marked out for yourself from the beginning.\r\n\r\nI will only notice one more statement in your letter of the 3d\r\ninstant[39]--that the performance of the promises which it is alleged\r\nwere made by you would have involved you in the resistance of law. I\r\nknow of no statute that would have been violated had you, carrying out\r\nyour promises in good faith, tendered your resignation when you\r\nconcluded not to be made a party in any legal proceedings. You add:\r\n\r\n\"I am in a measure confirmed in this conclusion by your recent orders\r\ndirecting me to disobey orders from the Secretary of War, _my superior_\r\nand your subordinate, without having countermanded his authority to\r\nissue the orders I am to disobey.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 24th[39] ultimo you addressed a note to the President requesting\r\nin writing an order given to you verbally five days before to disregard\r\norders from Mr. Stanton as Secretary of War until you \"knew from the\r\nPresident himself that they were his orders.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 29th,[40] in compliance with your request, I did give you\r\ninstructions in writing \"not to obey any order from the War Department\r\nassumed to be issued by the direction of the President unless such order\r\nis known by the General Commanding the armies of the United States to\r\nhave been authorized by the Executive.\"\r\n\r\nThere are some orders which a Secretary of War may issue without the\r\nauthority of the President; there are others which he issues simply as\r\nthe agent of the President, and which purport to be \"by direction\" of\r\nthe President. For such orders the President is responsible, and he\r\nshould therefore know and understand what they are before giving such\r\n\"direction.\" Mr. Stanton states in his letter of the 4th instant,[41]\r\nwhich accompanies the published correspondence, that he \"has had no\r\ncorrespondence with the President since the 12th of August last;\" and\r\nhe further says that since he resumed the duties of the office he has\r\ncontinued to discharge them \"without any personal or written\r\ncommunication with the President;\" and he adds, \"No orders have been\r\nissued from this Department in the name of the President with my\r\nknowledge, and I have received no orders from him.\"\r\n\r\nIt thus seems that Mr. Stanton now discharges the duties of the War\r\nDepartment without any reference to the President and without using his\r\nname.\r\n\r\nMy order to you had only reference to orders \"assumed to be issued by\r\nthe direction of the President.\" It would appear from Mr. Stanton's\r\nletter that you have received no such orders from him. However, in your\r\nnote to the President of the 30th ultimo,[42] in which you acknowledge\r\nthe receipt of the written order of the 29th,[43] you say that you have\r\nbeen informed by Mr. Stanton that he has not received any order limiting\r\nhis authority to issue orders to the Army, according to the practice\r\nof the Department, and state that \"while this authority to the War\r\nDepartment is not countermanded it will be satisfactory evidence to\r\nme that any orders issued from the War Department by direction of the\r\nPresident are authorized by the Executive.\"\r\n\r\nThe President issues an order to you to obey no order from the War\r\nDepartment purporting to be made \"by the direction of the President\"\r\nuntil you have referred it to him for his approval. You reply that you\r\nhave received the President's order and will not obey it, but will obey\r\nan order purporting to be given by his direction _if it comes from the\r\nWar Department_. You will not obey the direct order of the President,\r\nbut will obey his indirect order. If, as you say, there has been a\r\npractice in the War Department to issue orders in the name of the\r\nPresident without his direction, does not the precise order you have\r\nrequested and have received change the practice as to the General of\r\nthe Army? Could not the President countermand any such order issued to\r\nyou from the War Department? If you should receive an order from that\r\nDepartment, issued in the name of the President, to do a special act,\r\nand an order directly from the President himself not to do the act, is\r\nthere a doubt which you are to obey? You answer the question when you\r\nsay to the President, in your letter of the 3d instant,[44] the Secretary\r\nof War is \"my superior and your subordinate,\" and yet you refuse\r\nobedience to the superior out of a deference to the subordinate.\r\n\r\nWithout further comment upon the insubordinate attitude which you\r\nhave assumed, I am at a loss to know how you can relieve yourself\r\nfrom obedience to the orders of the President, who is made by the\r\nConstitution the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, and is\r\ntherefore the official superior as well of the General of the Army\r\nas of the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nRespectfully, yours,\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: See pp. 618-620.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: See pp. 615-618.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: See pp. 613-615.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: See pp. 613-615.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: See pp. 618-620.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: See p. 613.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: See p. 615.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: See pp. 612-613.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: See p. 615.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: See pp. 618-620.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Letter addressed to each of the members of the Cabinet present at the\r\nconversation between the President and General Grant on the 14th of\r\nJanuary, 1868, and answers thereto.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, D.C., February 5, 1868_.\r\n\r\nSIR: The Chronicle of this morning contains a correspondence between the\r\nPresident and General Grant reported from the War Department in answer\r\nto a resolution of the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nI beg to call your attention to that correspondence, and especially to\r\nthat part of it which refers to the conversation between the President\r\nand General Grant at the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, the 14th of\r\nJanuary, and to request you to state what was said in that conversation.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, yours,\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _February 5, 1868_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nSIR: Your note of this date was handed to me this evening.

In the presence of the Cabinet the President\r\nasked General Grant whether, \"in conversation which took place after his\r\nappointment as Secretary of War _ad interim_, he did not agree either\r\nto remain at the head of the War Department and abide any judicial\r\nproceedings that might follow the nonconcurrence by the Senate in Mr.\r\nStanton's suspension, or, should he wish not to become involved in such\r\na controversy, to put the President in the same position with respect to\r\nthe office as he occupied previous to General Grant's appointment, by\r\nreturning it to the President in time to anticipate such action by the\r\nSenate.\" This General Grant admitted.\r\n\r\nThe President then asked General Grant if at the conference on the\r\npreceding Saturday he had not, to avoid misunderstanding, requested\r\nGeneral Grant to state what he intended to do, and, further, if in reply\r\nto that inquiry he (General Grant) had not referred to their former\r\nconversations, saying that from them the President understood his\r\nposition, and that his (General Grant's) action would be consistent with\r\nthe understanding which had been reached.\r\n\r\nTo these questions General Grant replied in the affirmative.\r\n\r\nThe President asked General Grant if at the conclusion of their\r\ninterview on Saturday it was not understood that they were to have\r\nanother conference on Monday before final action by the Senate in the\r\ncase of Mr. Stanton.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant replied that such was the understanding, but that he did\r\nnot suppose the Senate would act so soon; that on Monday he had been\r\nengaged in a conference with General Sherman, and was occupied with\r\n\"many little matters,\" and asked if General Sherman had not called on\r\nthat day.\r\n\r\nI take this mode of complying with the request contained in the\r\nPresident's letter to me, because my attention had been called to the\r\nsubject before, when the conversation between the President and General\r\nGrant was under consideration.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nALEX W. RANDALL,\r\n\r\n_Postmaster-General_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: See pp. 615-618.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,\r\n\r\n_Washington, D.C., February 6, 1868_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nSIR: I am in receipt of yours of yesterday, calling my attention to\r\na correspondance between yourself and General Grant published in the\r\nChronicle newspaper, and especially to that part of said correspondence\r\n\"which refers to the conversation between the President and General\r\nGrant at the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, the 14th of January,\" and\r\nrequesting me \"to state what was said in that conversation.\"\r\n\r\nIn reply I submit the following statement: At the Cabinet meeting on\r\nTuesday, the 14th of January, 1868, General Grant appeared and took his\r\naccustomed seat at the board. When he had been reached in the order of\r\nbusiness, the President asked him, as usual, if he had anything to\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nIn reply the General, after referring to a note which he had that\r\nmorning addressed to the President, inclosing a copy of the resolution\r\nof the Senate refusing to concur in the reasons for the suspension of\r\nMr. Stanton, proceeded to say that he regarded his duties as Secretary\r\nof War _ad interim_ terminated by that resolution, and that he could not\r\nlawfully exercise such duties for a moment after the adoption of the\r\nresolution by the Senate; that the resolution reached him last night,\r\nand that this morning he had gone to the War Department, entered the\r\nSecretary's room, bolted one door on the inside, locked the other on the\r\noutside, delivered the key to the Adjutant-General, and proceeded to the\r\nHeadquarters of the Army and addressed the note above mentioned to the\r\nPresident, informing him that he (General Grant) was no longer Secretary\r\nof War _ad interim_.\r\n\r\nThe President expressed great surprise at the course which General\r\nGrant had thought proper to pursue, and, addressing himself to the\r\nGeneral, proceeded to say, in substance, that he had anticipated such\r\naction on the part of the Senate, and, being very desirous to have the\r\nconstitutionality of the tenure-of-office bill tested and his right\r\nto suspend or remove a member of the Cabinet decided by the judicial\r\ntribunals of the country, he had some time ago, and shortly after\r\nGeneral Grant's appointment as Secretary of War _ad interim_, asked the\r\nGeneral what his action would be in the event that the Senate should\r\nrefuse to concur in the suspension of Mr. Stanton, and that the General\r\nhad then agreed either to remain at the head of the War Department till\r\na decision could be obtained from the court or resign the office into\r\nthe hands of the President before the case was acted upon by the Senate,\r\nso as to place the President in the same situation he occupied at the\r\ntime of his (Grant's) appointment.\r\n\r\nThe President further said that the conversation was renewed on the\r\npreceding Saturday, at which time he asked the General what he intended\r\nto do if the Senate should undertake to reinstate Mr. Stanton, in reply\r\nto which the General referred to their former conversation upon the same\r\nsubject and said: \"You understand my position, and my conduct will be\r\nconformable to that understanding;\" that he (the General) then expressed\r\na repugnance to being made a party to a judicial proceeding, saying that\r\nhe would expose himself to fine and imprisonment by doing so, as his\r\ncontinuing to discharge the duties of Secretary of War _ad interim_\r\nafter the Senate should have refused to concur in the suspension of Mr.\r\nStanton would be a violation of the tenure-of-office bill; that in reply\r\nto this he (the President) informed General Grant he had not suspended\r\nMr. Stanton under the tenure-of-office bill, but by virtue of the powers\r\nconferred on him by the Constitution; and that, as to the fine and\r\nimprisonment, he (the President) would pay whatever fine was imposed\r\nand submit to whatever imprisonment might be adjudged against him (the\r\nGeneral); that they continued the conversation for some time, discussing\r\nthe law at length, and that they finally separated without having\r\nreached a definite conclusion, and with the understanding that the\r\nGeneral would see the President again on Monday.\r\n\r\nIn reply General Grant admitted that the conversations had occurred, and\r\nsaid that at the first conversation he had given it as his opinion to\r\nthe President that in the event of nonconcurrence by the Senate in the\r\naction of the President in respect to the Secretary of War the question\r\nwould have to be decided by the court--that Mr. Stanton would have to\r\nappeal to the court to reinstate him in office; that the _ins_ would\r\nremain in till they could be displaced and the _outs_ put in by legal\r\nproceedings; and that he _then_ thought so, and had agreed that if he\r\nshould change his mind he would notify the President in time to enable\r\nhim to make another appointment, but that at the time of the first\r\nconversation he had not looked very closely into the law; that it had\r\nrecently been discussed by the newspapers, and that this had induced him\r\nto examine it more carefully, and that he had come to the conclusion\r\nthat if the Senate should refuse to concur in the suspension Mr. Stanton\r\nwould thereby be reinstated, and that he (Grant) could not continue\r\nthereafter to act as Secretary of War _ad interim_ without subjecting\r\nhimself to fine and imprisonment, and that he came over on Saturday to\r\ninform the President of this change in his views, and did so inform him;\r\nthat the President replied that he had not suspended Mr. Stanton under\r\nthe tenure-of-office bill, but under the Constitution, and had appointed\r\nhim (Grant) by virtue of the authority derived from the Constitution,\r\netc.; that they continued to discuss the matter some time, and finally\r\nhe left, without any conclusion having been reached, expecting to see\r\nthe President again on Monday.\r\n\r\nHe then proceeded to explain why he had not called on the President on\r\nMonday, saying that he had had a long interview with General Sherman,\r\nthat various little matters had occupied his time till it was late, and\r\nthat he did not think the Senate would act so soon, and asked: \"Did not\r\nGeneral Sherman call on you on Monday?\"\r\n\r\nI do not know what passed between the President and General Grant on\r\nSaturday, except as I learned it from the conversation between them at\r\nthe Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, and the foregoing is substantially what\r\nthen occurred. The precise words used on the occasion are not, of\r\ncourse, given exactly in the order in which they were spoken, but the\r\nideas expressed and the facts stated are faithfully preserved and\r\npresented.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, sir, with great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nO.H. BROWNING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, February 6, 1868_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nSIR: The meeting to which you refer in your letter was a regular Cabinet\r\nmeeting. While the members were assembling, and before the President had\r\nentered the council chamber, General Grant on coming in said to me that\r\nhe was in attendance there, not as a member of the Cabinet, but upon\r\ninvitation, and I replied by the inquiry whether there was a change in\r\nthe War Department. After the President had taken his seat, business\r\nwent on in the usual way of hearing matters submitted by the several\r\nSecretaries. When the time came for the Secretary of War, General Grant\r\nsaid that he was now there, not as Secretary of War, but upon the\r\nPresident's invitation; that he had retired from the War Department. A\r\nslight difference then appeared about the supposed invitation, General\r\nGrant saying that the officer who had borne his letter to the President\r\nthat morning announcing his retirement from the War Department had told\r\nhim that the President desired to see him at the Cabinet, to which the\r\nPresident answered that when General Grant's communication was delivered\r\nto him the President simply replied that he supposed General Grant would\r\nbe very soon at the Cabinet meeting. I regarded the conversation thus\r\nbegun as an incidental one. It went on quite informally, and consisted\r\nof a statement on your part of your views in regard to the understanding\r\nof the tenure upon which General Grant had assented to hold the War\r\nDepartment _ad interim_ and of his replies by way of answer and\r\nexplanation. It was respectful and courteous on both sides. Being in\r\nthis conversational form, its details could only have been preserved by\r\nverbatim report. So far as I know, no such report was made at the time.\r\nI can give only the general effect of the conversation. Certainly you\r\nstated that, although you had reported the reasons for Mr. Stanton's\r\nsuspension to the Senate, you nevertheless held that he would not be\r\nentitled to resume the office of Secretary of War even if the Senate\r\nshould disapprove of his suspension, and that you had proposed to have\r\nthe question tested by judicial process, to be applied to the person who\r\nshould be the incumbent of the Department under your designation of\r\nSecretary of War _ad interim_ in the place of Mr. Stanton. You contended\r\nthat this was well understood between yourself and General Grant;\r\nthat when he entered the War Department as Secretary _ad interim_ he\r\nexpressed his concurrence in a belief that the question of Mr. Stanton's\r\nrestoration would be a question for the courts; that in a subsequent\r\nconversation with General Grant you had adverted to the understanding\r\nthus had, and that General Grant expressed his concurrence in it; that\r\nat some conversation which had been previously held General Grant said\r\nhe still adhered to the same construction of the law, but said if he\r\nshould change his opinion he would give you seasonable notice of it,\r\nso that you should in any case be placed in the same position in\r\nregard to the War Department that you were while General Grant held\r\nit _ad interim_. I did not understand General Grant as denying nor as\r\nexplicitly admitting these statements in the form and full extent to\r\nwhich you made them. His admission of them was rather indirect and\r\ncircumstantial, though I did not understand it to be an evasive one.\r\nHe said that, reasoning from what occurred in the case of the police in\r\nMaryland, which he regarded as a parallel one, he was of opinion, and so\r\nassured you, that it would be his right and duty under your instructions\r\nto hold the War Office after the Senate should disapprove of Mr.\r\nStanton's suspension until the question should be decided upon by the\r\ncourts; that he remained until very recently of that opinion, and that\r\non the Saturday before the Cabinet meeting a conversation was held\r\nbetween yourself and him in which the subject was generally discussed.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant's statement was that in that conversation he had stated\r\nto you the legal difficulties which might arise, involving fine and\r\nimprisonment, under the civil-tenure bill, and that he did not care to\r\nsubject himself to those penalties; that you replied to this remark that\r\nyou regarded the civil-tenure bill as unconstitutional and did not think\r\nits penalties were to be feared, or that you would voluntarily assume\r\nthem; and you insisted that General Grant should either retain the\r\noffice until relieved by yourself, according to what you claimed was\r\nthe original understanding between yourself and him, or, by seasonable\r\nnotice of change of purpose on his part, put you in the same situation\r\nwhich you would be if he adhered. You claimed that General Grant finally\r\nsaid in that Saturday's conversation that you understood his views, and\r\nhis proceedings thereafter would be consistent with what had been so\r\nunderstood. General Grant did not controvert, nor can I say that he\r\nadmitted, this last statement. Certainly General Grant did not at\r\nany time in the Cabinet meeting insist that he had in the Saturday's\r\nconversation, either distinctly or finally, advised you of his\r\ndetermination to retire from the charge of the War Department otherwise\r\nthan under your own subsequent direction. He acquiesced in your\r\nstatement that the Saturday's conversation ended with an expectation\r\nthat there would be a subsequent conference on the subject, which he,\r\nas well as yourself, supposed could seasonably take place on Monday.\r\nYou then alluded to the fact that General Grant did not call upon you\r\non Monday, as you had expected from that conversation. General Grant\r\nadmitted that it was his expectation or purpose to call upon you on\r\nMonday. General Grant assigned reasons for the omission. He said he was\r\nin conference with General Sherman; that there were many little matters\r\nto be attended to; he had conversed upon the matter of the incumbency of\r\nthe War Department with General Sherman, and he expected that General\r\nSherman would call upon you on Monday. My own mind suggested a further\r\nexplanation, but I do not remember whether it was mentioned or not,\r\nnamely, that it was not supposed by General Grant on Monday that the\r\nSenate would decide the question so promptly as to anticipate further\r\nexplanation between yourself and him if delayed beyond that day. General\r\nGrant made another explanation--that he was engaged on Sunday with\r\nGeneral Sherman, and I think, also, on Monday, in regard to the War\r\nDepartment matter, with a hope, though he did not say in an effort,\r\nto procure an amicable settlement of the affair of Mr. Stanton, and\r\nhe still hoped that it would be brought about.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nWILLIAM H. SEWARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _February 11, 1868_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe accompanying letter from General Grant, received since the\r\ntransmission to the House of Representatives of my communication of this\r\ndate, is submitted to the House as a part of the correspondence referred\r\nto in the resolution of the 10th instant.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n_Washington, D.C., February 11, 1868_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency A. JOHNSON,\r\n\r\n_President of the United States_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication\r\nof the 10th instant,[46] accompanied by statements of five Cabinet\r\nministers of their recollection of what occurred in Cabinet meeting on\r\nthe 14th of January. Without admitting anything in these statements\r\nwhere they differ from anything heretofore stated by me, I propose to\r\nnotice only that portion of your communication wherein I am charged with\r\ninsubordination. I think it will be plain to the reader of my letter of\r\nthe 30th of January[47] that I did not propose to disobey any legal\r\norder of the President distinctly given, but only gave an interpretation\r\nof what would be regarded as satisfactory evidence of the President's\r\nsanction to orders communicated by the Secretary of War. I will say here\r\nthat your letter of the 10th instant[48] contains the first intimation\r\nI have had that you did not accept that interpretation.\r\n\r\nNow for reasons for giving that interpretation. It was clear to me\r\nbefore my letter of January 30[47] was written that I, the person having\r\nmore public business to transact with the Secretary of War than any\r\nother of the President's subordinates, was the only one who had been\r\ninstructed to disregard the authority of Mr. Stanton where his authority\r\nwas derived as agent of the President.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of January I received a letter from the Secretary of War\r\n(copy herewith) directing me to furnish escort to public treasure from\r\nthe Rio Grande to New Orleans, etc., at the request of the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury to him. I also send two other inclosures, showing\r\nrecognition of Mr. Stanton as Secretary of War by both the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury and the Postmaster-General, in all of which cases the\r\nSecretary of War had to call upon me to make the orders requested or\r\ngive the information desired, and where his authority to do so is\r\nderived, in my view, as agent of the President.\r\n\r\nWith an order so clearly ambiguous as that of the President here\r\nreferred to, it was my duty to inform the President of my interpretation\r\nof it and to abide by that interpretation until I received other orders.\r\n\r\nDisclaiming any intention, now or heretofore, of disobeying any legal\r\norder of the President distinctly communicated,\r\n\r\nI remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT, _General_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: See pp. 603-610.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: See p. 615.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: See pp. 603-605.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n_Washington City, January 27, 1868_.\r\n\r\nGeneral U.S. GRANT,\r\n\r\n_Commanding Army United States_.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: The Secretary of the Treasury has requested this Department\r\nto afford A.F. Randall, special agent of the Treasury Department, such\r\nmilitary aid as may be necessary to secure and forward for deposit\r\nfrom Brownsville, Tex., to New Orleans public moneys in possession of\r\ncustom-house officers at Brownsville, and which are deemed insecure\r\nat that place.\r\n\r\nYou will please give such directions as you may deem proper to the\r\nofficer commanding at Brownsville to carry into effect the request of\r\nthe Treasury Department, the instructions to be sent by telegraph to\r\nGalveston, to the care of A.F. Randall, special agent, who is at\r\nGalveston waiting telegraphic orders, there being no telegraphic\r\ncommunication with Brownsville, and the necessity for military\r\nprotection to the public moneys represented as urgent.\r\n\r\nPlease favor me with a copy of such instructions as you may give, in\r\norder that they may be communicated to the Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nYours, truly,\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT, CONTRACT OFFICE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, February 3, 1868_.\r\n\r\nThe Honorable the SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nSIR: It has been represented to this Department that in October last a\r\nmilitary commission was appointed to settle upon some general plan of\r\ndefense for the Texas frontiers, and that the said commission has made\r\na report recommending a line of posts from the Rio Grande to the Red\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nAn application is now pending in this Department for a change in the\r\ncourse of the San Antonio and El Paso mail, so as to send it by way\r\nof Forts Mason, Griffin, and Stockton instead of Camps Hudson and\r\nLancaster. This application requires immediate decision, but before\r\nfinal action can be had thereon it is desired to have some official\r\ninformation as to the report of the commission above referred to.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I have the honor to request that you will cause this\r\nDepartment to be furnished as early as possible with the information\r\ndesired in the premises, and also with a copy of the report, if any has\r\nbeen made by the commission.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, etc.,\r\n\r\nGEO. W. McCLELLAN,\r\n\r\n_Second Assistant Postmaster-General_.\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 3, 1868.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferred to the General of the Army for report.\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREASURY DEPARTMENT, _January 29, 1868_.\r\n\r\nThe Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nSIR: It is represented to this Department that a band of robbers has\r\nobtained such a foothold in the section of country between Humboldt and\r\nLawrence, Kans., committing depredations upon travelers, both by public\r\nand private conveyance, that the safety of the public money collected by\r\nthe receiver of the land office at Humboldt requires that it should be\r\nguarded during its transit from Humboldt to Lawrence. I have therefore\r\nthe honor to request that the proper commanding officer of the district\r\nmay be instructed by the War Department, if in the opinion of the\r\nhonorable Secretary of War it can be done without prejudice to the\r\npublic interests, to furnish a sufficient military guard to protect such\r\nmoneys as may be _in transitu_ from the above office for the purpose of\r\nbeing deposited to the credit of the Treasurer of the United States. As\r\nfar as we are now advised, such service will not be necessary oftener\r\nthan once a month. Will you please advise me of the action taken, that\r\nI may instruct the receiver and the Commissioner of the General Land\r\nOffice in the matter?\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nH. McCULLOCH,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of the Treasury_.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully referred to the General of the Army to give the necessary\r\norders in this case and to furnish this Department a copy for the\r\ninformation of the Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nBy order of the Secretary of War:\r\n\r\nED. SCHRIVER,\r\n\r\n_Inspector-General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following are inserted because they have direct bearing on the two\r\nmessages from the President of February 11, 1868, and their inclosures.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n_Washington City, February 4, 1868_.\r\n\r\nHon. SCHUYLER COLFAX,\r\n\r\n_Speaker of the House of Representatives_.\r\n\r\nSIR: In answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n3d instant, I transmit herewith copies furnished me by General Grant of\r\ncorrespondence between him and the President relating to the Secretary\r\nof War, and which he reports to be all the correspondence he has had\r\nwith the President on the subject.\r\n\r\nI have had no correspondence with the President since the 12th of August\r\nlast. After the action of the Senate on his alleged reason for my\r\nsuspension from the office of Secretary of War, I resumed the duties of\r\nthat office, as required by the act of Congress, and have continued to\r\ndischarge them without any personal or written communication with the\r\nPresident. No orders have been issued from this Department in the name\r\nof the President with my knowledge, and I have received no orders from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence sent herewith embraces all the correspondence known\r\nto me on the subject referred to in the resolution of the House of\r\nRepresentatives.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, sir, with great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nEDWIN M.

JOHNSON,\r\n\r\n_President of the United States_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor very respectfully to request to have in writing\r\nthe order which the President gave me verbally on Sunday, the 19th\r\ninstant, to disregard the orders of the Hon. E.M. Stanton as Secretary\r\nof War until I knew from the President himself that they were his\r\norders.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT, _General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Grant to the President_.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\n\r\n_Washington, D.C., January 28, 1868_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency A. JOHNSON,\r\n\r\n_President of the United States_.\r\n\r\nSIR: On the 24th instant I requested you to give me in writing the\r\ninstructions which you had previously given me verbally not to obey any\r\norder from Hon. E.M. Stanton, Secretary of War, unless I knew that it\r\ncame from yourself. To this written request I received a message that\r\nhas left doubt in my mind of your intentions. To prevent any possible\r\nmisunderstanding, therefore, I renew the request that you will give me\r\nwritten instructions, and till they are received will suspend action on\r\nyour verbal ones.\r\n\r\nI am compelled to ask these instructions in writing in consequence\r\nof the many and gross misrepresentations affecting my personal honor\r\ncirculated through the press for the last fortnight, purporting to come\r\nfrom the President, of conversations which occurred either with the\r\nPresident privately in his office or in Cabinet meeting. What is written\r\nadmits of no misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nIn view of the misrepresentations referred to, it will be well to state\r\nthe facts in the case.\r\n\r\nSome time after I assumed the duties of Secretary of War _ad interim_\r\nthe President asked me my views as to the course Mr. Stanton would have\r\nto pursue, in case the Senate should not concur in his suspension,\r\nto obtain possession of his office. My reply was, in substance, that\r\nMr. Stanton would have to appeal to the courts to reinstate him,\r\nillustrating my position by citing the ground I had taken in the case\r\nof the Baltimore police commissioners.\r\n\r\nIn that case I did not doubt the technical right of Governor Swann to\r\nremove the old commissioners and to appoint their successors. As the old\r\ncommissioners refused to give up, however, I contended that no resource\r\nwas left but to appeal to the courts.\r\n\r\nFinding that the President was desirous of keeping Mr. Stanton out of\r\noffice, whether sustained in the suspension or not, I stated that I had\r\nnot looked particularly into the tenure-of-office bill, but that what\r\nI had stated was a general principle, and if I should change my mind in\r\nthis particular case I would inform him of the fact.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, on reading the tenure-of-office bill closely, I found that\r\nI could not, without violation of the law, refuse to vacate the office\r\nof Secretary of War the moment Mr. Stanton was reinstated by the Senate,\r\neven though the President should order me to retain it, which he never\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nTaking this view of the subject, and learning on Saturday, the 11th\r\ninstant, that the Senate had taken up the subject of Mr. Stanton's\r\nsuspension, after some conversation with Lieutenant General Sherman and\r\nsome members of my staff, in which I stated that the law left me no\r\ndiscretion as to my action should Mr. Stanton be reinstated, and that I\r\nintended to inform the President, I went to the President for the sole\r\npurpose of making this decision known, and did so make it known.\r\n\r\nIn doing this I fulfilled the promise made in our last preceding\r\nconversation on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe President, however, instead of accepting my view of the requirements\r\nof the tenure-of-office bill, contended that he had suspended Mr.\r\nStanton under the authority given by the Constitution, and that the same\r\nauthority did not preclude him from reporting, as an act of courtesy,\r\nhis reasons for the suspension to the Senate; that, having appointed me\r\nunder the authority given by the Constitution, and not under any act of\r\nCongress, I could not be governed by the act. I stated that the law was\r\nbinding on me, constitutional or not, until set aside by the proper\r\ntribunal. An hour or more was consumed, each reiterating his views on\r\nthis subject, until, getting late, the President said he would see me\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nI did not agree to call again on Monday, nor at any other definite time,\r\nnor was I sent for by the President until the following Tuesday.\r\n\r\nFrom the 11th to the Cabinet meeting on the 14th instant a doubt never\r\nentered my mind about the President's fully understanding my position,\r\nnamely, that if the Senate refused to concur in the suspension of Mr.\r\nStanton my powers as Secretary of War _ad interim_ would cease and Mr.\r\nStanton's right to resume at once the functions of his office would\r\nunder the law be indisputable, and I acted accordingly. With Mr. Stanton\r\nI had no communication, direct nor indirect, on the subject of his\r\nreinstatement during his suspension.\r\n\r\nI knew it had been recommended to the President to send in the\r\nname of Governor Cox, of Ohio, for Secretary of War, and thus save all\r\nembarrassment--a proposition that I sincerely hoped he would entertain\r\nfavorably; General Sherman seeing the President at my particular request\r\nto urge this on the 13th instant.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday (the day Mr. Stanton reentered the office of the Secretary of\r\nWar) General Comstock, who had carried my official letter announcing\r\nthat with Mr. Stanton's reinstatement by the Senate I had ceased to be\r\nSecretary of War _ad interim_, and who saw the President open and read\r\nthe communication, brought back to me from the President a message that\r\nhe wanted to see me that day at the Cabinet meeting, after I had made\r\nknown the fact that I was no longer Secretary of War _ad interim_.\r\n\r\nAt this meeting, after opening it as though I were a member of the\r\nCabinet, when reminded of the notification already given him that I was\r\nno longer Secretary of War _ad interim_, the President gave a version of\r\nthe conversations alluded to already. In this statement it was asserted\r\nthat in both conversations I had agreed to hold on to the office of\r\nSecretary of War until displaced by the courts, or resign, so as to\r\nplace the President where he would have been had I never accepted the\r\noffice. After hearing the President through, I stated our conversations\r\nsubstantially as given in this letter. I will add that my conversation\r\nbefore the Cabinet embraced other matter not pertinent here, and is\r\ntherefore left out.\r\n\r\nI in no wise admitted the correctness of the President's statement of\r\nour conversations, though, to soften the evident contradiction my\r\nstatement gave, I said (alluding to our first conversation on the\r\nsubject) the President might have understood me the way he said, namely,\r\nthat I had promised to resign if I did not resist the reinstatement.\r\nI made no such promise.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT, _General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\n\r\n_January 30, 1868_.\r\n\r\nRespectfully forwarded to the Secretary of War for his information.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT, _General_.\r\n\r\n[Indorsement of the President on General Grant's note of January 24,\r\n1868.[49]]\r\n\r\nJANUARY 29, 1868.\r\n\r\nAs requested in this communication, General Grant is instructed in\r\nwriting not to obey any order from the War Department assumed to be\r\nissued by the direction of the President unless such order is known by\r\nthe General Commanding the armies of the United States to have been\r\nauthorized by the Executive.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: See p. 613.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Grant to the President_.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\n\r\n_Washington, January 30, 1868_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency A.

While this authority to the War Department is\r\nnot countermanded it will be satisfactory evidence to me that any orders\r\nissued from the War Department by direction of the President are\r\nauthorized by the Executive.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT, _General_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: See p. 613.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMY UNITED STATES,\r\n\r\n_January 30, 1868_.\r\n\r\nRespectfully forwarded to the Secretary of War for his information.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT, _General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The President to General Grant_.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 31, 1868_.\r\n\r\nGeneral U.S. GRANT,\r\n\r\n_Commanding United States Armies_.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I have received your communication of the 28th instant,[50]\r\nrenewing your request of the 24th,[49] that I should repeat in a written\r\nform my verbal instructions of the 19th instant, viz, that you obey no\r\norder from the Hon. Edwin M. Stanton as Secretary of War unless you have\r\ninformation that it was issued by the President's directions.\r\n\r\nIn submitting this request (with which I complied on the 29th\r\ninstant[51]) you take occasion to allude to recent publications in\r\nreference to the circumstances connected with the vacation by yourself\r\nof the office of Secretary of War _ad interim_, and with the view of\r\ncorrecting statements which you term \"gross misrepresentations\" give\r\nat length your own recollection of the facts under which, without the\r\nsanction of the President, from whom you had received and accepted the\r\nappointment, you yielded the Department of War to the present incumbent.\r\n\r\nAs stated in your communication, some time after you had assumed the\r\nduties of Secretary of War _ad interim_ we interchanged views respecting\r\nthe course that should be pursued in the event of nonconcurrence by the\r\nSenate in the suspension from office of Mr. Stanton. I sought that\r\ninterview, calling myself at the War Department. My sole object in then\r\nbringing the subject to your attention was to ascertain definitely\r\nwhat would be your own action should such an attempt be made for his\r\nrestoration to the War Department. That object was accomplished, for\r\nthe interview terminated with the distinct understanding that if upon\r\nreflection you should prefer not to become a party to the controversy or\r\nshould conclude that it would be your duty to surrender the Department\r\nto Mr. Stanton upon action in his favor by the Senate you were to return\r\nthe office to me prior to a decision by the Senate, in order that if I\r\ndesired to do so I might designate someone to succeed you. It must have\r\nbeen apparent to you that had not this understanding been reached it was\r\nmy purpose to relieve you from the further discharge of the duties of\r\nSecretary of War _ad interim_ and to appoint some other person in that\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\nOther conversations upon this subject ensued, all of them having on my\r\npart the same object and leading to the same conclusion as the first.\r\nIt is not necessary, however, to refer to any of them excepting that of\r\nSaturday, the 11th instant, mentioned in your communication. As it was\r\nthen known that the Senate had proceeded to consider the case of Mr.\r\nStanton, I was anxious to learn your determination. After a protracted\r\ninterview, during which the provisions of the tenure-of-office bill were\r\nfreely discussed, you said that, as had been agreed upon in our first\r\nconference, you would either return the office to my possession in time\r\nto enable me to appoint a successor before final action by the Senate\r\nupon Mr. Stanton's suspension, or would remain as its head, awaiting a\r\ndecision of the question by judicial proceedings. It was then understood\r\nthat there would be a further conference on Monday, by which time I\r\nsupposed you would be prepared to inform me of your final decision. You\r\nfailed, however, to fulfill the engagement, and on Tuesday notified me\r\nin writing of the receipt by you of official notification of the action\r\nof the Senate in the case of Mr. Stanton, and at the same time informed\r\nme that according to the act regulating the tenure of certain civil\r\noffices your functions as Secretary of War _ad interim_ ceased from\r\nthe moment of the receipt of the notice. You thus, in disregard of the\r\nunderstanding between us, vacated the office without having given me\r\nnotice of your intention to do so. It is but just, however, to say that\r\nin your communication you claim that you did inform me of your purpose,\r\nand thus \"fulfilled the promise made in our last preceding conversation\r\non this subject.\" The fact that such a promise existed is evidence of\r\nan arrangement of the kind I have mentioned. You had found in our first\r\nconference \"that the President was desirous of keeping Mr. Stanton out\r\nof office whether sustained in the suspension or not.\" You knew what\r\nreasons had induced the President to ask from you a promise; you\r\nalso knew that in case your views of duty did not accord with his\r\nown convictions it was his purpose to fill your place by another\r\nappointment. Even ignoring the existence of a positive understanding\r\nbetween us, these conclusions were plainly deducible from our various\r\nconversations. It is certain, however, that even under these\r\ncircumstances you did not offer to return the place to my possession,\r\nbut, according to your own statement, placed yourself in a position\r\nwhere, could I have anticipated your action, I would have been compelled\r\nto ask of you, as I was compelled to ask of your predecessor in the War\r\nDepartment, a letter of resignation, or else to resort to the more\r\ndisagreeable expedient of suspending you by a successor.\r\n\r\nAs stated in your letter, the nomination of Governor Cox, of Ohio, for\r\nthe office of Secretary of War was suggested to me. His appointment as\r\nMr. Stanton's successor was urged in your name, and it was said that\r\nhis selection would save further embarrassment. I did not think that\r\nin the selection of a Cabinet officer I should be trammeled by such\r\nconsiderations. I was prepared to take the responsibility of deciding\r\nthe question in accordance with my ideas of constitutional duty, and,\r\nhaving determined upon a course which I deemed right and proper, was\r\nanxious to learn the steps you would take should the possession of the\r\nWar Department be demanded by Mr. Stanton. Had your action been in\r\nconformity to the understanding between us, I do not believe that the\r\nembarrassment would have attained its present proportions or that the\r\nprobability of its repetition would have been so great.\r\n\r\nI know that, with a view to an early termination of a state of affairs\r\nso detrimental to the public interests, you voluntarily offered, both on\r\nWednesday, the 15th instant, and on the succeeding Sunday, to call upon\r\nMr. Stanton and urge upon him that the good of the service required his\r\nresignation. I confess that I considered your proposal as a sort of\r\nreparation for the failure on your part to act in accordance with an\r\nunderstanding more than once repeated, which I thought had received your\r\nfull assent, and under which you could have returned to me the office\r\nwhich I had conferred upon you, thus saving yourself from embarrassment\r\nand leaving the responsibility where it properly belonged--with the\r\nPresident, who is accountable for the faithful execution of the laws.\r\n\r\nI have not yet been informed by you whether, as twice proposed by\r\nyourself, you have called upon Mr. Stanton and made an effort to induce\r\nhim voluntarily to retire from the War Department.\r\n\r\nYou conclude your communication with a reference to our conversation at\r\nthe meeting of the Cabinet held on Tuesday, the 14th instant. In your\r\naccount of what then occurred you say that after the President had given\r\nhis version of our previous conversations you stated them substantially\r\nas given in your letter; that you in no wise admitted the correctness of\r\nhis statement of them, \"though, to soften the evident contradiction my\r\nstatement gave, I said (alluding to our first conversation on the\r\nsubject) the President might have understood me the way he said, namely,\r\nthat I had promised to resign if I did not resist the reinstatement.\r\nI made no such promise.\"\r\n\r\nMy recollection of what then transpired is diametrically the reverse of\r\nyour narration. In the presence of the Cabinet I asked you--\r\n\r\nFirst. If, in a conversation which took place shortly after your\r\nappointment as Secretary of War _ad interim_, you did not agree either\r\nto remain at the head of the War Department and abide any judicial\r\nproceedings that might follow nonconcurrence by the Senate in Mr.\r\nStanton's suspension, or, should you wish not to become involved in such\r\na controversy, to put me in the same position with respect to the office\r\nas I occupied previous to your appointment, by returning it to me in\r\ntime to anticipate such action by the Senate. This you admitted.\r\n\r\nSecond. I then asked you if, at our conference on the preceding\r\nSaturday, I had not, to avoid misunderstanding, requested you to state\r\nwhat you intended to do, and, further, if in reply to that inquiry you\r\nhad not referred to our former conversations, saying that from them I\r\nunderstood your position, and that your action would be consistent with\r\nthe understanding which had been reached. To these questions you also\r\nreplied in the affirmative.\r\n\r\nThird. I next asked if at the conclusion of our interview on Saturday\r\nit was not understood that we were to have another conference on Monday\r\nbefore final action by the Senate in the case of Mr. Stanton. You\r\nreplied that such was the understanding, but that you did not suppose\r\nthe Senate would act so soon; that on Monday you had been engaged in a\r\nconference with General Sherman and were occupied with \"many little\r\nmatters,\" and asked if General Sherman had not called on that day. What\r\nrelevancy General Sherman's visit to me on Monday had with the purpose\r\nfor which you were then to have called I am at a loss to perceive,\r\nas he certainly did not inform me whether you had determined to retain\r\npossession of the office or to afford me an opportunity to appoint a\r\nsuccessor in advance of any attempted reinstatement of Mr. Stanton.\r\n\r\nThis account of what passed between us at the Cabinet meeting on the\r\n14th instant widely differs from that contained in your communication,\r\nfor it shows that instead of having \"stated our conversations as given\r\nin the letter\" which has made this reply necessary you admitted that my\r\nrecital of them was entirely accurate. Sincerely anxious, however, to\r\nbe correct in my statements, I have to-day read this narration of what\r\noccurred on the 14th instant to the members of the Cabinet who were then\r\npresent. They, without exception, agree in its accuracy.\r\n\r\nIt is only necessary to add that on Wednesday morning, the 15th instant,\r\nyou called on me, in company with Lieutenant-General Sherman. After some\r\npreliminary conversation, you remarked that an article in the National\r\nIntelligencer of that date did you much injustice. I replied that I had\r\nnot read the Intelligencer of that morning. You then first told me that\r\nit was your intention to urge Mr. Stanton to resign his office.\r\n\r\nAfter you had withdrawn I carefully read the article of which you had\r\nspoken, and found that its statements of the understanding between us\r\nwere substantially correct. On the 17th I caused it to be read to four\r\nof the five members of the Cabinet who were present at our conference on\r\nthe 14th, and they concurred in the general accuracy of its statements\r\nrespecting our conversation upon that occasion.\r\n\r\nIn reply to your communication, I have deemed it proper, in order to\r\nprevent further misunderstanding, to make this simple recital of facts.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, yours,\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: See p. 613.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: See pp. 613-615.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: See p. 615.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Grant to the President_.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\n\r\n_Washington, D.C., February 3, 1868_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency A. JOHNSON,\r\n\r\n_President of the United States_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication\r\nof the 31st ultimo,[52] in answer to mine of the 28th ultimo[53]. After\r\na careful reading and comparison of it with the article in the National\r\nIntelligencer of the 15th ultimo and the article over the initials\r\nJ.B.S. in the New York World of the 27th ultimo, purporting to be based\r\nupon your statement and that of the members of your Cabinet therein\r\nnamed, I find it to be but a reiteration, only somewhat more in detail,\r\nof the \"many and gross misrepresentations\" contained in these articles,\r\nand which my statement of the facts set forth in my letter of the 28th\r\nultimo[53] was intended to correct; and I here reassert the correctness\r\nof my statements in that letter, anything in yours in reply to it to the\r\ncontrary notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nI confess my surprise that the Cabinet officers referred to should so\r\ngreatly misapprehend the facts in the matter of admissions alleged to\r\nhave been made by me at the Cabinet meeting of the 14th ultimo as to\r\nsuffer their names to be made the basis of the charges in the newspaper\r\narticle referred to, or agree in the accuracy, as you affirm they do,\r\nof your account of what occurred at that meeting.\r\n\r\nYou know that we parted on Saturday, the 11th ultimo, without any\r\npromise on my part, either express or implied, to the effect that I\r\nwould hold on to the office of Secretary of War _ad interim_ against the\r\naction of the Senate, or, declining to do so myself, would surrender it\r\nto you before such action was had, or that I would see you again at any\r\nfixed time on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe performance of the promises alleged by you to have been made by me\r\nwould have involved a resistance to law and an inconsistency with the\r\nwhole history of my connection with the suspension of Mr. Stanton.\r\n\r\nFrom our conversations and my written protest of August 1, 1867,\r\nagainst the removal of Mr. Stanton, you must have known that my greatest\r\nobjection to his removal or suspension was the fear that someone would\r\nbe appointed in his stead who would, by opposition to the laws relating\r\nto the restoration of the Southern States to their proper relations\r\nto the Government, embarrass the Army in the performance of duties\r\nespecially imposed upon it by these laws; and it was to prevent such an\r\nappointment that I accepted the office of Secretary of War _ad interim_,\r\nand not for the purpose of enabling you to get rid of Mr. Stanton by my\r\nwithholding it from him in opposition to law, or, not doing so myself,\r\nsurrendering it to one who would, as the statement and assumptions in\r\nyour communication plainly indicate was sought. And it was to avoid this\r\nsame danger, as well as to relieve you from the personal embarrassment\r\nin which Mr. Stanton's reinstatement would place you, that I urged the\r\nappointment of Governor Cox, believing that it would be agreeable to you\r\nand also to Mr. Stanton, satisfied as I was that it was the good of the\r\ncountry, and not the office, the latter desired.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th ultimo, in presence of General Sherman, I stated to you that\r\nI thought Mr. Stanton would resign, but did not say that I would advise\r\nhim to do so. On the 18th I did agree with General Sherman to go and\r\nadvise him to that course, and on the 19th I had an interview alone with\r\nMr. Stanton, which led me to the conclusion that any advice to him of\r\nthe kind would be useless, and I so informed General Sherman.\r\n\r\nBefore I consented to advise Mr. Stanton to resign, I understood\r\nfrom him, in a conversation on the subject immediately after his\r\nreinstatement, that it was his opinion that the act of Congress entitled\r\n\"An act temporarily to supply vacancies in the Executive Departments in\r\ncertain cases,\" approved February 20, 1863, was repealed by subsequent\r\nlegislation, which materially influenced my action. Previous to this\r\ntime I had had no doubt that the law of 1863 was still in force, and,\r\nnotwithstanding my action, a fuller examination of the law leaves a\r\nquestion in my mind whether it is or is not repealed. This being the\r\ncase, I could not now advise his resignation, lest the same danger\r\nI apprehended on his first removal might follow.\r\n\r\nThe course you would have it understood I agreed to pursue was in\r\nviolation of law and without orders from you, while the course I did\r\npursue, and which I never doubted you fully understood, was in\r\naccordance with law and not in disobedience of any orders of my\r\nsuperior.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Mr. President, when my honor as a soldier and integrity as a\r\nman have been so violently assailed, pardon me for saying that I can but\r\nregard this whole matter, from the beginning to the end, as an attempt\r\nto involve me in the resistance of law, for which you hesitated to\r\nassume the responsibility in orders, and thus to destroy my character\r\nbefore the country. I am in a measure confirmed in this conclusion by\r\nyour recent orders directing me to disobey orders from the Secretary of\r\nWar, my superior and your subordinate, without having countermanded his\r\nauthority to issue the orders I am to disobey.\r\n\r\nWith the assurance, Mr. President, that nothing less than a vindication\r\nof my personal honor and character could have induced this\r\ncorrespondence on my part,\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT, _General_.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully forwarded to the Secretary of War for his information, and\r\nto be made a part of correspondence previously furnished on same subject.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT, _General_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: See pp. 615-618.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: See pp. 613-615.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 17, 1868_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn reply to the resolution adopted by the House of Representatives on\r\nthe 19th of December last, calling for correspondence and information\r\nin relation to Russian America, I transmit reports and accompanying\r\ndocuments from the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 18, 1868_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 17th of\r\nJanuary last, calling for information in regard to the execution of the\r\ntreaty of 1858 with China, for the settlement of claims, I transmit a\r\nreport of the Secretary of State and the papers which accompany it.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _February 19, 1868_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Attorney-General, prepared in\r\ncompliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n26th November, 1867, requesting a list of all pardons \"granted since\r\nthe 14th day of April, 1865, to any person or persons charged with or\r\nconvicted of making or passing counterfeit money, or having counterfeit\r\nmoney or tools or instruments for making the same in his or their\r\npossession, or charged with or convicted of the crime of forgery or\r\ncriminal alteration of papers, accounts, or other documents, or of the\r\ncrime of perjury, and that such list be accompanied by a particular\r\nstatement in each case of the reasons or grounds of the pardon, with a\r\ndisclosure of the names of persons, if any, who recommended or advised\r\nthe same.\"\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _February 19, 1868_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Attorney-General, prepared in\r\ncompliance with a resolution adopted by the Senate on the 2d day of\r\nDecember last, requesting \"a full list of the names of all persons\r\npardoned by the President since May 1, 1865, who have been convicted of\r\ncounterfeiting United States bonds, greenbacks, national-bank currency,\r\nfractional currency, or the coin of the United States, with the date of\r\nissuing each pardon, reasons for issuing it, and by whom recommended.\"\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 20, 1868_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to a resolution of the Senate of the 18th of December last,\r\nrequesting information in regard to the island of San Juan, on Puget\r\nSound, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State and the papers\r\nwhich accompanied it.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 20, 1868_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nWith reference to the convention between Denmark and the United States\r\nconcluded on the 24th of October last, I transmit to the Senate a copy\r\nin translation of a note of the 19th instant addressed to the Secretary\r\nof State by His Danish Majesty's chargé d'affaires, announcing the\r\nratification of the convention by the Government of Denmark and stating\r\nhis readiness to proceed with the customary exchange of ratifications.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 21, 1868_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a communication from the Chief of the Engineer Corps\r\nof the Army, accompanied by a report, in reference to ship canals around\r\nthe Falls of the Ohio River, called for by the resolution of the House\r\nof Representatives of the 18th instant.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _February 21, 1868_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nOn the 12th day of August, 1867, by virtue of the power and authority\r\nvested in the President by the Constitution and laws of the United\r\nStates, I suspended Edwin M. Stanton from the office of Secretary of\r\nWar.\r\n\r\nIn further exercise of the power and authority so vested in the\r\nPresident, I have this day removed Mr. Stanton from office and\r\ndesignated the Adjutant-General of the Army to act as Secretary\r\nof War _ad interim_.\r\n\r\nCopies of the communications upon this subject addressed to Mr. Stanton\r\nand the Adjutant-General are herewith transmitted for the information of\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _February 22, 1868_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have received a copy of the resolution adopted by the Senate on the\r\n21st instant, as follows:\r\n\r\n  Whereas the Senate have received and considered the communication of\r\n  the President stating that he had removed Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary\r\n  of War, and had designated the Adjutant-General of the Army to act as\r\n  Secretary of War _ad interim_: Therefore,\r\n\r\n  _Resolved by the Senate of the United States_, That under the\r\n  Constitution and laws of the United States the President has no power\r\n  to remove the Secretary of War and designate any other officer to\r\n  perform the duties of that office _ad interim_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis resolution is confined to the power of the President to remove the\r\nSecretary of War and to designate another officer to perform the duties\r\nof the office _ad interim_, and by its preamble is made expressly\r\napplicable to the removal of Mr. Stanton and the designation to act\r\n_ad interim_ of the Adjutant-General of the Army. Without, therefore,\r\nattempting to discuss the general power of removal as to all officers,\r\nupon which subject no expression of opinion is contained in the\r\nresolution, I shall confine myself to the question as thus limited--the\r\npower to remove the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nIt is declared in the resolution--\r\n\r\n  That under the Constitution and laws of the United States the President\r\n  has no power to remove the Secretary of War and designate any other\r\n  officer to perform the duties of that office _ad interim_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to the question of power under the Constitution, I do not propose at\r\npresent to enter upon its discussion.\r\n\r\nThe uniform practice from the beginning of the Government, as\r\nestablished by every President who has exercised the office, and the\r\ndecisions of the Supreme Court of the United States have settled the\r\nquestion in favor of the power of the President to remove all officers\r\nexcepting a class holding appointments of a judicial character. No\r\npractice nor any decision has ever excepted a Secretary of War from this\r\ngeneral power of the President to make removals from office.\r\n\r\nIt is only necessary, then, that I should refer to the power of the\r\nExecutive, under the laws of the United States, to remove from office a\r\nSecretary of War. The resolution denies that under these laws this power\r\nhas any existence. In other words, it affirms that no such authority is\r\nrecognized or given by the statutes of the country.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are the laws of the United States which deny the President\r\nthe power to remove that officer? I know but two laws which bear upon\r\nthis question. The first in order of time is the act of August 7, 1789,\r\ncreating the Department of War, which, after providing for a Secretary\r\nas its principal officer, proceeds as follows:\r\n\r\n  SEC. 2. _And be it further enacted_, That there shall be in the said\r\n  Department an inferior officer, to be appointed by the said principal\r\n  officer, to be employed therein as he shall deem proper, and to be\r\n  called the chief clerk in the Department of War, and who, whenever the\r\n  said principal officer shall be removed from office by the President of\r\n  the United States, or in any other case of vacancy, shall during such\r\n  vacancy have the charge and custody of all records, books, and papers\r\n  appertaining to the said Department.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is clear that this act, passed by a Congress many of whose members\r\nparticipated in the formation of the Constitution, so far from denying\r\nthe power of the President to remove the Secretary of War, recognizes\r\nit as existing in the Executive alone, without the concurrence of the\r\nSenate or of any other department of the Government. Furthermore, this\r\nact does not purport to confer the power by legislative authority, nor\r\nin fact was there any other existing legislation through which it was\r\nbestowed upon the Executive. The recognition of the power by this act is\r\ntherefore complete as a recognition under the Constitution itself, for\r\nthere was no other source or authority from which it could be derived.\r\n\r\nThe other act which refers to this question is that regulating the\r\ntenure of certain civil offices, passed by Congress on the 2d day of\r\nMarch, 1867. The first section of that act is in the following words:\r\n\r\n  That every person holding any civil office to which he has been\r\n  appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and every\r\n  person who shall hereafter be appointed to any such office, and shall\r\n  become duly qualified to act therein, is and shall be entitled to hold\r\n  such office until a successor shall have been in like manner appointed\r\n  and duly qualified, except as herein otherwise provided: _Provided_,\r\n  That the Secretaries of State, of the Treasury, of War, of the Navy,\r\n  and of the Interior, the Postmaster-General, and the Attorney-General\r\n  shall hold their offices, respectively, for and during the term of\r\n  the President by whom they may have been appointed and for one month\r\n  thereafter, subject to removal by and with the advice and consent of\r\n  the Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fourth section of the same act restricts the term of offices to the\r\nlimit prescribed by the law creating them.\r\n\r\nThat part of the first section which precedes the proviso declares that\r\nevery person holding a civil office to which he has been or may be\r\nappointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate shall hold\r\nsuch office until a successor shall have been in like manner appointed.\r\nIt purports to take from the Executive, during the fixed time\r\nestablished for the tenure of the office, the independent power of\r\nremoval, and to require for such removal the concurrent action of the\r\nPresident and the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe proviso that follows proceeds to fix the term of office of the seven\r\nheads of Departments, whose tenure never had been defined before, by\r\nprescribing that they \"shall hold their offices, respectively, for and\r\nduring the term of the President by whom they may have been appointed\r\nand for one month thereafter, subject to removal by and with the advice\r\nand consent of the Senate.\"\r\n\r\nThus, as to these enumerated officers, the proviso takes from the\r\nPresident the power of removal except with the advice and consent of the\r\nSenate. By its terms, however, before he can be deprived of the power to\r\ndisplace them it must appear that he himself has appointed them. It is\r\nonly in that case that they have any tenure of office or any independent\r\nright to hold during the term of the President and for one month after\r\nthe cessation of his official functions. The proviso, therefore, gives\r\nno tenure of office to any one of these officers who has been appointed\r\nby a former President beyond one month after the accession of his\r\nsuccessor.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Mr. Stanton, the only appointment under which he\r\nheld the office of Secretary of War was that conferred upon him by my\r\nimmediate predecessor, with the advice and consent of the Senate. He has\r\nnever held from me any appointment as the head of the War Department.\r\nWhatever right he had to hold the office was derived from that original\r\nappointment and my own sufferance. The law was not intended to protect\r\nsuch an incumbent of the War Department by taking from the President the\r\npower to remove him. This, in my judgment, is perfectly clear, and the\r\nlaw itself admits of no other just construction. We find in all that\r\nportion of the first section which precedes the proviso that as to civil\r\nofficers generally the President is deprived of the power of removal,\r\nand it is plain that if there had been no proviso that power would just\r\nas clearly have been taken from him so far as it applies to the seven\r\nheads of Departments. But for reasons which were no doubt satisfactory\r\nto Congress these principal officers were specially provided for, and as\r\nto them the express and only requirement is that the President who has\r\nappointed them shall not without the advice and consent of the Senate\r\nremove them from office. The consequence is that as to my Cabinet,\r\nembracing the seven officers designated in the first section, the act\r\ntakes from me the power, without the concurrence of the Senate, to\r\nremove any one of them that I have appointed, but it does not protect\r\nsuch of them as I did not appoint, nor give to them any tenure of office\r\nbeyond my pleasure.\r\n\r\nAn examination of this act, then, shows that while in one part of the\r\nsection provision is made for officers generally, in another clause\r\nthere is a class of officers, designated by their official titles, who\r\nare excepted from the general terms of the law, and in reference to whom\r\na clear distinction is made as to the general power of removal limited\r\nin the first clause of the section.\r\n\r\nThis distinction is that as to such of these enumerated officers as hold\r\nunder the appointment of the President the power of removal can only be\r\nexercised by him with the consent of the Senate, while as to those who\r\nhave not been appointed by him there is no like denial of his power to\r\ndisplace them. It would be a violation of the plain meaning of this\r\nenactment to place Mr. Stanton upon the same footing as those heads of\r\nDepartments who have been appointed by myself. As to him, this law gives\r\nhim no tenure of office. The members of my Cabinet who have been\r\nappointed by me are by this act entitled to hold for one month after the\r\nterm of my office shall cease; but Mr. Stanton could not, against the\r\nwishes of my successor, hold a moment thereafter. If he were permitted\r\nby that successor to hold for the first two weeks, would that successor\r\nhave no power to remove him? But the power of my successor over him\r\ncould be no greater than my own. If my successor would have the power to\r\nremove Mr. Stanton after permitting him to remain a period of two weeks,\r\nbecause he was not appointed by him, but by his predecessor, I, who have\r\ntolerated Mr. Stanton for more than two years, certainly have the same\r\nright to remove him, and upon the same ground, namely, that he was not\r\nappointed by me, but by my predecessor.\r\n\r\nUnder this construction of the tenure-of-office act, I have never\r\ndoubted my power to remove Mr. Stanton.\r\n\r\nWhether the act were constitutional or not, it was always my opinion\r\nthat it did not secure him from removal. I was, however, aware that\r\nthere were doubts as to the construction of the law, and from the first\r\nI deemed it desirable that at the earliest possible moment those doubts\r\nshould be settled and the true construction of the act fixed by decision\r\nof the Supreme Court of the United States. My order of suspension in\r\nAugust last was intended to place the case in such a position as would\r\nmake a resort to a judicial decision both necessary and proper. My\r\nunderstanding and wishes, however, under that order of suspension were\r\nfrustrated, and the late order for Mr. Stanton's removal was a further\r\nstep toward the accomplishment of that purpose.\r\n\r\nI repeat that my own convictions as to the true construction of the law\r\nand as to its constitutionality were well settled and were sustained\r\nby every member of my Cabinet, including Mr. Stanton himself. Upon the\r\nquestion of constitutionality, each one in turn deliberately advised me\r\nthat the tenure-of-office act was unconstitutional. Upon the question\r\nwhether, as to those members who were appointed by my predecessor,\r\nthat act took from me the power to remove them, one of those members\r\nemphatically stated in the presence of the others sitting in Cabinet\r\nthat they did not come within the provisions of the act, and it was\r\nno protection to them. No one dissented from this construction, and\r\nI understood them all to acquiesce in its correctness. In a matter of\r\nsuch grave consequence I was not disposed to rest upon my own opinions,\r\nthough fortified by my constitutional advisers. I have therefore sought\r\nto bring the question at as early a day as possible before the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States for final and authoritative decision.\r\n\r\nIn respect to so much of the resolution as relates to the designation\r\nof an officer to act as Secretary of War _ad interim_, I have only to\r\nsay that I have exercised this power under the provisions of the first\r\nsection of the act of February 13, 1795, which, so far as they are\r\napplicable to vacancies caused by removals, I understand to be still\r\nin force.\r\n\r\nThe legislation upon the subject of _ad interim_ appointments in the\r\nExecutive Departments stands, as to the War Office, as follows:\r\n\r\nThe second section of the act of the 7th of August, 1789, makes\r\nprovision for a vacancy in the very case of a removal of the head of the\r\nWar Department, and upon such a vacancy gives the charge and custody\r\nof the records, books, and papers to the chief clerk. Next, by the act\r\nof the 8th of May, 1792, section 8, it is provided that in case of a\r\nvacancy occasioned by death, absence from the seat of Government, or\r\nsickness of the head of the War Department the President may authorize\r\na person to perform the duties of the office until a successor is\r\nappointed or the disability removed. The act, it will be observed, does\r\nnot provide for the case of a vacancy caused by removal. Then, by the\r\nfirst section of the act of February 13, 1795, it is provided that in\r\ncase of any vacancy the President may appoint a person to perform the\r\nduties while the vacancy exists.\r\n\r\nThese acts are followed by that of the 20th of February, 1863, by the\r\nfirst section of which provision is again made for a vacancy caused by\r\ndeath, resignation, absence from the seat of Government, or sickness of\r\nthe head of any Executive Department of the Government, and upon the\r\noccurrence of such a vacancy power is given to the President--\r\n\r\n  to authorize the head of any other Executive Department, or other\r\n  officer in either of said Departments whose appointment is vested in\r\n  the President, at his discretion, to perform the duties of the said\r\n  respective offices until a successor be appointed or until such absence\r\n  or inability by sickness shall cease: _Provided_, That no one vacancy\r\n  shall be supplied in manner aforesaid for a longer term than six months.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis law, with some modifications, reenacts the act of 1792, and\r\nprovides, as did that act, for the sort of vacancies so to be filled;\r\nbut, like the act of 1792, it makes no provision for a vacancy\r\noccasioned by removal. It has reference altogether to vacancies arising\r\nfrom other causes.\r\n\r\nAccording to my construction of the act of 1863, while it impliedly\r\nrepeals the act of 1792 regulating the vacancies therein described, it\r\nhas no bearing whatever upon so much of the act of 1795 as applies to a\r\nvacancy caused by removal. The act of 1795 therefore furnishes the rule\r\nfor a vacancy occasioned by removal--one of the vacancies expressly\r\nreferred to in the act of the 7th of August, 1789, creating the\r\nDepartment of War. Certainly there is no express repeal by the act of\r\n1863 of the act of 1795. The repeal, if there is any, is by implication,\r\nand can only be admitted so far as there is a clear inconsistency\r\nbetween the two acts. The act of 1795 is inconsistent with that of 1863\r\nas to a vacancy occasioned by death, resignation, absence, or sickness,\r\nbut not at all inconsistent as to a vacancy caused by removal.\r\n\r\nIt is assuredly proper that the President should have the same power to\r\nfill temporarily a vacancy occasioned by removal as he has to supply\r\na place made vacant by death or the expiration of a term. If, for\r\ninstance, the incumbent of an office should be found to be wholly unfit\r\nto exercise its functions, and the public service should require his\r\nimmediate expulsion, a remedy should exist and be at once applied, and\r\ntime be allowed the President to select and appoint a successor, as is\r\npermitted him in case of a vacancy caused by death or the termination of\r\nan official term.\r\n\r\nThe necessity, therefore, for an _ad interim_ appointment is just as\r\ngreat, and, indeed, may be greater in cases of removal than in any\r\nothers. Before it be held, therefore, that the power given by the act\r\nof 1795 in cases of removal is abrogated by succeeding legislation an\r\nexpress repeal ought to appear. So wholesome a power should certainly\r\nnot be taken away by loose implication.\r\n\r\nIt may be, however, that in this, as in other cases of implied repeal,\r\ndoubts may arise. It is confessedly one of the most subtle and debatable\r\nquestions which arise in the construction of statutes. If upon such a\r\nquestion I have fallen into an erroneous construction, I submit whether\r\nit should be characterized as a violation of official duty and of law.\r\n\r\nI have deemed it proper, in vindication of the course which I have\r\nconsidered it my duty to take, to place before the Senate the reasons\r\nupon which I have based my action. Although I have been advised by\r\nevery member of my Cabinet that the entire tenure-of-office act is\r\nunconstitutional, and therefore void, and although I have expressly\r\nconcurred in that opinion in the veto message which I had the honor\r\nto submit to Congress when I returned the bill for reconsideration,\r\nI have refrained from making a removal of any officer contrary to the\r\nprovisions of the law, and have only exercised that power in the case of\r\nMr. Stanton, which, in my judgment, did not come within its provisions.\r\nI have endeavored to proceed with the greatest circumspection, and have\r\nacted only in an extreme and exceptional case, carefully following the\r\ncourse which I have marked out for myself as a general rule, faithfully\r\nto execute all laws, though passed over my objections on the score of\r\nconstitutionality. In the present instance I have appealed, or sought\r\nto appeal, to that final arbiter fixed by the Constitution for the\r\ndetermination of all such questions. To this course I have been impelled\r\nby the solemn obligations which rest upon me to sustain inviolate the\r\npowers of the high office committed to my hands.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the consequences merely personal to myself, I could not\r\nallow them to prevail against a public duty so clear to my own mind, and\r\nso imperative. If what was possible had been certain, if I had been\r\nfully advised when I removed Mr. Stanton that in thus defending the\r\ntrust committed to my hands my own removal was sure to follow, I could\r\nnot have hesitated. Actuated by public considerations of the highest\r\ncharacter, I earnestly protest against the resolution of the Senate\r\nwhich charges me in what I have done with a violation of the\r\nConstitution and laws of the United States.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 25, 1868_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn further answer of the resolution of the Senate of the 13th of January\r\nlast, relative to the appointment of the Hon.

Under all circumstances the result of their\r\nlabors was as near an approximation to perfection as was compatible\r\nwith the fallibility of man. Such being the estimation in which the\r\nConstitution is and has ever been held by our countrymen, it is not\r\nsurprising that any proposition for its alteration or amendment should\r\nbe received with reluctance and distrust. While this sentiment deserves\r\ncommendation and encouragement as a useful preventive of unnecessary\r\nattempt to change its provisions, it must be conceded that time has\r\ndeveloped imperfections and omissions in the Constitution, the\r\nreformation of which has been demanded by the best interests of the\r\ncountry. Some of these have been remedied in the manner provided in\r\nthe Constitution itself. There are others which, although heretofore\r\nbrought to the attention of the people, have never been so presented\r\nas to enable the popular judgment to determine whether they should\r\nbe corrected by means of additional amendments. My object in this\r\ncommunication is to suggest certain defects in the Constitution which\r\nseem to me to require correction, and to recommend that the judgment\r\nof the people be taken on the amendments proposed.\r\n\r\nThe first of the defects to which I desire to direct attention is in\r\nthat clause of the Constitution which provides for the election of\r\nPresident and Vice-President through the intervention of electors, and\r\nnot by an immediate vote of the people. The importance of so amending\r\nthis clause as to secure to the people the election of President and\r\nVice-President by their direct votes was urged with great earnestness\r\nand ability by President Jackson in his first annual message, and the\r\nrecommendation was repeated in five of his subsequent communications to\r\nCongress, extending through the eight years of his Administration. In\r\nhis message of 1829 he said:\r\n\r\n  To the people belongs the right of electing their Chief Magistrate; it\r\n  was never designed that their choice should in any case be defeated,\r\n  either by the intervention of electoral colleges or by the agency\r\n  confided, under certain contingencies, to the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe then proceeded to state the objections to an election of President\r\nby the House of Representatives, the most important of which was that\r\nthe choice of a clear majority of the people might be easily defeated.\r\nHe then closed the argument with the following communication:\r\n\r\n  I would therefore recommend such an amendment of the Constitution as\r\n  may remove all intermediate agency in the election of the President and\r\n  Vice-President. The mode may be so regulated as to preserve to each\r\n  State its present relative weight in the election, and a failure in the\r\n  first attempt may be provided for by confining the second to a choice\r\n  between the two highest candidates. In connection with such an amendment\r\n  it would seem advisable to limit the service of the Chief Magistrate to\r\n  a single term of either four or six years. If, however, it should not be\r\n  adopted, it is worthy of consideration whether a provision disqualifying\r\n  for office the Representatives in Congress on whom such an election may\r\n  have devolved would not be proper.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough this recommendation was repeated with undiminished\r\nearnestness in several of his succeeding messages, yet the proposed\r\namendment was never adopted and submitted to the people by Congress. The\r\ndanger of a defeat of the people's choice in an election by the House of\r\nRepresentatives remains unprovided for in the Constitution, and would\r\nbe greatly increased if the House of Representatives should assume the\r\npower arbitrarily to reject the votes of a State which might not be\r\ncast in conformity with the wishes of the majority in that body.\r\n\r\nBut if President Jackson failed to secure the amendment to the\r\nConstitution which he urged so persistently, his arguments contributed\r\nlargely to the formation of party organizations, which have effectually\r\navoided the contingency of an election by the House of Representatives.\r\nThese organizations, first by a resort to the caucus system of\r\nnominating candidates, and afterwards to State and national conventions,\r\nhave been successful in so limiting the number of candidates as to\r\nescape the danger of an election by the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, however, that in thus limiting the number of candidates\r\nthe true object and spirit of the Constitution have been evaded and\r\ndefeated. It is an essential feature in our republican system of\r\ngovernment that every citizen possessing the constitutional\r\nqualifications has a right to become a candidate for the office of\r\nPresident and Vice-President, and that every qualified elector has a\r\nright to cast his vote for any citizen whom he may regard as worthy of\r\nthese offices. But under the party organizations which have prevailed\r\nfor years these asserted rights of the people have been as effectually\r\ncut off and destroyed as if the Constitution itself had inhibited their\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\nThe danger of a defeat of the popular choice in an election by the House\r\nof Representatives is no greater than in an election made nominally by\r\nthe people themselves, when by the laws of party organizations and by\r\nthe constitutional provisions requiring the people to vote for electors\r\ninstead of for the President or Vice-President it is made impracticable\r\nfor any citizen to be a candidate except through the process of a party\r\nnomination, and for any voter to cast his suffrage for any other person\r\nthan one thus brought forward through the manipulations of a nominating\r\nconvention. It is thus apparent that by means of party organizations\r\nthat provision of the Constitution which requires the election of\r\nPresident and Vice-President to be made through the electoral colleges\r\nhas been made instrumental and potential in defeating the great object\r\nof conferring the choice of these officers upon the people. It may be\r\nconceded that party organizations are inseparable from republican\r\ngovernment, and that when formed and managed in subordination to the\r\nConstitution they may be valuable safeguards of popular liberty; but\r\nwhen they are perverted to purposes of bad ambition they are liable\r\nto become the dangerous instruments of overthrowing the Constitution\r\nitself. Strongly impressed with the truth of these views, I feel\r\ncalled upon by an imperative sense of duty to revive substantially the\r\nrecommendation so often and so earnestly made by President Jackson,\r\nand to urge that the amendment to the Constitution herewith presented,\r\nor some similar proposition, may be submitted to the people for their\r\nratification or rejection.\r\n\r\nRecent events have shown the necessity of an amendment to the\r\nConstitution distinctly defining the persons who shall discharge the\r\nduties of President of the United States in the event of a vacancy in\r\nthat office by the death, resignation, or removal of both the President\r\nand Vice-President. It is clear that this should be fixed by the\r\nConstitution, and not be left to repealable enactments of doubtful\r\nconstitutionality. It occurs to me that in the event of a vacancy in the\r\noffice of President by the death, resignation, disability, or removal of\r\nboth the President and Vice-President the duties of the office should\r\ndevolve upon an officer of the executive department of the Government,\r\nrather than one connected with the legislative or judicial departments.\r\nThe objections to designating either the President _pro tempore_ of\r\nthe Senate or the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, especially\r\nin the event of a vacancy produced by removal, are so obvious and so\r\nunanswerable that they need not be stated in detail. It is enough\r\nto state that they are both interested in producing a vacancy, and,\r\naccording to the provisions of the Constitution, are members of the\r\ntribunal by whose decree a vacancy may be produced.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances the impropriety of designating either\r\nof these officers to succeed the President so removed is palpable.\r\nThe framers of the Constitution, when they referred to Congress the\r\nsettlement of the succession to the office of President in the event of\r\na vacancy in the offices of both President and Vice-President, did not,\r\nin my opinion, contemplate the designation of any other than an officer\r\nof the executive department, on whom, in such a contingency, the powers\r\nand duties of the President should devolve. Until recently the\r\ncontingency has been remote, and serious attention has not been called\r\nto the manifest incongruity between the provisions of the Constitution\r\non this subject and the act of Congress of 1792. Having, however, been\r\nbrought almost face to face with this important question, it seems an\r\neminently proper time for us to make the legislation conform to the\r\nlanguage, intent, and theory of the Constitution, and thus place the\r\nexecutive department beyond the reach of usurpation, and remove from the\r\nlegislative and judicial departments every temptation to combine for the\r\nabsorption of all the powers of government.\r\n\r\nIt has occurred to me that in the event of such a vacancy the duties of\r\nPresident would devolve most appropriately upon some one of the heads of\r\nthe several Executive Departments, and under this conviction I present\r\nfor your consideration an amendment to the Constitution on this subject,\r\nwith the recommendation that it be submitted to the people for their\r\naction.\r\n\r\nExperience seems to have established the necessity of an amendment\r\nof that clause of the Constitution which provides for the election of\r\nSenators to Congress by the legislatures of the several States. It would\r\nbe more consistent with the genius of our form of government if the\r\nSenators were chosen directly by the people of the several States.\r\nThe objections to the election of Senators by the legislatures are\r\nso palpable that I deem it unnecessary to do more than submit the\r\nproposition for such an amendment, with the recommendation that it\r\nbe opened to the people for their judgment.\r\n\r\nIt is strongly impressed on my mind that the tenure of office by\r\nthe judiciary of the United States during good behavior for life is\r\nincompatible with the spirit of republican government, and in this\r\nopinion I am fully sustained by the evidence of popular judgment upon\r\nthis subject in the different States of the Union.\r\n\r\nI therefore deem it my duty to recommend an amendment to the\r\nConstitution by which the terms of the judicial officers would be\r\nlimited to a period of years, and I herewith present it in the hope that\r\nCongress will submit it to the people for their decision.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing views have long been entertained by me. In 1845, in the\r\nHouse of Representatives, and afterwards, in 1860, in the Senate of the\r\nUnited States, I submitted substantially the same propositions as those\r\nto which the attention of Congress is herein invited. Time, observation,\r\nand experience have confirmed these convictions; and, as a matter of\r\npublic duty and a deep sense of my constitutional obligation \"to\r\nrecommend to the consideration of Congress such measures as I deem\r\nnecessary and expedient,\" I submit the accompanying propositions, and\r\nurge their adoption and submission to the judgment of the people.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  JOINT RESOLUTION proposing amendments to the Constitution of the\r\n  United States.\r\n\r\n  Whereas the fifth article of the Constitution of the United States\r\n  provides for amendments thereto in the manner following, viz:\r\n\r\n  \"The Congress, whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall deem it\r\n  necessary, shall propose amendments to this Constitution, or, on the\r\n  application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the several States,\r\n  shall call a convention for proposing amendments, which in either case\r\n  shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of this Constitution\r\n  when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States\r\n  or by conventions in three-fourths thereof, as the one or the other mode\r\n  of ratification may be proposed by the Congress: _Provided_, That no\r\n  amendment which may be made prior to the year 1808 shall in any manner\r\n  affect the first and fourth clauses in the ninth section of the first\r\n  article, and that no State, without its consent, shall be deprived of\r\n  its equal suffrage in the Senate:\"\r\n\r\n  Therefore,\r\n\r\n  _Be it resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\n  States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of both Houses\r\n  concurring_), That the following amendments to the Constitution of the\r\n  United States be proposed to the legislatures of the several States,\r\n  which, when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the States,\r\n  shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution:\r\n\r\n  \"That hereafter the President and Vice-President of the United States\r\n  shall be chosen for the term of six years, by the people of the\r\n  respective States, in the manner following: Each State shall be divided\r\n  by the legislature thereof in districts, equal in number to the whole\r\n  number of Senators and Representatives to which such State may be\r\n  entitled in the Congress of the United States; the said districts to\r\n  be composed of contiguous territory, and to contain, as nearly as may\r\n  be, an equal number of persons entitled to be represented under the\r\n  Constitution, and to be laid off for the first time immediately after\r\n  the ratification of this amendment; that on the first Thursday in August\r\n  in the year 18--, and on the same day every sixth year thereafter, the\r\n  citizens of each State who possess the qualifications requisite for\r\n  electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures shall\r\n  meet within their respective districts and vote for a President and\r\n  Vice-President of the United States; and the person receiving the\r\n  greatest number of votes for President and the one receiving the\r\n  greatest number of votes for Vice-President in each district shall\r\n  be holden to have received one vote, which fact shall be immediately\r\n  certified by the governor of the State to each of the Senators in\r\n  Congress from such State and to the President of the Senate and the\r\n  Speaker of the House of Representatives. The Congress of the United\r\n  States shall be in session on the second Monday in October in the year\r\n  18--, and on the same day in every sixth year thereafter; and the\r\n  President of the Senate, in the presence of the Senate and House of\r\n  Representatives, shall open all the certificates, and the votes shall\r\n  then be counted. The person having the greatest number of votes for\r\n  President shall be President, if such number be equal to a majority of\r\n  the whole number of votes given; but if no person have such majority,\r\n  then a second election shall be held on the first Thursday in the month\r\n  of December then next ensuing between the persons having the two highest\r\n  numbers for the office of President, which second election shall be\r\n  conducted, the result certified, and the votes counted in the same\r\n  manner as in the first, and the person having the greatest number of\r\n  votes for President shall be President. But if two or more persons shall\r\n  have received the greatest and an equal number of votes at the second\r\n  election, then the person who shall have received the greatest number of\r\n  votes in the greatest number of States shall be President. The person\r\n  having the greatest number of votes for Vice-President at the first\r\n  election shall be Vice-President, if such number be equal to a majority\r\n  of the whole number of votes given; and if no person have such majority,\r\n  then a second election shall take place between the persons having the\r\n  two highest numbers on the same day that the second election is held for\r\n  President, and the person having the highest number of the votes for\r\n  Vice-President shall be Vice-President. But if there should happen to\r\n  be an equality of votes between the persons so voted for at the second\r\n  election, then the person having the greatest number of votes in the\r\n  greatest number of States shall be Vice-President. But when a second\r\n  election shall be necessary in the case of Vice-President and not\r\n  necessary in the case of President, then the Senate shall choose a\r\n  Vice-President from the persons having the two highest numbers in the\r\n  first election, as now prescribed in the Constitution: _Provided_,\r\n  That after the ratification of this amendment to the Constitution the\r\n  President and Vice-President shall hold their offices, respectively, for\r\n  the term of six years, and that no President or Vice-President shall be\r\n  eligible for reelection to a second term.\"\r\n\r\n  Sec. 2. _And be it further resolved_, That Article II, section I,\r\n  paragraph 6, of the Constitution of the United States shall be amended\r\n  so as to read as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"In case of the removal of the President from office, or of his death,\r\n  resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of said\r\n  office, the same shall devolve on the Vice-President; and in the case of\r\n  the removal, death, resignation, or inability both of the President and\r\n  Vice-President, the powers and duties of said office shall devolve on\r\n  the Secretary of State for the time being, and after this officer, in\r\n  case of vacancy in that or other Department, and in the order in which\r\n  they are named, on the Secretary of the Treasury, on the Secretary of\r\n  War, on the Secretary of the Navy, on the Secretary of the Interior, on\r\n  the Postmaster-General, and on the Attorney-General; and such officer,\r\n  on whom the powers and duties of President shall devolve in accordance\r\n  with the foregoing provisions, shall then act as President until the\r\n  disability shall be removed or a President shall be elected, as is or\r\n  may be provided for by law.\"\r\n\r\n  Sec. 3. _And be it further resolved_, That Article I, section 3, be\r\n  amended by striking out the word \"legislature,\" and inserting in lieu\r\n  thereof the following words, viz: \"Persons qualified to vote for members\r\n  of the most numerous branch of the legislature,\" so as to make the third\r\n  section of said article, when ratified by three-fourths of the States,\r\n  read as follows, to wit:\r\n\r\n  \"The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from\r\n  each State, chosen by the persons qualified to vote for the members of\r\n  the most numerous branch of the legislature thereof, for six years, and\r\n  each Senator shall have one vote.\"\r\n\r\n  Sec. 4. _And be it further resolved_, That Article III, section I, be\r\n  amended by striking out the words \"good behavior,\" and inserting the\r\n  following words, viz: \"the term of twelve years.\" And further, that said\r\n  article and section be amended by adding the following thereto, viz:\r\n  \"And it shall be the duty of the President of the United States, within\r\n  twelve months after the ratification of this amendment by three-fourths\r\n  of all the States, as provided by the Constitution of the United States,\r\n  to divide the whole number of judges, as near as may be practicable,\r\n  into three classes.

The second section, however, takes away the\r\nright of appeal to that court in cases which involve the life and\r\nliberty of the citizen, and leaves them exposed to the judgment of\r\nnumerous inferior tribunals. It is apparent that the two sections were\r\nconceived in a very different spirit, and I regret that my objections\r\nto one impose upon me the necessity of withholding my sanction from the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nI can not give my assent to a measure which proposes to deprive\r\nany person \"restrained of his or her liberty in violation of the\r\nConstitution or of any treaty or law of the United States\" from\r\nthe right of appeal to the highest judicial authority known to our\r\nGovernment. To \"secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our\r\nposterity\" is one of the declared objects of the Federal Constitution.\r\nTo assure these, guaranties are provided in the same instrument, as well\r\nagainst \"unreasonable searches and seizures\" as against the suspensions\r\nof \"the privilege of the writ of _habeas corpus_, * * * unless when, in\r\ncases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it.\" It\r\nwas doubtless to afford the people the means of protecting and enforcing\r\nthese inestimable privileges that the jurisdiction which this bill\r\nproposes to take away was conferred upon the Supreme Court of the\r\nnation. The act conferring that jurisdiction was approved on the 5th day\r\nof February, 1867, with a full knowledge of the motives that prompted its\r\npassage, and because it was believed to be necessary and right. Nothing\r\nhas since occurred to disprove the wisdom and justness of the measures,\r\nand to modify it as now proposed would be to lessen the protection of\r\nthe citizen from the exercise of arbitrary power and to weaken the\r\nsafeguards of life and liberty, which can never be made too secure\r\nagainst illegal encroachments.\r\n\r\nThe bill not only prohibits the adjudication by the Supreme Court\r\nof cases in which appeals may hereafter be taken, but interdicts its\r\njurisdiction on appeals which have already been made to that high\r\njudicial body. If, therefore, it should become a law, it will by its\r\nretroactive operation wrest from the citizen a remedy which he enjoyed\r\nat the time of his appeal. It will thus operate most harshly upon those\r\nwho believe that justice has been denied them in the inferior courts.\r\n\r\nThe legislation proposed in the second section, it seems to me, is not\r\nin harmony with the spirit and intention of the Constitution. It can\r\nnot fail to affect most injuriously the just equipoise of our system\r\nof Government, for it establishes a precedent which, if followed, may\r\neventually sweep away every check on arbitrary and unconstitutional\r\nlegislation. Thus far during the existence of the Government the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States has been viewed by the people as the true\r\nexpounder of their Constitution, and in the most violent party conflicts\r\nits judgments and decrees have always been sought and deferred to with\r\nconfidence and respect. In public estimation it combines judicial wisdom\r\nand impartiality in a greater degree than any other authority known to\r\nthe Constitution, and any act which may be construed into or mistaken\r\nfor an attempt to prevent or evade its decision on a question which\r\naffects the liberty of the citizens and agitates the country can\r\nnot fail to be attended with unpropitious consequences. It will be\r\njustly held by a large portion of the people as an admission of the\r\nunconstitutionally of the act on which its judgment may be forbidden or\r\nforestalled, and may interfere with that willing acquiescence in its\r\nprovisions which is necessary for the harmonious and efficient execution\r\nof any law.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, thus briefly and imperfectly stated, and for others,\r\nof which want of time forbids the enumeration, I deem it my duty to\r\nwithhold my assent from this bill, and to return it for the\r\nreconsideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _June 20, 1868_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without my signature a bill entitled \"An act to admit the State\r\nof Arkansas to representation in Congress.\"\r\n\r\nThe approval of this bill would be an admission on the part of the\r\nExecutive that the \"Act for the more efficient government of the rebel\r\nStates,\" passed March 2, 1867, and the acts supplementary thereto were\r\nproper and constitutional. My opinion, however, in reference to those\r\nmeasures has undergone no change, but, on the contrary, has been\r\nstrengthened by the results which have attended their execution. Even\r\nwere this not the case, I could not consent to a bill which is based\r\nupon the assumption either that by an act of rebellion of a portion\r\nof its people the State of Arkansas seceded from the Union, or that\r\nCongress may at its pleasure expel or exclude a State from the Union,\r\nor interrupt its relations with the Government by arbitrarily depriving\r\nit of representation in the Senate and House of Representatives. If\r\nArkansas is a State not in the Union, this bill does not admit it as\r\na State into the Union. If, on the other hand, Arkansas is a State\r\nin the Union, no legislation is necessary to declare it entitled\r\n\"to representation in Congress as one of the States of the Union.\" The\r\nConstitution already declares that \"each State shall have at least one\r\nRepresentative;\" that the Senate \"shall be composed of two Senators from\r\neach State,\" and \"that no State, without its consent, shall be deprived\r\nof its equal suffrage in the Senate.\"\r\n\r\nThat instrument also makes each House \"the judge of the elections,\r\nreturns, and qualifications of its own members,\" and therefore all that\r\nis now necessary to restore Arkansas in all its constitutional relations\r\nto the Government is a decision by each House upon the eligibility of\r\nthose who, presenting their credentials, claim seats in the respective\r\nHouses of Congress. This is the plain and simple plan of the\r\nConstitution; and believing that had it been pursued when Congress\r\nassembled in the month of December, 1865, the restoration of the States\r\nwould long since have been completed, I once again earnestly recommend\r\nthat it be adopted by each House in preference to legislation, which I\r\nrespectfully submit is not only of at least doubtful constitutionality,\r\nand therefore unwise and dangerous as a precedent, but is unnecessary,\r\nnot so effective in its operation as the mode prescribed by the\r\nConstitution, involves additional delay, and from its terms may be taken\r\nrather as applicable to a Territory about to be admitted as one of the\r\nUnited States than to a State which has occupied a place in the Union\r\nfor upward of a quarter of a century.\r\n\r\nThe bill declares the State of Arkansas entitled and admitted to\r\nrepresentation in Congress as one of the States of the Union upon the\r\nfollowing fundamental condition:\r\n\r\n  That the constitution of Arkansas shall never be so amended or changed\r\n  as to deprive any citizen or class of citizens of the United States of\r\n  the right to vote who are entitled to vote by the constitution herein\r\n  recognized, except as a punishment for such crimes as are now felonies\r\n  at common law, whereof they shall have been duly convicted under laws\r\n  equally applicable to all the inhabitants of said State: _Provided_,\r\n  That any alteration of said constitution, prospective in its effect,\r\n  may be made in regard to the time and place of residence of voters.\r\n\r\nI have been unable to find in the Constitution of the United States any\r\nwarrant for the exercise of the authority thus claimed by Congress.\r\nIn assuming the power to impose a \"fundamental condition\" upon a State\r\nwhich has been duly \"admitted into the Union upon an equal footing with\r\nthe original States in all respects whatever,\" Congress asserts a right\r\nto enter a State as it may a Territory, and to regulate the highest\r\nprerogative of a free people--the elective franchise. This question is\r\nreserved by the Constitution to the States themselves, and to concede\r\nto Congress the power to regulate the subject would be to reverse the\r\nfundamental principle of the Republic and to place in the hands of the\r\nFederal Government, which is the creature of the States, the sovereignty\r\nwhich justly belongs to the States or the people--the true source of all\r\npolitical power, by whom our Federal system was created and to whose\r\nwill it is subordinate.\r\n\r\nThe bill fails to provide in what manner the State of Arkansas is to\r\nsignify its acceptance of the \"fundamental condition\" which Congress\r\nendeavors to make unalterable and irrevocable. Nor does it prescribe the\r\npenalty to be imposed should the people of the State amend or change the\r\nparticular portions of the constitution which it is one of the purposes\r\nof the bill to perpetuate, but as to the consequences of such action\r\nleaves them in uncertainty and doubt. When the circumstances under which\r\nthis constitution has been brought to the attention of Congress are\r\nconsidered, it is not unreasonable to suppose that efforts will be made\r\nto modify its provisions, and especially those in respect to which this\r\nmeasure prohibits any alteration. It is seriously questioned whether the\r\nconstitution has been ratified by a majority of the persons who, under\r\nthe act of March 2, 1867, and the acts supplementary thereto, were\r\nentitled to registration and to vote upon that issue. Section 10 of\r\nthe schedule provides that--\r\n\r\n  No person disqualified from voting or registering under this\r\n  constitution shall vote for candidates for any office, nor shall be\r\n  permitted to vote for the ratification or rejection of the constitution\r\n  at the polls herein authorized.\r\n\r\n\r\nAssumed to be in force before its adoption, in disregard of the law of\r\nCongress, the constitution undertakes to impose upon the elector other\r\nand further conditions. The fifth section of the eighth article provides\r\nthat \"all persons, before registering or voting,\" must take and\r\nsubscribe an oath which, among others, contains the following clause:\r\n\r\n  That I accept the civil and political equality of all men, and agree\r\n  not to attempt to deprive any person or persons, on account of race,\r\n  color, or previous condition, of any political or civil right,\r\n  privilege, or immunity enjoyed by any other class of men.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well known that a very large portion of the electors in all the\r\nStates, if not a large majority of all of them, do not believe in or\r\naccept the political equality of Indians, Mongolians, or negroes with\r\nthe race to which they belong. If the voters in many of the States of\r\nthe North and West were required to take such an oath as a test of their\r\nqualification, there is reason to believe that a majority of them would\r\nremain from the polls rather than comply with its degrading conditions.\r\nHow far and to what extent this test oath prevented the registration of\r\nthose who were qualified under the laws of Congress it is not possible\r\nto know, but that such was its effect, at least sufficient to overcome\r\nthe small and doubtful majority in favor of this constitution, there\r\ncan be no reasonable doubt. Should the people of Arkansas, therefore,\r\ndesiring to regulate the elective franchise so as to make it conform to\r\nthe constitutions of a large proportion of the States of the North and\r\nWest, modify the provisions referred to in the \"fundamental condition,\"\r\nwhat is to be the consequence? Is it intended that a denial of\r\nrepresentation shall follow? And if so, may we not dread, at some future\r\nday, a recurrence of the troubles which have so long agitated the\r\ncountry? Would it not be the part of wisdom to take for our guide the\r\nFederal Constitution, rather than resort to measures which, looking only\r\nto the present, may in a few years renew, in an aggravated form, the\r\nstrife and bitterness caused by legislation which has proved to be\r\nso ill timed and unfortunate?\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _June 25, 1868_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn returning to the House of Representatives, in which it originated,\r\na bill entitled \"An act to admit the States of North Carolina, South\r\nCarolina, Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama, and Florida to representation\r\nin Congress,\" I do not deem it necessary to state at length the reasons\r\nwhich constrain me to withhold my approval. I will not, therefore,\r\nundertake at this time to reopen the discussion upon the grave\r\nconstitutional questions involved in the act of March 2, 1867, and\r\nthe acts supplementary thereto, in pursuance of which it is claimed,\r\nin the preamble to this bill, these States have framed and adopted\r\nconstitutions of State government. Nor will I repeat the objections\r\ncontained in my message of the 20th instant, returning without my\r\nsignature the bill to admit to representation the State of Arkansas,\r\nand which are equally applicable to the pending measure.\r\n\r\nLike the act recently passed in reference to Arkansas, this bill\r\nsupersedes the plain and simple mode prescribed by the Constitution\r\nfor the admission to seats in the respective Houses of Senators and\r\nRepresentatives from the several States. It assumes authority over six\r\nStates of the Union which has never been delegated to Congress, or is\r\neven warranted by previous unconstitutional legislation upon the subject\r\nof restoration. It imposes conditions which are in derogation of the\r\nequal rights of the States, and is founded upon a theory which is\r\nsubversive of the fundamental principles of the Government. In the case\r\nof Alabama it violates the plighted faith of Congress by forcing upon\r\nthat State a constitution which was rejected by the people, according to\r\nthe express terms of an act of Congress requiring that a majority of the\r\nregistered electors should vote upon the question of its ratification.\r\n\r\nFor these objections, and many others that might be presented, I can not\r\napprove this bill, and therefore return it for the action of Congress\r\nrequired in such cases by the Federal Constitution.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _July 20, 1868_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have given to the joint resolution entitled \"A resolution excluding\r\nfrom the electoral college the votes of States lately in rebellion which\r\nshall not have been reorganized\" as careful examination as I have been\r\nable to bestow upon the subject during the few days that have intervened\r\nsince the measure was submitted for my approval.\r\n\r\nFeeling constrained to withhold my consent, I herewith return the\r\nresolution to the Senate, in which House it originated, with a brief\r\nstatement of the reasons which have induced my action. This joint\r\nresolution is based upon the assumption that some of the States whose\r\ninhabitants were lately in rebellion are not now entitled to\r\nrepresentation in Congress and participation in the election of\r\nPresident and Vice-President of the United States.\r\n\r\nHaving heretofore had occasion to give in detail my reasons for\r\ndissenting from this view, it is not necessary at this time to repeat\r\nthem. It is sufficient to state that I continue strong in my conviction\r\nthat the acts of secession, by which a number of the States sought to\r\ndissolve their connection with the other States and to subvert the\r\nUnion, being unauthorized by the Constitution and in direct violation\r\nthereof, were from the beginning absolutely null and void. It follows\r\nnecessarily that when the rebellion terminated the several States which\r\nhad attempted to secede continued to be States in the Union, and all\r\nthat was required to enable them to resume their relations to the Union\r\nwas that they should adopt the measures necessary to their practical\r\nrestoration as States. Such measures were adopted, and the legitimate\r\nresult was that those States, having conformed to all the requirements\r\nof the Constitution, resumed their former relations, and became entitled\r\nto the exercise of all the rights guaranteed to them by its provisions.\r\n\r\nThe joint resolution under consideration, however, seems to assume that\r\nby the insurrectionary acts of their respective inhabitants those States\r\nforfeited their rights as such, and can never again exercise them except\r\nupon readmission into the Union on the terms prescribed by Congress.\r\nIf this position be correct, it follows that they were taken out of the\r\nUnion by virtue of their acts of secession, and hence that the war waged\r\nupon them was illegal and unconstitutional. We would thus be placed in\r\nthis inconsistent attitude, that while the war was commenced and carried\r\non upon the distinct ground that the Southern States, being component\r\nparts of the Union, were in rebellion against the lawful authority of\r\nthe United States, upon its termination we resort to a policy of\r\nreconstruction which assumes that it was not in fact a rebellion, but\r\nthat the war was waged for the conquest of territories assumed to be\r\noutside of the constitutional Union.\r\n\r\nThe mode and manner of receiving and counting the electoral votes\r\nfor President and Vice-President of the United States are in plain\r\nand simple terms prescribed by the Constitution. That instrument\r\nimperatively requires that \"the President of the Senate shall, in the\r\npresence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the\r\ncertificates, and the votes shall then be counted.\" Congress has,\r\ntherefore, no power, under the Constitution, to receive the electoral\r\nvotes or reject them. The whole power is exhausted when, in the presence\r\nof the two Houses, the votes are counted and the result declared.\r\nIn this respect the power and duty of the President of the Senate are,\r\nunder the Constitution, purely ministerial. When, therefore, the joint\r\nresolution declares that no electoral votes shall be received or counted\r\nfrom States that since the 4th of March, 1867, have not \"adopted a\r\nconstitution of State government under which a State government shall\r\nhave organized,\" a power is assumed which is nowhere delegated to\r\nCongress, unless upon the assumption that the State governments\r\norganized prior to the 4th of March, 1867, were illegal and void.\r\n\r\nThe joint resolution, by implication at least, concedes that these\r\nStates were States by virtue of their organization prior to the 4th of\r\nMarch, 1867, but denies to them the right to vote in the election of\r\nPresident and Vice-President of the United States. It follows either\r\nthat this assumption of power is wholly unauthorized by the Constitution\r\nor that the States so excluded from voting were out of the Union by\r\nreason of the rebellion, and have never been legitimately restored.\r\nBeing fully satisfied that they were never out of the Union, and that\r\ntheir relations thereto have been legally and constitutionally restored,\r\nI am forced to the conclusion that the joint resolution, which deprives\r\nthem of the right to have their votes for President and Vice-President\r\nreceived and counted, is in conflict with the Constitution, and that\r\nCongress has no more power to reject their votes than those of the\r\nStates which have been uniformly loyal to the Federal Union.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that if the States whose inhabitants were\r\nrecently in rebellion were legally and constitutionally organized and\r\nrestored to their rights prior to the 4th of March, 1867, as I am\r\nsatisfied they were, the only legitimate authority under which the\r\nelection for President and Vice-President can be held therein must be\r\nderived from the governments instituted before that period. It clearly\r\nfollows that all the State governments organized in those States under\r\nact of Congress for that purpose, and under military control, are\r\nillegitimate and of no validity whatever; and in that view the votes\r\ncast in those States for President and Vice-President, in pursuance\r\nof acts passed since the 4th of March, 1867, and in obedience to the\r\nso-called reconstruction acts of Congress, can not be legally received\r\nand counted, while the only votes in those States that can be legally\r\ncast and counted will be those cast in pursuance of the laws in force in\r\nthe several States prior to the legislation by Congress upon the subject\r\nof reconstruction.\r\n\r\nI can not refrain from directing your special attention to the\r\ndeclaration contained in the joint resolution, that \"none of the\r\nStates whose inhabitants were lately in rebellion shall be entitled to\r\nrepresentation in the electoral college,\" etc. If it is meant by this\r\ndeclaration that no State is to be allowed to vote for President and\r\nVice-President _all_ of whose inhabitants were engaged in the late\r\nrebellion, it is apparent that no one of the States will be excluded\r\nfrom voting, since it is well known that in every Southern State there\r\nwere many inhabitants who not only did not participate in the rebellion,\r\nbut who actually took part in the suppression, or refrained from giving\r\nit any aid or countenance. I therefore conclude that the true meaning of\r\nthe joint resolution is that no State a _portion_ of whose inhabitants\r\nwere engaged in the rebellion shall be permitted to participate in the\r\nPresidential election, except upon the terms and conditions therein\r\nprescribed.\r\n\r\nAssuming this to be the true construction of the resolution, the\r\ninquiry becomes pertinent, May those Northern States a portion of\r\nwhose inhabitants were actually in the rebellion be prevented, at the\r\ndiscretion of Congress, from having their electoral votes counted? It is\r\nwell known that a portion of the inhabitants of New York and a portion\r\nof the inhabitants of Virginia were alike engaged in the rebellion; yet\r\nit is equally well known that Virginia, as well as New York, was at all\r\ntimes during the war recognized by the Federal Government as a State\r\nin the Union--so clearly that upon the termination of hostilities it\r\nwas not even deemed necessary for her restoration that a provisional\r\ngovernor should be appointed; yet, according to this joint resolution,\r\nthe people of Virginia, unless they comply with the terms it prescribes,\r\nare denied the right of voting for President, while the people of\r\nNew York, a portion of the inhabitants of which State were also in\r\nrebellion, are permitted to have their electoral votes counted without\r\nundergoing the process of reconstruction prescribed for Virginia. New\r\nYork is no more a State than Virginia; the one is as much entitled to\r\nrepresentation in the electoral college as the other. If Congress has\r\nthe power to deprive Virginia of this right, it can exercise the same\r\nauthority with respect to New York or any other of the States. Thus the\r\nresult of the Presidential election may be controlled and determined\r\nby Congress, and the people be deprived of their right under the\r\nConstitution to choose a President and Vice-President of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIf Congress were to provide by law that the votes of none of the States\r\nshould be received and counted if cast for a candidate who differed in\r\npolitical sentiment with a majority of the two Houses, such legislation\r\nwould at once be condemned by the country as an unconstitutional and\r\nrevolutionary usurpation of power. It would, however, be exceedingly\r\ndifficult to find in the Constitution any more authority for the passage\r\nof the joint resolution under consideration than for an enactment\r\nlooking directly to the rejection of all votes not in accordance with\r\nthe political preferences of a majority of Congress. No power exists\r\nin the Constitution authorizing the joint resolution or the supposed\r\nlaw--the only difference being that one would be more palpably\r\nunconstitutional and revolutionary than the other. Both would rest upon\r\nthe radical error that Congress has the power to prescribe terms and\r\nconditions to the right of the people of the States to cast their votes\r\nfor President and Vice-President.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons thus indicated I am constrained to return the joint\r\nresolution to the Senate for such further action thereon as Congress\r\nmay deem necessary.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 25, 1868_\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nBelieving that a bill entitled \"An act relating to the Freedmen's\r\nBureau, and providing for its discontinuance,\" interferes with the\r\nappointing power conferred by the Constitution upon the Executive, and\r\nfor other reasons, which at this late period of the session time will\r\nnot permit me to state, I herewith return it to the Senate, in which\r\nHouse it originated, without my approval.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas in the month of July, A.D. 1861, in accepting the condition\r\nof civil war which was brought about by insurrection and rebellion in\r\nseveral of the States which constitute the United States, the two Houses\r\nof Congress did solemnly declare that that war was not waged on the\r\npart of the Government in any spirit of oppression, nor for any purpose\r\nof conquest or subjugation, nor for any purpose of overthrowing or\r\ninterfering with the rights or established institutions of the States,\r\nbut only to defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States and to preserve the Union, with all the dignity, equality,\r\nand rights of the several States unimpaired, and that so soon as those\r\nobjects should be accomplished the war on the part of the Government\r\nshould cease; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the President of the United States has heretofore, in the spirit\r\nof that declaration and with the view of securing for it ultimate and\r\ncomplete effect, set forth several proclamations offering amnesty and\r\npardon to persons who had been or were concerned in the aforenamed\r\nrebellion, which proclamations, however, were attended with prudential\r\nreservations and exceptions then deemed necessary and proper, and which\r\nproclamations were respectively issued on the 8th day of December, 1863,\r\non the 26th day of March, 1864, on the 29th day of May, 1865, and on the\r\n7th day of September, 1867; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the said lamentable civil war has long since altogether ceased,\r\nwith an acknowledgment by all the States of the supremacy of the Federal\r\nConstitution and of the Government thereunder, and there no longer\r\nexists any reasonable ground to apprehend a renewal of the said civil\r\nwar, or any foreign interference, or any unlawful resistance by any\r\nportion of the people of any of the States to the Constitution and laws\r\nof the United States;

and\r\n\r\nWhereas it is believed that amnesty and pardon will tend to secure a\r\ncomplete and universal establishment and prevalence of municipal law\r\nand order in conformity with the Constitution of the United States,\r\nand to remove all appearances or presumptions of a retaliatory or\r\nvindictive policy on the part of the Government attended by unnecessary\r\ndisqualifications, pains, penalties, confiscations, and\r\ndisfranchisements, and, on the contrary, to promote and procure complete\r\nfraternal reconciliation among the whole people, with due submission to\r\nthe Constitution and laws:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it known that I, Andrew Johnson, President of\r\nthe United States, do, by virtue of the Constitution and in the\r\nname of the people of the United States, hereby proclaim and declare,\r\nunconditionally and without reservation, to all and to every person\r\nwho, directly or indirectly, participated in the late insurrection or\r\nrebellion, excepting such person or persons as may be under presentment\r\nor indictment in any court of the United States having competent\r\njurisdiction upon a charge of treason or other felony, a full pardon\r\nand amnesty for the offense of treason against the United States or of\r\nadhering to their enemies during the late civil war, with restoration of\r\nall rights of property, except as to slaves, and except also as to any\r\nproperty of which any person may have been legally divested under the\r\nlaws of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have signed these presents with my hand and have\r\ncaused the seal of the United States to be hereunto affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, the 4th day of July, A.D. 1868, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States of America the ninety-third.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  WILLIAM H.

SCHOFIELD,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 9, 1868_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nUpon the reassembling of Congress it again becomes my duty to call your\r\nattention to the state of the Union and to its continued disorganized\r\ncondition under the various laws which have been passed upon the subject\r\nof reconstruction.\r\n\r\nIt may be safely assumed as an axiom in the government of states that\r\nthe greatest wrongs inflicted upon a people are caused by unjust and\r\narbitrary legislation, or by the unrelenting decrees of despotic rulers,\r\nand that the timely revocation of injurious and oppressive measures is\r\nthe greatest good that can be conferred upon a nation. The legislator or\r\nruler who has the wisdom and magnanimity to retrace his steps when\r\nconvinced of error will sooner or later be rewarded with the respect and\r\ngratitude of an intelligent and patriotic people.\r\n\r\nOur own history, although embracing a period less than a century,\r\naffords abundant proof that most, if not all, of our domestic troubles\r\nare directly traceable to violations of the organic law and excessive\r\nlegislation. The most striking illustrations of this fact are furnished\r\nby the enactments of the past three years upon the question of\r\nreconstruction. After a fair trial they have substantially failed and\r\nproved pernicious in their results, and there seems to be no good reason\r\nwhy they should longer remain upon the statute book. States to which the\r\nConstitution guarantees a republican form of government have been\r\nreduced to military dependencies, in each of which the people have been\r\nmade subject to the arbitrary will of the commanding general. Although\r\nthe Constitution requires that each State shall be represented in\r\nCongress, Virginia, Mississippi, and Texas are yet excluded from the\r\ntwo Houses, and, contrary to the express provisions of that instrument,\r\nwere denied participation in the recent election for a President and\r\nVice-President of the United States. The attempt to place the white\r\npopulation under the domination of persons of color in the South has\r\nimpaired, if not destroyed, the kindly relations that had previously\r\nexisted between them; and mutual distrust has engendered a feeling of\r\nanimosity which, leading in some instances to collision and bloodshed,\r\nhas prevented that cooperation between the two races so essential to the\r\nsuccess of industrial enterprise in the Southern States. Nor have the\r\ninhabitants of those States alone suffered from the disturbed condition\r\nof affairs growing out of these Congressional enactments. The entire\r\nUnion has been agitated by grave apprehensions of troubles which might\r\nagain involve the peace of the nation; its interests have been\r\ninjuriously affected by the derangement of business and labor, and the\r\nconsequent want of prosperity throughout that portion of the country.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Constitution--the _magna charta_ of American rights, under\r\nwhose wise and salutary provisions we have successfully conducted all\r\nour domestic and foreign affairs, sustained ourselves in peace and in\r\nwar, and become a great nation among the powers of the earth--must\r\nassuredly be now adequate to the settlement of questions growing out of\r\nthe civil war, waged alone for its vindication. This great fact is made\r\nmost manifest by the condition of the country when Congress assembled in\r\nthe month of December, 1865. Civil strife had ceased, the spirit of\r\nrebellion had spent its entire force, in the Southern States the people\r\nhad warmed into national life, and throughout the whole country a\r\nhealthy reaction in public sentiment had taken place. By the application\r\nof the simple yet effective provisions of the Constitution the executive\r\ndepartment, with the voluntary aid of the States, had brought the work\r\nof restoration as near completion as was within the scope of its\r\nauthority, and the nation was encouraged by the prospect of an early\r\nand satisfactory adjustment of all its difficulties. Congress, however,\r\nintervened, and, refusing to perfect the work so nearly consummated,\r\ndeclined to admit members from the unrepresented States, adopted\r\na series of measures which arrested the progress of restoration,\r\nfrustrated all that had been so successfully accomplished, and, after\r\nthree years of agitation and strife, has left the country further from\r\nthe attainment of union and fraternal feeling than at the inception of\r\nthe Congressional plan of reconstruction. It needs no argument to show\r\nthat legislation which has produced such baneful consequences should\r\nbe abrogated, or else made to conform to the genuine principles of\r\nrepublican government.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of party passion and sectional prejudice, other acts\r\nhave been passed not warranted by the Constitution. Congress has already\r\nbeen made familiar with my views respecting the \"tenure-of-office bill.\"\r\nExperience has proved that its repeal is demanded by the best interests\r\nof the country, and that while it remains in force the President can not\r\nenjoin that rigid accountability of public officers so essential to an\r\nhonest and efficient execution of the laws. Its revocation would enable\r\nthe executive department to exercise the power of appointment and\r\nremoval in accordance with the original design of the Federal\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nThe act of March 2, 1867, making appropriations for the support of the\r\nArmy for the year ending June 30, 1868, and for other purposes, contains\r\nprovisions which interfere with the President's constitutional functions\r\nas Commander in Chief of the Army and deny to States of the Union\r\nthe right to protect themselves by means of their own militia. These\r\nprovisions should be at once annulled; for while the first might, in\r\ntimes of great emergency, seriously embarrass the Executive in efforts\r\nto employ and direct the common strength of the nation for its\r\nprotection and preservation, the other is contrary to the express\r\ndeclaration of the Constitution that \"a well-regulated militia being\r\nnecessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to\r\nkeep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\"\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the repeal of all such laws would be accepted by\r\nthe American people as at least a partial return to the fundamental\r\nprinciples of the Government, and an indication that hereafter the\r\nConstitution is to be made the nation's safe and unerring guide. They\r\ncan be productive of no permanent benefit to the country, and should not\r\nbe permitted to stand as so many monuments of the deficient wisdom which\r\nhas characterized our recent legislation.\r\n\r\nThe condition of our finances demands the early and earnest\r\nconsideration of Congress. Compared with the growth of our population,\r\nthe public expenditures have reached an amount unprecedented in our\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThe population of the United States in 1790 was nearly 4,000,000 people.\r\nIncreasing each decade about 33 per cent, it reached in 1860 31,000,000,\r\nan increase of 700 per cent on the population in 1790. In 1869 it is\r\nestimated that it will reach 38,000,000, or an increase of 868 per cent\r\nin seventy-nine years.\r\n\r\nThe annual expenditures of the Federal Government in 1791 were\r\n$4,200,000; in 1820, $13,200,000; in 1850, forty-one millions; in 1860,\r\nsixty-three millions; in 1865, nearly thirteen hundred millions; and\r\nin 1869 it is estimated by the Secretary of the Treasury, in his last\r\nannual report, that they will be three hundred and seventy-two millions.\r\n\r\nBy comparing the public disbursements of 1869, as estimated, with those\r\nof 1791, it will be seen that the increase of expenditure since the\r\nbeginning of the Government has been 8,618 per cent, while the increase\r\nof the population for the same period was only 868 per cent. Again,\r\nthe expenses of the Government in 1860, the year of peace immediately\r\npreceding the war, were only sixty-three millions, while in 1869, the\r\nyear of peace three years after the war, it is estimated they will be\r\nthree hundred and seventy-two millions, an increase of 489 per cent,\r\nwhile the increase of population was only 21 per cent for the same\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThese statistics further show that in 1791 the annual national expenses,\r\ncompared with the population, were little more than $1 per capita, and\r\nin 1860 but $2 per capita; while in 1869 they will reach the extravagant\r\nsum of $9.78 per capita.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that all these statements refer to and exhibit the\r\ndisbursements of peace periods. It may, therefore, be of interest to\r\ncompare the expenditures of the three war periods--the war with Great\r\nBritain, the Mexican War, and the War of the Rebellion.\r\n\r\nIn 1814 the annual expenses incident to the War of 1812 reached their\r\nhighest amount--about thirty-one millions--while our population slightly\r\nexceeded 8,000,000, showing an expenditure of only $3.80 per capita.\r\nIn 1847 the expenditures growing out of the war with Mexico reached\r\nfifty-five millions, and the population about 21,000,000, giving only\r\n$2.60 per capita for the war expenses of that year. In 1865 the\r\nexpenditures called for by the rebellion reached the vast amount of\r\ntwelve hundred and ninety millions, which, compared with a population\r\nof 34,000,000, gives $38.20 per capita.\r\n\r\nFrom the 4th day of March, 1789, to the 30th of June, 1861, the entire\r\nexpenditures of the Government were $1,700,000,000. During that period\r\nwe were engaged in wars with Great Britain and Mexico, and were involved\r\nin hostilities with powerful Indian tribes; Louisiana was purchased from\r\nFrance at a cost of $15,000,000; Florida was ceded to us by Spain for\r\nfive millions; California was acquired from Mexico for fifteen millions,\r\nand the territory of New Mexico was obtained from Texas for the sum of\r\nten millions. Early in 1861 the War of the Rebellion commenced; and\r\nfrom the 1st of July of that year to the 30th of June, 1865, the public\r\nexpenditures reached the enormous aggregate of thirty-three hundred\r\nmillions. Three years of peace have intervened, and during that time the\r\ndisbursements of the Government have successively been five hundred and\r\ntwenty millions, three hundred and forty-six millions, and three hundred\r\nand ninety-three millions. Adding to these amounts three hundred and\r\nseventy-two millions, estimated as necessary for the fiscal year ending\r\nthe 30th of June, 1869, we obtain a total expenditure of $1,600,000,000\r\nduring the four years immediately succeeding the war, or nearly as much\r\nas was expended during the seventy-two years that preceded the rebellion\r\nand embraced the extraordinary expenditures already named.\r\n\r\nThese startling facts clearly illustrate the necessity of\r\nretrenchment in all branches of the public service. Abuses which were\r\ntolerated during the war for the preservation of the nation will not be\r\nendured by the people, now that profound peace prevails. The receipts\r\nfrom internal revenues and customs have during the past three years\r\ngradually diminished, and the continuance of useless and extravagant\r\nexpenditures will involve us in national bankruptcy, or else make\r\ninevitable an increase of taxes, already too onerous and in many\r\nrespects obnoxious on account of their inquisitorial character. One\r\nhundred millions annually are expended for the military force, a large\r\nportion of which is employed in the execution of laws both unnecessary\r\nand unconstitutional; one hundred and fifty millions are required each\r\nyear to pay the interest on the public debt; an army of taxgatherers\r\nimpoverishes the nation, and public agents, placed by Congress beyond\r\nthe control of the Executive, divert from their legitimate purposes\r\nlarge sums of money which they collect from the people in the name of\r\nthe Government. Judicious legislation and prudent economy can alone\r\nremedy defects and avert evils which, if suffered to exist, can not fail\r\nto diminish confidence in the public councils and weaken the attachment\r\nand respect of the people toward their political institutions. Without\r\nproper care the small balance which it is estimated will remain in the\r\nTreasury at the close of the present fiscal year will not be realized,\r\nand additional millions be added to a debt which is now enumerated by\r\nbillions.\r\n\r\nIt is shown by the able and comprehensive report of the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury that the receipts for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1868,\r\nwere $405,638,083, and that the expenditures for the same period were\r\n$377,340,284, leaving in the Treasury a surplus of $28,297,798. It is\r\nestimated that the receipts during the present fiscal year, ending June\r\n30, 1869, will be $341,392,868 and the expenditures $336,152,470,\r\nshowing a small balance of $5,240,398 in favor of the Government. For\r\nthe fiscal year ending June 30, 1870, it is estimated that the receipts\r\nwill amount to $327,000,000 and the expenditures to $303,000,000,\r\nleaving an estimated surplus of $24,000,000.\r\n\r\nIt becomes proper in this connection to make a brief reference to our\r\npublic indebtedness, which has accumulated with such alarming rapidity\r\nand assumed such colossal proportions.\r\n\r\nIn 1789, when the Government commenced operations under the Federal\r\nConstitution, it was burdened with an indebtedness of $75,000,000,\r\ncreated during the War of the Revolution. This amount had been reduced\r\nto $45,000,000 when, in 1812, war was declared against Great Britain.\r\nThe three years' struggle that followed largely increased the national\r\nobligations, and in 1816 they had attained the sum of $127,000,000. Wise\r\nand economical legislation, however, enabled the Government to pay the\r\nentire amount within a period of twenty years, and the extinguishment\r\nof the national debt filled the land with rejoicing and was one of the\r\ngreat events of President Jackson's Administration. After its redemption\r\na large fund remained in the Treasury, which was deposited for\r\nsafe-keeping with the several States, on condition that it should be\r\nreturned when required by the public wants. In 1849--the year after the\r\ntermination of an expensive war with Mexico--we found ourselves involved\r\nin a debt of $64,000,000; and this was the amount owed by the Government\r\nin 1860, just prior to the outbreak of the rebellion. In the spring of\r\n1861 our civil war commenced. Each year of its continuance made an\r\nenormous addition to the debt; and when, in the spring of 1865, the\r\nnation successfully emerged from the conflict, the obligations of the\r\nGovernment had reached the immense sum of $2,873,992,909. The Secretary\r\nof the Treasury shows that on the 1st day of November, 1867, this amount\r\nhad been reduced to $2,491,504,450; but at the same time his report\r\nexhibits an increase during the past year of $35,625,102, for the debt\r\non the 1st day of November last is stated to have been $2,527,129,552.\r\nIt is estimated by the Secretary that the returns for the past month\r\nwill add to our liabilities the further sum of $11,000,000, making a\r\ntotal increase during thirteen months of $46,500,000.\r\n\r\nIn my message to Congress December 4, 1865, it was suggested that a\r\npolicy should be devised which, without being oppressive to the people,\r\nwould at once begin to effect a reduction of the debt, and, if persisted\r\nin, discharge it fully within a definite number of years. The Secretary\r\nof the Treasury forcibly recommends legislation of this character,\r\nand justly urges that the longer it is deferred the more difficult\r\nmust become its accomplishment. We should follow the wise precedents\r\nestablished in 1789 and 1816, and without further delay make provision\r\nfor the payment of our obligations at as early a period as may be\r\npracticable. The fruits of their labors should be enjoyed by our\r\ncitizens rather than used to build up and sustain moneyed monopolies in\r\nour own and other lands. Our foreign debt is already computed by the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury at $850,000,000; citizens of foreign countries\r\nreceive interest upon a large portion of our securities, and American\r\ntaxpayers are made to contribute large sums for their support. The idea\r\nthat such a debt is to become permanent should be at all times discarded\r\nas involving taxation too heavy to be borne, and payment once in every\r\nsixteen years, at the present rate of interest, of an amount equal to\r\nthe original sum. This vast debt, if permitted to become permanent and\r\nincreasing, must eventually be gathered into the hands of a few, and\r\nenable them to exert a dangerous and controlling power in the affairs of\r\nthe Government. The borrowers would become servants to the lenders, the\r\nlenders the masters of the people. We now pride ourselves upon having\r\ngiven freedom to 4,000,000 of the colored race; it will then be our\r\nshame that 40,000,000 of people, by their own toleration of usurpation\r\nand profligacy, have suffered themselves to become enslaved, and merely\r\nexchanged slave owners for new taskmasters in the shape of bondholders\r\nand taxgatherers. Besides, permanent debts pertain to monarchical\r\ngovernments, and, tending to monopolies, perpetuities, and class\r\nlegislation, are totally irreconcilable with free institutions.\r\nIntroduced into our republican system, they would gradually but surely\r\nsap its foundations, eventually subvert our governmental fabric, and\r\nerect upon its ruins a moneyed aristocracy. It is our sacred duty to\r\ntransmit unimpaired to our posterity the blessings of liberty which were\r\nbequeathed to us by the founders of the Republic, and by our example\r\nteach those who are to follow us carefully to avoid the dangers which\r\nthreaten a free and independent people.\r\n\r\nVarious plans have been proposed for the payment of the public debt.\r\nHowever they may have varied as to the time and mode in which it should\r\nbe redeemed, there seems to be a general concurrence as to the propriety\r\nand justness of a reduction in the present rate of interest. The\r\nSecretary of the Treasury in his report recommends 5 per cent; Congress,\r\nin a bill passed prior to adjournment on the 27th of July last, agreed\r\nupon 4 and 4-1/2 per cent; while by many 3 per cent has been held to be\r\nan amply sufficient return for the investment. The general impression as\r\nto the exorbitancy of the existing rate of interest has led to an\r\ninquiry in the public mind respecting the consideration which the\r\nGovernment has actually received for its bonds, and the conclusion is\r\nbecoming prevalent that the amount which it obtained was in real money\r\nthree or four hundred per cent less than the obligations which it issued\r\nin return. It can not be denied that we are paying an extravagant\r\npercentage for the use of the money borrowed, which was paper currency,\r\ngreatly depreciated below the value of coin. This fact is made apparent\r\nwhen we consider that bondholders receive from the Treasury upon each\r\ndollar they own in Government securities 6 per cent in gold, which is\r\nnearly or quite equal to 9 per cent in currency; that the bonds are\r\nthen converted into capital for the national banks, upon which those\r\ninstitutions issue their circulation, bearing 6 per cent interest; and\r\nthat they are exempt from taxation by the Government and the States, and\r\nthereby enhanced 2 per cent in the hands of the holders. We thus have an\r\naggregate of 17 per cent which may be received upon each dollar by the\r\nowners of Government securities. A system that produces such results is\r\njustly regarded as favoring a few at the expense of the many, and has\r\nled to the further inquiry whether our bondholders, in view of the\r\nlarge profits which they have enjoyed, would themselves be averse to\r\na settlement of our indebtedness upon a plan which would yield them a\r\nfair remuneration and at the same time be just to the taxpayers of the\r\nnation. Our national credit should be sacredly observed, but in making\r\nprovision for our creditors we should not forget what is due to the\r\nmasses of the people. It may be assumed that the holders of our\r\nsecurities have already received upon their bonds a larger amount than\r\ntheir original investment, measured by a gold standard. Upon this\r\nstatement of facts it would seem but just and equitable that the 6 per\r\ncent interest now paid by the Government should be applied to the\r\nreduction of the principal in semiannual installments, which in sixteen\r\nyears and eight months would liquidate the entire national debt. Six per\r\ncent in gold would at present rates be equal to 9 per cent in currency,\r\nand equivalent to the payment of the debt one and a half times in a\r\nfraction less than seventeen years. This, in connection with all the\r\nother advantages derived from their investment, would afford to the\r\npublic creditors a fair and liberal compensation for the use of their\r\ncapital, and with this they should be satisfied. The lessons of the past\r\nadmonish the lender that it is not well to be overanxious in exacting\r\nfrom the borrower rigid compliance with the letter of the bond.\r\n\r\nIf provision be made for the payment of the indebtedness of the\r\nGovernment in the manner suggested, our nation will rapidly recover its\r\nwonted prosperity. Its interests require that some measure should be\r\ntaken to release the large amount of capital invested in the securities\r\nof the Government. It is not now merely unproductive, but in taxation\r\nannually consumes $150,000,000, which would otherwise be used by our\r\nenterprising people in adding to the wealth of the nation. Our commerce,\r\nwhich at one time successfully rivaled that of the great maritime\r\npowers, has, rapidly diminished, and our industrial interests are\r\nin a depressed and languishing condition. The development of our\r\ninexhaustible resources is checked, and the fertile fields of the South\r\nare becoming waste for want of means to till them. With the release of\r\ncapital, new life would be infused into the paralyzed energies of our\r\npeople and activity and vigor imparted to every branch of industry. Our\r\npeople need encouragement in their efforts to recover from the effects\r\nof the rebellion and of injudicious legislation, and it should be the\r\naim of the Government to stimulate them by the prospect of an early\r\nrelease from the burdens which impede their prosperity. If we can not\r\ntake the burdens from their shoulders, we should at least manifest\r\na willingness to help to bear them.\r\n\r\nIn referring to the condition of the circulating medium, I shall merely\r\nreiterate substantially that portion of my last annual message which\r\nrelates to that subject.\r\n\r\nThe proportion which the currency of any country should bear to\r\nthe whole value of the annual produce circulated by its means is a\r\nquestion upon which political economists have not agreed. Nor can it\r\nbe controlled by legislation, but must be left to the irrevocable laws\r\nwhich everywhere regulate commerce and trade. The circulating medium\r\nwill ever irresistibly flow to those points where it is in greatest\r\ndemand. The law of demand and supply is as unerring as that which\r\nregulates the tides of the ocean; and, indeed, currency, like the tides,\r\nhas its ebbs and flows throughout the commercial world.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the rebellion the bank-note circulation of the\r\ncountry amounted to not much more than $200,000,000; now the circulation\r\nof national-bank notes and those known as \"legal-tenders\" is nearly\r\nseven hundred millions. While it is urged by some that this amount\r\nshould be increased, others contend that a decided reduction is\r\nabsolutely essential to the best interests of the country. In view of\r\nthese diverse opinions, it may be well to ascertain the real value of\r\nour paper issues when compared with a metallic or convertible currency.\r\nFor this purpose let us inquire how much gold and silver could be\r\npurchased by the seven hundred millions of paper money now in\r\ncirculation. Probably not more than half the amount of the latter;\r\nshowing that when our paper currency is compared with gold and silver\r\nits commercial value is compressed into three hundred and fifty\r\nmillions. This striking fact makes it the obvious duty of the\r\nGovernment, as early as may be consistent with the principles of sound\r\npolitical economy, to take such measures as will enable the holders of\r\nits notes and those of the national banks to convert them, without loss,\r\ninto specie or its equivalent. A reduction of our paper circulating\r\nmedium need not necessarily follow. This, however, would depend upon the\r\nlaw of demand and supply, though it should be borne in mind that by\r\nmaking legal-tender and bank notes convertible into coin or its\r\nequivalent their present specie value in the hands of their holders\r\nwould be enhanced 100 per cent.\r\n\r\nLegislation for the accomplishment of a result so desirable is demanded\r\nby the highest public considerations. The Constitution contemplates that\r\nthe circulating medium of the country shall be uniform in quality and\r\nvalue. At the time of the formation of that instrument the country had\r\njust emerged from the War of the Revolution, and was suffering from the\r\neffects of a redundant and worthless paper currency. The sages of that\r\nperiod were anxious to protect their posterity from the evils which they\r\nthemselves had experienced. Hence in providing a circulating medium they\r\nconferred upon Congress the power to coin money and regulate the value\r\nthereof, at the same time prohibiting the States from making anything\r\nbut gold and silver a tender in payment of debts.\r\n\r\nThe anomalous condition of our currency is in striking contrast with\r\nthat which was originally designed. Our circulation now embraces, first,\r\nnotes of the national banks, which are made receivable for all dues to\r\nthe Government, excluding imposts, and by all its creditors, excepting\r\nin payment of interest upon its bonds and the securities themselves;\r\nsecond, legal tender, issued by the United States, and which the law\r\nrequires shall be received as well in payment of all debts between\r\ncitizens as of all Government dues, excepting imposts; and, third, gold\r\nand silver coin. By the operation of our present system of finance,\r\nhowever, the metallic currency, when collected, is reserved only for one\r\nclass of Government creditors, who, holding its bonds, semiannually\r\nreceive their interest in coin from the National Treasury. There is no\r\nreason which will be accepted as satisfactory by the people why those\r\nwho defend us on the land and protect us on the sea; the pensioner upon\r\nthe gratitude of the nation, bearing the scars and wounds received while\r\nin its service; the public servants in the various departments of the\r\nGovernment; the farmer who supplies the soldiers of the Army and the\r\nsailors of the Navy; the artisan who toils in the nation's workshops,\r\nor the mechanics and laborers who build its edifices and construct\r\nits forts and vessels of war, should, in payment of their just and\r\nhard-earned dues, receive depreciated paper, while another class of\r\ntheir countrymen, no more deserving, are paid in coin of gold and\r\nsilver. Equal and exact justice requires that all the creditors of the\r\nGovernment should be paid in a currency possessing a uniform value.\r\nThis can only be accomplished by the restoration of the currency to the\r\nstandard established by the Constitution, and by this means we would\r\nremove a discrimination which may, if it has not already done so, create\r\na prejudice that may become deep-rooted and widespread and imperil the\r\nnational credit.\r\n\r\nThe feasibility of making our currency correspond with the\r\nconstitutional standard may be seen by reference to a few facts derived\r\nfrom our commercial statistics.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate product of precious metals in the United States from 1849\r\nto 1867 amounted to $1,174,000,000, while for the same period the net\r\nexports of specie were $741,000,000. This shows an excess of product\r\nover net exports of $433,000,000. There are in the Treasury $103,407,985\r\nin coin; in circulation in the States on the Pacific Coast about\r\n$40,000,000, and a few millions in the national and other banks--in all\r\nless than $160,000,000. Taking into consideration the specie in the\r\ncountry prior to 1849 and that produced since 1867, and we have more\r\nthan $300,000,000 not accounted for by exportation or by returns of the\r\nTreasury, and therefore most probably remaining in the country.\r\n\r\nThese are important facts, and show how completely the inferior\r\ncurrency will supersede the better, forcing it from circulation among\r\nthe masses and causing it to be exported as a mere article of trade, to\r\nadd to the money capital of foreign lands. They show the necessity of\r\nretiring our paper money, that the return of gold and silver to the\r\navenues of trade may be invited and a demand created which will cause\r\nthe retention at home of at least so much of the productions of our\r\nrich and inexhaustible gold-bearing fields as may be sufficient for\r\npurposes of circulation. It is unreasonable to expect a return to a\r\nsound currency so long as the Government and banks, by continuing to\r\nissue irredeemable notes, fill the channels of circulation with\r\ndepreciated paper. Notwithstanding a coinage by our mints since 1849 of\r\n$874,000,000, the people are now strangers to the currency which was\r\ndesigned for their use and benefit, and specimens of the precious metals\r\nbearing the national device are seldom seen, except when produced to\r\ngratify the interest excited by their novelty. If depreciated paper is\r\nto be continued as the permanent currency of the country, and all our\r\ncoin is to become a mere article of traffic and speculation, to the\r\nenhancement in price of all that is indispensable to the comfort of the\r\npeople, it would be wise economy to abolish our mints, thus saving the\r\nnation the care and expense incident to such establishments, and let our\r\nprecious metals be exported in bullion. The time has come, however, when\r\nthe Government and national banks should be required to take the most\r\nefficient steps and make all necessary arrangements for a resumption of\r\nspecie payments. Let specie payments once be earnestly inaugurated by\r\nthe Government and banks, and the value of the paper circulation would\r\ndirectly approximate a specie standard.\r\n\r\nSpecie payments having been resumed by the Government and banks, all\r\nnotes or bills of paper issued by either of a less denomination than $20\r\nshould by law be excluded from circulation, so that the people may have\r\nthe benefit and convenience of a gold and silver currency which in all\r\ntheir business transactions will be uniform in value at home and abroad.\r\nEvery man of property or industry, every man who desires to preserve\r\nwhat he honestly possesses or to obtain what he can honestly earn, has a\r\ndirect interest in maintaining a safe circulating medium--such a medium\r\nas shall be real and substantial, not liable to vibrate with opinions,\r\nnot subject to be blown up or blown down by the breath of speculation,\r\nbut to be made stable and secure. A disordered currency is one of the\r\ngreatest political evils. It undermines the virtues necessary for the\r\nsupport of the social system and encourages propensities destructive of\r\nits happiness; it wars against industry, frugality, and economy, and it\r\nfosters the evil spirits of extravagance and speculation.\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted by one of our profound and most gifted statesmen\r\nthat--\r\n\r\n  Of all the contrivances for cheating the laboring classes of mankind,\r\n  none has been more effectual than that which deludes them with paper\r\n  money. This is the most effectual of inventions to fertilize the rich\r\n  man's fields by the sweat of the poor man's brow. Ordinary tyranny,\r\n  oppression, excessive taxation--these bear lightly on the happiness of\r\n  the mass of the community compared with a fraudulent currency and the\r\n  robberies committed by depreciated paper. Our own history has recorded\r\n  for our instruction enough, and more than enough, of the demoralizing\r\n  tendency, the injustice, and the intolerable oppression on the virtuous\r\n  and well-disposed of a degraded paper currency authorized by law or in\r\n  any way countenanced by government.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most successful devices, in times of peace or war,\r\nof expansions or revulsions, to accomplish the transfer of all the\r\nprecious metals from the great mass of the people into the hands of the\r\nfew, where they are hoarded in secret places or deposited under bolts\r\nand bars, while the people are left to endure all the inconvenience,\r\nsacrifice, and demoralization resulting from the use of depreciated and\r\nworthless paper.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior in his report gives valuable information\r\nin reference to the interests confided to the supervision of his\r\nDepartment, and reviews the operations of the Land Office, Pension\r\nOffice, Patent Office, and Indian Bureau.\r\n\r\nDuring the fiscal year ending June 30, 1868, 6,655,700 acres of public\r\nland were disposed of. The entire cash receipts of the General Land\r\nOffice for the same period were $1,632,745, being greater by $284,883\r\nthan the amount realized from the same sources during the previous year.\r\nThe entries under the homestead law cover 2,328,923 acres, nearly\r\none-fourth of which was taken under the act of June 21, 1866, which\r\napplies only to the States of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas,\r\nand Florida.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of June, 1868, 169,643 names were borne on the pension\r\nrolls, and during the year ending on that day the total amount paid for\r\npensions, including the expenses of disbursement, was $24,010,982, being\r\n$5,391,025 greater than that expended for like purposes during the\r\npreceding year.\r\n\r\nDuring the year ending the 30th of September last the expenses of the\r\nPatent Office exceeded the receipts by $171, and, including reissues\r\nand designs, 14,153 patents were issued.\r\n\r\nTreaties with various Indian tribes have been concluded, and will be\r\nsubmitted to the Senate for its constitutional action. I cordially\r\nsanction the stipulations which provide for reserving lands for the\r\nvarious tribes, where they may be encouraged to abandon their nomadic\r\nhabits and engage in agricultural and industrial pursuits. This policy,\r\ninaugurated many years since, has met with signal success whenever it\r\nhas been pursued in good faith and with becoming liberality by the\r\nUnited States. The necessity for extending it as far as practicable in\r\nour relations with the aboriginal population is greater now than at any\r\npreceding period. Whilst we furnish subsistence and instruction to the\r\nIndians and guarantee the undisturbed enjoyment of their treaty rights,\r\nwe should habitually insist upon the faithful observance of their\r\nagreement to remain within their respective reservations. This is the\r\nonly mode by which collisions with other tribes and with the whites can\r\nbe avoided and the safety of our frontier settlements secured.\r\n\r\nThe companies constructing the railway from Omaha to Sacramento have\r\nbeen most energetically engaged in prosecuting the work, and it is\r\nbelieved that the line will be completed before the expiration of\r\nthe next fiscal year. The 6 per cent bonds issued to these companies\r\namounted on the 5th instant to $44,337,000, and additional work had\r\nbeen performed to the extent of $3,200,000.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior in August last invited my attention\r\nto the report of a Government director of the Union Pacific Railroad\r\nCompany who had been specially instructed to examine the location,\r\nconstruction, and equipment of their road. I submitted for the opinion\r\nof the Attorney-General certain questions in regard to the authority of\r\nthe Executive which arose upon this report and those which had from time\r\nto time been presented by the commissioners appointed to inspect each\r\nsuccessive section of the work. After carefully considering the law of\r\nthe case, he affirmed the right of the Executive to order, if necessary,\r\na thorough revision of the entire road. Commissioners were thereupon\r\nappointed to examine this and other lines, and have recently submitted a\r\nstatement of their investigations, of which the report of the Secretary\r\nof the Interior furnishes specific information.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War contains information of interest and\r\nimportance respecting the several bureaus of the War Department and the\r\noperations of the Army. The strength of our military force on the 30th\r\nof September last was 48,000 men, and it is computed that by the 1st of\r\nJanuary next this number will be decreased to 43,000. It is the opinion\r\nof the Secretary of War that within the next year a considerable\r\ndiminution of the infantry force may be made without detriment to the\r\ninterests of the country; and in view of the great expense attending the\r\nmilitary peace establishment and the absolute necessity of retrenchment\r\nwherever it can be applied, it is hoped that Congress will sanction the\r\nreduction which his report recommends. While in 1860 sixteen thousand\r\nthree hundred men cost the nation $16,472,000, the sum of $65,682,000\r\nis estimated as necessary for the support of the Army during the fiscal\r\nyear ending June 30, 1870. The estimates of the War Department for\r\nthe last two fiscal years were, for 1867, $33,814,461, and for 1868\r\n$25,205,669. The actual expenditures during the same periods were,\r\nrespectively, $95,224,415 and $123,246,648. The estimate submitted in\r\nDecember last for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1869, was $77,124,707;\r\nthe expenditures for the first quarter, ending the 30th of September\r\nlast, were $27,219,117, and the Secretary of the Treasury gives\r\n$66,000,000 as the amount which will probably be required during the\r\nremaining three quarters, if there should be no reduction of the\r\nArmy--making its aggregate cost for the year considerably in excess\r\nof ninety-three millions. The difference between the estimates and\r\nexpenditures for the three fiscal years which have been named is thus\r\nshown to be $175,545,343 for this single branch of the public service.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy exhibits the operations of that\r\nDepartment and of the Navy during the year. A considerable reduction of\r\nthe force has been effected. There are 42 vessels, carrying 411 guns, in\r\nthe six squadrons which are established in different parts of the world.\r\nThree of these vessels are returning to the United States and 4 are used\r\nas storeslips, leaving the actual cruising force 35 vessels, carrying\r\n356 guns. The total number of vessels in the Navy is 206, mounting 1,743\r\nguns. Eighty-one vessels of every description are in use, armed with 696\r\nguns. The number of enlisted men in the service, including apprentices,\r\nhas been reduced to 8,500. An increase of navy-yard facilities is\r\nrecommended as a measure which will in the event of war be promotive\r\nof economy and security. A more thorough and systematic survey of the\r\nNorth Pacific Ocean is advised in view of our recent acquisitions, our\r\nexpanding commerce, and the increasing intercourse between the Pacific\r\nStates and Asia. The naval pension fund, which consists of a moiety of\r\nthe avails of prizes captured during the war, amounts to $14,000,000.\r\nException is taken to the act of 23d July last, which reduces the\r\ninterest on the fund loaned to the Government by the Secretary, as\r\ntrustee, to 3 per cent instead of 6 per cent, which was originally\r\nstipulated when the investment was made. An amendment of the pension\r\nlaws is suggested to remedy omissions and defects in existing\r\nenactments. The expenditures of the Department during the last fiscal\r\nyear were $20,120,394, and the estimates for the coming year amount\r\nto $20,993,414.\r\n\r\nThe Postmaster-General's report furnishes a full and clear exhibit of\r\nthe operations and condition of the postal service. The ordinary postal\r\nrevenue for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1868, was $16,292,600,\r\nthe total expenditures, embracing all the service for which special\r\nappropriations have been made by Congress, amounted to $22,730,592,\r\nshowing an excess of expenditures of $6,437,991. Deducting from the\r\nexpenditures the sum of $1,896,525, the amount of appropriations for\r\nocean-steamship and other special service, the excess of expenditures\r\nwas $4,541,466. By using an unexpended balance in the Treasury of\r\n$3,800,000 the actual sum for which a special appropriation is required\r\nto meet the deficiency is $741,466. The causes which produced this large\r\nexcess of expenditure over revenue were the restoration of service in\r\nthe late insurgent States and the putting into operation of new service\r\nestablished by acts of Congress, which amounted within the last two\r\nyears and a half to about 48,700 miles--equal to more than one-third\r\nof the whole amount of the service at the close of the war. New postal\r\nconventions with Great Britain, North Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands,\r\nSwitzerland, and Italy, respectively, have been carried into effect.\r\nUnder their provisions important improvements have resulted in reduced\r\nrates of international postage and enlarged mail facilities with\r\nEuropean countries. The cost of the United States transatlantic ocean\r\nmail service since January 1, 1868, has been largely lessened under the\r\noperation of these new conventions, a reduction of over one-half having\r\nbeen effected under the new arrangements for ocean mail steamship\r\nservice which went into effect on that date. The attention of Congress\r\nis invited to the practical suggestions and recommendations made in his\r\nreport by the Postmaster-General.\r\n\r\nNo important question has occurred during the last year in our\r\naccustomed cordial and friendly intercourse with Costa Rica, Guatemala,\r\nHonduras, San Salvador, France, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Portugal,\r\nthe Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, Rome, Greece, Turkey,\r\nPersia, Egypt, Liberia, Morocco, Tripoli, Tunis, Muscat, Siam, Borneo,\r\nand Madagascar.\r\n\r\nCordial relations have also been maintained with the Argentine and the\r\nOriental Republics. The expressed wish of Congress that our national\r\ngood offices might be tendered to those Republics, and also to Brazil\r\nand Paraguay, for bringing to an end the calamitous war which has so\r\nlong been raging in the valley of the La Plata, has been assiduously\r\ncomplied with and kindly acknowledged by all the belligerents. That\r\nimportant negotiation, however, has thus far been without result.\r\n\r\nCharles A. Washburn, late United States minister to Paraguay, having\r\nresigned, and being desirous to return to the United States, the\r\nrear-admiral commanding the South Atlantic Squadron was early directed\r\nto send a ship of war to Asuncion, the capital of Paraguay, to receive\r\nMr. Washburn and his family and remove them from a situation which was\r\nrepresented to be endangered by faction and foreign war. The Brazilian\r\ncommander of the allied invading forces refused permission to the _Wasp_\r\nto pass through the blockading forces, and that vessel returned to\r\nits accustomed anchorage. Remonstrance having been made against this\r\nrefusal, it was promptly overruled, and the _Wasp_ therefore resumed\r\nher errand, received Mr. Washburn and his family, and conveyed them to\r\na safe and convenient seaport. In the meantime an excited controversy\r\nhad arisen between the President of Paraguay and the late United States\r\nminister, which, it is understood, grew out of his proceedings in\r\ngiving asylum in the United States legation to alleged enemies of\r\nthat Republic. The question of the right to give asylum is one always\r\ndifficult and often productive of great embarrassment. In states well\r\norganized and established, foreign powers refuse either to concede or\r\nexercise that right, except as to persons actually belonging to the\r\ndiplomatic service. On the other hand, all such powers insist upon\r\nexercising the right of asylum in states where the law of nations is\r\nnot fully acknowledged, respected, and obeyed.\r\n\r\nThe President of Paraguay is understood to have opposed to Mr.\r\nWashburn's proceedings the injurious and very improbable charge of\r\npersonal complicity in insurrection and treason. The correspondence,\r\nhowever, has not yet reached the United States.\r\n\r\nMr. Washburn, in connection with this controversy, represents that two\r\nUnited States citizens attached to the legation were arbitrarily seized\r\nat his Side, when leaving the capital of Paraguay, committed to prison,\r\nand there subjected to torture for the purpose of procuring confessions\r\nof their own criminality and testimony to support the President's\r\nallegations against the United States minister. Mr. McMahon, the newly\r\nappointed minister to Paraguay, having reached the La Plata, has been\r\ninstructed to proceed without delay to Asuncion, there to investigate\r\nthe whole subject. The rear-admiral commanding the United States South\r\nAtlantic Squadron has been directed to attend the new minister with a\r\nproper naval force to sustain such just demands as the occasion may\r\nrequire, and to vindicate the rights of the United States citizens\r\nreferred to and of any others who may be exposed to danger in the\r\ntheater of war. With these exceptions, friendly relations have been\r\nmaintained between the United States and Brazil and Paraguay.\r\n\r\nOur relations during the past year with Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru,\r\nand Chile have become especially friendly and cordial. Spain and the\r\nRepublics of Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador have expressed their willingness\r\nto accept the mediation of the United States for terminating the war\r\nupon the South Pacific coast. Chile has not finally declared upon the\r\nquestion. In the meantime the conflict has practically exhausted itself,\r\nsince no belligerent or hostile movement has been made by either party\r\nduring the last two years, and there are no indications of a present\r\npurpose to resume hostilities on either side. Great Britain and France\r\nhave cordially seconded our proposition of mediation, and I do not\r\nforego the hope that it may soon be accepted by all the belligerents and\r\nlead to a secure establishment of peace and friendly relations between\r\nthe Spanish American Republics of the Pacific and Spain--a result\r\nwhich would be attended with common benefits to the belligerents\r\nand much advantage to all commercial nations. I communicate, for\r\nthe consideration of Congress, a correspondence which shows that the\r\nBolivian Republic has established the extremely liberal principle of\r\nreceiving into its citizenship any citizen of the United States, or\r\nof any other of the American Republics, upon the simple condition of\r\nvoluntary registry.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence herewith submitted wall be found painfully\r\nreplete with accounts of the ruin and wretchedness produced by recent\r\nearthquakes, of unparalleled severity, in the Republics of Peru,\r\nEcuador, and Bolivia. The diplomatic agents and naval officers of the\r\nUnited States who were present in those countries at the time of those\r\ndisasters furnished all the relief in their power to the sufferers, and\r\nwere promptly rewarded with grateful and touching acknowledgments by\r\nthe Congress of Peru. An appeal to the charity of our fellow-citizens\r\nhas been answered by much liberality. In this connection I submit an\r\nappeal which has been made by the Swiss Republic, whose Government and\r\ninstitutions are kindred to our own, in behalf of its inhabitants, who\r\nare suffering extreme destitution, produced by recent devastating\r\ninundations.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Mexico during the year have been marked by an\r\nincreasing growth of mutual confidence. The Mexican Government has\r\nnot yet acted upon the three treaties celebrated here last summer for\r\nestablishing the rights of naturalized citizens upon a liberal and just\r\nbasis, for regulating consular powers, and for the adjustment of mutual\r\nclaims.\r\n\r\nAll commercial nations, as well as all friends of republican\r\ninstitutions, have occasion to regret the frequent local disturbances\r\nwhich occur in some of the constituent States of Colombia. Nothing has\r\noccurred, however, to affect the harmony and cordial friendship which\r\nhave for several years existed between that youthful and vigorous\r\nRepublic and our own.\r\n\r\nNegotiations are pending with a view to the survey and construction\r\nof a ship canal across the Isthmus of Darien, under the auspices of\r\nthe United States. I hope to be able to submit the results of that\r\nnegotiation to the Senate during its present session.\r\n\r\nThe very liberal treaty which was entered into last year by the United\r\nStates and Nicaragua has been ratified by the latter Republic.\r\n\r\nCosta Rica, with the earnestness of a sincerely friendly neighbor,\r\nsolicits a reciprocity of trade, which I commend to the consideration\r\nof Congress.\r\n\r\nThe convention created by treaty between the United States and Venezuela\r\nin July, 1865, for the mutual adjustment of claims, has been held,\r\nand its decisions have been received at the Department of State. The\r\nheretofore-recognized Government of the United States of Venezuela has\r\nbeen subverted. A provisional government having been instituted under\r\ncircumstances which promise durability, it has been formally recognized.\r\n\r\nI have been reluctantly obliged to ask explanation and satisfaction\r\nfor national injuries committed by the President of Hayti. The political\r\nand social condition of the Republics of Hayti and St. Domingo is very\r\nunsatisfactory and painful. The abolition of slavery, which has been\r\ncarried into effect throughout the island of St. Domingo and the entire\r\nWest Indies, except the Spanish islands of Cuba and Porto Rico, has\r\nbeen followed by a profound popular conviction of the rightfulness\r\nof republican institutions and an intense desire to secure them.\r\nThe attempt, however, to establish republics there encounters many\r\nobstacles, most of which may be supposed to result from long-indulged\r\nhabits of colonial supineness and dependence upon European monarchical\r\npowers. While the United States have on all occasions professed a\r\ndecided unwillingness that any part of this continent or of its adjacent\r\nislands shall be made a theater for a new establishment of monarchical\r\npower, too little has been done by us, on the other hand, to attach the\r\ncommunities by which we are surrounded to our own country, or to lend\r\neven a moral support to the efforts they are so resolutely and so\r\nconstantly making to secure republican institutions for themselves.\r\nIt is indeed a question of grave consideration whether our recent and\r\npresent example is not calculated to check the growth and expansion of\r\nfree principles, and make those communities distrust, if not dread,\r\na government which at will consigns to military domination States that\r\nare integral parts of our Federal Union, and, while ready to resist any\r\nattempts by other nations to extend to this hemisphere the monarchical\r\ninstitutions of Europe, assumes to establish over a large portion of\r\nits people a rule more absolute, harsh, and tyrannical than any known\r\nto civilized powers.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of Alaska was made with the view of extending national\r\njurisdiction and republican principles in the American hemisphere.\r\nBelieving that a further step could be taken in the same direction,\r\nI last year entered into a treaty with the King of Denmark for the\r\npurchase of the islands of St. Thomas and St. John, on the best terms\r\nthen attainable, and with the express consent of the people of those\r\nislands. This treaty still remains under consideration in the Senate.\r\nA new convention has been entered into with Denmark, enlarging the time\r\nfixed for final ratification of the original treaty.\r\n\r\nComprehensive national policy would seem to sanction the acquisition and\r\nincorporation into our Federal Union of the several adjacent continental\r\nand insular communities as speedily as it can be done peacefully,\r\nlawfully, and without any violation of national justice, faith, or\r\nhonor. Foreign possession or control of those communities has hitherto\r\nhindered the growth and impaired the influence of the United States.\r\nChronic revolution and anarchy there would be equally injurious. Each\r\none of them, when firmly established as an independent republic, or when\r\nincorporated into the United States, would be a new source of strength\r\nand power. Conforming my Administration to these principles, I have on\r\nno occasion lent support or toleration to unlawful expeditions set on\r\nfoot upon the plea of republican propagandism or of national extension\r\nor aggrandizement. The necessity, however, of repressing such unlawful\r\nmovements clearly indicates the duty which rests upon us of adapting our\r\nlegislative action to the new circumstances of a decline of European\r\nmonarchical power and influence and the increase of American republican\r\nideas, interests, and sympathies.\r\n\r\nIt can not be long before it will become necessary for this Government\r\nto lend some effective aid to the solution of the political and social\r\nproblems which are continually kept before the world by the two\r\nRepublics of the island of St. Domingo, and which are now disclosing\r\nthemselves more distinctly than heretofore in the island of Cuba. The\r\nsubject is commended to your consideration with all the more earnestness\r\nbecause I am satisfied that the time has arrived when even so direct a\r\nproceeding as a proposition for an annexation of the two Republics of\r\nthe island of St. Domingo would not only receive the consent of the\r\npeople interested, but would also give satisfaction to all other foreign\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nI am aware that upon the question of further extending our\r\npossessions it is apprehended by some that our political system can not\r\nsuccessfully be applied to an area more extended than our continent; but\r\nthe conviction is rapidly gaining ground in the American mind that with\r\nthe increased facilities for intercommunication between all portions\r\nof the earth the principles of free government, as embraced in our\r\nConstitution, if faithfully maintained and carried out, would prove of\r\nsufficient strength and breadth to comprehend within their sphere and\r\ninfluence the civilized nations of the world.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the Senate and of Congress is again respectfully\r\ninvited to the treaty for the establishment of commercial reciprocity\r\nwith the Hawaiian Kingdom entered into last year, and already ratified\r\nby that Government. The attitude of the United States toward these\r\nislands is not very different from that in which they stand toward the\r\nWest Indies. It is known and felt by the Hawaiian Government and people\r\nthat their Government and institutions are feeble and precarious; that\r\nthe United States, being so near a neighbor, would be unwilling to see\r\nthe islands pass under foreign control. Their prosperity is continually\r\ndisturbed by expectations and alarms of unfriendly political\r\nproceedings, as well from the United States as from other foreign\r\npowers. A reciprocity treaty, while it could not materially diminish\r\nthe revenues of the United States, would be a guaranty of the good will\r\nand forbearance of all nations until the people of the islands shall of\r\nthemselves, at no distant day, voluntarily apply for admission into the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor of Russia has acceded to the treaty negotiated here\r\nin January last for the security of trade-marks in the interest\r\nof manufacturers and commerce. I have invited his attention to the\r\nimportance of establishing, now while it seems easy and practicable,\r\na fair and equal regulation of the vast fisheries belonging to the\r\ntwo nations in the waters of the North Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe two treaties between the United States and Italy for the regulation\r\nof consular powers and the extradition of criminals, negotiated and\r\nratified here during the last session of Congress, have been accepted\r\nand confirmed by the Italian Government. A liberal consular convention\r\nwhich has been negotiated with Belgium will be submitted to the Senate.\r\nThe very important treaties which were negotiated between the United\r\nStates and North Germany and Bavaria for the regulation of the rights of\r\nnaturalized citizens have been duly ratified and exchanged, and similar\r\ntreaties have been entered into with the Kingdoms of Belgium and\r\nWurtemberg and with the Grand Duchies of Baden and Hesse-Darmstadt.\r\nI hope soon to be able to submit equally satisfactory conventions of\r\nthe same character now in the course of negotiation with the respective\r\nGovernments of Spain, Italy, and the Ottoman Empire.\r\n\r\nExamination of claims against the United States by the Hudsons Bay\r\nCompany and the Puget Sound Agricultural Company, on account of certain\r\npossessory rights in the State of Oregon and Territory of Washington,\r\nalleged by those companies in virtue of provisions of the treaty\r\nbetween the United States and Great Britain of June 15, 1846, has been\r\ndiligently prosecuted, under the direction of the joint international\r\ncommission to which they were submitted for adjudication by treaty\r\nbetween the two Governments of July 1, 1863, and will, it is expected,\r\nbe concluded at an early day.\r\n\r\nNo practical regulation concerning colonial trade and the fisheries can\r\nbe accomplished by treaty between the United States and Great Britain\r\nuntil Congress shall have expressed their judgment concerning the\r\nprinciples involved. Three other questions, however, between the United\r\nStates and Great Britain remain open for adjustment. These are the\r\nmutual rights of naturalized citizens, the boundary question involving\r\nthe title to the island of San Juan, on the Pacific coast, and mutual\r\nclaims arising since the year 1853 of the citizens and subjects of the\r\ntwo countries for injuries and depredations committed under the\r\nauthority of their respective Governments. Negotiations upon these\r\nsubjects are pending, and I am not without hope of being able to lay\r\nbefore the Senate, for its consideration during the present session,\r\nprotocols calculated to bring to an end these justly exciting and\r\nlong-existing controversies.\r\n\r\nWe are not advised of the action of the Chinese Government upon the\r\nliberal and auspicious treaty which was recently celebrated with its\r\nplenipotentiaries at this capital.\r\n\r\nJapan remains a theater of civil war, marked by religious incidents\r\nand political severities peculiar to that long-isolated Empire. The\r\nExecutive has hitherto maintained strict neutrality among the\r\nbelligerents, and acknowledges with pleasure that it has been frankly\r\nand fully sustained in that course by the enlightened concurrence and\r\ncooperation of the other treaty powers, namely, Great Britain, France,\r\nthe Netherlands, North Germany, and Italy.\r\n\r\nSpain having recently undergone a revolution marked by extraordinary\r\nunanimity and preservation of order, the provisional government\r\nestablished at Madrid has been recognized, and the friendly intercourse\r\nwhich has so long happily existed between the two countries remains\r\nunchanged.\r\n\r\nI renew the recommendation contained in my communication to Congress\r\ndated the 18th July last--a copy of which accompanies this message--that\r\nthe judgment of the people should be taken on the propriety of so\r\namending the Federal Constitution that it shall provide--\r\n\r\nFirst. For an election of President and Vice-President by a direct vote\r\nof the people, instead of through the agency of electors, and making\r\nthem ineligible for reelection to a second term.\r\n\r\nSecond. For a distinct designation of the person who shall discharge\r\nthe duties of President in the event of a vacancy in that office by the\r\ndeath, resignation, or removal of both the President and Vice-President.\r\n\r\nThird. For the election of Senators of the United States directly by\r\nthe people of the several States, instead of by the legislatures; and\r\n\r\nFourth. For the limitation to a period of years of the terms of Federal\r\njudges.\r\n\r\nProfoundly impressed with the propriety of making these important\r\nmodifications in the Constitution, I respectfully submit them for\r\nthe early and mature consideration of Congress. We should, as far\r\nas possible, remove all pretext for violations of the organic law,\r\nby remedying such imperfections as time and experience may develop,\r\never remembering that \"the constitution which at any time exists until\r\nchanged by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people is sacredly\r\nobligatory upon all.\"\r\n\r\nIn the performance of a duty imposed upon me by the Constitution, I have\r\nthus communicated to Congress information of the state of the Union and\r\nrecommended for their consideration such measures as have seemed to me\r\nnecessary and expedient. If carried into effect, they will hasten the\r\naccomplishment of the great and beneficent purposes for which the\r\nConstitution was ordained, and which it comprehensively states were\r\n\"to form a more perfect Union, establish justice, insure domestic\r\ntranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote the general\r\nwelfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our\r\nposterity.\" In Congress are vested all legislative powers, and upon them\r\ndevolves the responsibility as well for framing unwise and excessive\r\nlaws as for neglecting to devise and adopt measures absolutely demanded\r\nby the wants of the country. Let us earnestly hope that before the\r\nexpiration of our respective terms of service, now rapidly drawing\r\nto a close, an all-wise Providence will so guide our counsels as to\r\nstrengthen and preserve the Federal Union, inspire reverence for the\r\nConstitution, restore prosperity and happiness to our whole people,\r\nand promote \"on earth peace, good will toward men.\"\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 8, 1868_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit a copy of a note of the 24th of November last addressed to\r\nthe Secretary of State by the minister of Great Britain, communicating\r\na decree of the district court of the United States for the southern\r\ndistrict of New York ordering the payment of certain sums to the\r\ndefendants in a suit against the English schooner _Sibyl_, libeled as a\r\nprize of war.

An extract from that part of the dispatch of the minister of\r\nthe United States at Lima which accompanied the copy referred to, and\r\nwhich relates to it, is also transmitted. It will be seen from this\r\nextract that it is desirable that the decision of the Senate upon\r\nthe instrument should be given as early as may be convenient.

It is\r\nexpected that the original of the convention will be forwarded by the\r\nsteamer which leaves Liverpool to-morrow.

It is expected that the original of the convention\r\nwill be forwarded by the steamer which leaves Liverpool to-morrow.\r\nCircumstances, however, to which it is unnecessary to advert, in my\r\njudgment make it advisable to communicate to the Senate the copy\r\nreferred to in advance of the arrival of the original instrument.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _January 18, 1869_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe resolution adopted on the 5th instant, requesting the President \"to\r\ntransmit to the Senate a copy of any proclamation of amnesty made by him\r\nsince the last adjournment of Congress, and also to communicate to the\r\nSenate by what authority of law the same was made,\" has been received.\r\n\r\nI accordingly transmit herewith a copy of a proclamation dated the 25th\r\nday of December last. The authority of law by which it was made is set\r\nforth in the proclamation itself, which expressly affirms that it was\r\nissued \"by virtue of the power and authority in me vested by the\r\nConstitution, and in the name of the sovereign people of the United\r\nStates,\" and proclaims and declares \"unconditionally and without\r\nreservation, to all and to every person who, directly or indirectly,\r\nparticipated in the late insurrection or rebellion, a full pardon and\r\namnesty for the offense of treason against the United States, or of\r\nadhering to their enemies during the late civil war, with restoration of\r\nall rights, privileges, and immunities under the Constitution and the\r\nlaws which have been made in pursuance thereof.\"\r\n\r\nThe Federal Constitution is understood to be and is regarded by the\r\nExecutive as the supreme law of the land. The second section of article\r\nsecond of that instrument provides that the President \"shall have power\r\nto grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States,\r\nexcept in cases of impeachment.\" The proclamation of the 25th ultimo is\r\nin strict accordance with the judicial expositions of the authority thus\r\nconferred upon the Executive, and, as will be seen by reference to the\r\naccompanying papers, is in conformity with the precedent established by\r\nWashington in 1795, and followed by President Adams in 1800, Madison in\r\n1815, and Lincoln in 1863, and by the present Executive in 1865, 1867,\r\nand 1868.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 20, 1869_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of War, made in\r\ncompliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 19th ultimo,\r\nrequesting information in reference to the payment of rent for the use\r\nof the building known as the Libby Prison, in the city of Richmond, Va.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 22, 1869_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, an additional article to the convention between the United\r\nStates and His Majesty the King of Italy for regulating the jurisdiction\r\nof consuls.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 22, 1869_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, an additional article to the convention between the United\r\nStates and His Majesty the King of Italy for the mutual extradition of\r\ncriminals fugitives from justice.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 23, 1869_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith lay before the Senate, for the constitutional action of\r\nthat body, a treaty concluded at the council house on the Cattaraugus\r\nReservation, in Erie County, N.Y., on the 4th day of December, 1868,\r\nby Walter R.

The resolutions transmitted herewith show that\r\nthey have performed their trust in a manner entirely satisfactory to\r\nthe colored people of the two cities, and no good reason is known to\r\nthe Executive why the duties which now devolve upon them should be\r\ntransferred as proposed in the bill.\r\n\r\nWith these brief suggestions the bill is respectfully returned, and the\r\nconsideration of Congress invited to the accompanying preamble and\r\nresolutions.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _February 22, 1869_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe accompanying bill, entitled \"An act regulating the duties on\r\nimported copper and copper ores,\" is, for the following reasons,\r\nreturned, without my approval, to the House of Representatives, in which\r\nbranch of Congress it originated.\r\n\r\nIts immediate effect will be to diminish the public receipts, for the\r\nobject of the bill can not be accomplished without seriously affecting\r\nthe importation of copper and copper ores, from which a considerable\r\nrevenue is at present derived. While thus impairing the resources of the\r\nGovernment, it imposes an additional tax upon an already overburdened\r\npeople, who should not be further impoverished that monopolies may be\r\nfostered and corporations enriched.\r\n\r\nIt is represented--and the declaration seems to be sustained by\r\nevidence--that the duties for which this bill provides are nearly or\r\nquite sufficient to prohibit the importation of certain foreign ores of\r\ncopper. Its enactment, therefore, will prove detrimental to the shipping\r\ninterests of the nation, and at the same time destroy the business, for\r\nmany years successfully established, of smelting home ores in connection\r\nwith a smaller amount of the imported articles. This business, it is\r\ncredibly asserted, has heretofore yielded the larger share of the copper\r\nproduction of the country, and thus the industry which this legislation\r\nis designed to encourage is actually less than that which will be\r\ndestroyed by the passage of this bill.\r\n\r\nIt seems also to be evident that the effect of this measure will be to\r\nenhance by 70 per cent the cost of blue vitriol--an article extensively\r\nused in dyeing and in the manufacture of printed and colored cloths. To\r\nproduce such an augmentation in the price of this commodity will be to\r\ndiscriminate against other great branches of domestic industry, and by\r\nincreasing their cost to expose them most unfairly to the effects of\r\nforeign competition. Legislation can neither be wise nor just which\r\nseeks the welfare of a single interest at the expense and to the injury\r\nof many and varied interests at least equally important and equally\r\ndeserving the consideration of Congress. Indeed, it is difficult to find\r\nany reason which will justify the interference of Government with any\r\nlegitimate industry, except so far as may be rendered necessary by the\r\nrequirements of the revenue. As has already been stated, however, the\r\nlegislative intervention proposed in the present instance will diminish,\r\nnot increase, the public receipts.\r\n\r\nThe enactment of such a law is urged as necessary for the relief of\r\ncertain mining interests upon Lake Superior, which, it is alleged,\r\nare in a greatly depressed condition, and can only be sustained by an\r\nenhancement of the price of copper. If this result should follow the\r\npassage of the bill, a tax for the exclusive benefit of a single class\r\nwould be imposed upon the consumers of copper throughout the entire\r\ncountry, not warranted by any need of the Government, and the avails of\r\nwhich would not in any degree find their way into the Treasury of the\r\nnation. If the miners of Lake Superior are in a condition of want, it\r\ncan not be justly affirmed that the Government should extend charity to\r\nthem in preference to those of its citizens who in other portions of the\r\ncountry suffer in like manner from destitution. Least of all should the\r\nendeavor to aid them be based upon a method so uncertain and indirect as\r\nthat contemplated by the bill, and which, moreover, proposes to continue\r\nthe exercise of its benefaction through an indefinite period of years.\r\nIt is, besides, reasonable to hope that positive suffering from want,\r\nif it really exists, will prove but temporary in a region where\r\nagricultural labor is so much in demand and so well compensated. A\r\ncareful examination of the subject appears to show that the present\r\nlow price of copper, which alone has induced any depression the mining\r\ninterests of Lake Superior may have recently experienced, is due to\r\ncauses which it is wholly impolitic, if not impracticable, to contravene\r\nby legislation. These causes are, in the main, an increase in the\r\ngeneral supply of copper, owing to the discovery and working of\r\nremarkably productive mines and to a coincident restriction in the\r\nconsumption and use of copper by the substitution of other and cheaper\r\nmetals for industrial purposes. It is now sought to resist by artificial\r\nmeans the action of natural laws; to place the people of the United\r\nStates, in respect to the enjoyment and use of an essential commodity,\r\nupon a different basis from other nations, and especially to compensate\r\ncertain private and sectional interests for the changes and losses which\r\nare always incident to industrial progress.\r\n\r\nAlthough providing for an increase of duties, the proposed law does not\r\neven come within the range of protection, in the fair acceptation of the\r\nterm. It does not look to the fostering of a young and feeble interest\r\nwith a view to the ultimate attainment of strength and the capacity\r\nof self-support. It appears to assume that the present inability for\r\nsuccessful production is inherent and permanent, and is more likely\r\nto increase than to be gradually overcome; yet in spite of this it\r\nproposes, by the exercise of the lawmaking power, to sustain that\r\ninterest and to impose it in hopeless perpetuity as a tax upon the\r\ncompetent and beneficent industries of the country.\r\n\r\nThe true method for the mining interests of Lake Superior to\r\nobtain relief, if relief is needed, is to endeavor to make their great\r\nnatural resources fully available by reducing the cost of production.\r\nSpecial or class legislation can not remedy the evils which this bill\r\nis designed to meet. They can only be overcome by laws which will effect\r\na wise, honest, and economical administration of the Government, a\r\nreestablishment of the specie standard of value, and an early adjustment\r\nof our system of State, municipal, and national taxation (especially the\r\nlatter) upon the fundamental principle that all taxes, whether collected\r\nunder the internal revenue or under a tariff, shall interfere as little\r\nas possible with the productive energies of the people.\r\n\r\nThe bill is therefore returned, in the belief that the true interests\r\nof the Government and of the people require that it should not become\r\na law.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas the President of the United States has heretofore set forth\r\nseveral proclamations offering amnesty and pardon to persons who\r\nhad been or were concerned in the late rebellion against the lawful\r\nauthority of the Government of the United States, which proclamations\r\nwere severally issued on the 8th day of December, 1863, on the 26th\r\nday of March, 1864, on the 29th day of May, 1865, on the 7th day of\r\nSeptember, 1867, and on the 4th day of July, in the present year; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the authority of the Federal Government having been\r\nreestablished in all the States and Territories within the jurisdiction\r\nof the United States, it is believed that such prudential reservations\r\nand exceptions as at the dates of said several proclamations were deemed\r\nnecessary and proper may now be wisely and justly relinquished, and that\r\nan universal amnesty and pardon for participation in said rebellion\r\nextended to all who have borne any part therein will tend to secure\r\npermanent peace, order, and prosperity throughout the land, and to renew\r\nand fully restore confidence and fraternal feeling among the whole\r\npeople, and their respect for and attachment to the National Government,\r\ndesigned by its patriotic founders for the general good:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it known that I, Andrew Johnson, President of the\r\nUnited States, by virtue of the power and authority in me vested by the\r\nConstitution and in the name of the sovereign people of the United\r\nStates, do hereby proclaim and declare, unconditionally and without\r\nreservation, to all and to every person who, directly or indirectly,\r\nparticipated in the late insurrection or rebellion a full pardon and\r\namnesty for the offense of treason against the United States or of\r\nadhering to their enemies during the late civil war, with restoration\r\nof all rights, privileges, and immunities under the Constitution and\r\nthe laws which have been made in pursuance thereof.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have signed these presents with my hand and have\r\ncaused the seal of the United States to be hereunto affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, the 25th day of December, A.D. 1868, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States of America the ninety-third.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  F.W.

IX. That said Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, on\r\nthe 22d day of February, A.D. 1868, at Washington, in the District of\r\nColumbia, in disregard of the Constitution and the laws of the United\r\nStates duly enacted, as Commander in Chief of the Army of the United\r\nStates, did bring before himself then and there William H. Emory, a\r\nmajor-general by brevet in the Army of the United States, actually in\r\ncommand of the Department of Washington and the military forces thereof,\r\nand did then and there, as such Commander in Chief, declare to and\r\ninstruct said Emory that part of a law of the United States, passed\r\nMarch 2, 1867, entitled \"An act making appropriations for the support\r\nof the Army for the year ending June 30, 1868, and for other purposes,\"\r\nespecially the second section thereof, which provides, among other\r\nthings, that \"all orders and instructions relating to military\r\noperations issued by the President or Secretary of War shall be issued\r\nthrough the General of the Army, and in case of his inability through\r\nthe next in rank,\" was unconstitutional and in contravention of the\r\ncommission of said Emory, and which said provision of law had been\r\ntheretofore duly and legally promulgated by general order for the\r\ngovernment and direction of the Army of the United States, as the said\r\nAndrew Johnson then and there well knew, with intent thereby to induce\r\nsaid Emory, in his official capacity as commander of the Department of\r\nWashington, to violate the provisions of said act and to take and\r\nreceive, act upon, and obey such orders as he, the said Andrew Johnson,\r\nmight make and give, and which should not be issued through the General\r\nof the Army of the United States, according to the provisions of said\r\nact, and with the further intent thereby to enable him, the said Andrew\r\nJohnson, to prevent the execution of the act entitled \"An act regulating\r\nthe tenure of certain civil offices,\" passed March 2, 1867, and to\r\nunlawfully prevent Edwin M.

X. That said Andrew Johnson, President of the United States,\r\nunmindful of the high duties of his office and the dignity and\r\nproprieties thereof, and of the harmony and courtesies which ought to\r\nexist and be maintained between the executive and legislative branches\r\nof the Government of the United States, designing and intending to\r\nset aside the rightful authority and powers of Congress, did attempt\r\nto bring into disgrace, ridicule, hatred, contempt, and reproach the\r\nCongress of the United States and the several branches thereof, to\r\nimpair and destroy the regard and respect of all the good people of\r\nthe United States for the Congress and legislative power thereof (which\r\nall officers of the Government ought inviolably to preserve and\r\nmaintain), and to excite the odium and resentment of all the good\r\npeople of the United States against Congress and the laws by it duly and\r\nconstitutionally enacted; and, in pursuance of his design and intent,\r\nopenly and publicly, and before divers assemblages of the citizens of\r\nthe United States, convened in divers parts thereof to meet and receive\r\nsaid Andrew Johnson as the Chief Magistrate of the United States, did,\r\non the 18th day of August, A.D. 1866, and on divers other days and\r\ntimes, as well before as afterwards, make and deliver with a loud voice\r\ncertain intemperate, inflammatory, and scandalous harangues, and did\r\ntherein utter loud threats and bitter menaces, as well against Congress\r\nas the laws of the United States, duly enacted thereby, amid the cries,\r\njeers, and laughter of the multitudes then assembled and in hearing,\r\nwhich are set forth in the several specifications hereinafter written\r\nin substance and effect; that is to say:\r\n\r\n_Specification first_.--In this, that at Washington, in the District of\r\nColumbia, in the Executive Mansion, to a committee of citizens who\r\ncalled upon the President of the United States, speaking of and\r\nconcerning the Congress of the United States, said Andrew Johnson,\r\nPresident of the United States, heretofore, to wit, on the 18th day of\r\nAugust, A.D. 1866, did in a loud voice declare in substance and effect,\r\namong other things; that is to say:\r\n\r\n  So far as the executive department of the Government is concerned, the\r\n  effort has been made to restore the Union, to heal the breach, to pour\r\n  oil into the wounds which were consequent upon the struggle, and (to\r\n  speak in common phrase) to prepare, as the learned and wise physician\r\n  would, a plaster healing in character and coextensive with the wound.\r\n  We thought and we think that we had partially succeeded; but as the work\r\n  progresses, as reconstruction seemed to be taking place and the country\r\n  was becoming reunited, we found a disturbing and marring element\r\n  opposing us. In alluding to that element I shall go no further than your\r\n  convention and the distinguished gentleman who has delivered to me the\r\n  report of its proceedings. I shall make no reference to it that I do not\r\n  believe the time and the occasion justify.\r\n\r\n  We have witnessed in one department of the Government every endeavor\r\n  to prevent the restoration of peace, harmony, and union. We have seen\r\n  hanging upon the verge of the Government, as it were, a body called, or\r\n  which assumes to be, the Congress of the United States, while in fact it\r\n  is a Congress of only a part of the States. We have seen this Congress\r\n  pretend to be for the Union, when its every step and act tended to\r\n  perpetuate disunion and make a disruption of the States inevitable.\r\n  * * * We have seen Congress gradually encroach, step by step, upon\r\n  constitutional rights, and violate, day after day and month after month,\r\n  fundamental principles of the Government. We have seen a Congress that\r\n  seemed to forget that there was a limit to the sphere and scope of\r\n  legislation. We have seen a Congress in a minority assume to exercise\r\n  power which, allowed to be consummated, would result in despotism or\r\n  monarchy itself.\r\n\r\n_Specification second_.--In this, that at Cleveland, in the State\r\nof Ohio, heretofore, to wit, on the 3d day of September, A.D. 1866,\r\nbefore a public assemblage of citizens and others, said Andrew Johnson,\r\nPresident of the United States, speaking of and concerning the Congress\r\nof the United States, did in a loud voice declare in substance and\r\neffect, among other things; that is to say:\r\n\r\n  I will tell you what I did do. I called upon your Congress that is\r\n  trying to break up the Government.\r\n\r\n  In conclusion, besides that, Congress had taken much pains to poison\r\n  their constituents against him. But what had Congress done? Have they\r\n  done anything to restore the Union of these States? No. On the contrary,\r\n  they have done everything to prevent it. And because he stood now where\r\n  he did when the rebellion commenced, he had been denounced as a traitor.\r\n  Who had run greater risks or made greater sacrifices than himself? But\r\n  Congress, factious and domineering, had undertaken to poison the minds\r\n  of the American people.\r\n\r\n_Specification third_.--In this, that at St. Louis, in the State of\r\nMissouri, heretofore, to wit, on the 8th day of September, A.D. 1866,\r\nbefore a public assemblage of citizens and others, said Andrew Johnson,\r\nPresident of the United States, speaking of and concerning the Congress\r\nof the United States, did in a loud voice declare in substance and\r\neffect, among other things; that is to say:\r\n\r\n  Go on. Perhaps if you had a word or two on the subject of New Orleans\r\n  you might understand more about it than you do. And if you will go\r\n  back--if you will go back and ascertain the cause of the riot at New\r\n  Orleans, perhaps you will not be so prompt in calling out \"New Orleans.\"\r\n  If you will take up the riot at New Orleans and trace it back to its\r\n  source or its immediate cause, you will find out who was responsible\r\n  for the blood that was shed there. If you will take up the riot at New\r\n  Orleans and trace it back to the Radical Congress, you will find that\r\n  the riot at New Orleans was substantially planned. If you will take up\r\n  the proceedings in their caucuses, you will understand that they there\r\n  knew that a convention was to be called which was extinct by its power\r\n  having expired; that it was said that the intention was that a new\r\n  government was to be organized, and on the organization of that\r\n  government the intention was to enfranchise one portion of the\r\n  population, called the colored population, who had just been\r\n  emancipated, and at the same time disfranchise white men. When you\r\n  design to talk about New Orleans, you ought to understand what you are\r\n  talking about. When you read the speeches that were made and take up\r\n  the facts on the Friday and Saturday before that convention sat, you\r\n  will there find that speeches were made, incendiary in their character,\r\n  exciting that portion of the population--the black population--to arm\r\n  themselves and prepare for the shedding of blood. You will also find\r\n  that that convention did assemble, in violation of law, and the\r\n  intention of that convention was to supersede the reorganized\r\n  authorities in the State government of Louisiana, which had been\r\n  recognized by the Government of the United States; and every man engaged\r\n  in that rebellion in that convention, with the intention of superseding\r\n  and upturning the civil government which had been recognized by the\r\n  Government of the United States, I say that he was a traitor to the\r\n  Constitution of the United States; and hence you find that another\r\n  rebellion was commenced, _having its origin in the Radical Congress_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  So much for the New Orleans riot. And there was the cause and the origin\r\n  of the blood that was shed; and every drop of blood that was shed is\r\n  upon their skirts, and they are responsible for it. I could test this\r\n  thing a little closer, but will not do it here to-night. But when you\r\n  talk about the causes and consequences that resulted from proceedings\r\n  of that kind, perhaps, as I have been introduced here, and you have\r\n  provoked questions of this kind--though it does not provoke me--I will\r\n  tell you a few wholesome things that have been done by this Radical\r\n  Congress in connection with New Orleans and the extension of the\r\n  elective franchise.\r\n\r\n  I know that I have been traduced and abused. I know it has come in\r\n  advance of me, here as elsewhere, that I have attempted to exercise an\r\n  arbitrary power in resisting laws that were intended to be forced upon\r\n  the Government; that I had exercised that power; that I had abandoned\r\n  the party that elected me, and that I was a traitor, because I exercised\r\n  the veto power in attempting and did arrest for a time a bill that was\r\n  called a \"Freedmen's Bureau\" bill; yes, that I was a traitor. And I have\r\n  been traduced, I have been slandered, I have been maligned, I have been\r\n  called Judas Iscariot and all that. Now, my countrymen, here to-night,\r\n  it is very easy to indulge in epithets; it is easy to call a man a Judas\r\n  and cry out \"traitor;\" but when he is called upon to give arguments and\r\n  facts he is very often found wanting. Judas Iscariot--Judas. There was\r\n  a Judas, and he was one of the twelve apostles. Oh, yes; the twelve\r\n  apostles had a Christ. The twelve apostles had a Christ, and he never\r\n  could have had a Judas unless he had had twelve apostles. If I have\r\n  played the Judas, who has been my Christ that I have played the Judas\r\n  with? Was it Thad. Stevens? Was it Wendell Phillips? Was it Charles\r\n  Sumner? These are the men that stop and compare themselves with the\r\n  Savior, and everybody that differs with them in opinion, and to try\r\n  to stay and arrest their diabolical and nefarious policy, is to be\r\n  denounced as a Judas.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Well, let me say to you, if you will stand by me in this action, if you\r\n  will stand by me in trying to give the people a fair chance--soldiers\r\n  and citizens--to participate in these offices, God being willing I will\r\n  kick them out. I will kick them out just as fast as I can.\r\n\r\n  Let me say to you in concluding that what I have said I intended to say.\r\n  I was not provoked into this, and I care not for their menaces, the\r\n  taunts and the jeers. I care not for threats. I do not intend to be\r\n  bullied by my enemies nor overawed by my friends. But, God willing, with\r\n  your help I will veto their measures whenever any of them come to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich said utterances, declarations, threats, and harangues, highly\r\ncensurable in any, are peculiarly indecent and unbecoming in the Chief\r\nMagistrate of the United States, by means whereof said Andrew Johnson\r\nhas brought the high office of the President of the United States into\r\ncontempt, ridicule, and disgrace, to the great scandal of all good\r\ncitizens; whereby said Andrew Johnson, President of the United States,\r\ndid commit and was then and there guilty of a high misdemeanor in\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nART. XI. That said Andrew Johnson, President of the United States,\r\nunmindful of the high duties of his office and of his oath of office,\r\nand in disregard of the Constitution and laws of the United States, did\r\nheretofore, to wit, on the 18th day of August, A.D. 1866, at the city of\r\nWashington, in the District of Columbia, by public speech, declare and\r\naffirm in substance that the Thirty-ninth Congress of the United States\r\nwas not a Congress of the United States authorized by the Constitution\r\nto exercise legislative power under the same, but, on the contrary, was\r\na Congress of only part of the States; thereby denying and intending to\r\ndeny that the legislation of said Congress was valid or obligatory upon\r\nhim, the said Andrew Johnson, except in so far as he saw fit to approve\r\nthe same, and also thereby denying and intending to deny the power of\r\nthe said Thirty-ninth Congress to propose amendments to the Constitution\r\nof the United States; and in pursuance of said declaration the said\r\nAndrew Johnson, President of the United States, afterwards, to wit,\r\non the 21st day of February, A.D. 1868, at the city of Washington,\r\nin the District of Columbia, did unlawfully, and in disregard of the\r\nrequirement of the Constitution that he should take care that the laws\r\nbe faithfully executed, attempt to prevent the execution of an act\r\nentitled \"An act regulating the tenure of certain civil offices,\" passed\r\nMarch 2, 1867, by unlawfully devising and contriving, and attempting to\r\ndevise and contrive, means by which he should prevent Edwin M. Stanton\r\nfrom forthwith resuming the functions of the office of Secretary for the\r\nDepartment of War, notwithstanding the refusal of the Senate to concur\r\nin the suspension theretofore made by said Andrew Johnson of said Edwin\r\nM. Stanton from said office of Secretary for the Department of War, and\r\nalso by further unlawfully devising and contriving, and attempting to\r\ndevise and contrive, means then and there to prevent the execution of\r\nan act entitled \"An act making appropriations for the support of the\r\nArmy for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1868 and for other purposes,\"\r\napproved March 2, 1867, and also to prevent the execution of an act\r\nentitled \"An act to provide for the more efficient government of the\r\nrebel States,\" passed March 2, 1867, whereby the said Andrew Johnson,\r\nPresident of the United States, did then, to wit, on the 21st day of\r\nFebruary, A.D. 1868, at the city of Washington, commit and was guilty\r\nof a high misdemeanor in office.\r\n\r\nSCHUYLER COLFAX,\r\n\r\n_Speaker of the House of Representatives_.\r\n\r\nAttest:\r\n\r\nEDWARD McPHERSON,\r\n\r\n_Clerk of the House of Representatives_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE SENATE, _March 4, 1868_.\r\n\r\nThe President _pro tempore_ laid before the Senate the following letter\r\nfrom the Hon. Salmon P. Chase, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States:\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 4, 1868_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the sole power to try impeachments is vested by the\r\nConstitution in the Senate, and it is made the duty of the Chief Justice\r\nto preside when the President is on trial, I take the liberty of\r\nsubmitting, very respectfully, some observations in respect to the\r\nproper mode of proceeding upon the impeachment which has been preferred\r\nby the House of Representatives against the President now in office.\r\n\r\nThat when the Senate sits for the trial of an impeachment it sits as a\r\ncourt seems unquestionable.\r\n\r\nThat for the trial of an impeachment of the President this court must be\r\nconstituted of the members of the Senate, with the Chief Justice\r\npresiding, seems equally unquestionable.\r\n\r\nThe Federalist is regarded as the highest contemporary authority on the\r\nconstruction of the Constitution, and in the sixty-fourth number the\r\nfunctions of the Senate \"sitting in their judicial capacity as a court\r\nfor the trial of impeachments\" are examined.\r\n\r\nIn a paragraph explaining the reasons for not uniting \"the Supreme Court\r\nwith the Senate in the formation of the court of impeachments\" it is\r\nobserved that--\r\n\r\n  To a certain extent the benefits of that union will be obtained from\r\n  making the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court the president of the court\r\n  of impeachments, as is proposed by the plan of the Convention, while the\r\n  inconveniences of an entire incorporation of the former into the latter\r\n  will be substantially avoided. This was, perhaps, the prudent mean.\r\n\r\nThis authority seems to leave no doubt upon either of the propositions\r\njust stated; and the statement of them will serve to introduce the\r\nquestion upon which I think it my duty to state the result of my\r\nreflections to the Senate, namely, At what period, in the case of\r\nan impeachment of the President, should the court of impeachment be\r\norganized under oath, as directed by the Constitution?\r\n\r\nIt will readily suggest itself to anyone who reflects upon the abilities\r\nand the learning in the law which distinguish so many Senators that\r\nbesides the reason assigned in the Federalist there must have been still\r\nanother for the provision requiring the Chief Justice to preside in the\r\ncourt of impeachment. Under the Constitution, in case of a vacancy in\r\nthe office of President, the Vice-President succeeds, and it was\r\ndoubtless thought prudent and befitting that the next in succession\r\nshould not preside in a proceeding through which a vacancy might be\r\ncreated.\r\n\r\nIt is not doubted that the Senate, while sitting in its ordinary\r\ncapacity, must necessarily receive from the House of Representatives\r\nsome notice of its intention to impeach the President at its bar,\r\nbut it does not seem to me an unwarranted opinion, in view of this\r\nconstitutional provision, that the organization of the Senate as\r\na court of impeachment, under the Constitution, should precede the\r\nactual announcement of the impeachment on the part of the House.\r\n\r\nAnd it may perhaps be thought a still less unwarranted opinion that\r\narticles of impeachment should only be presented to a court of\r\nimpeachment; that no summons or other process should issue except\r\nfrom the organized court, and that rules for the government of the\r\nproceedings of such a court should be framed only by the court itself.\r\n\r\nI have found myself unable to come to any other conclusions than these.\r\nI can assign no reason for requiring the Senate to organize as a court\r\nunder any other than its ordinary presiding officer for the latter\r\nproceedings upon an impeachment of the President which does not seem\r\nto me to apply equally to the earlier.\r\n\r\nI am informed that the Senate has proceeded upon other views, and it is\r\nnot my purpose to contest what its superior wisdom may have directed.\r\n\r\nAll good citizens will fervently pray that no occasion may ever arise\r\nwhen the grave proceedings now in progress will be cited as a precedent;\r\nbut it is not impossible that such an occasion may come.\r\n\r\nInasmuch, therefore, as the Constitution has charged the Chief Justice\r\nwith an important function in the trial of an impeachment of the\r\nPresident, it has seemed to me fitting and obligatory, where he is\r\nunable to concur in the views of the Senate concerning matters essential\r\nto the trial, that his respectful dissent should appear.\r\n\r\nS.P. CHASE,\r\n\r\n_Chief Justice of the United States_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE SENATE SITTING FOR THE TRIAL OF THE IMPEACHMENT\r\nOF ANDREW JOHNSON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 5, 1868.\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES _vs_. ANDREW JOHNSON, PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Justice of the United States entered the Senate Chamber and\r\nwas conducted to the chair by the committee appointed by the Senate for\r\nthat purpose.\r\n\r\nThe following oath was administered to the Chief Justice by Associate\r\nJustice Nelson, and by the Chief Justice to the members of the Senate:\r\n\r\nI do solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of\r\nthe impeachment of Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, now\r\npending, I will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and\r\nlaws. So help me God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIDAY, MARCH 6, 1868.\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES _vs_. ANDREW JOHNSON, PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nTo accord with the conviction of the Chief Justice[76] that the court\r\nshould adopt its own rules, those adopted on March 2 by the Senate\r\nsitting in its legislative capacity were readopted by the Senate sitting\r\nas a court of impeachment. The rules are as follows:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: See letter from the Chief Justice, pp. 718-720.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRULES OF PROCEDURE AND PRACTICE IN THE SENATE WHEN SITTING ON THE TRIAL\r\nOF IMPEACHMENTS.\r\n\r\nI. Whensoever the Senate shall receive notice from the House of\r\nRepresentatives that managers are appointed on their part to conduct an\r\nimpeachment against any person, and are directed to carry articles of\r\nimpeachment to the Senate, the Secretary of the Senate shall immediately\r\ninform the House of Representatives that the Senate is ready to receive\r\nthe managers for the purpose of exhibiting such articles of impeachment\r\nagreeably to said notice.\r\n\r\nII. When the managers of an impeachment shall be introduced at the bar\r\nof the Senate and shall signify that they are ready to exhibit articles\r\nof impeachment against any person, the Presiding Officer of the Senate\r\nshall direct the Sergeant-at-Arms to make proclamation, who shall, after\r\nmaking proclamation, repeat the following words, viz:\r\n\r\n  All persons are commanded to keep silence, on pain of imprisonment,\r\n  while the House of Representatives is exhibiting to the Senate of the\r\n  United States articles of impeachment against -------- --------.\r\n\r\nafter which the articles shall be exhibited; and then the Presiding\r\nOfficer of the Senate shall inform the managers that the Senate will\r\ntake proper order on the subject of the impeachment, of which due notice\r\nshall be given to the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nIII. Upon such articles being presented to the Senate, the Senate shall,\r\nat 1 o'clock afternoon of the day (Sunday excepted) following such\r\npresentation, or sooner if so ordered by the Senate, proceed to the\r\nconsideration of such articles, and shall continue in session from day\r\nto day (Sundays excepted) after the trial shall commence (unless\r\notherwise ordered by the Senate) until final judgment shall be rendered,\r\nand so much longer as may in its judgment be needful. Before proceeding\r\nto the consideration of the articles of impeachment the Presiding\r\nOfficer shall administer the oath hereinafter provided to the members of\r\nthe Senate then present, and to the other members of the Senate as they\r\nshall appear, whose duty it shall be to take the same.\r\n\r\nIV. When the President of the United States, or the Vice-President\r\nof the United States upon whom the powers and duties of the office of\r\nPresident shall have devolved, shall be impeached, the Chief Justice\r\nof the Supreme Court of the United States shall preside; and in a case\r\nrequiring the said Chief Justice to preside notice shall be given to him\r\nby the Presiding Officer of the Senate of the time and place fixed for\r\nthe consideration of the articles of impeachment as aforesaid, with a\r\nrequest to attend; and the said Chief Justice shall preside over the\r\nSenate during the consideration of said articles and upon the trial\r\nof the person impeached therein.\r\n\r\nV. The Presiding Officer shall have power to make and issue, by himself\r\nor by the Secretary of the Senate, all orders, mandates, writs, and\r\nprecepts authorized by these rules or by the Senate, and to make and\r\nenforce such other regulations and orders in the premises as the Senate\r\nmay authorize or provide.\r\n\r\nVI. The Senate shall have power to compel the attendance of witnesses,\r\nto enforce obedience to its orders, mandates, writs, precepts, and\r\njudgments, to preserve order, and to punish in a summary way contempts\r\nof and disobedience to its authority, orders, mandates, writs, precepts,\r\nor judgments, and to make all lawful orders, rules, and regulations\r\nwhich it may deem essential or conducive to the ends of justice; and the\r\nSergeant-at-Arms, under the direction of the Senate, may employ such aid\r\nand assistance as may be necessary to enforce, execute, and carry into\r\neffect the lawful orders, mandates, writs, and precepts of the Senate.\r\n\r\nVII. The Presiding Officer of the Senate shall direct all necessary\r\npreparations in the Senate Chamber, and the presiding officer upon the\r\ntrial shall direct all the forms of proceeding while the Senate are\r\nsitting for the purpose of trying an impeachment and all forms during\r\nthe trial not otherwise specially provided for. The presiding officer\r\nmay, in the first instance, submit to the Senate, without a division,\r\nall questions of evidence and incidental questions; but the same shall,\r\non the demand of one-fifth of the members present, be decided by yeas\r\nand nays.\r\n\r\nVIII. Upon the presentation of articles of impeachment and the\r\norganization of the Senate as hereinbefore provided, a writ of summons\r\nshall issue to the accused, reciting said articles and notifying him to\r\nappear before the Senate upon a day and at a place to be fixed by the\r\nSenate, and named in such writ, and file his answer to said articles of\r\nimpeachment, and to stand to and abide the orders and judgments of the\r\nSenate thereon, which writ shall be served by such officer or person as\r\nshall be named in the precept thereof such number of days prior to the\r\nday fixed for such appearance as shall be named in such precept, either\r\nby the delivery of an attested copy thereof to the person accused or,\r\nif that can not conveniently be done, by leaving such copy at the last\r\nknown place of abode of such person or at his usual place of business,\r\nin some conspicuous place therein; or, if such service shall be, in the\r\njudgment of the Senate, impracticable, notice to the accused to appear\r\nshall be given in such other manner, by publication or otherwise, as\r\nshall be deemed just; and if the writ aforesaid shall fail of service\r\nin the manner aforesaid, the proceedings shall not thereby abate, but\r\nfurther service may be made in such manner as the Senate shall direct.\r\nIf the accused, after service, shall fail to appear, either in person or\r\nby attorney, on the day so fixed therefor as aforesaid, or, appearing,\r\nshall fail to file his answer to such articles of impeachment, the trial\r\nshall proceed, nevertheless, as upon a plea of not guilty. If a plea of\r\nguilty shall be entered, judgment may be entered thereon without further\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nIX. At 12 o'clock and 30 minutes afternoon of the day appointed for the\r\nreturn of the summons against the person impeached the legislative and\r\nexecutive business of the Senate shall be suspended and the Secretary of\r\nthe Senate shall administer an oath to the returning officer in the form\r\nfollowing, viz:\r\n\r\n  I, -------- --------, do solemnly swear that the return made by me\r\n  upon the process issued on the ---- day of ---- by the Senate of the\r\n  United States against -------- -------- is truly made, and that I have\r\n  performed such service as herein described.\r\n\r\n  So help me God.\r\n\r\nwhich oath shall be entered at large on the records.\r\n\r\nX. The person impeached shall then be called to appear and answer the\r\narticles of impeachment against him. If he appear, or any person for\r\nhim, the appearance shall be recorded, stating particularly if by\r\nhimself or by agent or attorney, naming the person appearing and the\r\ncapacity in which he appears, If he do not appear, either personally\r\nor by agent or attorney, the same shall be recorded.\r\n\r\nXI. At 12 o'clock and 30 minutes afternoon of the day appointed for the\r\ntrial of an impeachment the legislative and executive business of the\r\nSenate shall be suspended and the Secretary shall give notice to the\r\nHouse of Representatives that the Senate is ready to proceed upon the\r\nimpeachment of -------- --------, in the Senate Chamber, which chamber\r\nis prepared with accommodations for the reception of the House of\r\nRepresentatives.\r\n\r\nXII. The hour of the day at which the Senate shall sit upon the trial of\r\nan impeachment shall be (unless otherwise ordered) 12 o'clock m., and\r\nwhen the hour for such sitting shall arrive the Presiding Officer of the\r\nSenate shall so announce; and thereupon the presiding officer upon such\r\ntrial shall cause proclamation to be made, and the business of the trial\r\nshall proceed. The adjournment of the Senate sitting in said trial shall\r\nnot operate as an adjournment of the Senate, but on such adjournment the\r\nSenate shall resume the consideration of its legislative and executive\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nXIII. The Secretary of the Senate shall record the proceedings in cases\r\nof impeachment as in the case of legislative proceedings, and the same\r\nshall be reported in the same manner as the legislative proceedings of\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\nXIV. Counsel for the parties shall be admitted to appear and be heard\r\nupon an impeachment.\r\n\r\nXV. All motions made by the parties or their counsel shall be addressed\r\nto the presiding officer, and if he or any Senator shall require it they\r\nshall be committed to writing and read at the Secretary's table.\r\n\r\nXVI. Witnesses shall be examined by one person on behalf of the party\r\nproducing them and then cross-examined by one person on the other side.\r\n\r\nXVII. If a Senator is called as a witness, he shall be sworn and give\r\nhis testimony standing in his place.\r\n\r\nXVIII. If a Senator wishes a question to be put to a witness, or to\r\noffer a motion or order (except a motion to adjourn), it shall be\r\nreduced to writing and put by the presiding officer.\r\n\r\nXIX. At all times while the Senate is sitting upon the trial of an\r\nimpeachment the doors of the Senate shall be kept open, unless the\r\nSenate shall direct the doors to be closed while deliberating upon\r\nits decisions.\r\n\r\nXX. All preliminary or interlocutory questions and all motions shall be\r\nargued for not exceeding one hour on each side, unless the Senate shall\r\nby order extend the time.\r\n\r\nXXI. The case on each side shall be opened by one person. The final\r\nargument on the merits may be made by two persons on each side (unless\r\notherwise ordered by the Senate, upon application for that purpose),\r\nand the argument shall be opened and closed on the part of the House\r\nof Representatives.\r\n\r\nXXII. On the final question whether the impeachment is sustained the\r\nyeas and nays shall be taken on each article of impeachment separately,\r\nand if the impeachment shall not, upon any of the articles presented, be\r\nsustained by the votes of two-thirds of the members present a judgment\r\nof acquittal shall be entered; but if the person accused in such\r\narticles of impeachment shall be convicted upon any of said articles by\r\nthe votes of two-thirds of the members present the Senate shall proceed\r\nto pronounce judgment, and a certified copy of such judgment shall be\r\ndeposited in the office of the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nXXIII. All the orders and decisions shall be made and had by yeas and\r\nnays, which shall be entered on the record, and without debate, except\r\nwhen the doors shall be closed for deliberation, and in that case no\r\nmember shall speak more than once on one question, and for not more than\r\nten minutes on an interlocutory question, and for not more than fifteen\r\nminutes on the final question, unless by consent of the Senate, to be\r\nhad without debate; but a motion to adjourn may be decided without the\r\nyeas and nays, unless they be demanded by one-fifth of the members\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nXXIV. Witnesses shall be sworn in the following form, viz:\r\n\r\n  You, -------- --------, do swear (or affirm, as the case maybe) that\r\n  the evidence you shall give in the case now depending between the\r\n  United States and -------- -------- shall be the truth, the whole\r\n  truth, and nothing but the truth. So help you God.\r\n\r\nwhich oath shall be administered by the Secretary or any other duly\r\nauthorized person.\r\n\r\n\r\nForm of subpoena to be issued on the application of the managers of\r\nthe impeachment, or of the party impeached, or of his counsel:\r\n\r\n  _To_ -------- --------; _greeting_:\r\n\r\n  You and each of you are hereby commanded to appear before the Senate of\r\n  the United States on the ---- day of ----, at the Senate Chamber, in\r\n  the city of Washington, then and there to testify your knowledge in the\r\n  cause which is before the Senate in which the House of Representatives\r\n  have impeached -------- --------.\r\n\r\n  Fail not.\r\n\r\n  Witness -------- --------, and Presiding Officer of the Senate, at\r\n  the city of Washington, this ---- day of ----, A.D. ----, and of the\r\n  Independence of the United States the ------.\r\n\r\n\r\nForm of direction for the service of said subpoena:\r\n\r\n  _The Senate of the United States to_ -------- --------, _greeting_:\r\n\r\n  You are hereby commanded to serve and return the within subpoena\r\n  according to law.\r\n\r\n  Dated at Washington, this ---- day of ----, A.D. ----, and of the\r\n  Independence of the United States the ------.\r\n\r\n  _Secretary of the Senate_.\r\n\r\n\r\nForm of oath to be administered to the members of the Senate sitting in\r\nthe trial of impeachments:\r\n\r\n  I solemnly swear (or affirm, as the case may be) that in all things\r\n  appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of -------- --------, now\r\n  pending, I will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and\r\n  laws.

If the Senate shall at any time fail to sit for the consideration\r\nof articles of impeachment on the day or hour fixed therefor, the Senate\r\nmay by an order, to be adopted without debate, fix a day and hour for\r\nresuming such consideration.\r\n\r\nOn March 31 Rule VII was amended to read as follows:\r\n\r\nVII. The Presiding Officer of the Senate shall direct all necessary\r\npreparations in the Senate Chamber, and the presiding officer on the\r\ntrial shall direct all the forms of proceeding while the Senate are\r\nsitting for the purpose of trying an impeachment, and all forms during\r\nthe trial not otherwise specially provided for, and the presiding\r\nofficer on the trial may rule all questions of evidence and incidental\r\nquestions, which ruling shall stand as the judgment of the Senate,\r\nunless some member of the Senate shall ask that a formal vote be taken\r\nthereon, in which case it shall be submitted to the Senate for decision;\r\nor he may, at his option, in the first instance submit any such question\r\nto a vote of the members of the Senate.\r\n\r\nOn April 3 Rule VII was further amended by inserting at the end thereof\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\nUpon all such questions the vote shall be without a division, unless the\r\nyeas and nays be demanded by one-fifth of the members present, when the\r\nsame shall be taken.\r\n\r\nOn March 13 Rule XXIII was amended to read as follows:\r\n\r\nXXIII. All the orders and decisions shall be made and had by yeas and\r\nnays, which shall be entered on the record, and without debate, subject,\r\nhowever, to the operation of Rule VII, except when the doors shall be\r\nclosed for deliberation, and in that case no member shall speak more\r\nthan once on one question, and for not more than ten minutes on an\r\ninterlocutory question, and for not more than fifteen minutes on the\r\nfinal question, unless by consent of the Senate, to be had without\r\ndebate; but a motion to adjourn may be decided without the yeas and\r\nnays, unless they be demanded by one-fifth of the members present.\r\n\r\nOn May 7 Rule XXIII was further amended by adding thereto the following:\r\n\r\nThe fifteen minutes herein allowed shall be for the whole deliberation\r\non the final question, and not to the final question on each article of\r\nimpeachment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIDAY, MARCH 13, 1868.\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES _vs_. ANDREW JOHNSON, PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry Stanbery, in behalf of Andrew Johnson, the respondent, read\r\nthe following paper:\r\n\r\nIn the matter of the impeachment of Andrew Johnson, President of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nMr. CHIEF JUSTICE: I, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States,\r\nhaving been served with a summons to appear before this honorable court,\r\nsitting as a court of impeachment, to answer certain articles of\r\nimpeachment found and presented against me by the honorable the House\r\nof Representatives of the United States, do hereby enter my appearance\r\nby my counsel, Henry Stanbery, Benjamin R. Curtis, Jeremiah S. Black,\r\nWilliam M. Evarts, and Thomas A.R. Nelson, who have my warrant and\r\nauthority therefor, and who are instructed by me to ask of this\r\nhonorable court a reasonable time for the preparation of my answer\r\nto said articles. After a careful examination of the articles of\r\nimpeachment and consultation with my counsel, I am satisfied that at\r\nleast forty days will be necessary for the preparation of my answer,\r\nand I respectfully ask that it be allowed.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Stanbery then submitted the following motion:\r\n\r\nIn the matter of the impeachment of Andrew Johnson, President of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nHenry Stanbery, Benjamin R. Curtis, Jeremiah S. Black, William M.\r\nEvarts, and Thomas A.R. Nelson, of counsel for the respondent, move the\r\ncourt for the allowance of forty days for the preparation of the answer\r\nto the articles of impeachment, and in support of the motion make the\r\nfollowing professional statement:\r\n\r\nThe articles are eleven in number, involving many questions of law\r\nand fact. We have during the limited time and opportunity afforded us\r\nconsidered as far as possible the field of investigation which must be\r\nexplored in the preparation of the answer, and the conclusion at which\r\nwe have arrived is that with the utmost diligence the time we have asked\r\nis reasonable and necessary.\r\n\r\nThe precedents as to time for answer upon impeachments before the Senate\r\nto which we have had opportunity to refer are those of Judge Chase and\r\nJudge Peck.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Judge Chase time was allowed from the 3d of January until\r\nthe 4th of February next succeeding to put in his answer--a period of\r\nthirty-two days; but in this case there were only eight articles, and\r\nJudge Chase had been for a year cognizant of most of the articles, and\r\nhad been himself engaged in preparing to meet them.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Judge Peck there was but a single article. Judge Peck\r\nasked for time from the 10th to the 25th of May to put in his answer,\r\nand it was granted. It appears that Judge Peck had been long cognizant\r\nof the ground laid for his impeachment, and had been present before the\r\ncommittee of the House upon the examination of the witnesses, and had\r\nbeen permitted by the House of Representatives to present to that body\r\nan elaborate answer to the charges.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that the President is fairly entitled to more time than\r\nwas allowed in either of the foregoing cases. It is proper to add that\r\nthe respondents in these cases were lawyers, fully capable of preparing\r\ntheir own answers, and that no pressing official duties interfered with\r\ntheir attention to that business; whereas the President, not being a\r\nlawyer, must rely on his counsel. The charges involve his acts,\r\ndeclarations, and intentions, as to all which his counsel must be fully\r\nadvised upon consultation with him, step by step, in the preparation of\r\nhis defense. It is seldom that a case requires such constant\r\ncommunication between client and counsel as this, and yet such\r\ncommunication can only be had at such intervals as are allowed to the\r\nPresident from the usual hours that must be devoted to his high official\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nWe further beg leave to suggest for the consideration of this honorable\r\ncourt that, as counsel careful as well of their own reputation as of\r\nthe interests of their client in a case of such magnitude as this, so\r\nout of the ordinary range of professional experience, where so much\r\nresponsibility is felt, they submit to the candid consideration of the\r\ncourt that they have a right to ask for themselves such opportunity to\r\ndischarge their duty as seems to them to be absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\n  HENRY STANBERY,\r\n  B.R. CURTIS,\r\n  JEREMIAH S. BLACK, \\__ Per H.S.\r\n  WILLIAM M. EVARTS, /\r\n  THOMAS A.R. NELSON,\r\n\r\n_Of Counsel for the Respondent_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above motion was denied, and the Senate adopted the following orders:\r\n\r\n_Ordered_, That the respondent file answer to the articles of\r\nimpeachment on or before Monday, the 23d day of March instant.\r\n\r\n_Ordered_, That unless otherwise ordered by the Senate, for cause shown,\r\nthe trial of the pending impeachment shall proceed immediately after\r\nreplication shall be filed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONDAY, MARCH 23, 1868.\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES _vs_. ANDREW JOHNSON, PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nThe answer of the respondent to the articles of impeachment was\r\nsubmitted by his counsel, as follows:\r\n\r\nSenate of the United States, sitting as a court of impeachment for the\r\ntrial of Andrew Johnson, President of the United States.\r\n\r\nTHE ANSWER OF THE SAID ANDREW JOHNSON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\nTO THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT EXHIBITED AGAINST HIM BY THE HOUSE OF\r\nREPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n_Answer to Article I_.--For answer to the first article he says that\r\nEdwin M. Stanton was appointed Secretary for the Department of War on\r\nthe 15th day of January, A.D. 1862, by Abraham Lincoln, then President\r\nof the United States, during the first term of his Presidency, and was\r\ncommissioned, according to the Constitution and laws of the United\r\nStates, to hold the said office during the pleasure of the President;\r\nthat the office of Secretary for the Department of War was created by an\r\nact of the First Congress in its first session, passed on the 7th day of\r\nAugust, A.D. 1789, and in and by that act it was provided and enacted\r\nthat the said Secretary for the Department of War shall perform and\r\nexecute such duties as shall from time to time be enjoined on and\r\nintrusted to him by the President of the United States, agreeably to the\r\nConstitution, relative to the subjects within the scope of the said\r\nDepartment; and, furthermore, that the said Secretary shall conduct the\r\nbusiness of the said Department in such a manner as the President of the\r\nUnited States shall from time to time order and instruct.\r\n\r\nAnd this respondent, further answering, says that by force of the act\r\naforesaid and by reason of his appointment aforesaid the said Stanton\r\nbecame the principal officer in one of the Executive Departments of the\r\nGovernment within the true intent and meaning of the second section\r\nof the second article of the Constitution of the United States and\r\naccording to the true intent and meaning of that provision of the\r\nConstitution of the United States; and, in accordance with the settled\r\nand uniform practice of each and every President of the United States,\r\nthe said Stanton then became, and so long as he should continue to hold\r\nthe said office of Secretary for the Department of War must continue to\r\nbe, one of the advisers of the President of the United States, as well\r\nas the person intrusted to act for and represent the President in\r\nmatters enjoined upon him or intrusted to him by the President touching\r\nthe Department aforesaid, and for whose conduct in such capacity,\r\nsubordinate to the President, the President is by the Constitution and\r\nlaws of the United States made responsible.\r\n\r\nAnd this respondent, further answering, says he succeeded to the office\r\nof President of the United States upon and by reason of the death of\r\nAbraham Lincoln, then President of the United States, on the 15th day\r\nof April, 1865, and the said Stanton was then holding the said office\r\nof Secretary for the Department of War under and by reason of the\r\nappointment and commission aforesaid; and not having been removed from\r\nthe said office by this respondent, the said Stanton continued to hold\r\nthe same under the appointment and commission aforesaid, at the pleasure\r\nof the President, until the time hereinafter particularly mentioned,\r\nand at no time received any appointment or commission save as above\r\ndetailed.\r\n\r\nAnd this respondent, further answering, says that on and prior to the\r\n5th day of August, A.D. 1867, this respondent, the President of the\r\nUnited States, responsible for the conduct of the Secretary for the\r\nDepartment of War, and having the constitutional right to resort to\r\nand rely upon the person holding that office for advice concerning\r\nthe great and difficult public duties enjoined on the President by\r\nthe Constitution and laws of the United States, became satisfied that\r\nhe could not allow the said Stanton to continue to hold the office\r\nof Secretary for the Department of War without hazard of the public\r\ninterest; that the relations between the said Stanton and the President\r\nno longer permitted the President to resort to him for advice or to be,\r\nin the judgment of the President, safely responsible for his conduct of\r\nthe affairs of the Department of War, as by law required, in accordance\r\nwith the orders and instructions of the President; and thereupon, by\r\nforce of the Constitution and laws of the United States, which devolve\r\non the President the power and the duty to control the conduct of the\r\nbusiness of that Executive Department of the Government, and by reason\r\nof the constitutional duty of the President to take care that the laws\r\nbe faithfully executed, this respondent did necessarily consider and did\r\ndetermine that the said Stanton ought no longer to hold the said office\r\nof Secretary for the Department of War. And this respondent, by virtue\r\nof the power and authority vested in him as President of the United\r\nStates by the Constitution and laws of the United States, to give effect\r\nto such his decision and determination, did, on the 5th day of August,\r\nA.D. 1867, address to the said Stanton a note of which the following\r\nis a true copy:\r\n\r\n  SIR: Public considerations of a high character constrain me to say that\r\n  your resignation as Secretary of War will be accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo which note the said Stanton made the following reply:\r\n\r\n  WAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n  _Washington, August_ 5, _1867_.\r\n\r\n  SIR: Your note of this day has been received, stating that \"public\r\n  considerations of a high character constrain\" you \"to say that\" my\r\n  \"resignation as Secretary of War will be accepted.\"\r\n\r\n  In reply I have the honor to say that public considerations of a high\r\n  character, which alone have induced me to continue at the head of this\r\n  Department, constrain me not to resign the office of Secretary of War\r\n  before the next meeting of Congress.\r\n\r\n  Very respectfully, yours,\r\n\r\n  EDWIN M. STANTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis respondent, as President of the United States, was thereon of\r\nopinion that, having regard to the necessary official relations and\r\nduties of the Secretary for the Department of War to the President of\r\nthe United States, according to the Constitution and laws of the United\r\nStates, and having regard to the responsibility of the President for\r\nthe conduct of the said Secretary, and having regard to the permanent\r\nexecutive authority of the office which the respondent holds under\r\nthe Constitution and laws of the United States, it was impossible,\r\nconsistently with the public interests, to allow the said Stanton to\r\ncontinue to hold the said office of Secretary for the Department of War;\r\nand it then became the official duty of the respondent, as President of\r\nthe United States, to consider and decide what act or acts should and\r\nmight lawfully be done by him, as President of the United States, to\r\ncause the said Stanton to surrender the said office.\r\n\r\nThis respondent was informed and verily believed that it was practically\r\nsettled by the First Congress of the United States, and had been so\r\nconsidered and uniformly and in great numbers of instances acted on by\r\neach Congress and President of the United States, in succession, from\r\nPresident Washington to and including President Lincoln, and from the\r\nFirst Congress to the Thirty-ninth Congress, that the Constitution of\r\nthe United States conferred on the President, as part of the executive\r\npower and as one of the necessary means and instruments of performing\r\nthe executive duty expressly imposed on him by the Constitution of\r\ntaking care that the laws be faithfully executed, the power at any and\r\nall times of removing from office all executive officers for cause to be\r\njudged of by the President alone. This respondent had, in pursuance of\r\nthe Constitution, required the opinion of each principal officer of the\r\nExecutive Departments upon this question of constitutional executive\r\npower and duty, and had been advised by each of them, including\r\nthe said Stanton, Secretary for the Department of War, that under\r\nthe Constitution of the United States this power was lodged by\r\nthe Constitution in the President of the United States, and that,\r\nconsequently, it could be lawfully exercised by him, and the Congress\r\ncould not deprive him thereof; and this respondent, in his capacity of\r\nPresident of the United States, and because in that capacity he was both\r\nenabled and bound to use his best judgment upon this question, did, in\r\ngood faith and with an earnest desire to arrive at the truth, come to\r\nthe conclusion and opinion, and did make the same known to the honorable\r\nthe Senate of the United States by a message dated on the 2d day of\r\nMarch, 1867 (a true copy whereof is hereunto annexed and marked A), that\r\nthe power last mentioned was conferred and the duty of exercising it in\r\nfit cases was imposed on the President by the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, and that the President could not be deprived of this power\r\nor relieved of this duty, nor could the same be vested by law in the\r\nPresident and the Senate jointly, either in part or whole; and this has\r\never since remained and was the opinion of this respondent at the time\r\nwhen he was forced as aforesaid to consider and decide what act or acts\r\nshould and might lawfully be done by this respondent, as President of\r\nthe United States, to cause the said Stanton to surrender the said\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nThis respondent was also then aware that by the first section of \"An act\r\nregulating the tenure of certain civil offices,\" passed March 2, 1867,\r\nby a constitutional majority of both Houses of Congress, it was enacted\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  That every person holding any civil office to which he has been\r\n  appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and every\r\n  person who shall hereafter be appointed to any such office and shall\r\n  become duly qualified to act therein, is and shall be entitled to hold\r\n  such office until a successor shall have been in like manner appointed\r\n  and duly qualified, except as herein otherwise provided: _Provided_,\r\n  That the Secretaries of State, of the Treasury, of War, of the Navy,\r\n  and of the Interior, the Postmaster-General, and the Attorney-General\r\n  shall hold their offices, respectively, for and during the term of the\r\n  President by whom they may have been appointed and one month thereafter,\r\n  subject to removal by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.\r\n\r\nThis respondent was also aware that this act was understood and intended\r\nto be an expression of the opinion of the Congress by which that act\r\nwas passed that the power to remove executive officers for cause might\r\nby law be taken from the President and vested in him and the Senate\r\njointly; and although this respondent had arrived at and still retained\r\nthe opinion above expressed, and verily believed, as he still believes,\r\nthat the said first section of the last-mentioned act was and is wholly\r\ninoperative and void by reason of its conflict with the Constitution of\r\nthe United States, yet, inasmuch as the same had been enacted by the\r\nconstitutional majority in each of the two Houses of that Congress, this\r\nrespondent considered it to be proper to examine and decide whether the\r\nparticular case of the said Stanton, on which it was this respondent's\r\nduty to act, was within or without the terms of that first section of\r\nthe act, or, if within it, whether the President had not the power,\r\naccording to the terms of the act, to remove the said Stanton from the\r\noffice of Secretary for the Department of War; and having, in his\r\ncapacity of President of the United States, so examined and considered,\r\ndid form the opinion that the case of the said Stanton and his tenure of\r\noffice were not affected by the first section of the last-named act.\r\n\r\nAnd this respondent, further answering, says that although a case thus\r\nexisted which, in his judgment, as President of the United States,\r\ncalled for the exercise of the executive power to remove the said\r\nStanton from the office of Secretary for the Department of War; and\r\nalthough this respondent was of opinion, as is above shown, that under\r\nthe Constitution of the United States the power to remove the said\r\nStanton from the said office was vested in the President of the United\r\nStates; and although this respondent was also of the opinion, as is\r\nabove shown, that the case of the said Stanton was not affected by\r\nthe first section of the last-named act; and although each of the\r\nsaid opinions had been formed by this respondent upon an actual case,\r\nrequiring him, in his capacity of President of the United States, to\r\ncome to some judgment and determination thereon, yet this respondent,\r\nas President of the United States, desired and determined to avoid, if\r\npossible, any question of the construction and effect of the said first\r\nsection of the last-named act, and also the broader question of the\r\nexecutive power conferred upon the President of the United States by\r\nthe Constitution of the United States to remove one of the principal\r\nofficers of one of the Executive Departments for cause seeming to him\r\nsufficient; and this respondent also desired and determined that if,\r\nfrom causes over which he could exert no control, it should become\r\nabsolutely necessary to raise and have in some way determined either\r\nor both of the said last-named questions, it was in accordance with the\r\nConstitution of the United States, and was required of the President\r\nthereby, that questions of so much gravity and importance, upon which\r\nthe legislative and executive departments of the Government had\r\ndisagreed, which involved powers considered by all branches of the\r\nGovernment, during its entire history down to the year 1867, to have\r\nbeen confided by the Constitution of the United States to the President,\r\nand to be necessary for the complete and proper execution of his\r\nconstitutional duties, should be in some proper way submitted to that\r\njudicial department of the Government intrusted by the Constitution\r\nwith the power, and subjected by it to the duty, not only of\r\ndetermining finally the construction and effect of all acts of Congress,\r\nbut of comparing them with the Constitution of the United States\r\nand pronouncing them inoperative when found in conflict with that\r\nfundamental law which the people have enacted for the government of\r\nall their servants. And to these ends, first, that through the action\r\nof the Senate of the United States the absolute duty of the President\r\nto substitute some fit person in place of Mr. Stanton as one of his\r\nadvisers, and as a principal subordinate officer whose official conduct\r\nhe was responsible for and had lawful right to control, might, if\r\npossible, be accomplished without the necessity of raising any one\r\nof the questions aforesaid; and, second, if this duty could not\r\nbe so performed, then that these questions, or such of them as might\r\nnecessarily arise, should be judicially determined in manner aforesaid,\r\nand for no other end or purpose, this respondent, as President of the\r\nUnited States, on the 12th day of August, 1867, seven days after the\r\nreception of the letter of the said Stanton of the 5th of August,\r\nhereinbefore stated, did issue to the said Stanton the order\r\nfollowing, namely:\r\n\r\n\r\n  EXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n  _Washington, August 12, 1867_.\r\n\r\n  Hon. EDWIN M. STANTON,\r\n\r\n  _Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n  SIR: By virtue of the power and authority vested in me as President by\r\n  the Constitution and laws of the United States, you are hereby suspended\r\n  from office as Secretary of War, and will cease to exercise any and all\r\n  functions pertaining to the same.\r\n\r\n  You will at once transfer to General Ulysses S. Grant, who has this day\r\n  been authorized and empowered to act as Secretary of War _ad interim_,\r\n  all records, books, papers, and other public property now in your\r\n  custody and charge.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo which said order the said Stanton made the following reply:\r\n\r\n\r\n  WAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n  _Washington City, August 12, 1867_.\r\n\r\n  The PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n  SIR: Your note of this date has been received, informing me that by\r\n  virtue of the powers vested in you as President by the Constitution\r\n  and laws of the United States I am suspended from office as Secretary\r\n  of War, and will cease to exercise any and all functions pertaining to\r\n  the same; and also directing me at once to transfer to General Ulysses\r\n  S. Grant, who has this day been authorized and empowered to act as\r\n  Secretary of War _ad interim_, all records, books, papers, and other\r\n  public property now in my custody and charge.\r\n\r\n  Under a sense of public duty, I am compelled to deny your right under\r\n  the Constitution and laws of the United States, without the advice and\r\n  consent of the Senate and without legal cause, to suspend me from office\r\n  as Secretary of War, or the exercise of any or all functions pertaining\r\n  to the same, or without such advice and consent to compel me to transfer\r\n  to any person the records, books, papers, and public property in my\r\n  custody as Secretary.\r\n\r\n  But inasmuch as the General Commanding the armies of the United States\r\n  has been appointed _ad interim_, and has notified me that he has\r\n  accepted the appointment, I have no alternative but to submit, under\r\n  protest, to superior force.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd this respondent, further answering, says that it is provided in and\r\nby the second section of \"An act regulating the tenure of certain civil\r\noffices\" that the President may suspend an officer from the performance\r\nof the duties of the office held by him, for certain causes therein\r\ndesignated, until the next meeting of the Senate and until the case\r\nshall be acted on by the Senate; that this respondent, as President\r\nof the United States, was advised, and he verily believed, and still\r\nbelieves, that the executive power of removal from office confided to\r\nhim by the Constitution as aforesaid includes the power of suspension\r\nfrom office at the pleasure of the President; and this respondent, by\r\nthe order aforesaid, did suspend the said Stanton from office, not until\r\nthe next meeting of the Senate or until the Senate should have acted\r\nupon the case, but, by force of the power and authority vested in him by\r\nthe Constitution and laws of the United States, indefinitely and at the\r\npleasure of the President; and the order, in form aforesaid, was made\r\nknown to the Senate of the United States on the 12th day of December,\r\nA.D. 1867, as will be more fully hereinafter stated.\r\n\r\nAnd this respondent, further answering, says that in and by the act of\r\nFebruary 13, 1795, it was, among other things, provided and enacted that\r\nin case of vacancy in the office of Secretary for the Department of\r\nWar it shall be lawful for the President, in case he shall think it\r\nnecessary, to authorize any person to perform the duties of that office\r\nuntil a successor be appointed or such vacancy filled, but not exceeding\r\nthe term of six months; and this respondent, being advised and believing\r\nthat such law was in full force and not repealed, by an order dated\r\nAugust 12, 1867, did authorize and empower Ulysses S. Grant, General of\r\nthe armies of the United States, to act as Secretary for the Department\r\nof War _ad interim_, in the form in which similar authority had\r\ntheretofore been given, not until the next meeting of the Senate and\r\nuntil the Senate should act on the case, but at the pleasure of the\r\nPresident, subject only to the limitation of six months in the said\r\nlast-mentioned act contained; and a copy of the last-named order was\r\nmade known to the Senate of the United States on the 12th day of\r\nDecember, A.D. 1867, as will be hereinafter more fully stated; and in\r\npursuance of the design and intention aforesaid, if it should become\r\nnecessary, to submit the said questions to a judicial determination,\r\nthis respondent, at or near the date of the last-mentioned order, did\r\nmake known such his purpose to obtain a judicial decision of the said\r\nquestions, or such of them as might be necessary.\r\n\r\nAnd this respondent, further answering, says that in further pursuance\r\nof his intention and design, if possible, to perform what he judged to\r\nbe his imperative duty, to prevent the said Stanton from longer holding\r\nthe office of Secretary for the Department of War, and at the same time\r\navoiding, if possible, any question respecting the extent of the power\r\nof removal from executive office confided to the President by the\r\nConstitution of the United States, and any question respecting the\r\nconstruction and effect of the first section of the said \"Act regulating\r\nthe tenure of certain civil offices,\" while he should not by any act of\r\nhis abandon and relinquish either a power which he believed the\r\nConstitution had conferred on the President of the United States to\r\nenable him to perform the duties of his office or a power designedly\r\nleft to him by the first section of the act of Congress last aforesaid,\r\nthis respondent did, on the 12th day of December, 1867, transmit to the\r\nSenate of the United States a message, a copy whereof is hereunto\r\nannexed and marked B, wherein he made known the orders aforesaid and\r\nthe reasons which had induced the same, so far as this respondent then\r\nconsidered it material and necessary that the same should be set forth,\r\nand reiterated his views concerning the constitutional power of removal\r\nvested in the President, and also expressed his views concerning the\r\nconstruction of the said first section of the last-mentioned act, as\r\nrespected the power of the President to remove the said Stanton from\r\nthe said office of Secretary for the Department of War, well hoping that\r\nthis respondent could thus perform what he then believed, and still\r\nbelieves, to be his imperative duty in reference to the said Stanton\r\nwithout derogating from the powers which this respondent believed were\r\nconfided to the President by the Constitution and laws, and without\r\nthe necessity of raising judicially any questions respecting the same.\r\n\r\nAnd this respondent, further answering, says that this hope not having\r\nbeen realized, the President was compelled either to allow the said\r\nStanton to resume the said office and remain therein contrary to the\r\nsettled convictions of the President, formed as aforesaid, respecting\r\nthe powers confided to him and the duties required of him by the\r\nConstitution of the United States, and contrary to the opinion formed\r\nas aforesaid that the first section of the last-mentioned act did not\r\naffect the case of the said Stanton, and contrary to the fixed belief\r\nof the President that he could no longer advise with or trust or be\r\nresponsible for the said Stanton in the said office of Secretary for the\r\nDepartment of War, or else he was compelled to take such steps as might\r\nin the judgment of the President be lawful and necessary to raise for a\r\njudicial decision the questions affecting the lawful right of the said\r\nStanton to resume the said office or the power of the said Stanton to\r\npersist in refusing to quit the said office if he should persist in\r\nactually refusing to quit the same; and to this end, and to this end\r\nonly, this respondent did, on the 21st day of February, 1868, issue the\r\norder for the removal of the said Stanton, in the said first article\r\nmentioned and set forth, and the order authorizing the said Lorenzo\r\nThomas to act as Secretary of War _ad interim_, in the said second\r\narticle set forth.\r\n\r\nAnd this respondent, proceeding to answer specifically each substantial\r\nallegation in the said first article, says: He denies that the said\r\nStanton, on the 21st day of February, 1868, was lawfully in possession\r\nof the said office of Secretary for the Department of War. He denies\r\nthat the said Stanton, on the day last mentioned, was lawfully entitled\r\nto hold the said office against the will of the President of the United\r\nStates. He denies that the said order for the removal of the said\r\nStanton was unlawfully issued. He denies that the said order was issued\r\nwith intent to violate the act entitled \"An act regulating the tenure of\r\ncertain civil offices.\" He denies that the said order was a violation of\r\nthe last-mentioned act. He denies that the said order was a violation of\r\nthe Constitution of the United States, or of any law thereof, or of his\r\noath of office. He denies that the said order was issued with an intent\r\nto violate the Constitution of the United States, or any law thereof, or\r\nthis respondent's oath of office; and he respectfully but earnestly\r\ninsists that not only was it issued by him in the performance of what he\r\nbelieved to be an imperative official duty, but in the performance of\r\nwhat this honorable court will consider was, in point of fact, an\r\nimperative official duty. And he denies that any and all substantive\r\nmatters in the said first article contained, in manner and form as the\r\nsame are therein stated and set forth, do by law constitute a high\r\nmisdemeanor in office within the true intent and meaning of the\r\nConstitution of the United States.\r\n\r\n_Answer to Article II_.--And for answer to the second article this\r\nrespondent says that he admits he did issue and deliver to said Lorenzo\r\nThomas the said writing set forth in said second article, bearing\r\ndate at Washington, D.C., February 21, 1868, addressed to Brevet\r\nMajor-General Lorenzo Thomas, Adjutant-General United States Army,\r\nWashington, D.C., and he further admits that the same was so issued\r\nwithout the advice and consent of the Senate of the United States, then\r\nin session; but he denies that he thereby violated the Constitution of\r\nthe United States or any law thereof, or that he did thereby intend to\r\nviolate the Constitution of the United States or the provisions of any\r\nact of Congress; and this respondent refers to his answer to said first\r\narticle for a full statement of the purposes and intentions with which\r\nsaid order was issued, and adopts the same as part of his answer to this\r\narticle; and he further denies that there was then and there no vacancy\r\nin the said office of Secretary for the Department of War, or that he\r\ndid then and there commit or was guilty of a high misdemeanor in office;\r\nand this respondent maintains and will insist--\r\n\r\n1. That at the date and delivery of said writing there was a vacancy\r\nexisting in the office of Secretary for the Department of War.\r\n\r\n2. That notwithstanding the Senate of the United States was then in\r\nsession, it was lawful and according to long and well-established usage\r\nto empower and authorize the said Thomas to act as Secretary of War\r\n_ad interim_.\r\n\r\n3. That if the said act regulating the tenure of civil offices be held\r\nto be a valid law, no provision of the same was violated by the issuing\r\nof said order or by the designation of said Thomas to act as Secretary\r\nof War _ad interim_.\r\n\r\n_Answer to Article III_.--And for answer to said third article this\r\nrespondent says that he abides by his answer to said first and second\r\narticles in so far as the same are responsive to the allegations\r\ncontained in the said third article, and, without here again repeating\r\nthe same answer, prays the same be taken as an answer to this third\r\narticle as fully as if here again set out at length; and as to the new\r\nallegation contained in said third article, that this respondent did\r\nappoint the said Thomas to be Secretary for the Department of War _ad\r\ninterim_, this respondent denies that he gave any other authority to\r\nsaid Thomas than such as appears in said written authority, set out in\r\nsaid article, by which he authorized and empowered said Thomas to act\r\nas Secretary for the Department of War _ad interim_; and he denies\r\nthat the same amounts to an appointment, and insists that it is only\r\na designation of an officer of that Department to act temporarily as\r\nSecretary for the Department of War _ad interim_--until an appointment\r\nshould be made. But whether the said written authority amounts to an\r\nappointment or to a temporary authority or designation, this respondent\r\ndenies that in any sense he did thereby intend to violate the\r\nConstitution of the United States, or that he thereby intended to\r\ngive the said order the character or effect of an appointment in the\r\nconstitutional or legal sense of that term. He further denies that there\r\nwas no vacancy in said office of Secretary for the Department of War\r\nexisting at the date of said written authority.\r\n\r\n_Answer to Article IV_.--And for answer to said fourth article this\r\nrespondent denies that on the said 21st day of February, 1868, at\r\nWashington aforesaid, or at any other time or place, he did unlawfully\r\nconspire with the said Lorenzo Thomas, or with the said Thomas and any\r\nother person or persons, with intent, by intimidations and threats,\r\nunlawfully to hinder and prevent the said Stanton from holding said\r\noffice of Secretary for the Department of War, in violation of the\r\nConstitution of the United States or of the provisions of the said act\r\nof Congress in said article mentioned, or that he did then and there\r\ncommit or was guilty of a high crime in office. On the contrary thereof,\r\nprotesting that the said Stanton was not then and there lawfully the\r\nSecretary for the Department of War, this respondent states that his\r\nsole purpose in authorizing the said Thomas to act as Secretary for the\r\nDepartment of War _ad interim_ was, as is fully stated in his answer to\r\nthe said first article, to bring the question of the right of the said\r\nStanton to hold said office, notwithstanding his said suspension, and\r\nnotwithstanding the said order of removal, and notwithstanding the said\r\nauthority of the said Thomas to act as Secretary of War _ad interim_, to\r\nthe test of a final decision by the Supreme Court of the United States\r\nin the earliest practicable mode by which the question could be brought\r\nbefore that tribunal.\r\n\r\nThis respondent did not conspire or agree with the said Thomas, or any\r\nother person or persons, to use intimidation or threats to hinder or\r\nprevent the said Stanton from holding the said office of Secretary for\r\nthe Department of War, nor did this respondent at any time command\r\nor advise the said Thomas, or any other person or persons, to resort\r\nto or use either threats or intimidation for that purpose. The only\r\nmeans in the contemplation or purpose of respondent to be used are set\r\nforth fully in the said orders of February 21, the first addressed to\r\nMr. Stanton and the second to the said Thomas. By the first order the\r\nrespondent notified Mr. Stanton that he was removed from the said office\r\nand that his functions as Secretary for the Department of War were to\r\nterminate upon the receipt of that order; and he also thereby notified\r\nthe said Stanton that the said Thomas had been authorized to act as\r\nSecretary for the Department of War _ad interim_, and ordered the said\r\nStanton to transfer to him all the records, books, papers, and other\r\npublic property in his custody and charge; and by the second order this\r\nrespondent notified the said Thomas of the removal from office of the\r\nsaid Stanton, and authorized him to act as Secretary for the Department\r\nof War _ad interim_, and directed him to immediately enter upon the\r\ndischarge of the duties pertaining to that office and to receive the\r\ntransfer of all the records, books, papers, and other public property\r\nfrom Mr. Stanton then in his custody and charge.\r\n\r\nRespondent gave no instructions to the said Thomas to use intimidation\r\nor threats to enforce obedience to these orders. He gave him no\r\nauthority to call in the aid of the military or any other force to\r\nenable him to obtain possession of the office or of the books, papers,\r\nrecords, or property thereof. The only agency resorted to, or intended\r\nto be resorted to, was by means of the said Executive orders requiring\r\nobedience. But the Secretary for the Department of War refused to obey\r\nthese orders, and still holds undisturbed possession and custody of that\r\nDepartment and of the records, books, papers, and other public property\r\ntherein. Respondent further states that in execution of the orders so by\r\nthis respondent given to the said Thomas he, the said Thomas, proceeded\r\nin a peaceful manner to demand of the said Stanton a surrender to him of\r\nthe public property in the said Department, and to vacate the possession\r\nof the same, and to allow him, the said Thomas, peaceably to exercise\r\nthe duties devolved upon him by authority of the President. That, as\r\nthis respondent has been informed and believes, the said Stanton\r\nperemptorily refused obedience to the orders so issued. Upon such\r\nrefusal no force or threat of force was used by the said Thomas, by\r\nauthority of the President or otherwise, to enforce obedience, either\r\nthen or at any subsequent time.\r\n\r\nThis respondent doth here except to the sufficiency of the allegations\r\ncontained in said fourth article, and states for ground of exception\r\nthat it is not stated that there was any agreement between this\r\nrespondent and the said Thomas, or any other person or persons, to use\r\nintimidation and threats, nor is there any allegation as to the nature\r\nof said intimidation and threats, or that there was any agreement to\r\ncarry them into execution, or that any step was taken or agreed to be\r\ntaken to carry them into execution; and that the allegation in said\r\narticle that the intent of said conspiracy was to use intimidation and\r\nthreats is wholly insufficient, inasmuch as it is not alleged that the\r\nsaid intent formed the basis or became part of any agreement between the\r\nsaid alleged conspirators; and, furthermore, that there is no allegation\r\nof any conspiracy or agreement to use intimidation or threats.\r\n\r\n_Answer to Article V_.--And for answer to the said fifth article this\r\nrespondent denies that on the said 21st day of February, 1868, or at\r\nany other time or times in the same year before the said 2d day of\r\nMarch, 1868, or at any prior or subsequent time, at Washington\r\naforesaid, or at any other place, this respondent did unlawfully\r\nconspire with the said Thomas, or with any other person or persons,\r\nto prevent or hinder the execution of the said act entitled \"An act\r\nregulating the tenure of certain civil offices,\" or that, in pursuance\r\nof said alleged conspiracy, he did unlawfully attempt to prevent the\r\nsaid Edwin M. Stanton from holding the said office of Secretary for the\r\nDepartment of War, or that he did thereby commit, or that he was thereby\r\nguilty of, a high misdemeanor in office. Respondent, protesting that\r\nsaid Stanton was not then and there Secretary for the Department of War,\r\nbegs leave to refer to his answer given to the fourth article and to his\r\nanswer to the first article as to his intent and purpose in issuing the\r\norders for the removal of Mr. Stanton and the authority given to the\r\nsaid Thomas, and prays equal benefit therefrom as if the same were here\r\nagain repeated and fully set forth.\r\n\r\nAnd this respondent excepts to the sufficiency of the said fifth\r\narticle, and states his ground for such exception that it is not alleged\r\nby what means or by what agreement the said alleged conspiracy was\r\nformed or agreed to be carried out, or in what way the same was\r\nattempted to be carried out, or what were the acts done in pursuance\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n_Answer to Article VI_.--And for answer to the said sixth article this\r\nrespondent denies that on the said 21st day of February, 1868, at\r\nWashington aforesaid, or at any other time or place, he did unlawfully\r\nconspire with the said Thomas by force to seize, take, or possess the\r\nproperty of the United States in the Department of War, contrary to\r\nthe provisions of the said acts referred to in the said article, or\r\neither of them, or with intent to violate either of them. Respondent,\r\nprotesting that said Stanton was not then and there Secretary for the\r\nDepartment of War, not only denies the said conspiracy as charged, but\r\nalso denies any unlawful intent in reference to the custody and charge\r\nof the property of the United States in the said Department of War, and\r\nagain refers to his former answers for a full statement of his intent\r\nand purpose in the premises.\r\n\r\n_Answer to Article VII_.--And for answer to the said seventh article\r\nrespondent denies that on the said 21st day of February, 1868, at\r\nWashington aforesaid, or at any other time and place, he did unlawfully\r\nconspire with the said Thomas with intent unlawfully to seize, take, or\r\npossess the property of the United States in the Department of War, with\r\nintent to violate or disregard the said act in the said seventh article\r\nreferred to, or that he did then and there commit a high misdemeanor in\r\noffice. Respondent, protesting that the said Stanton was not then and\r\nthere Secretary for the Department of War, again refers to his former\r\nanswers, in so far as they are applicable, to show the intent with which\r\nhe proceeded in the premises, and prays equal benefit therefrom as\r\nif the same were here again fully repeated. Respondent further takes\r\nexception to the sufficiency of the allegations of this article as to\r\nthe conspiracy alleged upon the same grounds as stated in the exception\r\nset forth in his answer to said article fourth.\r\n\r\n_Answer to Article VIII_.--And for answer to the said eighth article\r\nthis respondent denies that, on the 21st day of February, 1868, at\r\nWashington aforesaid, or at any other time and place, he did issue\r\nand deliver to the said Thomas the said letter of authority set forth\r\nin the said eighth article with the intent unlawfully to control the\r\ndisbursements of the money appropriated for the military service and\r\nfor the Department of War. This respondent, protesting that there was\r\na vacancy in the office of Secretary of War, admits that he did issue\r\nthe said letter of authority, and he denies that the same was with any\r\nunlawful intent whatever, either to violate the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States or any act of Congress. On the contrary, this respondent\r\nagain affirms that his sole intent was to vindicate his authority as\r\nPresident of the United States, and by peaceful means to bring the\r\nquestion of the right of the said Stanton to continue to hold the said\r\noffice of Secretary of War to a final decision before the Supreme Court\r\nof the United States, as has been hereinbefore set forth; and he prays\r\nthe same benefit from his answer in the premises as if the same were\r\nhere again repeated at length.\r\n\r\n_Answer to Article IX_.--And for answer to the said ninth article\r\nthe respondent states that on the said 22d day of February, 1868, the\r\nfollowing note was addressed to the said Emory by the private secretary\r\nof the respondent:\r\n\r\n\r\n  EXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, D.C.,\r\n\r\n  _February 22, 1868_.\r\n\r\n  GENERAL: The President directs me to say that he will be pleased to have\r\n  you call upon him as early as practicable.\r\n\r\n  Respectfully and truly yours,\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM G. MOORE,\r\n\r\n  _United States Army_.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Emory called at the Executive Mansion according to this request.\r\nThe object of respondent was to be advised by General Emory, as\r\ncommander of the Department of Washington, what changes had been made in\r\nthe military affairs of the department. Respondent had been informed\r\nthat various changes had been made which in no wise had been brought to\r\nhis notice or reported to him from the Department of War or from any\r\nother quarter, and desired to ascertain the facts. After the said Emory\r\nhad explained in detail the changes which had taken place, said Emory\r\ncalled the attention of respondent to a general order which he referred\r\nto, and which this respondent then sent for, when it was produced. It is\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  GENERAL ORDERS, No, 17.\r\n\r\n  WAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n  ADJUTANT-GENERALS OFFICE,\r\n\r\n  _Washington, March 14, 1867_.\r\n\r\n  The following acts of Congress are published for the information and\r\n  government of all concerned:\r\n\r\n  *       *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"II.--PUBLIC--No. 85.\r\n\r\n  \"An act making appropriations for the support of the Army for the year\r\n  ending June 30, 1868, and for other purposes.\r\n\r\n  *       *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"SEC. 2. _And be it further enacted_, That the headquarters of the\r\n  General of the Army of the United States shall be at the city of\r\n  Washington, and all orders and instructions relating to military\r\n  operations issued by the President or Secretary of War shall be issued\r\n  through the General of the Army, and in case of his inability through\r\n  the next in rank. The General of the Army shall not be removed,\r\n  suspended, or relieved from command, or assigned to duty elsewhere than\r\n  at said headquarters, except at his own request, without the previous\r\n  approval of the Senate; and any orders or instructions relating to\r\n  military operations issued contrary to the requirements of this section\r\n  shall be null and void; and any officer who shall issue orders or\r\n  instructions contrary to the provisions of this section shall be deemed\r\n  guilty of a misdemeanor in office; and any officer of the Army who shall\r\n  transmit, convey, or obey any orders or instructions so issued contrary\r\n  to the provisions of this section, knowing that such orders were so\r\n  issued, shall be liable to imprisonment for not less than two nor more\r\n  than twenty years upon conviction thereof in any court of competent\r\n  jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n  *       *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"Approved, March 2, 1867.\"\r\n\r\n  *       *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  By order of the Secretary of War:\r\n\r\n  E.D. TOWNSEND,\r\n\r\n  _Assistant Adjutant-General_.\r\n\r\n  Official:\r\n\r\n  -------- --------,\r\n\r\n  _Assistant Adjutant-General_.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Emory not only called the attention of respondent to this order,\r\nbut to the fact that it was in conformity with a section contained in an\r\nappropriation act passed by Congress. Respondent, after reading the\r\norder, observed:\r\n\r\nThis is not in accordance with the Constitution of the United States,\r\nwhich makes me Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, or of the\r\nlanguage of the commission which you hold.\r\n\r\nGeneral Emory then stated that this order had met the respondent's\r\napproval. Respondent then said in reply, in substance:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Am I to understand that the President of the United States can not give\r\n  an order but through the General in Chief, or General Grant?\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Emory again reiterated the statement that it had met\r\nrespondent's approval, and that it was the opinion of some of the\r\nleading lawyers of the country that this order was constitutional. With\r\nsome further conversation, respondent then inquired the names of the\r\nlawyers who had given the opinion, and he mentioned the names of two.\r\nRespondent then said that the object of the law was very evident,\r\nreferring to the clause in the appropriation act upon which the order\r\npurported to be based. This, according to respondent's recollection,\r\nwas the substance of the conversation had with General Emory.\r\n\r\nRespondent denies that any allegations in the said article of any\r\ninstructions or declarations given to the said Emory then or at any\r\nother time contrary to or in addition to what is hereinbefore set forth\r\nare true. Respondent denies that in said conversation with said Emory he\r\nhad any other intent than to express the opinion then given to the said\r\nEmory, nor did he then or at any time request or order the said Emory\r\nto disobey any law or any order issued in conformity with any law,\r\nor intend to offer any inducement to the said Emory to violate any\r\nlaw. What this respondent then said to General Emory was simply the\r\nexpression of an opinion which he then fully believed to be sound,\r\nand which he yet believes to be so, and that is that by the express\r\nprovisions of the Constitution this respondent, as President, is made\r\nthe Commander in Chief of the armies of the United States, and as such\r\nhe is to be respected, and that his orders, whether issued through the\r\nWar Department, or through the General in Chief, or by any other channel\r\nof communication, are entitled to respect and obedience, and that such\r\nconstitutional power can not be taken from him by virtue of any act of\r\nCongress. Respondent doth therefore deny that by the expression of such\r\nopinion he did commit or was guilty of a high misdemeanor in office;\r\nand the respondent doth further say that the said Article IX lays no\r\nfoundation whatever for the conclusion stated in the said article, that\r\nthe respondent, by reason of the allegations therein contained, was\r\nguilty of a high misdemeanor in office.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the statement made by General Emory that this respondent\r\nhad approved of said act of Congress containing the section referred to,\r\nthe respondent admits that his formal approval was given to said act,\r\nbut accompanied the same by the following message, addressed and sent\r\nwith the act to the House of Representatives, in which House the said\r\nact originated, and from which it came to respondent:\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, D.C., _March 2, 1867_.\r\n\r\n  _To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\n  The act entitled \"An act making appropriations for the support of\r\n  the Army for the year ending June 30, 1868, and for other purposes,\"\r\n  contains provisions to which I must call attention. These provisions\r\n  are contained in the second section, which in certain cases virtually\r\n  deprives the President of his constitutional functions as Commander in\r\n  Chief of the Army, and in the sixth section, which denies to ten States\r\n  of the Union their constitutional right to protect themselves in any\r\n  emergency by means of their own militia. These provisions are out of\r\n  place in an appropriation act, but I am compelled to defeat these\r\n  necessary appropriations if I withhold my signature from the act.\r\n  Pressed by these considerations, I feel constrained to return the bill\r\n  with my signature, but to accompany it with my earnest protest against\r\n  the sections which I have indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent, therefore, did no more than to express to said Emory the\r\nsame opinion which he had so expressed to the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\n_Answer to Article X_.--And in answer to the tenth article and\r\nspecifications thereof the respondent says that on the 14th and 15th\r\ndays of August, in the year 1866, a political convention of delegates\r\nfrom all or most of the States and Territories of the Union was held\r\nin the city of Philadelphia, under the name and style of the National\r\nUnion Convention, for the purpose of maintaining and advancing certain\r\npolitical views and opinions before the people of the United States, and\r\nfor their support and adoption in the exercise of the constitutional\r\nsuffrage in the elections of Representatives and Delegates in Congress\r\nwhich were soon to occur in many of the States and Territories of the\r\nUnion; which said convention, in the course of its proceedings, and\r\nin furtherance of the objects of the same, adopted a \"Declaration of\r\nprinciples\" and \"An address to the people of the United States,\" and\r\nappointed a committee of two of its members from each State and of one\r\nfrom each Territory and one from the District of Columbia to wait upon\r\nthe President of the United States and present to him a copy of the\r\nproceedings of the convention; that on the 18th day of said month of\r\nAugust this committee waited upon the President of the United States\r\nat the Executive Mansion, and was received by him in one of the rooms\r\nthereof, and by their chairman, Hon. Reverdy Johnson, then and now\r\na Senator of the United States, acting and speaking in their behalf,\r\npresented a copy of the proceedings of the convention and addressed the\r\nPresident of the United States in a speech of which a copy (according\r\nto a published report of the same, and, as the respondent believes,\r\nsubstantially a correct report) is hereto annexed as a part of this\r\nanswer, and marked Exhibit C.\r\n\r\nThat thereupon, and in reply to the address of said committee by their\r\nchairman, this respondent addressed the said committee so waiting upon\r\nhim in one of the rooms of the Executive Mansion; and this respondent\r\nbelieves that this his address to said committee is the occasion\r\nreferred to in the first specification of the tenth article; but this\r\nrespondent does not admit that the passages therein set forth, as if\r\nextracts from a speech or address of this respondent upon said occasion,\r\ncorrectly or justly present his speech or address upon said occasion,\r\nbut, on the contrary, this respondent demands and insists that if\r\nthis honorable court shall deem the said article and the said first\r\nspecification thereof to contain allegation of matter cognizable by\r\nthis honorable court as a high misdemeanor in office within the intent\r\nand meaning of the Constitution of the United States, and shall receive\r\nor allow proof in support of the same, that proof shall be required\r\nto be made of the actual speech and address of this respondent on\r\nsaid occasion, which this respondent denies that said article and\r\nspecification contain or correctly or justly represent.\r\n\r\nAnd this respondent, further answering the tenth article and the\r\nspecifications thereof, says that at Cleveland, in the State of Ohio,\r\nand on the 3d day of September, in the year 1866, he was attended by a\r\nlarge assemblage of his fellow-citizens, and in deference and obedience\r\nto their call and demand he addressed them upon matters of public and\r\npolitical consideration; and this respondent believes that said occasion\r\nand address are referred to in the second specification of the tenth\r\narticle; but this respondent does not admit that the passages therein\r\nset forth, as if extracts from a speech of this respondent on said\r\noccasion, correctly or justly present his speech or address upon said\r\noccasion, but, on the contrary, this respondent demands and insists that\r\nif this honorable court shall deem the said article and the said second\r\nspecification thereof to contain allegation of matter cognizable by this\r\nhonorable court as a high misdemeanor in office within the intent and\r\nmeaning of the Constitution of the United States, and shall receive or\r\nallow proof in support of the same, that proof shall be required to be\r\nmade of the actual speech and address of this respondent on said\r\noccasion, which this respondent denies that said article and\r\nspecification contain or correctly or justly represent.\r\n\r\nAnd this respondent, further answering the tenth article and the\r\nspecifications thereof, says that at St. Louis, in the State of\r\nMissouri, and on the 8th day of September, in the year 1866, he was\r\nattended by a numerous assemblage of his fellow-citizens, and in\r\ndeference and obedience to their call and demand he addressed them upon\r\nmatters of public and political consideration; and this respondent\r\nbelieves that said occasion and address are referred to in the third\r\nspecification of the tenth article; but this respondent does not admit\r\nthat the passages therein set forth, as if extracts from a speech of\r\nthis respondent on said occasion, correctly or justly present his speech\r\nor address upon said occasion, but, on the contrary, this respondent\r\ndemands and insists that if this honorable court shall deem the said\r\narticle and the said third specification thereof to contain allegation\r\nof matter cognizable by this honorable court as a high misdemeanor in\r\noffice within the intent and meaning of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, and shall receive or allow proof in support of the same, that\r\nproof shall be required to be made of the actual speech and address of\r\nthis respondent on said occasion, which this respondent denies that the\r\nsaid article and specification contain or correctly or justly represent.\r\n\r\nAnd this respondent, further answering the tenth article, protesting\r\nthat he has not been unmindful of the high duties of his office or of\r\nthe harmony or courtesies which ought to exist and be maintained between\r\nthe executive and legislative branches of the Government of the United\r\nStates, denies that he has ever intended or designed to set aside the\r\nrightful authority or powers of Congress, or attempted to bring into\r\ndisgrace, ridicule, hatred, contempt, or reproach the Congress of the\r\nUnited States, or either branch thereof, or to impair or destroy the\r\nregard or respect of all or any of the good people of the United States\r\nfor the Congress or the rightful legislative power thereof, or to excite\r\nthe odium or resentment of all or any of the good people of the United\r\nStates against Congress and the laws by it duly and constitutionally\r\nenacted. This respondent further says that at all times he has, in his\r\nofficial acts as President, recognized the authority of the several\r\nCongresses of the United States as constituted and organized during his\r\nadministration of the office of President of the United States.\r\n\r\nAnd this respondent, further answering, says that he has from time\r\nto time, under his constitutional right and duty as President of the\r\nUnited States, communicated to Congress his views and opinions in\r\nregard to such acts or resolutions thereof as, being submitted to him\r\nas President of the United States in pursuance of the Constitution,\r\nseemed to this respondent to require such communications; and he has\r\nfrom time to time, in the exercise of that freedom of speech which\r\nbelongs to him as a citizen of the United States, and, in his political\r\nrelations as President of the United States to the people of the United\r\nStates, is upon fit occasions a duty of the highest obligation, expressed\r\nto his fellow-citizens his views and opinions respecting the measures\r\nand proceedings of Congress; and that in such addresses to his\r\nfellow-citizens and in such his communications to Congress he has\r\nexpressed his views, opinions, and judgment of and concerning the actual\r\nconstitution of the two Houses of Congress, without representation\r\ntherein of certain States of the Union, and of the effect that in wisdom\r\nand justice, in the opinion and judgment of this respondent, Congress\r\nin its legislation and proceedings should give to this political\r\ncircumstance; and whatsoever he has thus communicated to Congress\r\nor addressed to his fellow-citizens or any assemblage thereof this\r\nrespondent says was and is within and according to his right and\r\nprivilege as an American citizen and his right and duty as President\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nAnd this respondent, not waiving or at all disparaging his right\r\nof freedom of opinion and of freedom of speech, as hereinbefore or\r\nhereinafter more particularly set forth, but claiming and insisting upon\r\nthe same, further answering the said tenth article, says that the views\r\nand opinions expressed by this respondent in his said addresses to\r\nthe assemblages of his fellow-citizens, as in said articles or in this\r\nanswer thereto mentioned, are not and were not intended to be other\r\nor different from those expressed by him in his communications to\r\nCongress--that the eleven States lately in insurrection never had\r\nceased to be States of the Union, and that they were then entitled\r\nto representation in Congress by loyal Representatives and Senators\r\nas fully as the other States of the Union, and that consequently the\r\nCongress as then constituted was not in fact a Congress of all the\r\nStates, but a Congress of only a part of the States. This respondent,\r\nalways protesting against the unauthorized exclusion therefrom of the\r\nsaid eleven States, nevertheless gave his assent to all laws passed by\r\nsaid Congress which did not, in his opinion and judgment, violate the\r\nConstitution, exercising his constitutional authority of returning bills\r\nto said Congress with his objections when they appeared to him to be\r\nunconstitutional or inexpedient.\r\n\r\nAnd further, this respondent has also expressed the opinion, both in\r\nhis communications to Congress and in his addresses to the people, that\r\nthe policy adopted by Congress in reference to the States lately in\r\ninsurrection did not tend to peace, harmony, and union, but, on the\r\ncontrary, did tend to disunion and the permanent disruption of the\r\nStates, and that in following its said policy laws had been passed by\r\nCongress in violation of the fundamental principles of the Government,\r\nand which tended to consolidation and despotism; and such being his\r\ndeliberate opinions, he would have felt himself unmindful of the\r\nhigh duties of his office if he had failed to express them in his\r\ncommunications to Congress or in his addresses to the people when called\r\nupon by them to express his opinions on matters of public and political\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nAnd this respondent, further answering the tenth article, says that he\r\nhas always claimed and insisted, and now claims and insists, that both\r\nin the personal and private capacity of a citizen of the United States\r\nand in the political relations of the President of the United States to\r\nthe people of the United States, whose servant, under the duties and\r\nresponsibilities of the Constitution of the United States, the President\r\nof the United States is and should always remain, this respondent had\r\nand has the full right, and in his office of President of the United\r\nStates is held to the high duty, of forming, and on fit occasions\r\nexpressing, opinions of and concerning the legislation of Congress,\r\nproposed or completed, in respect of its wisdom, expediency, justice,\r\nworthiness, objects, purposes, and public and political motives and\r\ntendencies, and within and as a part of such right and duty to form,\r\nand on fit occasions to express, opinions of and concerning the public\r\ncharacter and conduct, views, purposes, objects, motives, and tendencies\r\nof all men engaged in the public service, as well in Congress as\r\notherwise, and under no other rules or limits upon this right of\r\nfreedom of opinion and of freedom of speech, or of responsibility and\r\namenability for the actual exercise of such freedom of opinion and\r\nfreedom of speech, than attend upon such rights and their exercise on\r\nthe part of all other citizens of the United States and on the part of\r\nall their public servants.\r\n\r\nAnd this respondent, further answering said tenth article, says\r\nthat the several occasions on which, as is alleged in the several\r\nspecifications of said article, this respondent addressed his\r\nfellow-citizens on subjects of public and political considerations were\r\nnot, nor was any one of them, sought or planned by this respondent, but,\r\non the contrary, each of said occasions arose upon the exercise of a\r\nlawful and accustomed right of the people of the United States to call\r\nupon their public servants and express to them their opinions, wishes,\r\nand feelings upon matters of public and political consideration, and to\r\ninvite from such their public servants an expression of their opinions,\r\nviews, and feelings on matters of public and political consideration;\r\nand this respondent claims and insists before this honorable court, and\r\nbefore all the people of the United States, that of or concerning this\r\nhis right of freedom of opinion and of freedom of speech, and this\r\nhis exercise of such rights on all matters of public and political\r\nconsideration, and in respect of all public servants or persons\r\nwhatsoever engaged in or connected therewith, this respondent, as\r\na citizen or as President of the United States, is not subject to\r\nquestion, inquisition, impeachment, or inculpation in any form or\r\nmanner whatsoever.\r\n\r\nAnd this respondent says that neither the said tenth article nor any\r\nspecification thereof nor any allegation therein contained touches or\r\nrelates to any official act or doing of this respondent in the office\r\nof President of the United States or in the discharge of any of its\r\nconstitutional or legal duties or responsibilities; but said article and\r\nthe specifications and allegations thereof, wholly and in every part\r\nthereof, question only the discretion or propriety of freedom of opinion\r\nor freedom, of speech as exercised by this respondent as a citizen of\r\nthe United States in his personal right and capacity, and without\r\nallegation or imputation against this respondent of the violation of any\r\nlaw of the United States touching or relating to freedom of speech or\r\nits exercise by the citizens of the United States or by this respondent\r\nas one of the said citizens or otherwise; and he denies that by reason\r\nof any matter in said article or its specifications alleged he has said\r\nor done anything indecent or unbecoming in the Chief Magistrate of the\r\nUnited States, or that he has brought the high office of President of\r\nthe United States into contempt, ridicule, or disgrace, or that he has\r\ncommitted or has been guilty of a high misdemeanor in office.\r\n\r\n_Answer to Article XI_.--And in answer to the eleventh article this\r\nrespondent denies that on the 18th day of August, in the year 1866, at\r\nthe city of Washington, in the District of Columbia, he did, by public\r\nspeech or otherwise, declare or affirm, in substance or at all, that the\r\nThirty-ninth Congress of the United States was not a Congress of the\r\nUnited States authorized by the Constitution to exercise legislative\r\npower under the same, or that he did then and there declare or affirm\r\nthat the said Thirty-ninth Congress was a Congress of only part of the\r\nStates in any sense or meaning other than that ten States of the Union\r\nwere denied representation therein, or that he made any or either of\r\nthe declarations or affirmations in this behalf in the said article\r\nalleged as denying or intending to deny that the legislation of said\r\nThirty-ninth Congress was valid or obligatory upon this respondent\r\nexcept so far as this respondent saw fit to approve the same; and as to\r\nthe allegation in said article that he did thereby intend or mean to be\r\nunderstood that the said Congress had not power to propose amendments\r\nto the Constitution, this respondent says that in said address he said\r\nnothing in reference to the subject of amendments of the Constitution,\r\nnor was the question of the competency of the said Congress to propose\r\nsuch amendments, without the participation of said excluded States,\r\nat the time of said address in any way mentioned or considered or\r\nreferred to by this respondent, nor in what he did say had he any\r\nintent regarding the same; and he denies the allegations so made\r\nto the contrary thereof. But this respondent, in further answer to\r\nand in respect of the said allegations of the said eleventh article\r\nhereinbefore traversed and denied, claims and insists upon his personal\r\nand official right of freedom of opinion and freedom of speech, and his\r\nduty in his political relations as President of the United States to the\r\npeople of the United States in the exercise of such freedom of opinion\r\nand freedom of speech, in the same manner, form, and effect as he has\r\nin this behalf stated the same in his answer to the said tenth article,\r\nand with the same effect as if he here repeated the same; and he further\r\nclaims and insists, as in said answer to said tenth article he has\r\nclaimed and insisted, that he is not subject to question, inquisition,\r\nimpeachment or inculpation, in any form or manner, of or concerning such\r\nrights of freedom of opinion or freedom of speech, or his said alleged\r\nexercise thereof.\r\n\r\nAnd this respondent further denies that on the 21st day of February,\r\nin the year 1868, or at any other time, at the city of Washington, in\r\nthe District of Columbia, in pursuance of any such declaration as in\r\nthat behalf in said eleventh article alleged, or otherwise, he did\r\nunlawfully, and in disregard of the requirement of the Constitution that\r\nhe should take care that the laws should be faithfully executed, attempt\r\nto prevent the execution of an act entitled \"An act regulating the\r\ntenure of certain civil offices,\" passed March 2, 1867, by unlawfully\r\ndevising or contriving, or attempting to devise or contrive, means by\r\nwhich he should prevent Edwin M. Stanton from forthwith resuming the\r\nfunctions of Secretary for the Department of War, or by unlawfully\r\ndevising or contriving, or attempting to devise or contrive, means to\r\nprevent the execution of an act entitled \"An act making appropriations\r\nfor the support of the Army for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1868,\r\nand for other purposes,\" approved March 2, 1867, or to prevent the\r\nexecution of an act entitled \"An act to provide for the more efficient\r\ngovernment of the rebel States,\" passed March 2, 1867.\r\n\r\nAnd this respondent, further answering the said eleventh article, says\r\nthat he has in his answer to the first article set forth in detail the\r\nacts, steps, and proceedings done and taken by this respondent to and\r\ntoward or in the matter of the suspension or removal of the said Edwin\r\nM. Stanton in or from the office of Secretary for the Department of War,\r\nwith the times, modes, circumstances, intents, views, purposes, and\r\nopinions of official obligations and duty under and with which such\r\nacts, steps, and proceedings were done and taken; and he makes answer to\r\nthis eleventh article of the matters in his answer to the first article\r\npertaining to the suspension or removal of said Edwin M. Stanton, to the\r\nsame intent and effect as if they were here repeated and set forth.\r\n\r\nAnd this respondent, further answering the said eleventh article,\r\ndenies that by means or reason of anything in said article alleged this\r\nrespondent, as President of the United States, did, on the 21st day of\r\nFebruary, 1868, or at any other day or time, commit or that he was\r\nguilty of a high misdemeanor in office.\r\n\r\nAnd this respondent, further answering the said eleventh article, says\r\nthat the same and the matters therein contained do not charge or allege\r\nthe commission of any act whatever by this respondent in his office of\r\nPresident of the United States, nor the omission by this respondent of\r\nany act of official obligation or duty in his office of President of\r\nthe United States; nor does the said article nor the matters therein\r\ncontained name, designate, describe, or define any act or mode or form\r\nof attempt, device, contrivance, or means, or of attempt at device,\r\ncontrivance, or means, whereby this respondent can know or understand\r\nwhat act or mode or form of attempt, device, contrivance, or means, or\r\nof attempt at device, contrivance, or means, are imputed to or charged\r\nagainst this respondent in his office of President of the United States,\r\nor intended so to be, or whereby this respondent can more fully or\r\ndefinitely make answer unto the said article than he hereby does.\r\n\r\nAnd this respondent, in submitting to this honorable court this\r\nhis answer to the articles of impeachment exhibited against him,\r\nrespectfully reserves leave to amend and add to the same from time to\r\ntime, as may become necessary or proper, and when and as such necessity\r\nand propriety shall appear.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n  HENRY STANBERY,\r\n  B.R. CURTIS,\r\n  THOMAS A.R. NELSON,\r\n  WILLIAM M. EVARTS,\r\n  W.S. GROESBECK,\r\n\r\n_Of Counsel_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[For Exhibits A and B see veto message of March 2, 1867, pp. 492-498,\r\nand special message of December 12, 1867, pp. 583-594.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT C.\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE PRESIDENT BY HON. REVERDY JOHNSON, AUGUST, 18, 1866.\r\n\r\nMr. PRESIDENT: We are before you as a committee of the National Union\r\nConvention, which met in Philadelphia on Tuesday, the 14th instant,\r\ncharged with the duty of presenting you with an authentic copy of its\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nBefore placing it in your hands you will permit us to congratulate\r\nyou that in the object for which the convention was called, in the\r\nenthusiasm with which in every State and Territory the call was\r\nresponded to, in the unbroken harmony of its deliberations, in the\r\nunanimity with which the principles it has declared were adopted, and\r\nmore especially in the patriotic and constitutional character of the\r\nprinciples themselves, we are confident that you and the country will\r\nfind gratifying and cheering evidence that there exists among the people\r\na public sentiment which renders an early and complete restoration of\r\nthe Union as established by the Constitution certain and inevitable.\r\nParty faction, seeking the continuance of its misrule, may momentarily\r\ndelay it, but the principles of political liberty for which our\r\nfathers successfully contended, and to secure which they adopted the\r\nConstitution, are so glaringly inconsistent with the condition in\r\nwhich the country has been placed by such misrule that it will not\r\nbe permitted a much longer duration.\r\n\r\nWe wish, Mr. President, you could have witnessed the spirit of concord\r\nand brotherly affection which animated every member of the convention.\r\nGreat as your confidence has ever been in the intelligence and\r\npatriotism of your fellow-citizens, in their deep devotion to the Union\r\nand their present determination to reinstate and maintain it, that\r\nconfidence would have become a positive conviction could you have seen\r\nand heard all that was done and said upon the occasion. Every heart\r\nwas evidently full of joy; every eye beamed with patriotic animation;\r\ndespondency gave place to the assurance that, our late dreadful civil\r\nstrife ended, the blissful reign of peace, under the protection, not of\r\narms, but of the Constitution and laws, would have sway, and be in every\r\npart of our land cheerfully acknowledged and in perfect good faith\r\nobeyed. You would not have doubted that the recurrence of dangerous\r\ndomestic insurrections in the future is not to be apprehended.\r\n\r\nIf you could have seen the men of Massachusetts and South Carolina\r\ncoming into the convention on the first day of its meeting hand in hand,\r\namid the rapturous applause of the whole body, awakened by heartfelt\r\ngratification at the event, filling the eyes of thousands with tears of\r\njoy, which they neither could nor desired to repress, you would have\r\nfelt, as every person present felt, that the time had arrived when all\r\nsectional or other perilous dissensions had ceased, and that nothing\r\nshould be heard in the future but the voice of harmony proclaiming\r\ndevotion to a common country, of pride in being bound together by a\r\ncommon Union, existing and protected by forms of government proved by\r\nexperience to be eminently fitted for the exigencies of either war or\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nIn the principles announced by the convention and in the feeling there\r\nmanifested we have every assurance that harmony throughout our entire\r\nland will soon prevail. We know that as in former days, as was\r\neloquently declared by Webster, the nation's most gifted statesman,\r\nMassachusetts and South Carolina went \"shoulder to shoulder through the\r\nRevolution\" and stood hand in hand \"around the Administration of\r\nWashington and felt his own great arm lean on them for support,\" so will\r\nthey again, with like magnanimity, devotion, and power, stand round your\r\nAdministration and cause you to feel that you may also lean on them for\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nIn the proceedings, Mr. President, which we are to place in your hands\r\nyou will find that the convention performed the grateful duty imposed\r\nupon them by their knowledge of your \"devotion to the Constitution and\r\nlaws and interests of your country,\" as illustrated by your entire\r\nPresidential career, of declaring that in you they \"recognize a Chief\r\nMagistrate worthy of the nation and equal to the great crisis upon\r\nwhich your lot is cast;\" and in this declaration it gives us marked\r\npleasure to add we are confident that the convention has but spoken the\r\nintelligent and patriotic sentiment of the country. Ever inaccessible to\r\nthe low influences which often control the mere partisan, governed alone\r\nby an honest opinion of constitutional obligations and rights and of the\r\nduty of looking solely to the true interests, safety, and honor of the\r\nnation, such a class is incapable of resorting to any bait for\r\npopularity at the expense of the public good.\r\n\r\nIn the measures which you have adopted for the restoration of the Union\r\nthe convention saw only a continuance of the policy which for the same\r\npurpose was inaugurated by your immediate predecessor. In his reelection\r\nby the people, after that policy had been fully indicated and had been\r\nmade one of the issues of the contest, those of his political friends\r\nwho are now assailing you for sternly pursuing it are forgetful or\r\nregardless of the opinions which their support of his reelection\r\nnecessarily involved. Being upon the same ticket with that much-lamented\r\npublic servant, whose foul assassination touched the heart of the\r\ncivilized world with grief and horror, you would have been false to\r\nobvious duty if you had not endeavored to carry out the same policy;\r\nand, judging now by the opposite one which Congress has pursued, its\r\nwisdom and patriotism are indicated by the fact that that of Congress\r\nhas but continued a broken Union by keeping ten of the States in which\r\nat one time the insurrection existed (as far as they could accomplish\r\nit) in the condition of subjugated provinces, denying to them the right\r\nto be represented, while subjecting their people to every species of\r\nlegislation, including that of taxation. That such a state of things is\r\nat war with the very genius of our Government, inconsistent with every\r\nidea of political freedom, and most perilous to the peace and safety of\r\nthe country no reflecting man can fail to believe.\r\n\r\nWe hope, sir, that the proceedings of the convention will cause you to\r\nadhere, if possible, with even greater firmness to the course which you\r\nare pursuing, by satisfying you that the people are with you, and that\r\nthe wish which lies nearest to their heart is that a perfect restoration\r\nof our Union at the earliest moment be attained, and a conviction that\r\nthe result can only be accomplished by the measures which you are\r\npursuing. And in the discharge of the duties which these impose upon\r\nyou we, as did every member of the convention, again for ourselves\r\nindividually tender to you our profound respect and assurance of our\r\ncordial and sincere support.\r\n\r\nWith a reunited Union, with no foot but that of a freeman treading or\r\npermitted to tread our soil, with a nation's faith pledged forever to a\r\nstrict observance of all its obligations, with kindness and fraternal\r\nlove everywhere prevailing, the desolations of war will soon be removed;\r\nits sacrifices of life, sad as they have been, will, with Christian\r\nresignation, be referred to a providential purpose of fixing our beloved\r\ncountry on a firm and enduring basis, which will forever place our\r\nliberty and happiness beyond the reach of human peril.\r\n\r\nThen, too, and forever, will our Government challenge the admiration and\r\nreceive the respect of the nations of the world, and be in no danger of\r\nany efforts to impeach our honor.\r\n\r\nAnd permit me, sir, in conclusion, to add that, great as is your\r\nsolicitude for the restoration of our domestic peace and your labors\r\nto that end, you have also a watchful eye to the rights of the nation,\r\nand that any attempt by an assumed or actual foreign power to enforce\r\nan illegal blockade against the Government or citizens of the United\r\nStates, to use your own mild but expressive words, \"will be disallowed.\"\r\nIn this determination I am sure you will receive the unanimous approval\r\nof your fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nNow, sir, as the chairman of this committee, and in behalf of the\r\nconvention, I have the honor to present you with an authentic copy\r\nof its proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Counsel for the respondent submitted the following motion:\r\n\r\n  _To the Senate of the United States sitting as a court of impeachment_:\r\n\r\n  And now, on this 23d day of March, in the year 1868, the counsel for\r\n  the President of the United States, upon reading and filing his answer\r\n  to the articles of impeachment exhibited against him, respectfully\r\n  represent to the honorable court that after the replication shall have\r\n  been filed to the said answer the due and proper preparation of and for\r\n  the trial of the cause will require, in the opinion and judgment of such\r\n  counsel, that a period of not less than thirty days should be allowed to\r\n  the President of the United States and his counsel for such preparation,\r\n  and before the said trial should proceed.\r\n\r\n  HENRY STANBERY,\r\n  B.R. CURTIS,\r\n  THOMAS A.R. NELSON,\r\n  WM. M. EVARTS,\r\n  W.S. GROESBECK,\r\n\r\n  _Of Counsel_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTUESDAY, MARCH 24, 1868.\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES _vs_. ANDREW JOHNSON, PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nREPLICATION BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES TO\r\nTHE ANSWER OF ANDREW JOHNSON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, TO THE\r\nARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT EXHIBITED AGAINST HIM BY THE HOUSE OF\r\nREPRESENTATIVES.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives of the United States have considered the\r\nseveral answers of Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, to\r\nthe several articles of impeachment against him, by them exhibited in\r\nthe name of themselves and of all the people of the United States, and\r\nreserving to themselves all advantage of exception to the insufficiency\r\nof his answer to each and all of the several articles of impeachment\r\nexhibited against said Andrew Johnson, President of the United States,\r\ndo deny each and every averment in said several answers, or either\r\nof them, which denies or traverses the acts, intents, crimes, or\r\nmisdemeanors charged against said Andrew Johnson in the said articles of\r\nimpeachment, or either of them, and for replication to the said answer\r\ndo say that said Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, is\r\nguilty of the high crimes and misdemeanors mentioned in said articles,\r\nand that the House of Representatives are ready to prove the same.\r\n\r\nSCHUYLER COLFAX,\r\n\r\n_Speaker of the House of Representatives_.\r\n\r\nEDW'D McPHERSON,\r\n\r\n_Clerk of the House of Representatives_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe motion of the counsel for the respondent, submitted on March 23,\r\n\"that a period of not less than thirty days should be allowed to the\r\nPresident of the United States and his counsel for such preparation and\r\nbefore the said trial should proceed,\" was denied, and it was\r\n\r\n  _Ordered_. That the Senate will commence the trial of the President\r\n  upon the articles of impeachment exhibited against him on Monday, the\r\n  30th of March instant, and proceed therein with all convenient dispatch\r\n  under the rules of the Senate sitting upon the trial of an impeachment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONDAY, MAY 11, 1868.\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES _vs_. ANDREW JOHNSON, PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Justice stated that in compliance with the desire of the\r\nSenate he had prepared the question to be addressed to Senators upon\r\neach article of impeachment, and that he had reduced his views thereon\r\nto writing, which he read, as follows:\r\n\r\nSENATORS: In conformity with what seemed to be the general wish of the\r\nSenate when it adjourned last Thursday, the Chief Justice, in taking the\r\nvote on the articles of impeachment, will adopt the mode sanctioned by\r\nthe practice in the cases of Chase, Peck, and Humphreys.\r\n\r\nHe will direct the Secretary to read the several articles successively,\r\nand after the reading of each article will put the question of guilty or\r\nnot guilty to each Senator, rising in his place, in the form used in the\r\ncase of Judge Chase:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Senator ----, how say you? Is the respondent, Andrew Johnson,\r\n  President of the United States, guilty or not guilty of a high\r\n  misdemeanor, as charged in this article?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn putting the question on Articles IV and VI, each of which charges a\r\ncrime, the word \"crime\" will be substituted for the word \"misdemeanor.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chief Justice has carefully considered the suggestion of the Senator\r\nfrom Indiana (Mr. Hendricks), which appeared to meet the approval of the\r\nSenate, that in taking the vote on the eleventh article the question\r\nshould be put on each clause, and has found himself unable to divide the\r\narticle as suggested. The article charges several facts, but they are so\r\nconnected that they make but one allegation and they are charged as\r\nconstituting one misdemeanor.\r\n\r\nThe first fact charged is, in substance, that the President publicly\r\ndeclared in August, 1866, that the Thirty-ninth Congress was a Congress\r\nof only part of the States and not a constitutional Congress, intending\r\nthereby to deny its constitutional competency to enact laws or propose\r\namendments of the Constitution; and this charge seems to have been made\r\nas introductory, and as qualifying that which follows, namely, that the\r\nPresident, in pursuance of this declaration, attempted to prevent the\r\nexecution of the tenure-of-office act by contriving and attempting to\r\ncontrive means to prevent Mr. Stanton from resuming the functions of\r\nSecretary of War after the refusal of the Senate to concur in his\r\nsuspension, and also by contriving and attempting to contrive means to\r\nprevent the execution of the appropriation act of March 2, 1867, and\r\nalso to prevent the execution of the rebel States governments act of\r\nthe same date.\r\n\r\nThe gravamen of the article seems to be that the President attempted\r\nto defeat the execution of the tenure-of-office act, and that he\r\ndid this in pursuance of a declaration which was intended to deny\r\nthe constitutional competency of Congress to enact laws or propose\r\nconstitutional amendments, and by contriving means to prevent Mr.\r\nStanton from resuming his office of Secretary, and also to prevent the\r\nexecution of the appropriation act and the rebel States governments act.\r\n\r\nThe single substantive matter charged is the attempt to prevent the\r\nexecution of the tenure-of-office act, and the other facts are alleged\r\neither as introductory and exhibiting this general purpose or as showing\r\nthe means contrived in furtherance of that attempt.\r\n\r\nThis single matter, connected with the other matters previously and\r\nsubsequently alleged, is charged as the high misdemeanor of which the\r\nPresident is alleged to have been guilty.\r\n\r\nThe general question, guilty or not guilty of a high misdemeanor as\r\ncharged, seems fully to cover the whole charge, and will be put as to\r\nthis article as well as to the others, unless the Senate direct some\r\nmode of division.\r\n\r\nIn the tenth article the division suggested by the Senator from New York\r\n(Mr. Conkling) may be more easily made. It contains a general allegation\r\nto the effect that on the 18th of August and on other days the\r\nPresident, with intent to set aside the rightful authority of Congress\r\nand bring it into contempt, delivered certain scandalous harangues, and\r\ntherein uttered loud threats and bitter menaces against Congress and the\r\nlaws of the United States enacted by Congress, thereby bringing the\r\noffice of President into disgrace, to the great scandal of all good\r\ncitizens, and sets forth in three distinct specifications the harangues,\r\nthreats, and menaces complained of.\r\n\r\nIn respect to this article, if the Senate sees fit so to direct, the\r\nquestion of guilty or not guilty of the facts charged may be taken in\r\nrespect to the several specifications, and then the question of guilty\r\nor not guilty of a high misdemeanor, as charged in the article, can also\r\nbe taken.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Justice, however, sees no objection to putting the general\r\nquestion on this article in the same manner as on the others; for,\r\nwhether particular questions be put on the specifications or not, the\r\nanswer to the final question must be determined by the judgment of the\r\nSenate whether or not the facts alleged in the specifications have been\r\nsufficiently proved, and whether, if sufficiently proved, they amount\r\nto a high misdemeanor within the meaning of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, therefore, the Chief Justice thinks that the better\r\npractice will be to put the general question on each article without\r\nattempting to make any subdivision, and will pursue this course if no\r\nobjection is made. He will, however, be pleased to conform to such\r\ndirections as the Senate may see fit to give in this respect.\r\n\r\nWhereupon it was\r\n\r\n  _Ordered_, That the question be put as proposed by the Presiding\r\n  Officer of the Senate, and each Senator shall rise in his place and\r\n  answer \"guilty\" or \"not guilty\" only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSATURDAY, MAY 16, 1868.\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES _vs_. ANDREW JOHNSON, PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Justice stated that, in pursuance of the order of the Senate,\r\nhe would first proceed to take the judgment of the Senate on the\r\neleventh article. The roll of the Senate was called, with the following\r\nresult:\r\n\r\nThe Senators who voted \"guilty\" are Messrs.

ANDREW JOHNSON, PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nThe Senate ordered that the vote be taken upon the second article of\r\nimpeachment.

The roll of the Senate was called, with the following\r\nresult:\r\n\r\nThe Senators who voted \"guilty\" are Messrs. Anthony, Cameron, Cattell,\r\nChandler, Cole, Conkling, Conness, Corbett, Cragin, Drake, Edmunds,\r\nFerry, Frelinghuysen, Harlan, Howard, Howe, Morgan, Morrill of Maine,\r\nMorrill of Vermont, Morton, Nye, Patterson of New Hampshire, Pomeroy,\r\nRamsey, Sherman, Sprague, Stewart, Sumner, Thayer, Tipton, Wade, Willey,\r\nWilliams, Wilson, and Yates--35.\r\n\r\nThe Senators who voted \"not guilty\" are Messrs.
