RICHARDSON\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Adams\r\n\r\nMarch 4, 1797, to March 4, 1801\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Adams\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Adams was born on October 19 (old style), 1735, near Boston,\r\nMass., in the portion of the town of Braintree which has since been\r\nincorporated as Quincy. He was fourth in descent from Henry Adams,\r\nwho fled from persecution in Devonshire, England, and settled in\r\nMassachusetts about 1630. Another of his ancestors was John Adams, a\r\nfounder of the Plymouth Colony in 1620. Entered Harvard College in 1751,\r\nand graduated therefrom four years later. Studied the law and taught\r\nschool at Worcester; was admitted to the bar of Suffolk County in 1758.\r\nIn 1768 removed to Boston, where he won distinction at the bar. In 1764\r\nmarried Abigail Smith, whose father was Rev. William Smith and whose\r\ngrandfather was Colonel Quincy. In 1770 was chosen a representative from\r\nBoston in the legislature of Massachusetts. In 1774 was a member of the\r\nContinental Congress, and in 1776 was the adviser and great supporter of\r\nthe Declaration of Independence. The same year was a deputy to treat\r\nwith Lord Howe for the pacification of the Colonies. He declined the\r\noffer of chief justice of Massachusetts. In December, 1777, was\r\nappointed a commissioner to France, and returned home in the summer of\r\n1779. He was then chosen a member of the Massachusetts convention for\r\nframing a State constitution. On September 29, 1779, was appointed by\r\nCongress minister plenipotentiary to negotiate a peace treaty with Great\r\nBritain. In 1781 was a commissioner to conclude treaties of peace with\r\nEuropean powers. In 1783 negotiated with others a commercial treaty with\r\nGreat Britain. Was one of the commissioners to sign the provisional\r\ntreaty of peace with that nation November 30, 1782, and the definite\r\ntreaty September 3, 1783. In 1784 remained in Holland, and in 1785 was\r\nby Congress appointed minister of the United States at the Court of\r\nGreat Britain. He returned to his home in June, 1788. Was chosen\r\nVice-President on the ticket with Washington, and on the assembling of\r\nthe Senate took his seat as President of that body, at New York in\r\nApril, 1789. Was reelected Vice-President in 1792. On the retirement of\r\nWashington in 1796 he was elected President, and was inaugurated March\r\n4, 1797. He retired March 4, 1801, to his home at Quincy, Mass. In 1816\r\nwas chosen to head the list of Presidential electors of his party in the\r\nState. Was a member of the State convention to revise the constitution\r\nof Massachusetts; was unanimously elected president of that convention,\r\nbut declined it on account of his age. His wife died in 1818. On July 4,\r\n1826, he died, and was buried at Quincy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\nIN THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA, PA\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it was first perceived, in early times, that no middle course for\r\nAmerica remained between unlimited submission to a foreign legislature\r\nand a total independence of its claims, men of reflection were less\r\napprehensive of danger from the formidable power of fleets and armies\r\nthey must determine to resist than from those contests and dissensions\r\nwhich would certainly arise concerning the forms of government to be\r\ninstituted over the whole and over the parts of this extensive country.\r\nRelying, however, on the purity of their intentions, the justice of\r\ntheir cause, and the integrity and intelligence of the people, under an\r\noverruling Providence which had so signally protected this country from\r\nthe first, the representatives of this nation, then consisting of little\r\nmore than half its present number, not only broke to pieces the chains\r\nwhich were forging and the rod of iron that was lifted up, but frankly\r\ncut asunder the ties which had bound them, and launched into an ocean of\r\nuncertainty.\r\n\r\nThe zeal and ardor of the people during the Revolutionary war, supplying\r\nthe place of government, commanded a degree of order sufficient at least\r\nfor the temporary preservation of society. The Confederation which was\r\nearly felt to be necessary was prepared from the models of the Batavian\r\nand Helvetic confederacies, the only examples which remain with any\r\ndetail and precision in history, and certainly the only ones which the\r\npeople at large had ever considered. But reflecting on the striking\r\ndifference in so many particulars between this country and those where a\r\ncourier may go from the seat of government to the frontier in a single\r\nday, it was then certainly foreseen by some who assisted in Congress at\r\nthe formation of it that it could not be durable.\r\n\r\nNegligence of its regulations, inattention to its recommendations, if\r\nnot disobedience to its authority, not only in individuals but in\r\nStates, soon appeared with their melancholy consequences--universal\r\nlanguor, jealousies and rivalries of States, decline of navigation and\r\ncommerce, discouragement of necessary manufactures, universal fall in\r\nthe value of lands and their produce, contempt of public and private\r\nfaith, loss of consideration and credit with foreign nations, and at\r\nlength in discontents, animosities, combinations, partial conventions,\r\nand insurrection, threatening some great national calamity.\r\n\r\nIn this dangerous crisis the people of America were not abandoned by\r\ntheir usual good sense, presence of mind, resolution, or integrity.\r\nMeasures were pursued to concert a plan to form a more perfect union,\r\nestablish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common\r\ndefense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of\r\nliberty. The public disquisitions, discussions, and deliberations issued\r\nin the present happy Constitution of Government.\r\n\r\nEmployed in the service of my country abroad during the whole course of\r\nthese transactions, I first saw the Constitution of the United States in\r\na foreign country. Irritated by no literary altercation, animated by no\r\npublic debate, heated by no party animosity, I read it with great\r\nsatisfaction, as the result of good heads prompted by good hearts, as an\r\nexperiment better adapted to the genius, character, situation, and\r\nrelations of this nation and country than any which had ever been\r\nproposed or suggested. In its general principles and great outlines it\r\nwas conformable to such a system of government as I had ever most\r\nesteemed, and in some States, my own native State in particular, had\r\ncontributed to establish. Claiming a right of suffrage, in common with\r\nmy fellow-citizens, in the adoption or rejection of a constitution which\r\nwas to rule me and my posterity, as well as them and theirs, I did not\r\nhesitate to express my approbation of it on all occasions, in public and\r\nin private. It was not then, nor has been since, any objection to it in\r\nmy mind that the Executive and Senate were not more permanent. Nor have\r\nI ever entertained a thought of promoting any alteration in it but such\r\nas the people themselves, in the course of their experience, should see\r\nand feel to be necessary or expedient, and by their representatives in\r\nCongress and the State legislatures, according to the Constitution\r\nitself, adopt and ordain.\r\n\r\nReturning to the bosom of my country after a painful separation from it\r\nfor ten years, I had the honor to be elected to a station under the new\r\norder of things, and I have repeatedly laid myself under the most\r\nserious obligations to support the Constitution. The operation of it has\r\nequaled the most sanguine expectations of its friends, and from an\r\nhabitual attention to it, satisfaction in its administration, and\r\ndelight in its effects upon the peace, order, prosperity, and happiness\r\nof the nation I have acquired an habitual attachment to it and\r\nveneration for it.\r\n\r\nWhat other form of government, indeed, can so well deserve our esteem\r\nand love?\r\n\r\nThere may be little solidity in an ancient idea that congregations of\r\nmen into cities and nations are the most pleasing objects in the sight\r\nof superior intelligences, but this is very certain, that to a\r\nbenevolent human mind there can be no spectacle presented by any nation\r\nmore pleasing, more noble, majestic, or august, than an assembly like\r\nthat which has so often been seen in this and the other Chamber of\r\nCongress, of a Government in which the Executive authority, as well as\r\nthat of all the branches of the Legislature, are exercised by citizens\r\nselected at regular periods by their neighbors to make and execute laws\r\nfor the general good. Can anything essential, anything more than mere\r\nornament and decoration, be added to this by robes and diamonds? Can\r\nauthority be more amiable and respectable when it descends from\r\naccidents or institutions established in remote antiquity than when it\r\nsprings fresh from the hearts and judgments of an honest and enlightened\r\npeople? For it is the people only that are represented. It is their\r\npower and majesty that is reflected, and only for their good, in every\r\nlegitimate government, under whatever form it may appear. The existence\r\nof such a government as ours for any length of time is a full proof of a\r\ngeneral dissemination of knowledge and virtue throughout the whole body\r\nof the people. And what object or consideration more pleasing than this\r\ncan be presented to the human mind? If national pride is ever\r\njustifiable or excusable it is when it springs, not from power or\r\nriches, grandeur or glory, but from conviction of national innocence,\r\ninformation, and benevolence.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these pleasing ideas we should be unfaithful to\r\nourselves if we should ever lose sight of the danger to our liberties\r\nif anything partial or extraneous should infect the purity of our free,\r\nfair, virtuous, and independent elections. If an election is to be\r\ndetermined by a majority of a single vote, and that can be procured by a\r\nparty through artifice or corruption, the Government may be the choice\r\nof a party for its own ends, not of the nation for the national good. If\r\nthat solitary suffrage can be obtained by foreign nations by flattery or\r\nmenaces, by fraud or violence, by terror, intrigue, or venality, the\r\nGovernment may not be the choice of the American people, but of foreign\r\nnations. It may be foreign nations who govern us, and not we, the\r\npeople, who govern ourselves; and candid men will acknowledge that in\r\nsuch cases choice would have little advantage to boast of over lot or\r\nchance.\r\n\r\nSuch is the amiable and interesting system of government (and such are\r\nsome of the abuses to which it may be exposed) which the people of\r\nAmerica have exhibited to the admiration and anxiety of the wise and\r\nvirtuous of all nations for eight years under the administration of a\r\ncitizen who, by a long course of great actions, regulated by prudence,\r\njustice, temperance, and fortitude, conducting a people inspired with\r\nthe same virtues and animated with the same ardent patriotism and love\r\nof liberty to independence and peace, to increasing wealth and\r\nunexampled prosperity, has merited the gratitude of his fellow-citizens,\r\ncommanded the highest praises of foreign nations, and secured immortal\r\nglory with posterity.\r\n\r\nIn that retirement which is his voluntary choice may he long live to\r\nenjoy the delicious recollection of his services, the gratitude of\r\nmankind, the happy fruits of them to himself and the world, which are\r\ndaily increasing, and that splendid prospect of the future fortunes of\r\nthis country which is opening from year to year. His name may be still a\r\nrampart, and the knowledge that he lives a bulwark, against all open or\r\nsecret enemies of his country's peace. This example has been recommended\r\nto the imitation of his successors by both Houses of Congress and by the\r\nvoice of the legislatures and the people throughout the nation.\r\n\r\nOn this subject it might become me better to be silent or to speak with\r\ndiffidence; but as something may be expected, the occasion, I hope, will\r\nbe admitted as an apology if I venture to say that if a preference, upon\r\nprinciple, of a free republican government, formed upon long and serious\r\nreflection, after a diligent and impartial inquiry after truth; if an\r\nattachment to the Constitution of the United States, and a conscientious\r\ndetermination to support it until it shall be altered by the judgments\r\nand wishes of the people, expressed in the mode prescribed in it; if a\r\nrespectful attention to the constitutions of the individual States and a\r\nconstant caution and delicacy toward the State governments; if an equal\r\nand impartial regard to the rights, interest, honor, and happiness of\r\nall the States in the Union, without preference or regard to a northern\r\nor southern, an eastern or western, position, their various political\r\nopinions on unessential points or their personal attachments; if a love\r\nof virtuous men of all parties and denominations; if a love of science\r\nand letters and a wish to patronize every rational effort to encourage\r\nschools, colleges, universities, academies, and every institution for\r\npropagating knowledge, virtue, and religion among all classes of the\r\npeople, not only for their benign influence on the happiness of life in\r\nall its stages and classes, and of society in all its forms, but as the\r\nonly means of preserving our Constitution from its natural enemies, the\r\nspirit of sophistry, the spirit of party, the spirit of intrigue, the\r\nprofligacy of corruption, and the pestilence of foreign influence, which\r\nis the angel of destruction to elective governments; if a love of equal\r\nlaws, of justice, and humanity in the interior administration; if an\r\ninclination to improve agriculture, commerce, and manufactures for\r\nnecessity, convenience, and defense; if a spirit of equity and humanity\r\ntoward the aboriginal nations of America, and a disposition to meliorate\r\ntheir condition by inclining them to be more friendly to us, and our\r\ncitizens to be more friendly to them; if an inflexible determination to\r\nmaintain peace and inviolable faith with all nations, and that system of\r\nneutrality and impartiality among the belligerent powers of Europe which\r\nhas been adopted by this Government and so solemnly sanctioned by both\r\nHouses of Congress and applauded by the legislatures of the States and\r\nthe public opinion, until it shall be otherwise ordained by Congress; if\r\na personal esteem for the French nation, formed in a residence of seven\r\nyears chiefly among them, and a sincere desire to preserve the\r\nfriendship which has been so much for the honor and interest of both\r\nnations; if, while the conscious honor and integrity of the people of\r\nAmerica and the internal sentiment of their own power and energies must\r\nbe preserved, an earnest endeavor to investigate every just cause and\r\nremove every colorable pretense of complaint; if an intention to pursue\r\nby amicable negotiation a reparation for the injuries that have been\r\ncommitted on the commerce of our fellow-citizens by whatever nation, and\r\nif success can not be obtained, to lay the facts before the legislature,\r\nthat they may consider what further measures the honor and interest of\r\nthe Government and its constituents demand; if a resolution to do\r\njustice as far as may depend upon me, at all times and to all nations,\r\nand maintain peace, friendship, and benevolence with all the world; if\r\nan unshaken confidence in the honor, spirit, and resources of the\r\nAmerican people, on which I have so often hazarded my all and never been\r\ndeceived; if elevated ideas of the high destinies of this country and of\r\nmy own duties toward it, founded on a knowledge of the moral principles\r\nand intellectual improvements of the people deeply engraven on my mind\r\nin early life, and not obscured but exalted by experience and age; and,\r\nwith humble reverence, I feel it to be my duty to add, if a veneration\r\nfor the religion of a people who profess and call themselves Christians,\r\nand a fixed resolution to consider a decent respect for Christianity\r\namong the best recommendations for the public service, can enable me in\r\nany degree to comply with your wishes, it shall be my strenuous endeavor\r\nthat this sagacious injunction of the two Houses shall not be without\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nWith this great example before me, with the sense and spirit, the faith\r\nand honor, the duty and interest, of the same American people pledged to\r\nsupport the Constitution of the United States, I entertain no doubt of\r\nits continuance in all its energy, and my mind is prepared without\r\nhesitation to lay myself under the most solemn obligations to support it\r\nto the utmost of my power.\r\n\r\nAnd may that Being who is supreme over all, the Patron of Order, the\r\nFountain of Justice, and the Protector in all ages of the world of\r\nvirtuous liberty, continue His blessing upon this nation and its\r\nGovernment and give it all possible success and duration consistent with\r\nthe ends of His providence.\r\n\r\nMarch 4, 1797.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n[From Annals of Congress, Fifth Congress, Vol. I, 49.]\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas the Constitution of the United States of America provides that\r\nthe President may, on extraordinary occasions, convene both Houses of\r\nCongress; and\r\n\r\nWhereas an extraordinary occasion exists for convening Congress, and\r\ndivers weighty matters claim their consideration:\r\n\r\nI have therefore thought it necessary to convene, and I do by these\r\npresents convene, the Congress of the United States of America at the\r\ncity of Philadelphia, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, on Monday,\r\nthe 15th day of May next, hereby requiring the Senators and\r\nRepresentatives in the Congress of the United States of America, and\r\nevery of them, that, laying aside all other matters and cares, they then\r\nand there meet and assemble in Congress in order to consult and\r\ndetermine on such measures as in their wisdom shall be deemed meet for\r\nthe safety and welfare of the said United States.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States of\r\nAmerica to be affixed to these presents, and signed the same with my\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Philadelphia, the 25th day of March, A.D. 1797, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States of America the twenty-first.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  TIMOTHY PICKERING,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL SESSION MESSAGE.\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _May 16, 1797_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe personal inconveniences to the members of the Senate and of the\r\nHouse of Representatives in leaving their families and private affairs\r\nat this season of the year are so obvious that I the more regret the\r\nextraordinary occasion which has rendered the convention of Congress\r\nindispensable.\r\n\r\nIt would have afforded me the highest satisfaction to have been able to\r\ncongratulate you on a restoration of peace to the nations of Europe\r\nwhose animosities have endangered our tranquillity; but we have still\r\nabundant cause of gratitude to the Supreme Dispenser of National\r\nBlessings for general health and promising seasons, for domestic and\r\nsocial happiness, for the rapid progress and ample acquisitions of\r\nindustry through extensive territories, for civil, political, and\r\nreligious liberty. While other states are desolated with foreign war or\r\nconvulsed with intestine divisions, the United States present the\r\npleasing prospect of a nation governed by mild and equal laws, generally\r\nsatisfied with the possession of their rights, neither envying the\r\nadvantages nor fearing the power of other nations, solicitous only for\r\nthe maintenance of order and justice and the preservation of liberty,\r\nincreasing daily in their attachment to a system of government in\r\nproportion to their experience of its utility, yielding a ready and\r\ngeneral obedience to laws flowing from the reason and resting on the\r\nonly solid foundation--the affections of the people.\r\n\r\nIt is with extreme regret that I shall be obliged to turn your thoughts\r\nto other circumstances, which admonish us that some of these felicities\r\nmay not be lasting. But if the tide of our prosperity is full and a\r\nreflux commencing, a vigilant circumspection becomes us, that we may\r\nmeet our reverses with fortitude and extricate ourselves from their\r\nconsequences with all the skill we possess and all the efforts in our\r\npower.\r\n\r\nIn giving to Congress information of the state of the Union and\r\nrecommending to their consideration such measures as appear to me to be\r\nnecessary or expedient, according to my constitutional duty, the causes\r\nand the objects of the present extraordinary session will be explained.\r\n\r\nAfter the President of the United States received information that the\r\nFrench Government had expressed serious discontents at some proceedings\r\nof the Government of these States said to affect the interests of\r\nFrance, he thought it expedient to send to that country a new minister,\r\nfully instructed to enter on such amicable discussions and to give such\r\ncandid explanations as might happily remove the discontents and suspicions\r\nof the French Government and vindicate the conduct of the United States.\r\nFor this purpose he selected from among his fellow-citizens a character\r\nwhose integrity, talents, experience, and services had placed him in the\r\nrank of the most esteemed and respected in the nation. The direct object\r\nof his mission was expressed in his letter of credence to the French\r\nRepublic, being \"to maintain that good understanding which from the\r\ncommencement of the alliance had subsisted between the two nations, and\r\nto efface unfavorable impressions, banish suspicions, and restore that\r\ncordiality which was at once the evidence and pledge of a friendly\r\nunion.\" And his instructions were to the same effect, \"faithfully to\r\nrepresent the disposition of the Government and people of the United\r\nStates (their disposition being one), to remove jealousies and obviate\r\ncomplaints by shewing that they were groundless, to restore that mutual\r\nconfidence which had been so unfortunately and injuriously impaired,\r\nand to explain the relative interests of both countries and the real\r\nsentiments of his own.\"\r\n\r\nA minister thus specially commissioned it was expected would have proved\r\nthe instrument of restoring mutual confidence between the two Republics.\r\nThe first step of the French Government corresponded with that\r\nexpectation. A few days before his arrival at Paris the French minister\r\nof foreign relations informed the American minister then resident at\r\nParis of the formalities to be observed by himself in taking leave, and\r\nby his successor preparatory to his reception. These formalities they\r\nobserved, and on the 9th of December presented officially to the\r\nminister of foreign relations, the one a copy of his letters of recall,\r\nthe other a copy of his letters of credence.\r\n\r\nThese were laid before the Executive Directory. Two days afterwards the\r\nminister of foreign relations informed the recalled American minister\r\nthat the Executive Directory had determined not to receive another\r\nminister plenipotentiary from the United States until after the redress\r\nof grievances demanded of the American Government, and which the French\r\nRepublic had a right to expect from it. The American minister\r\nimmediately endeavored to ascertain whether by refusing to receive him\r\nit was intended that he should retire from the territories of the French\r\nRepublic, and verbal answers were given that such was the intention of\r\nthe Directory. For his own justification he desired a written answer,\r\nbut obtained none until toward the last of January, when, receiving\r\nnotice in writing to quit the territories of the Republic, he proceeded\r\nto Amsterdam, where he proposed to wait for instruction from this\r\nGovernment. During his residence at Paris cards of hospitality were\r\nrefused him, and he was threatened with being subjected to the\r\njurisdiction of the minister of police; but with becoming firmness he\r\ninsisted on the protection of the law of nations due to him as the known\r\nminister of a foreign power. You will derive further information from\r\nhis dispatches, which will be laid before you.\r\n\r\nAs it is often necessary that nations should treat for the mutual\r\nadvantage of their affairs, and especially to accommodate and terminate\r\ndifferences, and as they can treat only by ministers, the right of\r\nembassy is well known and established by the law and usage of nations.\r\nThe refusal on the part of France to receive our minister is, then, the\r\ndenial of a right; but the refusal to receive him until we have acceded\r\nto their demands without discussion and without investigation is to\r\ntreat us neither as allies nor as friends, nor as a sovereign state.\r\n\r\nWith this conduct of the French Government it will be proper to take\r\ninto view the public audience given to the late minister of the United\r\nStates on his taking leave of the Executive Directory. The speech of the\r\nPresident discloses sentiments more alarming than the refusal of a\r\nminister, because more dangerous to our independence and union, and at\r\nthe same time studiously marked with indignities toward the Government\r\nof the United States. It evinces a disposition to separate the people of\r\nthe United States from the Government, to persuade them that they have\r\ndifferent affections, principles, and interests from those of their\r\nfellow-citizens whom they themselves have chosen to manage their common\r\nconcerns, and thus to produce divisions fatal to our peace. Such\r\nattempts ought to be repelled with a decision which shall convince\r\nFrance and the world that we are not a degraded people, humiliated under\r\na colonial spirit of fear and sense of inferiority, fitted to be the\r\nmiserable instruments of foreign influence, and regardless of national\r\nhonor, character, and interest.\r\n\r\nI should have been happy to have thrown a veil over these transactions\r\nif it had been possible to conceal them; but they have passed on the\r\ngreat theater of the world, in the face of all Europe and America, and\r\nwith such circumstances of publicity and solemnity that they can not be\r\ndisguised and will not soon be forgotten. They have inflicted a wound in\r\nthe American breast. It is my sincere desire, however, that it may be\r\nhealed.\r\n\r\nIt is my sincere desire, and in this I presume I concur with you and\r\nwith our constituents, to preserve peace and friendship with all\r\nnations; and believing that neither the honor nor the interest of the\r\nUnited States absolutely forbid the repetition of advances for securing\r\nthese desirable objects with France, I shall institute a fresh attempt\r\nat negotiation, and shall not fail to promote and accelerate an\r\naccommodation on terms compatible with the rights, duties, interests,\r\nand honor of the nation. If we have committed errors, and these can be\r\ndemonstrated, we shall be willing to correct them; if we have done\r\ninjuries, we shall be willing on conviction to redress them; and equal\r\nmeasures of justice we have a right to expect from France and every\r\nother nation.\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic intercourse between the United States and France being at\r\npresent suspended, the Government has no means of obtaining official\r\ninformation from that country. Nevertheless, there is reason to believe\r\nthat the Executive Directory passed a decree on the 2d of March last\r\ncontravening in part the treaty of amity and commerce of 1778, injurious\r\nto our lawful commerce and endangering the lives of our citizens. A copy\r\nof this decree will be laid before you.\r\n\r\nWhile we are endeavoring to adjust all our differences with France by\r\namicable negotiation, the progress of the war in Europe, the\r\ndepredations on our commerce, the personal injuries to our citizens, and\r\nthe general complexion of affairs render it my indispensable duty to\r\nrecommend to your consideration effectual measures of defense.\r\n\r\nThe commerce of the United States has become an interesting object of\r\nattention, whether we consider it in relation to the wealth and finances\r\nor the strength and resources of the nation. With a seacoast of near\r\n2,000 miles in extent, opening a wide field for fisheries, navigation,\r\nand commerce, a great portion of our citizens naturally apply their\r\nindustry and enterprise to these objects. Any serious and permanent\r\ninjury to commerce would not fail to produce the most embarrassing\r\ndisorders. To prevent it from being undermined and destroyed it is\r\nessential that it receive an adequate protection.\r\n\r\nThe naval establishment must occur to every man who considers the\r\ninjuries committed on our commerce, the insults offered to our citizens,\r\nand the description of vessels by which these abuses have been\r\npracticed. As the sufferings of our mercantile and seafaring citizens\r\ncan not be ascribed to the omission of duties demandable, considering\r\nthe neutral situation of our country, they are to be attributed to the\r\nhope of impunity arising from a supposed inability on our part to afford\r\nprotection. To resist the consequences of such impressions on the minds\r\nof foreign nations and to guard against the degradation and servility\r\nwhich they must finally stamp on the American character is an important\r\nduty of Government.\r\n\r\nA naval power, next to the militia, is the natural defense of the United\r\nStates. The experience of the last war would be sufficient to shew that\r\na moderate naval force, such as would be easily within the present\r\nabilities of the Union, would have been sufficient to have baffled many\r\nformidable transportations of troops from one State to another, which\r\nwere then practiced. Our seacoasts, from their great extent, are more\r\neasily annoyed and more easily defended by a naval force than any other.\r\nWith all the materials our country abounds; in skill our naval\r\narchitects and navigators are equal to any, and commanders and seamen\r\nwill not be wanting.\r\n\r\nBut although the establishment of a permanent system of naval defense\r\nappears to be requisite, I am sensible it can not be formed so speedily\r\nand extensively as the present crisis demands. Hitherto I have thought\r\nproper to prevent the sailing of armed vessels except on voyages to the\r\nEast Indies, where general usage and the danger from pirates appeared to\r\nrender the permission proper. Yet the restriction has originated solely\r\nfrom a wish to prevent collisions with the powers at war, contravening\r\nthe act of Congress of June, 1794, and not from any doubt entertained by\r\nme of the policy and propriety of permitting our vessels to employ means\r\nof defense while engaged in a lawful foreign commerce. It remains for\r\nCongress to prescribe such regulations as will enable our seafaring\r\ncitizens to defend themselves against violations of the law of nations,\r\nand at the same time restrain them from committing acts of hostility\r\nagainst the powers at war. In addition to this voluntary provision for\r\ndefense by individual citizens, it appears to me necessary to equip the\r\nfrigates, and provide other vessels of inferior force, to take under\r\nconvoy such merchant vessels as shall remain unarmed.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the cruisers whose depredations have been most\r\ninjurious have been built and some of them partially equipped in the\r\nUnited States. Although an effectual remedy may be attended with\r\ndifficulty, yet I have thought it my duty to present the subject\r\ngenerally to your consideration. If a mode can be devised by the wisdom\r\nof Congress to prevent the resources of the United States from being\r\nconverted into the means of annoying our trade, a great evil will be\r\nprevented. With the same view, I think it proper to mention that some of\r\nour citizens resident abroad have fitted out privateers, and others have\r\nvoluntarily taken the command, or entered on board of them, and\r\ncommitted spoliations on the commerce of the United States. Such\r\nunnatural and iniquitous practices can be restrained only by severe\r\npunishments.\r\n\r\nBut besides a protection of our commerce on the seas, I think it highly\r\nnecessary to protect it at home, where it is collected in our most\r\nimportant ports. The distance of the United States from Europe and the\r\nwell-known promptitude, ardor, and courage of the people in defense of\r\ntheir country happily diminish the probability of invasion.\r\nNevertheless, to guard against sudden and predatory incursions the\r\nsituation of some of our principal seaports demands your consideration.\r\nAnd as our country is vulnerable in other interests besides those of its\r\ncommerce, you will seriously deliberate whether the means of general\r\ndefense ought not to be increased by an addition to the regular\r\nartillery and cavalry, and by arrangements for forming a provisional\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nWith the same view, and as a measure which, even in a time of universal\r\npeace, ought not to be neglected, I recommend to your consideration a\r\nrevision of the laws for organizing, arming, and disciplining the\r\nmilitia, to render that natural and safe defense of the country\r\nefficacious.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is very true that we ought not to involve ourselves in the\r\npolitical system of Europe, but to keep ourselves always distinct and\r\nseparate from it if we can, yet to effect this separation, early,\r\npunctual, and continual information of the current chain of events and\r\nof the political projects in contemplation is no less necessary than if\r\nwe were directly concerned in them. It is necessary, in order to the\r\ndiscovery of the efforts made to draw us into the vortex, in season to\r\nmake preparations against them. However we may consider ourselves, the\r\nmaritime and commercial powers of the world will consider the United\r\nStates of America as forming a weight in that balance of power in Europe\r\nwhich never can be forgotten or neglected. It would not only be against\r\nour interest, but it would be doing wrong to one-half of Europe, at\r\nleast, if we should voluntarily throw ourselves into either scale. It is\r\na natural policy for a nation that studies to be neutral to consult with\r\nother nations engaged in the same studies and pursuits. At the same time\r\nthat measures might be pursued with this view, our treaties with Prussia\r\nand Sweden, one of which is expired and the other near expiring, might\r\nbe renewed.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIt is particularly your province to consider the state of the public\r\nfinances, and to adopt such measures respecting them as exigencies shall\r\nbe found to require. The preservation of public credit, the regular\r\nextinguishment of the public debt, and a provision of funds to defray\r\nany extraordinary expenses will of course call for your serious\r\nattention. Although the imposition of new burthens can not be in itself\r\nagreeable, yet there is no ground to doubt that the American people will\r\nexpect from you such measures as their actual engagements, their present\r\nsecurity, and future interests demand.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe present situation of our country imposes an obligation on all the\r\ndepartments of Government to adopt an explicit and decided conduct. In\r\nmy situation an exposition of the principles by which my Administration\r\nwill be governed ought not to be omitted.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to conceal from ourselves or the world what has been\r\nbefore observed, that endeavors have been employed to foster and\r\nestablish a division between the Government and people of the United\r\nStates. To investigate the causes which have encouraged this attempt is\r\nnot necessary; but to repel, by decided and united councils,\r\ninsinuations so derogatory to the honor and aggressions so dangerous to\r\nthe Constitution, union, and even independence of the nation is an\r\nindispensable duty.\r\n\r\nIt must not be permitted to be doubted whether the people of the United\r\nStates will support the Government established by their voluntary\r\nconsent and appointed by their free choice, or whether, by surrendering\r\nthemselves to the direction of foreign and domestic factions, in\r\nopposition to their own Government, they will forfeit the honorable\r\nstation they have hitherto maintained.\r\n\r\nFor myself, having never been indifferent to what concerned the\r\ninterests of my country, devoted the best part of my life to obtain and\r\nsupport its independence, and constantly witnessed the patriotism,\r\nfidelity, and perseverance of my fellow-citizens on the most trying\r\noccasions, it is not for me to hesitate or abandon a cause in which my\r\nheart has been so long engaged.\r\n\r\nConvinced that the conduct of the Government has been just and impartial\r\nto foreign nations, that those internal regulations which have been\r\nestablished by law for the preservation of peace are in their nature\r\nproper, and that they have been fairly executed, nothing will ever be\r\ndone by me to impair the national engagements, to innovate upon\r\nprinciples which have been so deliberately and uprightly established, or\r\nto surrender in any manner the rights of the Government. To enable me to\r\nmaintain this declaration I rely, under God, with entire confidence on\r\nthe firm and enlightened support of the National Legislature and upon\r\nthe virtue and patriotism of my fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF THE SENATE TO JOHN ADAMS, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nSIR: The Senate of the United States request you to accept their\r\nacknowledgments for the comprehensive and interesting detail you have\r\ngiven in your speech to both Houses of Congress on the existing state\r\nof the Union.\r\n\r\nWhile we regret the necessity of the present meeting of the Legislature,\r\nwe wish to express our entire approbation of your conduct in convening\r\nit on this momentous occasion.\r\n\r\nThe superintendence of our national faith, honor, and dignity being in a\r\ngreat measure constitutionally deposited with the Executive, we observe\r\nwith singular satisfaction the vigilance, firmness, and promptitude\r\nexhibited by you in this critical state of our public affairs, and from\r\nthence derive an evidence and pledge of the rectitude and integrity of\r\nyour Administration. And we are sensible it is an object of primary\r\nimportance that each branch of the Government should adopt a language\r\nand system of conduct which shall be cool, just, and dispassionate, but\r\nfirm, explicit, and decided.\r\n\r\nWe are equally desirous with you to preserve peace and friendship with\r\nall nations, and are happy to be informed that neither the honor nor\r\ninterests of the United States forbid advances for securing those\r\ndesirable objects by amicable negotiation with the French Republic. This\r\nmethod of adjusting national differences is not only the most mild, but\r\nthe most rational and humane, and with governments disposed to be just\r\ncan seldom fail of success when fairly, candidly, and sincerely used.\r\n\r\nIf we have committed errors and can be made sensible of them, we agree\r\nwith you in opinion that we ought to correct them, and compensate the\r\ninjuries which may have been consequent thereon; and we trust the French\r\nRepublic will be actuated by the same just and benevolent principles of\r\nnational policy.\r\n\r\nWe do therefore most sincerely approve of your determination to promote\r\nand accelerate an accommodation of our existing differences with that\r\nRepublic by negotiation, on terms compatible with the rights, duties,\r\ninterests, and honor of our nation. And you may rest assured of our most\r\ncordial cooperation so far as it may become necessary in this pursuit.\r\n\r\nPeace and harmony with all nations is our sincere wish; but such being\r\nthe lot of humanity that nations will not always reciprocate peaceable\r\ndispositions, it is our firm belief that effectual measures of defense\r\nwill tend to inspire that national self-respect and confidence at\r\n_home_ which is the unfailing source of respectability _abroad_, to\r\ncheck aggression and prevent war.\r\n\r\nWhile we are endeavoring to adjust our differences with the French\r\nRepublic by amicable negotiation, the progress of the war in Europe, the\r\ndepredations on our commerce, the personal injuries to our citizens, and\r\nthe general complexion of affairs prove to us your vigilant care in\r\nrecommending to our attention effectual measures of defense.\r\n\r\nThose which you recommend, whether they relate to external defense by\r\npermitting our citizens to arm for the purpose of repelling aggressions\r\non their commercial rights, and by providing sea convoys, or to internal\r\ndefense by increasing the establishments of artillery and cavalry, by\r\nforming a provisional army, by revising the militia laws, and fortifying\r\nmore completely our ports and harbors, will meet our consideration under\r\nthe influence of the same just regard for the security, interest, and\r\nhonor of our country which dictated your recommendation.\r\n\r\nPractices so unnatural and iniquitous as those you state, of our own\r\ncitizens converting their property and personal exertions into the means\r\nof annoying our trade and injuring their fellow-citizens, deserve legal\r\nseverity commensurate with their turpitude.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Senate believe that the prosperity and happiness of our\r\ncountry does not depend on general and extensive political connections\r\nwith European nations, yet we can never lose sight of the propriety as\r\nwell as necessity of enabling the Executive, by sufficient and liberal\r\nsupplies, to maintain and even extend our foreign intercourse as\r\nexigencies may require, reposing full confidence in the Executive, in\r\nwhom the Constitution has placed the powers of negotiation.\r\n\r\nWe learn with sincere concern that attempts are in operation to alienate\r\nthe affections of our fellow-citizens from their Government. Attempts\r\nso wicked, wherever they exist, can not fail to excite our utmost\r\nabhorrence. A government chosen by the people for their own safety and\r\nhappiness, and calculated to secure both, can not lose their affections\r\nso long as its administration pursues the principles upon which it was\r\nerected; and your resolution to observe a conduct just and impartial to\r\nall nations, a sacred regard to our national engagements, and not to\r\nimpair the rights of our Government, contains principles which can not\r\nfail to secure to your Administration the support of the National\r\nLegislature to render abortive every attempt to excite dangerous\r\njealousies among us, and to convince the world that our Government and\r\nyour administration of it can not be separated from the affectionate\r\nsupport of every good citizen. And the Senate can not suffer the present\r\noccasion to pass without thus publicly and solemnly expressing their\r\nattachment to the Constitution and Government of their country; and\r\nas they hold themselves responsible to their constituents, their\r\nconsciences, and their God, it is their determination by all their\r\nexertions to repel every attempt to alienate the affections of the\r\npeople from the Government, so highly injurious to the honor, safety,\r\nand independence of the United States.\r\n\r\nWe are happy, since our sentiments on the subject are in perfect unison\r\nwith yours, in this public manner to declare that we believe the conduct\r\nof the Government has been just and impartial to foreign nations, and\r\nthat those internal regulations which have been established for the\r\npreservation of peace are in their nature proper and have been fairly\r\nexecuted.\r\n\r\nAnd we are equally happy in possessing an entire confidence in your\r\nabilities and exertions in your station to maintain untarnished the\r\nhonor, preserve the peace, and support the independence of our country,\r\nto acquire and establish which, in connection with your fellow-citizens,\r\nhas been the virtuous effort of a principal part of your life.\r\n\r\nTo aid you in these arduous and honorable exertions, as it is our duty\r\nso it shall be our faithful endeavor; and we flatter ourselves, sir,\r\nthat the proceedings of the present session of Congress will manifest\r\nto the world that although the United States love peace, they will be\r\nindependent; that they are sincere in their declarations to be just to\r\nthe French and all other nations, and expect the same in return.\r\n\r\nIf a sense of justice, a love of moderation and peace, shall influence\r\ntheir councils, which we sincerely hope we shall have just grounds to\r\nexpect, peace and amity between the United States and all nations will\r\nbe preserved.\r\n\r\nBut if we are so unfortunate as to experience injuries from any foreign\r\npower, and the ordinary methods by which differences are amicably\r\nadjusted between nations shall be rejected, the determination \"not\r\nto surrender in any manner the rights of the Government,\" being so\r\ninseparably connected with the dignity, interest, and independence\r\nof our country, shall by us be steadily and inviolably supported.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON,\r\n\r\n_Vice-President of the United States and President of the Senate_.\r\n\r\nMAY 23, 1797.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Vice-President and Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIt would be an affectation in me to dissemble the pleasure I feel on\r\nreceiving this kind address.\r\n\r\nMy long experience of the wisdom, fortitude, and patriotism of the\r\nSenate of the United States enhances in my estimation the value of those\r\nobliging expressions of your approbation of my conduct, which are a\r\ngenerous reward for the past and an affecting encouragement to constancy\r\nand perseverance in future.\r\n\r\nOur sentiments appear to be so entirely in unison that I can not but\r\nbelieve them to be the rational result of the understandings and the\r\nnatural feelings of the hearts of Americans in general on contemplating\r\nthe present state of the nation.\r\n\r\nWhile such principles and affections prevail they will form an\r\nindissoluble bond of union and a sure pledge that our country has no\r\nessential injury to apprehend from any portentous appearances abroad.\r\nIn a humble reliance on Divine Providence we may rest assured that\r\nwhile we reiterate with sincerity our endeavors to accommodate all our\r\ndifferences with France, the independence of our country can not be\r\ndiminished, its dignity degraded, or its glory tarnished by any nation\r\nor combination of nations, whether friends or enemies.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nMAY 24, 1797.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO JOHN ADAMS, PRESIDENT OF THE\r\nUNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: The interesting details of those events which have rendered the\r\nconvention of Congress at this time indispensable (communicated in your\r\nspeech to both Houses) has excited in us the strongest emotions. Whilst\r\nwe regret the occasion, we can not omit to testify our approbation of\r\nthe measure, and pledge ourselves that no considerations of private\r\ninconvenience shall prevent on our part a faithful discharge of the\r\nduties to which we are called.\r\n\r\nWe have constantly hoped that the nations of Europe, whilst desolated\r\nby foreign wars or convulsed by intestine divisions, would have left\r\nthe United States to enjoy that peace and tranquillity to which the\r\nimpartial conduct of our Government has entitled us, and it is now with\r\nextreme regret we find the measures of the French Republic tending to\r\nendanger a situation so desirable and interesting to our country.\r\n\r\nUpon this occasion we feel it our duty to express in the most explicit\r\nmanner the sensations which the present crisis has excited, and to\r\nassure you of our zealous cooperation in those measures which may appear\r\nnecessary for our security or peace.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is the earnest wish of our hearts that peace may be\r\nmaintained with the French Republic and with all the world, yet we never\r\nwill surrender those rights which belong to us as a nation; and whilst\r\nwe view with satisfaction the wisdom, dignity, and moderation which have\r\nmarked the measures of the Supreme Executive of our country in his\r\nattempt to remove by candid explanations the complaints and jealousies\r\nof France, we feel the full force of that indignity which has been\r\noffered our country in the rejection of its minister. No attempts to\r\nwound our rights as a sovereign State will escape the notice of our\r\nconstituents. They will be felt with indignation and repelled with that\r\ndecision which shall convince the world that we are not a degraded\r\npeople; that we can never submit to the demands of a foreign power\r\nwithout examination and without discussion.\r\n\r\nKnowing as we do the confidence reposed by the people of the United\r\nStates in their Government, we can not hesitate in expressing our\r\nindignation at any sentiments tending to derogate from that confidence.\r\nSuch sentiments, wherever entertained, serve to evince an imperfect\r\nknowledge of the opinions of our constituents. An attempt to separate\r\nthe people of the United States from their Government is an attempt to\r\nseparate them from themselves; and although foreigners who know not the\r\ngenius of our country may have conceived the project, and foreign\r\nemissaries may attempt the execution, yet the united efforts of our\r\nfellow-citizens will convince the world of its impracticability.\r\n\r\nSensibly as we feel the wound which has been inflicted by the\r\ntransactions disclosed in your communications, yet we think with you\r\nthat neither the honor nor the interest of the United States forbid the\r\nrepetition of advances for preserving peace; we therefore receive with\r\nthe utmost satisfaction your information that a fresh attempt at\r\nnegotiation will be instituted, and we cherish the hope that a mutual\r\nspirit of conciliation, and a disposition on the part of France to\r\ncompensate for any injuries which may have been committed upon our\r\nneutral rights, and on the part of the United States to place France on\r\ngrounds similar to those of other countries in their relation and\r\nconnection with us (if any inequalities shall be found to exist), will\r\nproduce an accommodation compatible with the engagements, rights,\r\nduties, and honor of the United States. Fully, however, impressed with\r\nthe uncertainty of the result, we shall prepare to meet with fortitude\r\nany unfavorable events which may occur, and to extricate ourselves from\r\ntheir consequences with all the skill we possess and all the efforts in\r\nour power. Believing with you that the conduct of the Government has\r\nbeen just and impartial to foreign nations, that the laws for the\r\npreservation of peace have been proper, and that they have been fairly\r\nexecuted, the Representatives of the people do not hesitate to declare\r\nthat they will give their most cordial support to the execution of\r\nprinciples so deliberately and uprightly established.\r\n\r\nThe many interesting subjects which you have recommended to our\r\nconsideration, and which are so strongly enforced by this momentous\r\noccasion, will receive every attention which their importance demands,\r\nand we trust that, by the decided and explicit conduct which will govern\r\nour deliberations, every insinuation will be repelled which is derogatory\r\nto the honor and independence of our country.\r\n\r\nPermit us in offering this address to express our satisfaction at\r\nyour promotion to the first office in the Government and our entire\r\nconfidence that the preeminent talents and patriotism which have placed\r\nyou in this distinguished situation will enable you to discharge its\r\nvarious duties with satisfaction to yourself and advantage to our common\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nJUNE 2, 1797.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Speaker and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI receive with great satisfaction your candid approbation of the\r\nconvention of Congress, and thank you for your assurances that the\r\ninteresting subjects recommended to your consideration shall receive\r\nthe attention which their importance demands, and that your cooperation\r\nmay be expected in those measures which may appear necessary for our\r\nsecurity or peace.\r\n\r\nThe declarations of the Representatives of this nation of their\r\nsatisfaction at my promotion to the first office in this Government and\r\nof their confidence in my sincere endeavors to discharge the various\r\nduties of it with advantage to our common country have excited my most\r\ngrateful sensibility.\r\n\r\nI pray you, gentlemen, to believe and to communicate such assurance to\r\nour constituents that no event which I can foresee to be attainable by\r\nany exertions in the discharge of my duties can afford me so much cordial\r\nsatisfaction as to conduct a negotiation with the French Republic to a\r\nremoval of prejudices, a correction of errors, a dissipation of umbrages,\r\nan accommodation of all differences, and a restoration of harmony and\r\naffection to the mutual satisfaction of both nations. And whenever the\r\nlegitimate organs of intercourse shall be restored and the real sentiments\r\nof the two Governments can be candidly communicated to each other,\r\nalthough strongly impressed with the necessity of collecting ourselves\r\ninto a manly posture of defense, I nevertheless entertain an encouraging\r\nconfidence that a mutual spirit of conciliation, a disposition to\r\ncompensate injuries and accommodate each other in all our relations and\r\nconnections, will produce an agreement to a treaty consistent with the\r\nengagements, rights, duties, and honor of both nations.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nJUNE 3, 1797.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _May 26, 1797_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you, for your consideration and advice, a treaty of\r\nperpetual peace and friendship between the United States of America\r\nand the Bey and subjects of Tripoli, of Barbary, concluded at Tripoli\r\non the 4th day of November, 1796.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _May 31, 1797_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI nominate General Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, of South Carolina,\r\nFrancis Dana, chief justice of the State of Massachusetts, and General\r\nJohn Marshall, of Virginia, to be jointly and severally envoys\r\nextraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary to the French Republic.\r\n\r\nAfter mature deliberation on the critical situation of our relations\r\nwith France, which have long engaged my most serious attention, I have\r\ndetermined on these nominations of persons to negotiate with the French\r\nRepublic to dissipate umbrages, to remove prejudices, to rectify errors,\r\nand adjust all differences by a treaty between the two powers.\r\n\r\nIt is in the present critical and singular circumstances of great\r\nimportance to engage the confidence of the great portions of the Union\r\nin the characters employed and the measures which may be adopted. I have\r\ntherefore thought it expedient to nominate persons of talents and\r\nintegrity, long known and intrusted in the three great divisions of\r\nthe Union, and at the same time, to provide against the cases of death,\r\nabsence, indisposition, or other impediment, to invest any one or more\r\nof them with full powers.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _June 12, 1797_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have received information from the commissioner appointed on the part\r\nof the United States, pursuant to the third article of our treaty with\r\nSpain, that the running and marking of the boundary line between the\r\ncolonies of East and West Florida and the territory of the United States\r\nhave been delayed by the officers of His Catholic Majesty, and that they\r\nhave declared their intention to maintain his jurisdiction, and to\r\nsuspend the withdrawing his troops from the military posts they occupy\r\nwithin the territory of the United States until the two Governments\r\nshall, by negotiation, have settled the meaning of the second article\r\nrespecting the withdrawing of the troops, garrisons, or settlements of\r\neither party in the territory of the other--that is, whether, when the\r\nSpanish garrisons withdraw, they are to leave the works standing or to\r\ndemolish them--and until, by an additional article to the treaty, the\r\nreal property of the inhabitants shall be secured, and, likewise, until\r\nthe Spanish officers are sure the Indians will be pacific. The two first\r\nquestions, if to be determined by negotiation, might be made subjects of\r\ndiscussion for years, and as no limitation of time can be prescribed to\r\nthe other, a certainty in the opinion of the Spanish officers that the\r\nIndians will be pacific, it will be impossible to suffer it to remain an\r\nobstacle to the fulfillment of the treaty on the part of Spain.\r\n\r\nTo remove the first difficulty, I have determined to leave it to the\r\ndiscretion of the officers of His Catholic Majesty when they withdraw\r\nhis troops from the forts within the territory of the United States,\r\neither to leave the works standing or to demolish them; and to remove\r\nthe second I shall cause an assurance to be published and to be\r\nparticularly communicated to the minister of His Catholic Majesty and to\r\nthe governor of Louisiana that the settlers or occupants of the lands in\r\nquestion shall not be disturbed in their possessions by the troops of\r\nthe United States, but, on the contrary, that they shall be protected in\r\nall their lawful claims; and to prevent or remove every doubt on this\r\npoint it merits the consideration of Congress whether it will not be\r\nexpedient immediately to pass a law giving positive assurances to those\r\ninhabitants who, by fair and regular grants or by occupancy, have\r\nobtained legal titles or equitable claims to lands in that country prior\r\nto the final ratification of the treaty between the United States and\r\nSpain on the 25th of April, 1796.\r\n\r\nThis country is rendered peculiarly valuable by its inhabitants, who are\r\nrepresented to amount to nearly 4,000, generally well affected and much\r\nattached to the United States, and zealous for the establishment of a\r\ngovernment under their authority.\r\n\r\nI therefore recommend to your consideration the expediency of erecting a\r\ngovernment in the district of the Natchez similar to that established\r\nfor the territory northwest of the river Ohio, but with certain\r\nmodifications relative to titles or claims of land, whether of individuals\r\nor companies, or to claims of jurisdiction of any individual State.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _June 22, 1797_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nImmediately after I had received your resolution of the 10th of June,\r\nrequesting a report respecting the depredations committed on the\r\ncommerce of the United States since the 1st of October, 1796, specifying\r\nthe name of the vessel taken, where bound to or from, species of lading,\r\nthe value (when it can be ascertained) of the vessel and cargo taken,\r\nand by what power captured, particularizing those which have been\r\nactually condemned, together with the proper documents to ascertain the\r\nsame, I directed a collection to be made of all such information as\r\nshould be found in the possession of the Government; in consequence of\r\nwhich the Secretary of State has made the report and the collection of\r\ndocuments which accompany this message, and are now laid before the\r\nHouse of Representatives in compliance with their desire.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _June 23, 1797_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe Dey of Algiers has manifested a predilection for American-built\r\nvessels, and in consequence has desired that two vessels might be\r\nconstructed and equipped as cruisers according to the choice and taste\r\nof Captain O'Brien. The cost of two such vessels built with live oak and\r\ncedar, and coppered, with guns and all other equipments complete, is\r\nestimated at $45,000. The expense of navigating them to Algiers may\r\nperhaps be compensated by the freight of the stores with which they may\r\nbe loaded on account of our stipulations by treaty with the Dey.\r\n\r\nA compliance with the Dey's request appears to me to be of serious\r\nimportance. He will repay the whole expense of building and equipping\r\nthe two vessels, and as he has advanced the price of our peace with\r\nTripoli, and become pledged for that of Tunis, the United States seem to\r\nbe under peculiar obligations to provide this accommodation, and I trust\r\nthat Congress will authorize the advance of money necessary for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nIt also appears to be of importance to place at Algiers a person as\r\nconsul in whose integrity and ability much confidence may be placed, to\r\nwhom a considerable latitude of discretion should be allowed, for the\r\ninterest of the United States in relation to their commerce. That\r\ncountry is so remote as to render it impracticable for the consul to ask\r\nand receive instructions in sudden emergencies. He may sometimes find it\r\nnecessary to make instant engagements for money or its equivalent, to\r\nprevent greater expenses or more serious evils. We can hardly hope to\r\nescape occasions of discontent proceeding from the Regency or arising\r\nfrom the misconduct or even the misfortunes of our commercial vessels\r\nnavigating in the Mediterranean Sea, and unless the causes of discontent\r\nare speedily removed the resentment of the Regency may be exerted with\r\nprecipitation on our defenseless citizens and their property, and thus,\r\noccasion a tenfold expense to the United States. For these reasons it\r\nappears to me to be expedient to vest the consul at Algiers with a\r\ndegree of discretionary power which can be requisite in no other\r\nsituation; and to encourage a person deserving the public confidence to\r\naccept so expensive and responsible a situation, it appears\r\nindispensable to allow him a handsome salary. I should confer on such a\r\nconsul a superintending power over the consulates for the States of\r\nTunis and Tripoli, especially in respect to pecuniary engagements, which\r\nshould not be made without his approbation.\r\n\r\nWhile the present salary of $2,000 a year appears adequate to the\r\nconsulates of Tunis and Tripoli, twice that sum probably will be\r\nrequisite for Algiers.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _July 3, 1797_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe whole of the intelligence which has for some time past been received\r\nfrom abroad, the correspondences between this Government and the\r\nministers of the belligerent powers residing here, and the advices\r\nfrom the officers of the United States, civil and military, upon the\r\nfrontiers all conspire to shew in a very strong light the critical\r\nsituation of our country. That Congress might be enabled to form a more\r\nperfect judgment of it and of the measures necessary to be taken,\r\nI have directed the proper officers to prepare such collections of\r\nextracts from the public correspondences as might afford the clearest\r\ninformation. The reports made to me from the Secretary of State and the\r\nSecretary of War, with a collection of documents from each of them, are\r\nnow communicated to both Houses of Congress. I have desired that the\r\nmessage, reports, and documents may be considered as confidential merely\r\nthat the members of both Houses of Congress may be apprised of their\r\ncontents before they should be made public. As soon as the two Houses\r\nshall have heard them, I shall submit to their discretion the\r\npublication of the whole, or any such parts of them as they shall\r\njudge necessary or expedient for the public good.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nBY JOHN ADAMS, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas an act of the Congress of the United States was passed on the\r\n9th day of February, 1793, entitled \"An act regulating foreign coins,\r\nand for other purposes,\" in which it was enacted \"that foreign gold and\r\nsilver coins shall pass current as money within the United States and be\r\na legal tender for the payment of all debts and demands\" at the several\r\nand respective rates therein stated; and that \"at the expiration of\r\nthree years next ensuing the time when the coinage of gold and silver\r\nagreeably to the act intituled \"An act establishing a mint and regulating\r\nthe coins of the United States\" shall commence at the Mint of the United\r\nStates (which time shall be announced by the proclamation of the\r\nPresident of the United States), all foreign gold coins and all foreign\r\nsilver coins, except Spanish milled dollars and parts of such dollars,\r\nshall cease to be a legal tender as aforesaid:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, the said John Adams, President of the United States,\r\nhereby proclaim, announce, and give notice to all whom it may concern\r\nthat, agreeably to the act last above mentioned, the coinage of silver\r\nat the Mint of the United States commenced on the 15th day of October,\r\n1794, and the coinage of gold on the 31st day of July, 1795; and that\r\nconsequently, in conformity to the act first above mentioned, all\r\nforeign silver coins, except Spanish milled dollars and parts of such\r\ndollars, will cease to pass current as money within the United States\r\nand to be a legal tender for the payment of any debts or demands after\r\nthe 15th day of October next, and all foreign gold coins will cease to\r\npass current as money within the United States and to be a legal tender\r\nas aforesaid for the payment of any debts or demands after the 31st day\r\nof July, which will be A.D. 1798.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States to be\r\naffixed to these presents, and signed the same with my hand.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at Philadelphia, the 22d day of July, A.D. 1797, and of the\r\nIndependence of the United States the twenty-second.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  TIMOTHY PICKERING,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ANNUAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _November 22, 1797_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI was for some time apprehensive that it would be necessary, on account\r\nof the contagious sickness which afflicted the city of Philadelphia,\r\nto convene the National Legislature at some other place. This measure\r\nit was desirable to avoid, because it would occasion much public\r\ninconvenience and a considerable public expense and add to the\r\ncalamities of the inhabitants of this city, whose sufferings must have\r\nexcited the sympathy of all their fellow-citizens. Therefore, after\r\ntaking measures to ascertain the state and decline of the sickness, I\r\npostponed my determination, having hopes, now happily realized, that,\r\nwithout hazard to the lives or health of the members, Congress might\r\nassemble at this place, where it was next by law to meet. I submit,\r\nhowever, to your consideration whether a power to postpone the meeting\r\nof Congress, without passing the time fixed by the Constitution upon\r\nsuch occasions, would not be a useful amendment to the law of 1794.\r\n\r\nAlthough I can not yet congratulate you on the reestablishment of peace\r\nin Europe and the restoration of security to the persons and properties\r\nof our citizens from injustice and violence at sea, we have,\r\nnevertheless, abundant cause of gratitude to the source of benevolence\r\nand influence for interior tranquillity and personal security, for\r\npropitious seasons, prosperous agriculture, productive fisheries, and\r\ngeneral improvements, and, above all, for a rational spirit of civil and\r\nreligious liberty and a calm but steady determination to support our\r\nsovereignty, as well as our moral and our religious principles, against\r\nall open and secret attacks.\r\n\r\nOur envoys extraordinary to the French Republic embarked---one in July,\r\nthe other early in August--to join their colleague in Holland. I have\r\nreceived intelligence of the arrival of both of them in Holland, from\r\nwhence they all proceeded on their journeys to Paris within a few days\r\nof the 19th of September. Whatever may be the result of this mission,\r\nI trust that nothing will have been omitted on my part to conduct the\r\nnegotiation to a successful conclusion, on such equitable terms as may\r\nbe compatible with the safety, honor, and interest of the United States.\r\nNothing, in the meantime, will contribute so much to the preservation of\r\npeace and the attainment of justice as a manifestation of that energy\r\nand unanimity of which on many former occasions the people of the United\r\nStates have given such memorable proofs, and the exertion of those\r\nresources for national defense which a beneficent Providence has kindly\r\nplaced within their power.\r\n\r\nIt may be confidently asserted that nothing has occurred since the\r\nadjournment of Congress which renders inexpedient those precautionary\r\nmeasures recommended by me to the consideration of the two Houses at the\r\nopening of your late extraordinary session. If that system was then\r\nprudent, it is more so now, as increasing depredations strengthen the\r\nreasons for its adoption.\r\n\r\nIndeed, whatever may be the issue of the negotiation with France, and\r\nwhether the war in Europe is or is not to continue, I hold it most\r\ncertain that permanent tranquillity and order will not soon be obtained.\r\nThe state of society has so long been disturbed, the sense of moral and\r\nreligious obligations so much weakened, public faith and national honor\r\nhave been so impaired, respect to treaties has been so diminished, and\r\nthe law of nations has lost so much of its force, while pride, ambition,\r\navarice, and violence have been so long unrestrained, there remains no\r\nreasonable ground on which to raise an expectation that a commerce\r\nwithout protection or defense will not be plundered.\r\n\r\nThe commerce of the United States is essential, if not to their\r\nexistence, at least to their comfort, their growth, prosperity, and\r\nhappiness. The genius, character, and habits of the people are highly\r\ncommercial. Their cities have been formed and exist upon commerce. Our\r\nagriculture, fisheries, arts, and manufactures are connected with and\r\ndepend upon it. In short, commerce has made this country what it is, and\r\nit can not be destroyed or neglected without involving the people in\r\npoverty and distress. Great numbers are directly and solely supported by\r\nnavigation. The faith of society is pledged for the preservation of the\r\nrights of commercial and seafaring no less than of the other citizens.\r\nUnder this view of our affairs, I should hold myself guilty of a neglect\r\nof duty if I forbore to recommend that we should make every exertion to\r\nprotect our commerce and to place our country in a suitable posture of\r\ndefense as the only sure means of preserving both.\r\n\r\nI have entertained an expectation that it would have been in my power\r\nat the opening of this session to have communicated to you the agreeable\r\ninformation of the due execution of our treaty with His Catholic Majesty\r\nrespecting the withdrawing of his troops from our territory and the\r\ndemarcation of the line of limits, but by the latest authentic\r\nintelligence Spanish garrisons were still continued within our country,\r\nand the running of the boundary line had not been commenced. These\r\ncircumstances are the more to be regretted as they can not fail to\r\naffect the Indians in a manner injurious to the United States. Still,\r\nhowever, indulging the hope that the answers which have been given will\r\nremove the objections offered by the Spanish officers to the immediate\r\nexecution of the treaty, I have judged it proper that we should continue\r\nin readiness to receive the posts and to run the line of limits. Further\r\ninformation on this subject will be communicated in the course of the\r\nsession.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this unpleasant state of things on our western\r\nfrontier it is proper for me to mention the attempts of foreign agents\r\nto alienate the affections of the Indian nations and to excite them to\r\nactual hostilities against the United States. Great activity has been\r\nexerted by those persons who have insinuated themselves among the Indian\r\ntribes residing within the territory of the United States to influence\r\nthem to transfer their affections and force to a foreign nation, to\r\nform them into a confederacy, and prepare them for war against the\r\nUnited States. Although measures have been taken to counteract these\r\ninfractions of our rights, to prevent Indian hostilities, and to\r\npreserve entire their attachment to the United States, it is my duty to\r\nobserve that to give a better effect to these measures and to obviate\r\nthe consequences of a repetition of such practices a law providing\r\nadequate punishment for such offenses may be necessary.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners appointed under the fifth article of the treaty of\r\namity, commerce, and navigation between the United States and Great\r\nBritain to ascertain the river which was truly intended under the\r\nname of the river St. Croix mentioned in the treaty of peace, met at\r\nPassamaquoddy Bay in October, 1796, and viewed the mouths of the rivers\r\nin question and the adjacent shores and islands, and, being of opinion\r\nthat actual surveys of both rivers to their sources were necessary,\r\ngave to the agents of the two nations instructions for that purpose,\r\nand adjourned to meet at Boston in August. They met, but the surveys\r\nrequiring more time than had been supposed, and not being then\r\ncompleted, the commissioners again adjourned, to meet at Providence,\r\nin the State of Rhode Island, in June next, when we may expect a final\r\nexamination and decision.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners appointed in pursuance of the sixth article of the\r\ntreaty met at Philadelphia in May last to examine the claims of British\r\nsubjects for debts contracted before the peace and still remaining due\r\nto them from citizens or inhabitants of the United States. Various\r\ncauses have hitherto prevented any determinations, but the business is\r\nnow resumed, and doubtless will be prosecuted without interruption.\r\n\r\nSeveral decisions on the claims of citizens of the United States for\r\nlosses and damages sustained by reason of irregular and illegal captures\r\nor condemnations of their vessels or other property have been made by\r\nthe commissioners in London comformably to the seventh article of the\r\ntreaty. The sums awarded by the commissioners have been paid by the\r\nBritish Government. A considerable number of other claims, where costs\r\nand damages, and not captured property, were the only objects in\r\nquestion, have been decided by arbitration, and the sums awarded to the\r\ncitizens of the United States have also been paid.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners appointed agreeably to the twenty-first article of our\r\ntreaty with Spain met at Philadelphia in the summer past to examine and\r\ndecide on the claims of our citizens for losses they have sustained\r\nin consequence of their vessels and cargoes having been taken by the\r\nsubjects of His Catholic Majesty during the late war between Spain and\r\nFrance. Their sittings have been interrupted, but are now resumed.\r\n\r\nThe United States being obligated to make compensation for the losses\r\nand damages sustained by British subjects, upon the award of the\r\ncommissioners acting under the sixth article of the treaty with Great\r\nBritain, and for the losses and damages sustained by British subjects by\r\nreason of the capture of their vessels and merchandise taken within the\r\nlimits and jurisdiction of the United States and brought into their\r\nports, or taken by vessels originally armed in ports of the United\r\nStates, upon the awards of the commissioners acting under the seventh\r\narticle of the same treaty, it is necessary that provision be made for\r\nfulfilling these obligations.\r\n\r\nThe numerous captures of American vessels by the cruisers of the French\r\nRepublic and of some by those of Spain have occasioned considerable\r\nexpenses in making and supporting the claims of our citizens before\r\ntheir tribunals. The sums required for this purpose have in divers\r\ninstances been disbursed by the consuls of the United States. By means\r\nof the same captures great numbers of our seamen have been thrown ashore\r\nin foreign countries, destitute of all means of subsistence, and the\r\nsick in particular have been exposed to grievous sufferings. The consuls\r\nhave in these cases also advanced moneys for their relief. For these\r\nadvances they reasonably expect reimbursements from the United States.\r\n\r\nThe consular act relative to seamen requires revision and amendment. The\r\nprovisions for their support in foreign countries and for their return\r\nare found to be inadequate and ineffectual. Another provision seems\r\nnecessary to be added to the consular act. Some foreign vessels have\r\nbeen discovered sailing under the flag of the United States and with\r\nforged papers. It seldom happens that the consuls can detect this\r\ndeception, because they have no authority to demand an inspection of\r\nthe registers and sea letters.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIt is my duty to recommend to your serious consideration those objects\r\nwhich by the Constitution are placed particularly within your\r\nsphere--the national debts and taxes.\r\n\r\nSince the decay of the feudal system, by which the public defense was\r\nprovided for chiefly at the expense of individuals, the system of loans\r\nhas been introduced, and as no nation can raise within the year by taxes\r\nsufficient sums for its defense and military operations in time of war,\r\nthe sums loaned and debts contracted have necessarily become the\r\nsubjects of what have been called funding systems. The consequences\r\narising from the continual accumulation of public debts in other\r\ncountries ought to admonish us to be careful to prevent their growth in\r\nour own. The national defense must be provided for as well as the\r\nsupport of Government; but both should be accomplished as much as\r\npossible by immediate taxes, and as little as possible by loans.\r\n\r\nThe estimates for the service of the ensuing year will by my direction\r\nbe laid before you.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nWe are met together at a most interesting period. The situations of the\r\nprincipal powers of Europe are singular and portentous. Connected with\r\nsome by treaties and with all by commerce, no important event there can\r\nbe indifferent to us. Such circumstances call with peculiar importunity\r\nnot less for a disposition to unite in all those measures on which the\r\nhonor, safety, and prosperity of our country depend than for all the\r\nexertions of wisdom and firmness.\r\n\r\nIn all such measures you may rely on my zealous and hearty concurrence.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF THE SENATE TO JOHN ADAMS, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: The communications you thought proper to make in your speech to\r\nboth Houses of Congress on the opening of their present session afford\r\nadditional proofs of the attention, integrity, and firmness which have\r\nalways marked your official character.\r\n\r\nWe can not but approve of the measures you had taken to ascertain\r\nthe state and decline of the contagious sickness which has so lately\r\nafflicted the city of Philadelphia, and the pleasing circumstance that\r\nCongress is now assembled at that place without hazard to the health\r\nof its members evinces the propriety of your having postponed a\r\ndetermination to convene the National Legislature at another place. We\r\nshall take into consideration the law of 1794 on this subject, and will\r\nreadily concur in any amendment which may be deemed expedient.\r\n\r\nIt would have given us much pleasure to have received your\r\ncongratulations on the reestablishment of peace in Europe and the\r\nrestoration of security to the persons and property of our citizens from\r\ninjustice and violence at sea; but though these events, so desirable to\r\nour country and the world, have not taken place, yet we have abundant\r\ncause of gratitude to the Great Disposer of Human Events for interior\r\ntranquillity and personal security, for propitious seasons, prosperous\r\nagriculture, productive fisheries, and general improvement, and, above\r\nall, for a rational spirit of civil and religious liberty and a calm but\r\nsteady determination to support our sovereignty against all open and\r\nsecret attacks.\r\n\r\nWe learn with satisfaction that our envoys extraordinary to the French\r\nRepublic had safely arrived in Europe and were proceeding to the scene\r\nof negotiation, and whatever may be the result of the mission, we are\r\nperfectly satisfied that nothing on your part has been omitted which\r\ncould in any way conduce to a successful conclusion of the negotiation\r\nupon terms compatible with the safety, honor, and interest of the United\r\nStates; and we are fully convinced that in the meantime a manifestation\r\nof that unanimity and energy of which the people of the United States\r\nhave given such memorable proofs and a proper exertion of those\r\nresources of national defense which we possess will essentially\r\ncontribute to the preservation of peace and the attainment of justice.\r\n\r\nWe think, sir, with you that the commerce of the United States is\r\nessential to the growth, comfort, and prosperity of our country, and\r\nthat the faith of society is pledged for the preservation of the rights\r\nof commercial and seafaring no less than of other citizens. And even if\r\nour negotiation with France should terminate favorably and the war in\r\nEurope cease, yet the state of society which unhappily prevails in so\r\ngreat a portion of the world and the experience of past times under\r\nbetter circumstances unite in warning us that a commerce so extensive\r\nand which holds out so many temptations to lawless plunderers can never\r\nbe safe without protection; and we hold ourselves obliged by every tie\r\nof duty which binds us to our constituents to promote and concur in such\r\nmeasures of marine defense as may convince our merchants and seamen that\r\ntheir rights are not sacrificed nor their injuries forgotten.\r\n\r\nWe regret that, notwithstanding the clear and explicit terms of the\r\ntreaty between the United States and His Catholic Majesty, the Spanish\r\ngarrisons are not yet withdrawn from our territory nor the running of\r\nthe boundary line commenced. The United States have been faithful in the\r\nperformance of their obligations to Spain, and had reason to expect a\r\ncompliance equally prompt on the part of that power. We still, however,\r\nindulge the hope that the convincing answers which have been given to\r\nthe objections stated by the Spanish officers to the immediate execution\r\nof the treaty will have their proper effect, and that this treaty, so\r\nmutually beneficial to the contracting parties, will be finally observed\r\nwith good faith. We therefore entirely approve of your determination to\r\ncontinue in readiness to receive the posts and to run the line of\r\npartition between our territory and that of the King of Spain.\r\n\r\nAttempts to alienate the affections of the Indians, to form them into a\r\nconfederacy, and to excite them to actual hostility against the United\r\nStates, whether made by foreign agents or by others, are so injurious to\r\nour interests at large and so inhuman with respect to our citizens\r\ninhabiting the adjacent territory as to deserve the most exemplary\r\npunishment, and we will cheerfully afford our aid in framing a law which\r\nmay prescribe a punishment adequate to the commission of crimes so\r\nheinous.\r\n\r\nThe several objects you have pointed out to the attention of the\r\nLegislature, whether they regard our internal or external relations,\r\nshall receive from us that consideration which they merit, and we will\r\nreadily concur in all such measures as may be necessary either to enable\r\nus to fulfill our engagements at home or to cause ourselves to be\r\nrespected abroad; and at this portentous period, when the powers of\r\nEurope with whom we are connected by treaty or commerce are in so\r\ncritical a situation, and when the conduct of some of those powers\r\ntoward the United States is so hostile and menacing, the several\r\nbranches of the Government are, in our opinion, called upon with\r\npeculiar importunity to unite, and by union not only to devise and carry\r\ninto effect those measures on which the safety and prosperity of our\r\ncountry depend, but also to undeceive those nations who, regarding us\r\nas a weak and divided people, have pursued systems of aggression\r\ninconsistent with a state of peace between independent nations. And,\r\nsir, we beg leave to assure you that we derive a singular consolation\r\nfrom the reflection that at such a time the executive part of our\r\nGovernment has been committed to your hands, for in your integrity,\r\ntalents, and firmness we place the most entire confidence.\r\n\r\nJACOB READ,\r\n\r\n_President of the Senate pro tempore_.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 27, 1797.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _November 28, 1797_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate:_\r\n\r\nI thank you for this address.\r\n\r\nWhen, after the most laborious investigation and serious reflection,\r\nwithout partial considerations or personal motives, measures have been\r\nadopted or recommended, I can receive no higher testimony of their\r\nrectitude than the approbation of an assembly so independent, patriotic,\r\nand enlightened as the Senate of the United States.\r\n\r\nNothing has afforded me more entire satisfaction than the coincidence\r\nof your judgment with mine in the opinion of the essential importance\r\nof our commerce and the absolute necessity of a maritime defense. What\r\nis it that has drawn to Europe the superfluous riches of the three\r\nother quarters of the globe but a marine? What is it that has drained\r\nthe wealth of Europe itself into the coffers of two or three of its\r\nprincipal commercial powers but a marine?\r\n\r\nThe world has furnished no example of a flourishing commerce without a\r\nmaritime protection, and a moderate knowledge of man and his history\r\nwill convince anyone that no such prodigy ever can arise. A mercantile\r\nmarine and a military marine must grow up together; one can not long\r\nexist without the other.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO JOHN ADAMS, PRESIDENT OF THE\r\nUNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: While our sympathy is excited by the recent sufferings of the\r\ncitizens of Philadelphia, we participate in the satisfaction which you\r\nare pleased to express that the duration of the late calamity was so\r\nlimited as to render unnecessary the expense and inconvenience that\r\nwould have been incident to the convention of Congress in another place;\r\nand we shall readily attend to every useful amendment of the law which\r\ncontemplates the event of contagious sickness at the seat of Government.\r\n\r\nIn lamenting the increase of the injuries offered to the persons\r\nand property of our citizens at sea we gratefully acknowledge the\r\ncontinuance of interior tranquillity and the attendant blessings of\r\nwhich you remind us as alleviations of these fatal effects of injustice\r\nand violence.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the result of the mission to the French Republic, your\r\nearly and uniform attachment to the interest of our country, your\r\nimportant services in the struggle for its independence, and your\r\nunceasing exertions for its welfare afford no room to doubt of the\r\nsincerity of your efforts to conduct the negotiation to a successful\r\nconclusion on such terms as may be compatible with the safety, honor,\r\nand interest of the United States. We have also a firm reliance upon the\r\nenergy and unanimity of the people of these States in the assertion of\r\ntheir rights, and on their determination to exert upon all proper\r\noccasions their ample resources in providing for the national defense.\r\n\r\nThe importance of commerce and its beneficial influence upon\r\nagriculture, arts, and manufactures have been verified in the growth and\r\nprosperity of our country. It is essentially connected with the other\r\ngreat interests of the community; they must flourish and decline\r\ntogether; and while the extension of our navigation and trade naturally\r\nexcites the jealousy and tempts the avarice of other nations, we are\r\nfirmly persuaded that the numerous and deserving class of citizens\r\nengaged in these pursuits and dependent on them for their subsistence\r\nhas a strong and indisputable claim to our support and protection.\r\n\r\nThe delay of the Spanish officers to fulfill the treaty existing with\r\nHis Catholic Majesty is a source of deep regret. We learn, however, with\r\nsatisfaction that you still indulge hopes of removing the objections\r\nwhich have been made to its execution, and that you have continued in\r\nreadiness to receive the posts. Disposed to perform with fidelity our\r\nnational engagements, nothing shall be wanting on our part to obtain the\r\nsame justice from others which we exercise toward them.\r\n\r\nOur abhorrence can not be too strongly expressed of the intrigues of\r\nforeign agents to alienate the affections of the Indians and to rouse\r\nthem to acts of hostility against the United States. No means in our\r\npower should be omitted of providing for the suppression of such cruel\r\npractices and for the adequate punishment of their atrocious authors.\r\n\r\nUpon the other interesting subjects noticed in your address we shall\r\nbestow the requisite attention. To preserve inviolable the public\r\nfaith by providing for the due execution of our treaties, to indemnify\r\nthose who may have just claims to retribution upon the United States\r\nfor expenses incurred in defending the property and relieving the\r\nnecessities of our unfortunate fellow-citizens, to guard against\r\nevasions of the laws intended to secure advantages to the navigation\r\nof our own vessels, and especially to prevent by all possible means an\r\nunnecessary accumulation of the public debt, are duties which we shall\r\nendeavor to keep in view and discharge with assiduity.\r\n\r\nWe regard with great anxiety the singular and portentous situation of\r\nthe principal powers of Europe. It were devoutly to be wished that the\r\nUnited States, remote from this seat of war and discord, unambitious of\r\nconquests, respecting the rights of other nations, and desirous merely\r\nto avail themselves of their natural resources, might be permitted to\r\nbehold the scenes which desolate that quarter of the globe with only\r\nthose sympathetic emotions which are natural to the lovers of peace and\r\nfriends of the human race. But we are led by events to associate with\r\nthese feelings a sense of the dangers which menace our security and\r\npeace. We rely upon your assurances of a zealous and hearty concurrence\r\nin such measures as may be necessary to avert these dangers, and nothing\r\non our part shall be wanting to repel them which the honor, safety, and\r\nprosperity of our country may require.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 28, 1797.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _November 29, 1797_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI receive this address from the House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates with peculiar pleasure.\r\n\r\nYour approbation of the meeting of Congress in this city and of those\r\nother measures of the Executive authority of Government communicated in\r\nmy address to both Houses at the opening of the session afford me great\r\nsatisfaction, as the strongest desire of my heart is to give\r\nsatisfaction to the people and their Representatives by a faithful\r\ndischarge of my duty.\r\n\r\nThe confidence you express in the sincerity of my endeavors and in the\r\nunanimity of the people does me much honor and gives me great joy.\r\n\r\nI rejoice in that harmony which appears in the sentiments of all\r\nthe branches of the Government on the importance of our commerce\r\nand our obligations to defend it, as well as in all the other subjects\r\nrecommended to your consideration, and sincerely congratulate you and\r\nour fellow-citizens at large on this appearance, so auspicious to the\r\nhonor, interest, and happiness of the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 6, 1797_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIsaac Smith, esq., who was appointed, with the advice and consent of\r\nthe Senate, to hold a treaty with the Seneca Nation of Indians, to\r\nsuperintend the purchase of a parcel of their land under a right of\r\npreemption derived from the State of Massachusetts, and situated within\r\nthe State of New York, having declined that service, Jeremiah Wadsworth,\r\nesq., was appointed during your recess to hold a treaty, which has\r\nterminated in a deed of bargain and sale, herewith submitted to your\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nIt being represented to me that the immediate investment in bank stock\r\nof the moneys which are to be the consideration of this deed might be\r\nattended with considerable loss to the Indians by raising the market\r\nprice of that article, it is suggested whether it would not be expedient\r\nthat the ratification should be made conclusive and binding on the\r\nparties only after the President shall be satisfied that the investment\r\nof the moneys has been made conformably to the intention of the treaty.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 13, 1797_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you the copy of a letter from the judges of the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States, representing the inconvenience arising from\r\naltering the time of holding the circuit court for the State of Delaware\r\nfrom April to June, and desiring that the existing law may be altered by\r\nrestoring the spring session of the circuit court in Delaware to the\r\n27th of April.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 30, 1797_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the desire of the two Houses of Congress, expressed\r\nin their resolution of the 2d of March, 1797, that some speedy and\r\neffectual means might be adopted of obtaining information from the\r\nStates of Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia,\r\nKentucky, Tennessee, and South Carolina whether they have ratified the\r\namendment proposed by Congress to the Constitution concerning the\r\nsuability of States, and if they have, to obtain proper evidences,\r\nmeasures have been taken and information and evidences obtained the\r\nparticulars of which will appear in the report from the Secretary of\r\nState made by my direction on the 28th day of this month, and now\r\npresented to the two Houses for their consideration.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 5, 1798_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe Secretary for the Department of War on the 30th day of December last\r\nmade a representation to me of the situation of affairs in his office,\r\nwhich I now transmit to the Senate and House of Representatives, and\r\nrecommend to their consideration and decision.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 8, 1798_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nThe situation of affairs between some of the citizens of the United\r\nStates and the Cherokee Indians has evinced the propriety of holding a\r\ntreaty with that nation to extinguish by purchase their right to certain\r\nparcels of land and to adjust and settle other points relative to the\r\nsafety and conveniency of our citizens. With this view I nominate Fisher\r\nAmes, of Dedham, in the State of Massachusetts; Bushrod Washington, of\r\nRichmond, in the State of Virginia, and Alfred Moore, of North Carolina,\r\nto be commissioners of the United States with full powers to hold\r\nconferences and conclude a treaty with the Cherokee Nation of Indians\r\nfor the purposes before mentioned.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 17, 1798_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have now an opportunity of transmitting to Congress a report of the\r\nSecretary of State, with a copy of an act of the legislature of the\r\nState of Kentucky consenting to the ratification of the amendment of\r\nthe Constitution of the United States proposed by Congress in their\r\nresolution of the 2d day of December, 1793, relative to the suability\r\nof States. This amendment, having been adopted by three-fourths of the\r\nseveral States, may now be declared to be a part of the Constitution of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 17, 1798_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe situation of affairs between the United States and the Cherokee\r\nIndians having evinced the expediency of a treaty with that nation for\r\nthe promotion of justice to them, as well as of the interests and\r\nconvenience of our citizens, I have nominated and, by and with the\r\nadvice and consent of the Senate, appointed commissioners to hold\r\nconferences and conclude a treaty as early as the season of the year\r\nand the convenience of the parties will admit.\r\n\r\nAs we know very well by experience such negotiations can not be carried\r\non without considerable expenses, I recommend to your consideration the\r\npropriety of making an appropriation at this time for defraying such as\r\nmay be necessary for holding and concluding a treaty.\r\n\r\nThat you may form your judgments with greater facility, I shall direct\r\nthe proper officer to lay before you an estimate of such articles and\r\nexpenses as may be thought indispensable.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 18, 1798_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nA representation has been made to me by the judge of the Pennsylvania\r\ndistrict of the United States of certain inconveniences and disagreeable\r\ncircumstances which have occurred in the execution of the law passed on\r\nthe 28th day of May, 1796, entitled \"An act for the relief of persons\r\nimprisoned for debt,\" as well as of certain doubts which have been\r\nraised concerning its construction. This representation, together with\r\na report of the Attorney-General on the same subject, I now transmit to\r\nCongress for their consideration, that if any amendments or explanations\r\nof that law should be thought advisable they may be adopted.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 23, 1798_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of this session of Congress I proposed in the course\r\nof it to communicate to both Houses further information concerning\r\nthe situation of our affairs in the territories of the United States\r\nsituated on the Mississippi River and in its neighborhood; our\r\nintercourse with the Indian nations; our relations with the Spanish\r\nGovernment, and the conduct of their officers and agents. This\r\ninformation will be found in a report of the Secretary of State and the\r\ndocuments attending it, which I now present to the Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 2, 1798_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have received from our minister in London two acts of the Parliament\r\nof Great Britain, one passed on the 4th of July, 1797, entitled \"An\r\nact for carrying into execution the treaty of amity, commerce, and\r\nnavigation concluded between His Majesty and the United States of\r\nAmerica,\" the other passed on the 19th day of July, 1797, entitled\r\n\"An act for regulating the trade to be carried on with the British\r\npossessions in India by the ships of nations in amity with His Majesty.\"\r\nThese acts have such connections with the commercial and political\r\ninterests of the United States that it is proper they should be\r\ncommunicated to Congress. I have accordingly transmitted copies of\r\nthem with this message.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 5, 1798_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have received a letter from His Excellency Charles Pinckney, esq.,\r\ngovernor of the State of South Carolina, dated the 22d of October, 1797,\r\ninclosing a number of depositions of witnesses to several captures and\r\noutrages committed within and near the limits of the United States by a\r\nFrench privateer belonging to Cape Francois, or Monte Christo, called\r\nthe _Vertitude_ or _Fortitude_, and commanded by a person of the name of\r\nJordan or Jourdain, and particularly upon an English merchant ship named\r\nthe _Oracabissa_, which he first plundered and then burned, with the\r\nrest of her cargo, of great value, within the territory of the United\r\nStates, in the harbor of Charleston, on the 17th day of October last,\r\ncopies of which letter and depositions, and also of several other\r\ndepositions relative to the same subject, received from the collector\r\nof Charleston, are herewith communicated.\r\n\r\nWhenever the channels of diplomatical communication between the United\r\nStates and France shall be opened, I shall demand satisfaction for the\r\ninsult and reparation for the injury.\r\n\r\nI have transmitted these papers to Congress not so much for the purpose\r\nof communicating an account of so daring a violation of the territory of\r\nthe United States as to show the propriety and necessity of enabling the\r\nExecutive authority of Government to take measures for protecting the\r\ncitizens of the United States and such foreigners as have a right to\r\nenjoy their peace and the protection of their laws within their limits\r\nin that as well as some other harbors which are equally exposed.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 12, 1798_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the law, I now present to both Houses of Congress my\r\nannual account of expenditures from the contingent fund during the year\r\n1797, by which it appears that on the 1st day of January last there\r\nremained in the Treasury a balance of $15,494.24 subject to future\r\ndispositions of Government.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 18, 1798_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn the report of the Secretary of State and the documents herewith\r\ntransmitted will be found such information as is in our possession of\r\nthe losses recovered by the citizens of the United States under the\r\ntreaty made with Great Britain, which are now presented to the House of\r\nRepresentatives in compliance with their request in their resolution of\r\nthe 1st of this month.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 20, 1798_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the law of the United States of the 3d of March, 1797,\r\nentitled \"An act authorizing an expenditure and making an appropriation\r\nfor the prosecution of the claims of certain citizens of the United\r\nStates for property captured by the belligerent powers,\" I submit to\r\nCongress the account exhibited to me by the Secretary of State with his\r\nreport of the 17th of this month.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 21, 1798_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nHaving received the original treaty concluded between the United States\r\nand the Government of Tunis, I lay it before the Senate of the United\r\nStates whether they advise and consent to its ratification.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 23, 1798_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe inclosed memorial from the commissioners appointed under an act of\r\nthe United States entitled \"An act for establishing the temporary and\r\npermanent seat of the Government of the United States,\" representing\r\nthe situation and circumstances of the city of Washington, I take this\r\nopportunity to present to both Houses of the Legislature and recommend\r\nto their consideration. Alexander White, esq., one of those commissioners,\r\nis now in this city, and will be able to give to Congress, or any of\r\ntheir committees, any explanation or further information which the\r\nsubject may require.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _March 5, 1798_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe first dispatches from our envoys extraordinary since their arrival\r\nat Paris were received at the Secretary of State's office at a late hour\r\nlast evening. They are all in a character which will require some days\r\nto be deciphered, except the last, which is dated the 8th of January,\r\n1798. The contents of this letter are of so much importance to be\r\nimmediately made known to Congress and to the public, especially to the\r\nmercantile part of our fellow-citizens, that I have thought it my duty\r\nto communicate them to both Houses without loss of time.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _March 12, 1798_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nInsinuations having been repeatedly made in the name of the Court of\r\nSweden of an inclination to renew the connection between the United\r\nStates and that power, I sent, in the recess of the Senate, to our\r\nminister at Berlin a full power to negotiate that business, with\r\nsuch alterations as might be agreeable to both parties; but as that\r\ncommission, if not renewed with the advice and consent of the Senate,\r\nwill expire with the present session of Congress, I now nominate John\r\nQuincy Adams to be a commissioner with full powers to negotiate a treaty\r\nof amity and commerce with His Majesty the King of Sweden.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _March 19, 1798_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe dispatches from the envoys extraordinary of the United States to the\r\nFrench Republic, which were mentioned in my message to both Houses of\r\nCongress of the 5th instant, have been examined and maturely considered.\r\n\r\nWhile I feel a satisfaction in informing you that their exertions for\r\nthe adjustment of the differences between the two nations have been\r\nsincere and unremitted, it is incumbent on me to declare that I perceive\r\nno ground of expectation that the objects of their mission can be\r\naccomplished on terms compatible with the safety, the honor, or the\r\nessential interests of the nation.\r\n\r\nThis result can not with justice be attributed to any want of moderation\r\non the part of this Government, or to any indisposition to forego\r\nsecondary interests for the preservation of peace. Knowing it to be\r\nmy duty, and believing it to be your wish, as well as that of the\r\ngreat body of the people, to avoid by all reasonable concessions any\r\nparticipation in the contentions of Europe, the powers vested in our\r\nenvoys were commensurate with a liberal and pacific policy and that high\r\nconfidence which might justly be reposed in the abilities, patriotism,\r\nand integrity of the characters to whom the negotiation was committed.\r\nAfter a careful review of the whole subject, with the aid of all the\r\ninformation I have received, I can discern nothing which could have\r\ninsured or contributed to success that has been omitted on my part, and\r\nnothing further which can be attempted consistently with maxims for\r\nwhich our country has contended at every hazard, and which constitute\r\nthe basis of our national sovereignty.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances I can not forbear to reiterate the\r\nrecommendations which have been formerly made, and to exhort you to\r\nadopt with promptitude, decision, and unanimity such measures as\r\nthe ample resources of the country afford for the protection of our\r\nseafaring and commercial citizens, for the defense of any exposed\r\nportions of our territory, for replenishing our arsenals, establishing\r\nfoundries and military manufactures, and to provide such efficient\r\nrevenue as will be necessary to defray extraordinary expenses and supply\r\nthe deficiencies which may be occasioned by depredations on our\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nThe present state of things is so essentially different from that in\r\nwhich instructions were given to the collectors to restrain vessels of\r\nthe United States from sailing in an armed condition that the principle\r\non which those orders were issued has ceased to exist. I therefore\r\ndeem it proper to inform Congress that I no longer conceive myself\r\njustifiable in continuing them, unless in particular cases where there\r\nmay be reasonable ground of suspicion that such vessels are intended\r\nto be employed contrary to law.\r\n\r\nIn all your proceedings it will be important to manifest a zeal, vigor,\r\nand concert in defense of the national rights proportioned to the danger\r\nwith which they are threatened.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _April 3, 1798_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the request of the House of Representatives expressed\r\nin their resolution of the 2d of this month, I transmit to both Houses\r\nthose instructions to and dispatches from the envoys extraordinary of\r\nthe United States to the French Republic which were mentioned in my\r\nmessage of the 19th of March last, omitting only some names and a few\r\nexpressions descriptive of the persons.\r\n\r\nI request that they may be considered in confidence until the members\r\nof Congress are fully possessed of their contents and shall have had\r\nopportunity to deliberate on the consequences of their publication,\r\nafter which time I submit them to your wisdom.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _April 12, 1798_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nA treaty with the Mohawk Nation of Indians has by accident lain long\r\nneglected. It was executed under the authority of the Honorable Isaac\r\nSmith, a commissioner of the United States. I now submit it to the\r\nSenate for their consideration.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _May 3, 1798_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nHis Excellency John Jay, esq., governor of New York, has informed me\r\nthat the Oneida tribe of Indians have proposed to sell a part of their\r\nland to the said State, and that the legislature at their late session\r\nauthorized the purchase, and to accomplish this object the governor has\r\ndesired that a commissioner may be appointed to hold a treaty with the\r\nOneida tribe of Indians, at which the agents of the State of New York\r\nmay agree with them on the terms of the purchase. I therefore nominate\r\nJoseph Hopkinson, esq., of Pennsylvania, to be the commissioner to hold\r\na treaty with the said Oneida tribe of Indians for the purpose above\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _June 21, 1798_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nWhile I congratulate you on the arrival of General Marshall, one of our\r\nlate envoys extraordinary to the French Republic, at a place of safety,\r\nwhere he is justly held in honor, I think it my duty to communicate to\r\nyou a letter received by him from Mr. Gerry, the only one of the three\r\nwho has not received his congé. This letter, together with another from\r\nthe minister of foreign relations to him of the 3d of April, and his\r\nanswer of the 4th, will shew the situation in which he remains--his\r\nintentions and prospects.\r\n\r\nI presume that before this time he has received fresh instructions (a\r\ncopy of which accompanies this message) to consent to no loans, and\r\ntherefore the negotiation may be considered at an end.\r\n\r\nI will never send another minister to France without assurances that he\r\nwill be received, respected, and honored as the representative of a\r\ngreat, free, powerful, and independent nation.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _June 27, 1798_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have received a letter from His Excellency Thomas Mifflin, governor of\r\nPennsylvania, inclosing some documents which I judge it my duty to lay\r\nbefore Congress without loss of time.\r\n\r\nAs my opinion coincides entirely with that of his excellency the\r\ngovernor, I recommend the subject to the consideration of both Houses of\r\nCongress, whose authority alone appears to me adequate to the occasion.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _July 2, 1798_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI nominate George Washington, of Mount Vernon, to be Lieutenant-General\r\nand Commander in Chief of all the armies raised or to be raised in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _July 13, 1798_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nA resolution of both Houses of Congress authorizing an adjournment on\r\nMonday, the 16th of this month, has been laid before me. Sensible of\r\nthe severity of the service in so long a session, it is with great\r\nreluctance that I find myself obliged to offer any consideration which\r\nmay operate against the inclinations of the members; but certain\r\nmeasures of Executive authority which will require the consideration of\r\nthe Senate, and which can not be matured, in all probability, before\r\nMonday or Tuesday, oblige me to request of the Senate that they would\r\ncontinue their session until Wednesday or Thursday.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _July 17, 1798_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nBelieving that the letter received this morning from General Washington\r\nwill give high satisfaction to the Senate, I transmit them a copy of it,\r\nand congratulate them and the public on this great event--the General's\r\nacceptance of his appointment as Lieutenant-General and Commander in\r\nChief of the Army.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOUNT VERNON, _July 13, 1798_.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS,\r\n\r\n_President of the United States_.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR: I had the honor, on the evening of the 11th instant, to\r\nreceive from the hands of the Secretary of War your favor of the 7th,\r\nannouncing that you had, with the advice and consent of the Senate,\r\nappointed me \"Lieutenant-General and Commander in Chief of all the\r\narmies raised or to be raised for the service of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nI can not express how greatly affected I am at this new proof of public\r\nconfidence and the highly flattering manner in which you have been\r\npleased to make the communication. At the same time I must not conceal\r\nfrom you my earnest wish that the choice had fallen upon a man less\r\ndeclined in years and better qualified to encounter the usual\r\nvicissitudes of war.\r\n\r\nYou know, sir, what calculation I had made relative to the probable\r\ncourse of events on my retiring from office, and the determination I had\r\nconsoled myself with of closing the remnant of my days in my present\r\npeaceful abode. You will therefore be at no loss to conceive and\r\nappreciate the sensations I must have experienced to bring my mind to\r\nany conclusion that would pledge me, at so late a period of life, to\r\nleave scenes I sincerely love to enter upon the boundless field of\r\npublic action, incessant trouble, and high responsibility.\r\n\r\nIt was not possible for me to remain ignorant of or indifferent to\r\nrecent transactions. The conduct of the Directory of France toward our\r\ncountry, their insidious hostility to its Government, their various\r\npractices to withdraw the affections of the people from it, the evident\r\ntendency of their acts and those of their agents to countenance and\r\ninvigorate opposition, their disregard of solemn treaties and the laws\r\nof nations, their war upon our defenseless commerce, their treatment of\r\nour ministers of peace, and their demands amounting to tribute could not\r\nfail to excite in me corresponding sentiments with those my countrymen\r\nhave so generally expressed in their affectionate addresses to you.\r\nBelieve me, sir, no one can more cordially approve of the wise and\r\nprudent measures of your Administration. They ought to inspire universal\r\nconfidence, and will no doubt, combined with the state of things, call\r\nfrom Congress such laws and means as will enable you to meet the full\r\nforce and extent of the crisis.\r\n\r\nSatisfied, therefore, that you have sincerely wished and endeavored to\r\navert war, and exhausted to the last drop the cup of reconciliation, we\r\ncan with pure hearts appeal to Heaven for the justice of our cause, and\r\nmay confidently trust the final result to that kind Providence who has\r\nheretofore and so often signally favored the people of these United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThinking in this manner, and feeling how incumbent it is upon every\r\nperson, of every description, to contribute at all times to his\r\ncountry's welfare, and especially in a moment like the present, when\r\neverything we hold dear and sacred is so seriously threatened, I have\r\nfinally determined to accept the commission of Commander in Chief of the\r\narmies of the United States, with the reserve only that I shall not be\r\ncalled into the field until the Army is in a situation to require my\r\npresence or it becomes indispensable by the urgency of circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn making this reservation I beg it to be understood that I do not mean\r\nto withhold any assistance to arrange and organize the Army which you\r\nmay think I can afford. I take the liberty also to mention that I\r\nmust decline having my acceptance considered as drawing after it any\r\nimmediate charge upon the public, or that I can receive any emoluments\r\nannexed to the appointment before entering into a situation to incur\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War being anxious to return to the seat of Government,\r\nI have detained him no longer than was necessary to a full communication\r\nupon the several points he had in charge.\r\n\r\nWith very great respect and consideration, I have the honor to be, dear\r\nsir, your most obedient and humble servant,\r\n\r\nG'o. WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nAs the safety and prosperity of nations ultimately and essentially\r\ndepend on the protection and the blessing of Almighty God, and the\r\nnational acknowledgment of this truth is not only an indispensable duty\r\nwhich the people owe to Him, but a duty whose natural influence is\r\nfavorable to the promotion of that morality and piety without which\r\nsocial happiness can not exist nor the blessings of a free government\r\nbe enjoyed; and as this duty, at all times incumbent, is so especially\r\nin seasons of difficulty or of danger, when existing or threatening\r\ncalamities, the just judgments of God against prevalent iniquity, are\r\na loud call to repentance and reformation; and as the United States of\r\nAmerica are at present placed in a hazardous and afflictive situation\r\nby the unfriendly disposition, conduct, and demands of a foreign power,\r\nevinced by repeated refusals to receive our messengers of reconciliation\r\nand peace, by depredations on our commerce, and the infliction of\r\ninjuries on very many of our fellow-citizens while engaged in their\r\nlawful business on the seas--under these considerations it has appeared\r\nto me that the duty of imploring the mercy and benediction of Heaven\r\non our country demands at this time a special attention from its\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nI have therefore thought fit to recommend, and I do hereby recommend,\r\nthat Wednesday, the 9th day of May next, be observed throughout the\r\nUnited States as a day of solemn humiliation, fasting, and prayer; that\r\nthe citizens of these States, abstaining on that day from their\r\ncustomary worldly occupations, offer their devout addresses to the\r\nFather of Mercies agreeably to those forms or methods which they have\r\nseverally adopted as the most suitable and becoming; that all religious\r\ncongregations do, with the deepest humility, acknowledge before God the\r\nmanifold sins and transgressions with which we are justly chargeable as\r\nindividuals and as a nation, beseeching Him at the same time, of His\r\ninfinite grace, through the Redeemer of the World, freely to remit all\r\nour offenses, and to incline us by His Holy Spirit to that sincere\r\nrepentance and reformation which may afford us reason to hope for his\r\ninestimable favor and heavenly benediction; that it be made the subject\r\nof particular and earnest supplication that our country may be protected\r\nfrom all the dangers which threaten it; that our civil and religious\r\nprivileges may be preserved inviolate and perpetuated to the latest\r\ngenerations; that our public councils and magistrates may be especially\r\nenlightened and directed at this critical period; that the American\r\npeople may be united in those bonds of amity and mutual confidence and\r\ninspired with that vigor and fortitude by which they have in times past\r\nbeen so highly distinguished and by which they have obtained such\r\ninvaluable advantages; that the health of the inhabitants of our land\r\nmay be preserved, and their agriculture, commerce, fisheries, arts, and\r\nmanufactures be blessed and prospered; that the principles of genuine\r\npiety and sound morality may influence the minds and govern the lives of\r\nevery description of our citizens, and that the blessings of peace,\r\nfreedom, and pure religion may be speedily extended to all the nations\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, I recommend that on the said day the duties of humiliation\r\nand prayer be accompanied by fervent thanksgiving to the Bestower\r\nof Every Good Gift, not only for His having hitherto protected and\r\npreserved the people of these United States in the independent enjoyment\r\nof their religious and civil freedom, but also for having prospered them\r\nin a wonderful progress of population, and for conferring on them many\r\nand great favors conducive to the happiness and prosperity of a nation.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand and the seal of the United States of America, at\r\nPhiladelphia, this 23d day of March, A.D. 1798, and of the Independence\r\nof the said States the twenty-second.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  TIMOTHY PICKERING,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From C.R. Adams's Works of John Adams, Vol. IX, p. 170.]\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nJULY 13, 1798.\r\n\r\nThe citizen Joseph Philippe Letombe having heretofore produced to the\r\nPresident of the United States his commission as consul-general of the\r\nFrench Republic within the United States of America, and another\r\ncommission as consul of the French Republic at Philadelphia; and, in\r\nlike manner, the citizen Rosier having produced his commission as\r\nvice-consul of the French Republic at New York; and the citizen Arcambal\r\nhaving produced his commission as vice-consul of the French Republic at\r\nNewport; and citizen Theodore Charles Mozard having produced his\r\ncommission as consul of the French Republic within the States of New\r\nHampshire, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island; and the President of the\r\nUnited States having thereupon granted an exequatur to each of the\r\nFrench citizens above named, recognizing them in their respective\r\nconsular offices above mentioned, and declaring them respectively free\r\nto exercise and enjoy such functions, powers, and privileges as are\r\nallowed to a consul-general, consuls, and vice-consuls of the French\r\nRepublic by their treaties, conventions, and laws in that case made and\r\nprovided; and the Congress of the United States, by their act passed the\r\n7th day of July, 1798, having declared \"that the United States are of\r\nright freed and exonerated from the stipulations of the treaties and of\r\nthe consular convention heretofore concluded between the United States\r\nand France, and that the same shall not henceforth be regarded as\r\nlegally obligatory on the Government or citizens of the United States,\"\r\nand by a former act, passed the 13th day of May, 1798, the Congress of\r\nthe United States having \"suspended the commercial intercourse between\r\nthe United States and France and the dependencies thereof,\" which\r\ncommercial intercourse was the direct and chief object of the consular\r\nestablishment; and\r\n\r\nWhereas actual hostilities have long been practiced on the commerce of\r\nthe United States by the cruisers of the French Republic under the\r\norders of its Government, which orders that Government refuses to revoke\r\nor relax; and hence it has become improper any longer to allow the\r\nconsul-general, consuls, and vice-consuls of the French Republic above\r\nnamed, or any of its consular persons or agents heretofore admitted in\r\nthese United States, any longer to exercise their consular functions:\r\n\r\nThese are therefore to declare that I do no longer recognize the said\r\ncitizen Letombe as consul-general or consul, nor the said citizens\r\nRosier and Arcambal as vice-consuls, nor the said citizen Mozard as\r\nconsul of the French Republic in any part of these United States, nor\r\npermit them or any other consular persons or agents of the French\r\nRepublic heretofore admitted in the United States to exercise their\r\nfunctions as such; and I do hereby wholly revoke the exequaturs\r\nheretofore given to them respectively, and do declare them absolutely\r\nnull and void from this day forward.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof, etc.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND ANNUAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 8, 1798_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nWhile with reverence and resignation we contemplate the dispensations\r\nof Divine Providence in the alarming and destructive pestilence with\r\nwhich several of our cities and towns have been visited, there is\r\ncause for gratitude and mutual congratulations that the malady has\r\ndisappeared and that we are again permitted to assemble in safety at\r\nthe seat of Government for the discharge of our important duties. But\r\nwhen we reflect that this fatal disorder has within a few years made\r\nrepeated ravages in some of our principal seaports, and with increased\r\nmalignancy, and when we consider the magnitude of the evils arising\r\nfrom the interruption of public and private business, whereby the\r\nnational interests are deeply affected, I think it my duty to invite\r\nthe Legislature of the Union to examine the expediency of establishing\r\nsuitable regulations in aid of the health laws of the respective States;\r\nfor these being formed on the idea that contagious sickness may be\r\ncommunicated through the channels of commerce, there seems to be a\r\nnecessity that Congress, who alone can regulate trade, should frame a\r\nsystem which, while it may tend to preserve the general health, may be\r\ncompatible with the interests of commerce and the safety of the revenue.\r\n\r\nWhile we think on this calamity and sympathize with the immediate\r\nsufferers, we have abundant reason to present to the Supreme Being our\r\nannual oblations of gratitude for a liberal participation in the\r\nordinary blessings of His providence. To the usual subjects of gratitude\r\nI can not omit to add one of the first importance to our well-being and\r\nsafety; I mean that spirit which has arisen in our country against the\r\nmenaces and aggression of a foreign nation. A manly sense of national\r\nhonor, dignity, and independence has appeared which, if encouraged and\r\ninvigorated by every branch of the Government, will enable us to view\r\nundismayed the enterprises of any foreign power and become the sure\r\nfoundation of national prosperity and glory.\r\n\r\nThe course of the transactions in relation to the United States and\r\nFrance which have come to my knowledge during your recess will be made\r\nthe subject of a future communication. That communication will confirm\r\nthe ultimate failure of the measures which have been taken by the\r\nGovernment of the United States toward an amicable adjustment of\r\ndifferences with that power. You will at the same time perceive that the\r\nFrench Government appears solicitous to impress the opinion that it is\r\naverse to a rupture with this country, and that it has in a qualified\r\nmanner declared itself willing to receive a minister from the United\r\nStates for the purpose of restoring a good understanding. It is\r\nunfortunate for professions of this kind that they should be expressed\r\nin terms which may countenance the inadmissible pretension of a right to\r\nprescribe the qualifications which a minister from the United States\r\nshould possess, and that while France is asserting the existence of a\r\ndisposition on her part to conciliate with sincerity the differences\r\nwhich have arisen, the sincerity of a like disposition on the part of\r\nthe United States, of which so many demonstrative proofs have been\r\ngiven, should even be indirectly questioned. It is also worthy of\r\nobservation that the decree of the Directory alleged to be intended to\r\nrestrain the depredations of French cruisers on our commerce has not\r\ngiven, and can not give, any relief. It enjoins them to conform to all\r\nthe laws of France relative to cruising and prizes, while these laws are\r\nthemselves the sources of the depredations of which we have so long, so\r\njustly, and so fruitlessly complained.\r\n\r\nThe law of France enacted in January last, which subjects to capture and\r\ncondemnation neutral vessels and their cargoes if any portion of the\r\nlatter are of British fabric or produce, although the entire property\r\nbelong to neutrals, instead of being rescinded has lately received a\r\nconfirmation by the failure of a proposition for its repeal. While this\r\nlaw, which, is an unequivocal act of war on the commerce of the nations\r\nit attacks, continues in force those nations can see in the French\r\nGovernment only a power regardless of their essential rights, of their\r\nindependence and sovereignty; and if they possess the means they can\r\nreconcile nothing with their interest and honor but a firm resistance.\r\n\r\nHitherto, therefore, nothing is discoverable in the conduct of France\r\nwhich ought to change or relax our measures of defense. On the contrary,\r\nto extend and invigorate them is our true policy. We have no reason to\r\nregret that these measures have been thus far adopted and pursued, and\r\nin proportion as we enlarge our view of the portentous and incalculable\r\nsituation of Europe we shall discover new and cogent motives for the\r\nfull development of our energies and resources.\r\n\r\nBut in demonstrating by our conduct that we do not fear war in the\r\nnecessary protection of our rights and honor we shall give no room to\r\ninfer that we abandon the desire of peace. An efficient preparation for\r\nwar can alone insure peace. It is peace that we have uniformly and\r\nperseveringly cultivated, and harmony between us and France may be\r\nrestored at her option. But to send another minister without more\r\ndeterminate assurances that he would be received would be an act\r\nof humiliation to which the United States ought not to submit. It\r\nmust therefore be left with France (if she is indeed desirous of\r\naccommodation) to take the requisite steps. The United States will\r\nsteadily observe the maxims by which they have hitherto been governed.\r\nThey will respect the sacred rights of embassy; and with a sincere\r\ndisposition on the part of France to desist from hostility, to make\r\nreparation for the injuries heretofore inflicted on our commerce, and to\r\ndo justice in future, there will be no obstacle to the restoration of a\r\nfriendly intercourse. In making to you this declaration I give a pledge\r\nto France and the world that the Executive authority of this country\r\nstill adheres to the humane and pacific policy which has invariably\r\ngoverned its proceedings, in conformity with the wishes of the other\r\nbranches of the Government and of the people of the United States.\r\nBut considering the late manifestations of her policy toward foreign\r\nnations, I deem it a duty deliberately and solemnly to declare my\r\nopinion that whether we negotiate with her or not, vigorous preparations\r\nfor war will be alike indispensable. These alone will give to us an\r\nequal treaty and insure its observance.\r\n\r\nAmong the measures of preparation which appear expedient, I take the\r\nliberty to recall your attention to the naval establishment. The\r\nbeneficial effects of the small naval armament provided under the acts\r\nof the last session are known and acknowledged. Perhaps no country ever\r\nexperienced more sudden and remarkable advantages from any measure of\r\npolicy than we have derived from the arming for our maritime protection\r\nand defense. We ought without loss of time to lay the foundation for an\r\nincrease of our Navy to a size sufficient to guard our coast and protect\r\nour trade. Such a naval force as it is doubtless in the power of the\r\nUnited States to create and maintain would also afford to them the best\r\nmeans of general defense by facilitating the safe transportation of\r\ntroops and stores to every part of our extensive coast. To accomplish\r\nthis important object, a prudent foresight requires that systematical\r\nmeasures be adopted for procuring at all times the requisite timber and\r\nother supplies. In what manner this shall be done I leave to your\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nI will now advert, gentlemen, to some matters of less moment, but proper\r\nto be communicated to the National Legislature.\r\n\r\nAfter the Spanish garrisons had evacuated the posts they occupied at the\r\nNatchez and Walnut Hills the commissioner of the United States commenced\r\nhis observations to ascertain the point near the Mississippi which\r\nterminated the northernmost part of the thirty-first degree of north\r\nlatitude. From thence he proceeded to run the boundary line between\r\nthe United States and Spain. He was afterwards joined by the Spanish\r\ncommissioner, when the work of the former was confirmed, and they\r\nproceeded together to the demarcation of the line. Recent information\r\nrenders it probable that the Southern Indians, either instigated to\r\noppose the demarcation or jealous of the consequences of suffering white\r\npeople to run a line over lands to which the Indian title had not\r\nbeen extinguished, have ere this time stopped the progress of the\r\ncommissioners; and considering the mischiefs which may result from\r\ncontinuing the demarcation in opposition to the will of the Indian\r\ntribes, the great expense attending it, and that the boundaries which\r\nthe commissioners have actually established probably extend at least as\r\nfar as the Indian title has been extinguished, it will perhaps become\r\nexpedient and necessary to suspend further proceedings by recalling our\r\ncommissioner.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners appointed in pursuance of the fifth article of the\r\ntreaty of amity, commerce, and navigation between the United States and\r\nHis Britannic Majesty to determine what river was truly intended under\r\nthe name of the river St. Croix mentioned in the treaty of peace, and\r\nforming a part of the boundary therein described, have finally decided\r\nthat question. On the 25th of October they made their declaration that\r\na river called Scoodiac, which falls into Passamaquoddy Bay at its\r\nnorthwestern quarter, was the true St. Croix intended in the treaty of\r\npeace, as far as its great fork, where one of its streams comes from the\r\nwestward and the other from the northward, and that the latter stream is\r\nthe continuation of the St. Croix to its source. This decision, it is\r\nunderstood, will preclude all contention among individual claimants, as\r\nit seems that the Scoodiac and its northern branch bound the grants of\r\nland which have been made by the respective adjoining Governments. A\r\nsubordinate question, however, it has been suggested, still remains to\r\nbe determined. Between the mouth of the St. Croix as now settled and\r\nwhat is usually called the Bay of Fundy lie a number of valuable\r\nislands. The commissioners have not continued the boundary line through\r\nany channel of these islands, and unless the bay of Passamaquoddy be a\r\npart of the Bay of Fundy this further adjustment of boundary will be\r\nnecessary. But it is apprehended that this will not be a matter of any\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nSuch progress has been made in the examination and decision of cases of\r\ncaptures and condemnations of American vessels which were the subject of\r\nthe seventh article of the treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation\r\nbetween the United States and Great Britain that it is supposed the\r\ncommissioners will be able to bring their business to a conclusion in\r\nAugust of the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners acting under the twenty-fifth article of the treaty\r\nbetween the United States and Spain have adjusted most of the claims of\r\nour citizens for losses sustained in consequence of their vessels and\r\ncargoes having been taken by the subjects of His Catholic Majesty during\r\nthe late war between France and Spain.\r\n\r\nVarious circumstances have concurred to delay the execution of the law\r\nfor augmenting the military establishment, among these the desire of\r\nobtaining the fullest information to direct the best selection of\r\nofficers. As this object will now be speedily accomplished, it is\r\nexpected that the raising and organizing of the troops will proceed\r\nwithout obstacle and with effect.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have directed an estimate of the appropriations which will be\r\nnecessary for the service of the ensuing year to be laid before you,\r\naccompanied with a view of the public receipts and expenditures to a\r\nrecent period. It will afford you satisfaction to infer the great extent\r\nand solidity of the public resources from the prosperous state of the\r\nfinances, notwithstanding the unexampled embarrassments which have\r\nattended commerce. When you reflect on the conspicuous examples of\r\npatriotism and liberality which have been exhibited by our mercantile\r\nfellow-citizens, and how great a proportion of the public resources\r\ndepends on their enterprise, you will naturally consider whether their\r\nconvenience can not be promoted and reconciled with the security of the\r\nrevenue by a revision of the system by which the collection is at\r\npresent regulated.\r\n\r\nDuring your recess measures have been steadily pursued for effecting\r\nthe valuations and returns directed by the act of the last session,\r\npreliminary to the assessment and collection of a direct tax. No other\r\ndelays or obstacles have been experienced except such as were expected\r\nto arise from the great extent of our country and the magnitude and\r\nnovelty of the operation, and enough has been accomplished to assure\r\na fulfillment of the views of the Legislature.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI can not close this address without once more adverting to our\r\npolitical situation and inculcating the essential importance of uniting\r\nin the maintenance of our dearest interests; and I trust that by the\r\ntemper and wisdom of your proceedings and by a harmony of measures we\r\nshall secure to our country that weight and respect to which it is so\r\njustly entitled.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF THE SENATE TO JOHN ADAMS, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: The Senate of the United States join you in thanks to Almighty God\r\nfor the removal of the late afflicting dispensations of His providence\r\nand for the patriotic spirit and general prosperity of our country.\r\nSympathy for the sufferings of our fellow-citizens from disease and the\r\nimportant interests of the Union demand of the National legislature a\r\nready cooperation with the State governments in the use of such means as\r\nseem best calculated to prevent the return of this fatal calamity.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have sincerely wished that an adjustment of our differences\r\nwith the Republic of France might be effected on safe and honorable\r\nterms, yet the information you have given us of the ultimate failure of\r\nthe negotiation has not surprised us. In the general conduct of that\r\nRepublic we have seen a design of universal influence incompatible with\r\nthe self-government and destructive of the independence of other States.\r\nIn its conduct toward these United States we have seen a plan of\r\nhostility pursued with unremitted constancy, equally disregarding the\r\nobligations of treaties and the rights of individuals. We have seen\r\ntwo embassies, formed for the purpose of mutual explanations and\r\nclothed with the most extensive and liberal powers, dismissed without\r\nrecognition and even without a hearing. The Government of France has not\r\nonly refused to repeal but has recently enjoined the observance of its\r\nformer edict respecting merchandise of British fabric or produce the\r\nproperty of neutrals, by which the interruption of our lawful commerce\r\nand the spoliation of the property of our citizens have again received a\r\npublic sanction. These facts indicate no change of system or disposition;\r\nthey speak a more intelligible language than professions of solicitude\r\nto avoid a rupture, however ardently made. But if, after the repeated\r\nproofs we have given of a sincere desire for peace, these professions\r\nshould be accompanied by insinuations implicating the integrity\r\nwith which it has been pursued; if, neglecting and passing by the\r\nconstitutional and authorized agents of the Government, they are\r\nmade through the medium of individuals without public character or\r\nauthority, and, above all, if they carry with them a claim to prescribe\r\nthe political qualifications of the minister of the United States to\r\nbe employed in the negotiation, they are not entitled to attention or\r\nconsideration, but ought to be regarded as designed to separate the\r\npeople from their Government and to bring about by intrigue that which\r\nopen force could not effect.\r\n\r\nWe are of opinion with you, sir, that there has nothing yet been\r\ndiscovered in the conduct of France which can justify a relaxation of\r\nthe means of defense adopted during the last session of Congress, the\r\nhappy result of which is so strongly and generally marked. If the force\r\nby sea and land which the existing laws authorize should be judged\r\ninadequate to the public defense, we will perform the indispensable duty\r\nof bringing forward such other acts as will effectually call forth the\r\nresources and force of our country.\r\n\r\nA steady adherence to this wise and manly policy, a proper direction\r\nof the noble spirit of patriotism which has arisen in our country, and\r\nwhich ought to be cherished and invigorated by every branch of the\r\nGovernment, will secure our liberty and independence against all open\r\nand secret attacks.\r\n\r\nWe enter on the business of the present session with an anxious\r\nsolicitude for the public good, and shall bestow that consideration\r\non the several objects pointed out in your communication which they\r\nrespectively merit.\r\n\r\nYour long and important services, your talents and firmness, so often\r\ndisplayed in the most trying times and most critical situations, afford\r\na sure pledge of a zealous cooperation in every measure necessary to\r\nsecure us justice and respect,\r\n\r\nJOHN LAURANCE,\r\n\r\n_President of the Senate pro tempore_.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 11, 1798.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 12, 1798.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: I thank you for this address, so conformable to the spirit of\r\nour Constitution and the established character of the Senate of the\r\nUnited States for wisdom, honor, and virtue.\r\n\r\nI have seen no real evidence of any change of system or disposition in\r\nthe French Republic toward the United States. Although the officious\r\ninterference of individuals without public character or authority is not\r\nentitled to any credit, yet it deserves to be considered whether that\r\ntemerity and impertinence of individuals affecting to interfere in\r\npublic affairs between France and the United States, whether by their\r\nsecret correspondence or otherwise, and intended to impose upon the\r\npeople and separate them from their Government, ought not to be inquired\r\ninto and corrected.\r\n\r\nI thank you, gentlemen, for your assurances that you will bestow that\r\nconsideration on the several objects pointed out in my communication\r\nwhich they respectively merit.\r\n\r\nIf I have participated in that understanding, sincerity, and constancy\r\nwhich have been displayed by my fellow-citizens and countrymen in the\r\nmost trying times and critical situations, and fulfilled my duties to\r\nthem, I am happy. The testimony of the Senate of the United States in my\r\nfavor is an high and honorable reward, which receives, as it merits, my\r\ngrateful acknowledgments. My zealous cooperation in measures necessary\r\nto secure us justice and consideration may be always depended on.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO JOHN ADAMS, PRESIDENT OF THE\r\nUNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS,\r\n\r\n_President of the United States_.\r\n\r\nSIR: The House of Representatives unite with you in deploring the\r\neffects of the desolating malady by which the seat of Government and\r\nother parts of our country have recently been visited. In calling our\r\nattention to the fatality of its repeated ravages and inviting us to\r\nconsider the expediency of exercising our constitutional powers in aid\r\nof the health laws of the respective States, your recommendation is\r\nsanctioned by the dictates of humanity and liberal policy. On this\r\ninteresting subject we feel the necessity of adopting every wise\r\nexpedient for preventing a calamity so distressing to individual\r\nsufferers and so prejudicial to our national commerce.\r\n\r\nThat our finances are in a prosperous state notwithstanding the\r\ncommercial derangements resulting from this calamity and from external\r\nembarrassments is a satisfactory manifestation of the great extent and\r\nsolidity of the public resources. Connected with this situation of our\r\nfiscal concerns, the assurance that the legal provisions for obtaining\r\nrevenue by direct taxation will fulfill the views of the Legislature is\r\npeculiarly acceptable.\r\n\r\nDesirous as we are that all causes of hostility may be removed by the\r\namicable adjustment of national differences, we learn with satisfaction\r\nthat in pursuance of our treaties with Spain and with Great Britain\r\nadvances have been made for definitively settling the controversies\r\nrelative to the southern and northeastern limits of the United States.\r\nWith similar sentiments have we received your information that the\r\nproceedings under commissions authorized by the same treaties afford to\r\na respectable portion of our citizens the prospect of a final decision\r\non their claims for maritime injuries committed by subjects of those\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nIt would be the theme of mutual felicitation were we assured of\r\nexperiencing similar moderation and justice from the French Republic,\r\nbetween which and the United States differences have unhappily arisen;\r\nbut this is denied us by the ultimate failure of the measures which have\r\nbeen taken by this Government toward an amicable adjustment of those\r\ndifferences and by the various inadmissible pretensions on the part of\r\nthat nation.\r\n\r\nThe continuing in force the decree of January last, to which you\r\nhave more particularly pointed our attention, ought of itself to be\r\nconsidered as demonstrative of the real intentions of the French\r\nGovernment. That decree proclaims a predatory warfare against the\r\nunquestionable rights of neutral commerce which with our means of\r\ndefense our interest and our honor command us to repel. It therefore\r\nnow becomes the United States to be as determined in resistance as\r\nthey have been patient in suffering and condescending in negotiation.\r\n\r\nWhile those who direct the affairs of France persist in the enforcement\r\nof decrees so hostile to our essential rights, their conduct forbids us\r\nto confide in any of their professions of amity.\r\n\r\nAs, therefore, the conduct of France hitherto exhibits nothing which\r\nought to change or relax our measures of defense, the policy of\r\nextending and invigorating those measures demands our sedulous\r\nattention. The sudden and remarkable advantages which this country has\r\nexperienced from a small naval armament sufficiently prove the utility\r\nof its establishment. As it respects the guarding of our coast, the\r\nprotection of our trade, and the facility of safely transporting the\r\nmeans of territorial defense to every part of our maritime frontier,\r\nan adequate naval force must be considered as an important object of\r\nnational policy. Nor do we hesitate to adopt the opinion that, whether\r\nnegotiations with France are resumed or not, vigorous preparations for\r\nwar will be alike indispensable.\r\n\r\nIn this conjuncture of affairs, while with you we recognize our abundant\r\ncause of gratitude to the Supreme Disposer of Events for the ordinary\r\nblessings of Providence, we regard as of high national importance the\r\nmanifestation in our country of a magnanimous spirit of resistance to\r\nforeign domination. This spirit merits to be cherished and invigorated\r\nby every branch of Government as the estimable pledge of national\r\nprosperity and glory.\r\n\r\nDisdaining a reliance on foreign protection, wanting no foreign guaranty\r\nof our liberties, resolving to maintain our national independence\r\nagainst every attempt to despoil us of this inestimable treasure, we\r\nconfide under Providence in the patriotism and energies of the people of\r\nthese United States for defeating the hostile enterprises of any foreign\r\npower.\r\n\r\nTo adopt with prudent foresight such systematical measures as may be\r\nexpedient for calling forth those energies wherever the national\r\nexigencies may require, whether on the ocean or on our own territory,\r\nand to reconcile with the proper security of revenue the convenience of\r\nmercantile enterprise, on which so great a proportion of the public\r\nresources depends, are objects of moment which shall be duly regarded in\r\nthe course of our deliberations.\r\n\r\nFully as we accord with you in the opinion that the United States ought\r\nnot to submit to the humiliation of sending another minister to France\r\nwithout previous assurances sufficiently determinate that he will be\r\nduly accredited, we have heard with cordial approbation the declaration\r\nof your purpose steadily to observe those maxims of humane and pacific\r\npolicy by which the United States have hitherto been governed. While it\r\nis left with France to take the requisite steps for accommodation, it is\r\nworthy the Chief Magistrate of a free people to make known to the world\r\nthat justice on the part of France will annihilate every obstacle to the\r\nrestoration of a friendly intercourse, and that the Executive authority\r\nof this country will respect the sacred rights of embassy. At the same\r\ntime, the wisdom and decision which have characterized your past\r\nAdministration assure us that no illusory professions will seduce you\r\ninto any abandonment of the rights which belong to the United States as\r\na free and independent nation.\r\n\r\nDecember 13, 1798.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 14, 1798.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States of America_.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: My sincere acknowledgments are due to the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the United States for this excellent address so\r\nconsonant to the character of representatives of a great and free\r\npeople. The judgment and feelings of a nation, I believe, were never\r\nmore truly expressed by their representatives than those of our\r\nconstituents by your decided declaration that with our means of defense\r\nour interest and honor command us to repel a predatory warfare against\r\nthe unquestionable rights of neutral commerce; that it becomes the\r\nUnited States to be as determined in resistance as they have been\r\npatient in suffering and condescending in negotiation; that while those\r\nwho direct the affairs of France persist in the enforcement of decrees\r\nso hostile to our essential rights their conduct forbids us to confide\r\nin any of their professions of amity; that an adequate naval force\r\nmust be considered as an important object of national policy, and\r\nthat, whether negotiations with France are resumed or not, vigorous\r\npreparations for war will be alike indispensable.\r\n\r\nThe generous disdain you so coolly and deliberately express of a\r\nreliance on foreign protection, wanting no foreign guaranty of our\r\nliberties, resolving to maintain our national independence against every\r\nattempt to despoil us of this inestimable treasure, will meet the full\r\napprobation of every sound understanding and exulting applauses from the\r\nheart of every faithful American.\r\n\r\nI thank you, gentlemen, for your candid approbation of my sentiments on\r\nthe subject of negotiation and for the declaration of your opinion that\r\nthe policy of extending and invigorating our measures of defense and the\r\nadoption with prudent foresight of such systematical measures as may be\r\nexpedient for calling forth the energies of our country wherever the\r\nnational exigencies may require, whether on the ocean or on our own\r\nterritory, will demand your sedulous attention.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I take the liberty to assure you it shall be my\r\nvigilant endeavor that no illusory professions shall seduce me into any\r\nabandonment of the rights which belong to the United States as a free\r\nand independent nation.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 8, 1799.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with your desire expressed in your resolution of the 2d\r\nof this month, I lay before you an extract of a letter from George C.\r\nMoreton, acting consul of the United States at The Havannah, dated the\r\n13th of November, 1798, to the Secretary of State, with a copy of a\r\nletter from him to L. Tresevant and William Timmons, esquires, with\r\ntheir answer.\r\n\r\nAlthough your request extends no further than such information as has\r\nbeen received, yet it may be a satisfaction to you to know that as soon\r\nas this intelligence was communicated to me circular orders were given\r\nby my direction to all the commanders of our vessels of war, a copy of\r\nwhich is also herewith transmitted. I also directed this intelligence\r\nand these orders to be communicated to His Britannic Majesty's envoy\r\nextraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the United States and\r\nto our minister plenipotentiary to the Court of Great Britain, with\r\ninstructions to him to make the proper representation to that Government\r\nupon this subject.\r\n\r\nIt is but justice to say that this is the first instance of misbehavior\r\nof any of the British officers toward our vessels of war that has come\r\nto my knowledge. According to all the representations that I have seen,\r\nthe flag of the United States and their officers and men have been\r\ntreated by the civil and military authority of the British nation in\r\nNova Scotia, the West India islands, and on the ocean with uniform\r\ncivility, politeness, and friendship. I have no doubt that this first\r\ninstance of misconduct will be readily corrected.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 15, 1799.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to you the treaty between the United States and the Cherokee\r\nIndians, signed near Tellico on the 2d day of October, 1798, for your\r\nconsideration. I have directed the Secretary of War to lay before you\r\nthe journal of the commissioners and a copy of their instructions.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 18, 1799.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe communication relative to our affairs with France alluded to in my\r\naddress to both Houses at the opening of the session is contained in\r\nthe sheets which accompany this. A report of the Secretary of State,\r\ncontaining some observations on them, will be sent to Congress on\r\nMonday.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 28, 1799.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAn edict of the Executive Directory of the French Republic of the 29th\r\nof October, 1798, inclosed in a letter from our minister plenipotentiary\r\nin London of the 16th of November, is of so much importance that it can\r\nnot be too soon communicated to you and the public.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 6, 1799.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIn consequence of intimations from the Court of Russia to our minister\r\nplenipotentiary at the Court of Great Britain of the desire of that\r\npower to have a treaty of amity and commerce with the United States,\r\nand that the negotiation might be conducted in London, I nominate Rufus\r\nKing, our minister plenipotentiary at the Court of Great Britain, to be\r\na minister plenipotentiary for the special purpose of negotiating with\r\nany minister of equal rank and powers a treaty of amity and commerce\r\nbetween the United States and the Emperor of all the Russias.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 15, 1799_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the request in your resolve of yesterday, I lay before\r\nyou such information as I have received touching a suspension of the\r\narrêt of the French Republic, communicated to your House by my message\r\nof the 28th of January last. But if the execution of that arrêt be\r\nsuspended, or even if it were repealed, it should be remembered that the\r\narrêt of the Executive Directory of the 2d of March, 1797, remains in\r\nforce, the third article of which subjects, explicitly and exclusively,\r\nAmerican seamen to be treated as pirates if found on board ships of the\r\nenemies of France.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 18, 1799.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to you a document which seems to be intended to be a\r\ncompliance with a condition mentioned at the conclusion of my message\r\nto Congress of the 21st of June last.\r\n\r\nAlways disposed and ready to embrace every plausible appearance of\r\nprobability of preserving or restoring tranquillity, I nominate William\r\nVans Murray, our minister resident at The Hague, to be minister\r\nplenipotentiary of the United States to the French Republic.\r\n\r\nIf the Senate shall advise and consent to his appointment, effectual\r\ncare shall be taken in his instructions that he shall not go to France\r\nwithout direct and unequivocal assurances from the French Government,\r\nsignified by their minister of foreign relations, that he shall be\r\nreceived in character, shall enjoy the privileges attached to his\r\ncharacter by the law of nations, and that a minister of equal rank,\r\ntitle, and powers shall be appointed to treat with him, to discuss and\r\nconclude all controversies between the two Republics by a new treaty.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Translation.]\r\n\r\nPARIS, _the 7th Vendémiaire of the 7th Year\r\n  of the French Republic, One and Indivisible_.\r\n\r\n_The Minister of Exterior Relations to Citizen Pichon, Secretary of\r\nLegation of the French Republic near the Batavian Republic_:\r\n\r\nI have received successively, Citizen, your letters of the 22d and 27th\r\nFructidor [8th and 13th September]. They afford me more and more reason\r\nto be pleased with the measure you have adopted, to detail to me your\r\nconversations with Mr. Murray. These conversations, at first merely\r\nfriendly, have acquired consistency by the sanction I have given to them\r\nby my letter of the 11th Fructidor. I do not regret that you have\r\ntrusted to Mr. Murray's honor a copy of my letter. It was intended for\r\nyou only, and contains nothing but what is conformable to the intentions\r\nof Government. I am thoroughly convinced that should explanations take\r\nplace with confidence between the two Cabinets, irritation would cease,\r\na crowd of misunderstandings would disappear, and the ties of friendship\r\nwould be the more strongly united as each party would discover the hand\r\nwhich sought to disunite them. But I will not conceal from you that your\r\nletters of the 2d and 3d Vendémiaire, just received, surprised me much.\r\nWhat Mr. Murray is still dubious of has been very explicitly declared,\r\neven before the President's message to Congress of the 3d Messidor [21st\r\nJune] last was known in France. I had written it to Mr. Gerry, namely,\r\non the 24th Messidor and 4th Thermidor; I did repeat it to him before he\r\nsat out. A whole paragraph of my letter to you of the 11th Fructidor, of\r\nwhich Mr. Murray has a copy, is devoted to develop still more the fixed\r\ndetermination of the French Government. According to these bases, you\r\nwere right to assert that whatever plenipotentiary the Government of\r\nthe United States might send to France to put an end to the existing\r\ndifferences between the two countries would be undoubtedly received\r\nwith the respect due to the representative of a free, independent, and\r\npowerful nation.\r\n\r\nI can not persuade myself, Citizen, that the American Government need\r\nany further declarations from us to induce them, in order to renew\r\nthe negotiations, to adopt such measures as would be suggested to\r\nthem by their desire to bring the differences to a peaceable end. If\r\nmisunderstandings on both sides have prevented former explanations from\r\nreaching that end, it is presumable that, those misunderstandings being\r\ndone away, nothing henceforth will bring obstacles to the reciprocal\r\ndispositions. The President's instructions to his envoys at Paris, which\r\nI have only known by the copy given you by Mr. Murray, and received by\r\nme the 21st Messidor [9th July], announce, if they contain the whole of\r\nthe American Government's intentions, dispositions which could only\r\nhave added to those which the Directory has always entertained; and,\r\nnotwithstanding the posterior acts of that Government, notwithstanding\r\nthe irritating and almost hostile measures they have adopted, the\r\nDirectory has manifested its perseverance in the sentiments which are\r\ndeposited both in my correspondence with Mr. Gerry and in my letter to\r\nyou of the 11th Fructidor, and which I have hereinbefore repeated in the\r\nmost explicit manner. Carry, therefore, Citizen, to Mr. Murray those\r\npositive expressions in order to convince him of our sincerity, and\r\nprevail upon him to transmit them to his Government.\r\n\r\nI presume, Citizen, that this letter will find you at The Hague; if not,\r\nI ask it may be sent back to you at Paris.\r\n\r\nSalute and fraternity,\r\n\r\nCH. MAU. TALLEYRAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 25, 1799.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nThe proposition of a fresh negotiation with France in consequence\r\nof advances made by the French Government has excited so general an\r\nattention and so much conversation as to have given occasion to many\r\nmanifestations of the public opinion, from which it appears to me that\r\na new modification of the embassy will give more general satisfaction\r\nto the legislature and to the nation, and perhaps better answer the\r\npurposes we have in view.\r\n\r\nIt is upon this supposition and with this expectation that I now\r\nnominate Oliver Ellsworth, esq., Chief Justice of the United States;\r\nPatrick Henry, esq., late governor of Virginia, and William Vans Murray,\r\nesq., our minister resident at The Hague, to be envoys extraordinary and\r\nministers plenipotentiary to the French Republic, with full powers to\r\ndiscuss and settle by a treaty all controversies between the United\r\nStates and France.\r\n\r\nIt is not intended that the two former of these gentlemen shall embark\r\nfor Europe until they shall have received from the Executive Directory\r\nassurances, signified by their secretary of foreign relations, that\r\nthey shall be received in character, that they shall enjoy all the\r\nprerogatives attached to that character by the law of nations, and\r\nthat a minister or ministers of equal powers shall be appointed and\r\ncommissioned to treat with them.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 2, 1799.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nJudging it of importance to the public that the Legislature should be\r\ninformed of the gradual progress of their maritime resources, I transmit\r\nto Congress a statement of the vessels, with their tonnage, warlike\r\nforce, and complement of men, to which commissions as private armed\r\nvessels have been issued since the 9th day of July last.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[From C. F. Adams's Works of John Adams, Vol. IX, p. 172.]\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nMARCH 6, 1799.\r\n\r\nAs no truth is more clearly taught in the Volume of Inspiration, nor any\r\nmore fully demonstrated by the experience of all ages, than that a deep\r\nsense and a due acknowledgment of the governing providence of a Supreme\r\nBeing and of the accountableness of men to Him as the searcher of hearts\r\nand righteous distributer of rewards and punishments are conducive\r\nequally to the happiness and rectitude of individuals and to the\r\nwell-being of communities; as it is also most reasonable in itself that\r\nmen who are made capable of social acts and relations, who owe their\r\nimprovements to the social state, and who derive their enjoyments from\r\nit, should, as a society, make their acknowledgments of dependence\r\nand obligation to Him who hath endowed them with these capacities and\r\nelevated them in the scale of existence by these distinctions; as it is\r\nlikewise a plain dictate of duty and a strong sentiment of nature that\r\nin circumstances of great urgency and seasons of imminent danger earnest\r\nand particular supplications should be made to Him who is able to defend\r\nor to destroy; as, moreover, the most precious interests of the people\r\nof the United States are still held in jeopardy by the hostile designs\r\nand insidious acts of a foreign nation, as well as by the dissemination\r\namong them of those principles, subversive of the foundations of\r\nall religious, moral, and social obligations, that have produced\r\nincalculable mischief and misery in other countries; and as, in fine,\r\nthe observance of special seasons for public religious solemnities is\r\nhappily calculated to avert the evils which we ought to deprecate and to\r\nexcite to the performance of the duties which we ought to discharge by\r\ncalling and fixing the attention of the people at large to the momentous\r\ntruths already recited, by affording opportunity to teach and inculcate\r\nthem by animating devotion and giving to it the character of a national\r\nact:\r\n\r\nFor these reasons I have thought proper to recommend, and I do hereby\r\nrecommend accordingly, that Thursday, the 25th day of April next, be\r\nobserved throughout the United States of America as a day of solemn\r\nhumiliation, fasting, and prayer; that the citizens on that day abstain\r\nas far as may be from their secular occupations, devote the time to the\r\nsacred duties of religion in public and in private; that they call to\r\nmind our numerous offenses against the Most High God, confess them\r\nbefore Him with the sincerest penitence, implore His pardoning mercy,\r\nthrough the Great Mediator and Redeemer, for our past transgressions,\r\nand that through the grace of His Holy Spirit we may be disposed and\r\nenabled to yield a more suitable obedience to His righteous requisitions\r\nin time to come; that He would interpose to arrest the progress of that\r\nimpiety and licentiousness in principle and practice so offensive to\r\nHimself and so ruinous to mankind; that He would make us deeply sensible\r\nthat \"righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach to any\r\npeople;\" that He would turn us from our transgressions and turn His\r\ndispleasure from us; that He would withhold us from unreasonable\r\ndiscontent, from disunion, faction, sedition, and insurrection; that He\r\nwould preserve our country from the desolating sword; that He would save\r\nour cities and towns from a repetition of those awful pestilential\r\nvisitations under which they have lately suffered so severely, and that\r\nthe health of our inhabitants generally may be precious in His sight;\r\nthat He would favor us with fruitful seasons and so bless the labors of\r\nthe husbandman as that there may be food in abundance for man and beast;\r\nthat He would prosper our commerce, manufactures, and fisheries, and\r\ngive success to the people in all their lawful industry and enterprise;\r\nthat He would smile on our colleges, academies, schools, and seminaries\r\nof learning, and make them nurseries of sound science, morals, and\r\nreligion; that He would bless all magistrates, from the highest to the\r\nlowest, give them the true spirit of their station, make them a terror\r\nto evil doers and a praise to them that do well; that He would preside\r\nover the councils of the nation at this critical period, enlighten\r\nthem to a just discernment of the public interest, and save them\r\nfrom mistake, division, and discord; that He would make succeed our\r\npreparations for defense and bless our armaments by land and by sea;\r\nthat He would put an end to the effusion of human blood and the\r\naccumulation of human misery among the contending nations of the earth\r\nby disposing them to justice, to equity, to benevolence, and to peace;\r\nand that he would extend the blessings of knowledge, of true liberty,\r\nand of pure and undefiled religion throughout the world.\r\n\r\nAnd I do also recommend that with these acts of humiliation, penitence,\r\nand prayer fervent thanksgiving to the Author of All Good be united for\r\nthe countless favors which He is still continuing to the people of the\r\nUnited States, and which render their condition as a nation eminently\r\nhappy when compared with the lot of others.\r\n\r\nGiven, etc,\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas combinations to defeat the execution of the laws for the\r\nvaluation of lands and dwelling houses within the United States have\r\nexisted in the counties of Northampton, Montgomery, and Bucks, in the\r\nState of Pennsylvania, and have proceeded in a manner subversive of the\r\njust authority of the Government, by misrepresentations, to render the\r\nlaws odious, by deterring the public officers of the United States to\r\nforbear the execution of their functions, and by openly threatening\r\ntheir lives; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the endeavors of the well-affected citizens, as well as of the\r\nexecutive officers, to conciliate a compliance with those laws have\r\nfailed of success, and certain persons in the county of Northampton\r\naforesaid have been hardy enough to perpetrate certain acts which I am\r\nadvised amount to treason, being overt acts of levying war against the\r\nUnited States, the said persons, exceeding one hundred in number and\r\narmed and arrayed in a warlike manner, having, on the 7th day of this\r\npresent month of March, proceeded to the house of Abraham Lovering, in\r\nthe town of Bethlehem, and there compelled William Nichols, marshal of\r\nthe United States in and for the district of Pennsylvania, to desist\r\nfrom the execution of certain legal process in his hands to be executed,\r\nand having compelled him to discharge and set at liberty certain persons\r\nwhom he had arrested by virtue of criminal process duly issued for\r\noffenses against the United States, and having impeded and prevented the\r\ncommissioner and the assessors, appointed in conformity with the laws\r\naforesaid, in the county of Northampton aforesaid, by threats and\r\npersonal injury, from executing the said laws, avowing as the motives of\r\nthese illegal and treasonable proceedings an intention to prevent by\r\nforce of arms the execution of the said laws and to withstand by open\r\nviolence the lawful authority of the Government of the United States;\r\nand\r\n\r\nWhereas by the Constitution and laws of the United States I am\r\nauthorized, whenever the laws of the United States shall be opposed or\r\nthe execution thereof obstructed in any State by combinations too\r\npowerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings\r\nor by the powers vested in the marshals, to call forth military force to\r\nsuppress such combinations and to cause the laws to be duly executed;\r\nand\r\n\r\nWhereas it is in my judgment necessary to call forth military force\r\nin order to suppress the combinations aforesaid and to cause the laws\r\naforesaid to be duly executed, and I have accordingly determined so to\r\ndo, under the solemn conviction that the essential interests of the\r\nUnited States demand it:\r\n\r\nWherefore I, John Adams, President of the United States, do hereby\r\ncommand all persons being insurgents as aforesaid, and all others whom\r\nit may concern, on or before Monday next, being the 18th day of this\r\npresent month, to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective\r\nabodes; and I do moreover warn all persons whomsoever against aiding,\r\nabetting, or comforting the perpetrators of the aforesaid treasonable\r\nacts; and I do require all officers and others, good and faithful\r\ncitizens, according to their respective duties and the laws of the land,\r\nto exert their utmost endeavors to prevent and suppress such dangerous\r\nand unlawful proceedings.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States of\r\nAmerica to be affixed to these presents, and signed the same with my\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Philadelphia, the 12th day of March, A.D. 1799, and\r\nof the Independence of the said United States of America the\r\ntwenty-third.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  TIMOTHY PICKERING,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From, a broadside in the archives of the Department of State.]\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas by an act of the Congress of the United States passed the 9th\r\nday of February last, entitled \"An act further to suspend the commercial\r\nintercourse between the United States and France and the dependencies\r\nthereof,\" it is provided that at any time after the passing of this act\r\nit shall be lawful for the President of the United States, if he shall\r\ndeem it expedient and consistent with the interests of the United\r\nStates, by his order to remit and discontinue for the time being the\r\nrestraints and prohibitions by the said act imposed, either with respect\r\nto the French Republic or to any island, port, or place belonging to the\r\nsaid Republic with which a commercial intercourse may safely be renewed,\r\nand also to revoke such order whenever, in his opinion, the interest of\r\nthe United States shall require;

Coming from all parts of the Union at this\r\ncritical and interesting period, the members must be fully possessed of\r\nthe sentiments and wishes of our constituents.\r\n\r\nThe flattering prospects of abundance from the labors of the people by\r\nland and by sea; the prosperity of our extended commerce, notwithstanding\r\ninterruptions occasioned by the belligerent state of a great part of the\r\nworld; the return of health, industry, and trade to those cities which\r\nhave lately been afflicted with disease, and the various and inestimable\r\nadvantages, civil and religious, which, secured under our happy frame of\r\ngovernment, are continued to us unimpaired, demand of the whole American\r\npeople sincere thanks to a benevolent Deity for the merciful dispensations\r\nof His providence.\r\n\r\nBut while these numerous blessings are recollected, it is a painful duty\r\nto advert to the ungrateful return which has been made for them by some\r\nof the people in certain counties of Pennsylvania, where, seduced by the\r\narts and misrepresentations of designing men, they have openly resisted\r\nthe law directing the valuation of houses and lands. Such defiance was\r\ngiven to the civil authority as rendered hopeless all further attempts\r\nby judicial process to enforce the execution of the law, and it became\r\nnecessary to direct a military force to be employed, consisting of some\r\ncompanies of regular troops, volunteers, and militia, by whose zeal and\r\nactivity, in cooperation with the judicial power, order and submission\r\nwere restored and many of the offenders arrested. Of these, some have\r\nbeen convicted of misdemeanors, and others, charged with various crimes,\r\nremain to be tried.\r\n\r\nTo give due effect to the civil administration of Government and\r\nto insure a just execution of the laws, a revision and amendment\r\nof the judiciary system is indispensably necessary. In this extensive\r\ncountry it can not but happen that numerous questions respecting the\r\ninterpretation of the laws and the rights and duties of officers and\r\ncitizens must arise. On the one hand, the laws should be executed; on\r\nthe other, individuals should be guarded from oppression. Neither of\r\nthese objects is sufficiently assured under the present organization\r\nof the judicial department. I therefore earnestly recommend the subject\r\nto your serious consideration.\r\n\r\nPersevering in the pacific and humane policy which had been invariably\r\nprofessed and sincerely pursued by the Executive authority of the United\r\nStates, when indications were made on the part of the French Republic of\r\na disposition to accommodate the existing differences between the two\r\ncountries, I felt it to be my duty to prepare for meeting their advances\r\nby a nomination of ministers upon certain conditions which the honor of\r\nour country dictated, and which its moderation had given it a right to\r\nprescribe. The assurances which were required of the French Government\r\nprevious to the departure of our envoys have been given through their\r\nminister of foreign relations, and I have directed them to proceed on\r\ntheir mission to Paris. They have full power to conclude a treaty,\r\nsubject to the constitutional advice and consent of the Senate. The\r\ncharacters of these gentlemen are sure pledges to their country that\r\nnothing incompatible with its honor or interest, nothing inconsistent\r\nwith our obligations of good faith or friendship to any other nation,\r\nwill be stipulated.\r\n\r\nIt appearing probable from the information I received that our\r\ncommercial intercourse with some ports in the island of St. Domingo\r\nmight safely be renewed, I took such steps as seemed to me expedient\r\nto ascertain that point. The result being satisfactory, I then, in\r\nconformity with the act of Congress on the subject, directed the\r\nrestraints and prohibitions of that intercourse to be discontinued on\r\nterms which were made known by proclamation. Since the renewal of this\r\nintercourse our citizens trading to those ports, with their property,\r\nhave been duly respected, and privateering from those ports has ceased.\r\n\r\nIn examining the claims of British subjects by the commissioners at\r\nPhiladelphia, acting under the sixth article of the treaty of amity,\r\ncommerce, and navigation with Great Britain, a difference of opinion on\r\npoints deemed essential in the interpretation of that article has arisen\r\nbetween the commissioners appointed by the United States and the other\r\nmembers of that board, from which the former have thought it their duty\r\nto withdraw. It is sincerely to be regretted that the execution of an\r\narticle produced by a mutual spirit of amity and justice should have\r\nbeen thus unavoidably interrupted. It is, however, confidently expected\r\nthat the same spirit of amity and the same sense of justice in which it\r\noriginated will lead to satisfactory explanations. In consequence of\r\nthe obstacles to the progress of the commission in Philadelphia, His\r\nBritannic Majesty has directed the commissioners appointed by him under\r\nthe seventh article of the treaty relating to the British captures of\r\nAmerican vessels to withdraw from the board sitting in London, but with\r\nthe express declaration of his determination to fulfill with punctuality\r\nand good faith the engagements which His Majesty has contracted by his\r\ntreaty with the United States, and that they will be instructed to\r\nresume their functions whenever the obstacles which impede the progress\r\nof the commission at Philadelphia shall be removed. It being in like\r\nmanner my sincere determination, so far as the same depends on me, that\r\nwith equal punctuality and good faith the engagements contracted by the\r\nUnited States in their treaties with His Britannic Majesty shall be\r\nfulfilled, I shall immediately instruct our minister at London to\r\nendeavor to obtain the explanations necessary to a just performance\r\nof those engagements on the part of the United States. With such\r\ndispositions on both sides, I can not entertain a doubt that all\r\ndifficulties will soon be removed and that the two boards will then\r\nproceed and bring the business committed to them respectively to a\r\nsatisfactory conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe act of Congress relative to the seat of the Government of the United\r\nStates requiring that on the first Monday of December next it should be\r\ntransferred from Philadelphia to the District chosen for its permanent\r\nseat, it is proper for me to inform you that the commissioners appointed\r\nto provide suitable buildings for the accommodation of Congress and of\r\nthe President and of the public offices of the Government have made a\r\nreport of the state of the buildings designed for those purposes in\r\nthe city of Washington, from which they conclude that the removal of\r\nthe seat of Government to that place at the time required will be\r\npracticable and the accommodation satisfactory. Their report will\r\nbe laid before you.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI shall direct the estimates of the appropriations necessary for the\r\nservice of the ensuing year, together with an account of the revenue and\r\nexpenditure, to be laid before you. During a period in which a great\r\nportion of the civilized world has been involved in a war unusually\r\ncalamitous and destructive, it was not to be expected that the United\r\nStates could be exempted from extraordinary, burthens. Although the\r\nperiod is not arrived when the measures adopted to secure our country\r\nagainst foreign attacks can be renounced, yet it is alike necessary\r\nfor the honor of the Government and the satisfaction of the community\r\nthat an exact economy should be maintained. I invite you, gentlemen,\r\nto investigate the different branches of the public expenditure. The\r\nexamination will lead to beneficial retrenchments or produce a conviction\r\nof the wisdom of the measures to which the expenditure relates.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAt a period like the present, when momentous changes are occurring and\r\nevery hour is preparing new and great events in the political world,\r\nwhen a spirit of war is prevalent in almost every nation with whose\r\naffairs the interests of the United States have any connection, unsafe\r\nand precarious would be our situation were we to neglect the means of\r\nmaintaining our just rights. The result of the mission to France is\r\nuncertain; but however it may terminate, a steady perseverance in a\r\nsystem of national defense commensurate with our resources and the\r\nsituation of our country is an obvious dictate of wisdom; for, remotely\r\nas we are placed from the belligerent nations, and desirous as we are,\r\nby doing justice to all, to avoid offense to any, nothing short of the\r\npower of repelling aggressions will secure to our country a rational\r\nprospect of escaping the calamities of war or national degradation. As\r\nto myself, it is my anxious desire so to execute the trust reposed in me\r\nas to render the people of the United States prosperous and happy. I\r\nrely with entire confidence on your cooperation in objects equally your\r\ncare, and that our mutual labors will serve to increase and confirm\r\nunion among our fellow-citizens and an unshaken attachment to our\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF THE SENATE TO JOHN ADAMS, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nAccept, sir, the respectful acknowledgments of the Senate of the United\r\nStates for your speech delivered to both Houses of Congress at the\r\nopening of the present session.\r\n\r\nWhile we devoutly join you in offering our thanks to Almighty God for\r\nthe return of health to our cities and for the general prosperity of the\r\ncountry, we can not refrain from lamenting that the arts and calumnies\r\nof factious, designing men have excited open rebellion a second time in\r\nPennsylvania, and thereby compelled the employment of a military force\r\nto aid the civil authority in the execution of the laws. We rejoice that\r\nyour vigilance, energy, and well-timed exertions have crushed so\r\ndaring an opposition and prevented the spreading of such treasonable\r\ncombinations. The promptitude and zeal displayed by the troops called to\r\nsuppress this insurrection deserve our highest commendation and praise,\r\nand afford a pleasing proof of the spirit and alacrity with which our\r\nfellow-citizens are ready to maintain the authority of our excellent\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nKnowing as we do that the United States are sincerely anxious for a fair\r\nand liberal execution of the treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation\r\nentered into with Great Britain, we learn with regret that the progress\r\nof adjustment has been interrupted by a difference of opinion among the\r\ncommissioners. We hope, however, that the justice, the moderation,\r\nand the obvious interests of both parties will lead to satisfactory\r\nexplanations, and that the business will then go forward to an amicable\r\nclose of all differences and demands between the two countries. We\r\nare fully persuaded that the Legislature of the United States will\r\ncheerfully enable you to realize your assurances of performing on our\r\npart all engagements under our treaties with punctuality and the most\r\nscrupulous good faith.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect upon the uncertainty of the result of the late mission\r\nto France and upon the uncommon nature, extent, and aspect of the war\r\nnow raging in Europe, which affects materially our relations with the\r\npowers at war, and which has changed the condition of their colonies in\r\nour neighborhood, we are of opinion with you that it would be neither\r\nwise nor safe to relax our measures of defense or to lessen any of our\r\npreparations to repel aggression.\r\n\r\nOur inquiries and attention shall be carefully directed to the\r\nvarious other important subjects which you have recommended to our\r\nconsideration, and from our experience of your past Administration we\r\nanticipate with the highest confidence your strenuous cooperation in all\r\nmeasures which have a tendency to promote and extend our national\r\ninterests and happiness.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL LIVERMORE,\r\n\r\n_President of the Senate pro tempore_.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 9, 1799.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 10, 1799_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI thank you for this address. I wish you all possible success and\r\nsatisfaction in your deliberations on the means which have a tendency to\r\npromote and extend our national interests and happiness, and I assure\r\nyou that in all your measures directed to those great objects you may at\r\nall times rely with the highest confidence on my cordial cooperation.\r\n\r\nThe praise of the Senate, so judiciously conferred on the promptitude\r\nand zeal of the troops called to suppress the insurrection, as it falls\r\nfrom so high authority, must make a deep impression, both as a terror to\r\nthe disobedient and an encouragement of such as do well.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO JOHN ADAMS, PRESIDENT OF THE\r\nUNITED STATES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: While the House of Representatives contemplate the flattering\r\nprospects of abundance from the labors of the people by land and by\r\nsea, the prosperity of our extended commerce notwithstanding the\r\ninterruptions occasioned by the belligerent state of a great part of the\r\nworld, the return of health, industry, and trade to those cities which\r\nhave lately been afflicted with disease, and the various and inestimable\r\nadvantages, civil and religious, which, secured under our happy frame of\r\nGovernment, are continued to us unimpaired, we can not fail to offer\r\nup to a benevolent Deity our sincere thanks for these the merciful\r\ndispensations of His protecting providence.\r\n\r\nThat any portion of the people of America should permit themselves,\r\namid such numerous blessings, to be seduced by the arts and\r\nmisrepresentations of designing men into an open resistance of a law\r\nof the United States can not be heard without deep and serious regret.\r\nUnder a Constitution where the public burthens can only be imposed by\r\nthe people themselves for their own benefit and to promote their own\r\nobjects, a hope might well have been indulged that the general interest\r\nwould have been too well understood and the general welfare too highly\r\nprized to have produced in any of our citizens a disposition to hazard\r\nso much felicity by the criminal effort of a part to oppose with lawless\r\nviolence the will of the whole. While we lament that depravity which\r\ncould produce a defiance of the civil authority and render indispensable\r\nthe aid of the military force of the nation, real consolation is to\r\nbe derived from the promptness and fidelity with which that aid was\r\nafforded. That zealous and active cooperation with the judicial power of\r\nthe volunteers and militia called into service, which has restored order\r\nand submission to the laws, is a pleasing evidence of the attachment of\r\nour fellow-citizens to their own free Government, and of the truly\r\npatriotic alacrity with which they will support it.\r\n\r\nTo give due effect to the civil administration of Government and to\r\ninsure a just execution of the laws are objects of such real magnitude\r\nas to secure a proper attention to your recommendation of a revision and\r\namendment of the judiciary system.\r\n\r\nHighly approving as we do the pacific and humane policy which has been\r\ninvariably professed and sincerely pursued by the Executive authority\r\nof the United States, a policy which our best interests enjoined, and\r\nof which honor has permitted the observance, we consider as the most\r\nunequivocal proof of your inflexible perseverance in the same well-chosen\r\nsystem your preparation to meet the first indications on the part of\r\nthe French Republic of a disposition to accommodate the existing\r\ndifferences between the two countries by a nomination of ministers,\r\non certain conditions which the honor of our country unquestionably\r\ndictated, and which its moderation had certainly given it a right to\r\nprescribe. When the assurances thus required of the French Government,\r\nprevious to the departure of our envoys, had been given through their\r\nminister of foreign relations, the direction that they should proceed\r\non their mission was on your part a completion of the measure, and\r\nmanifests the sincerity with which it was commenced. We offer up our\r\nfervent prayers to the Supreme Ruler of the Universe for the success of\r\ntheir embassy, and that it may be productive of peace and happiness to\r\nour common country. The uniform tenor of your conduct through a life\r\nuseful to your fellow-citizens and honorable to yourself gives a sure\r\npledge of the sincerity with which the avowed objects of the negotiation\r\nwill be pursued on your part, and we earnestly pray that similar\r\ndispositions may be displayed on the part of France. The differences\r\nwhich unfortunately subsist between the two nations can not fail in\r\nthat event to be happily terminated. To produce this end, to all so\r\ndesirable, firmness, moderation, and union at home constitute, we are\r\npersuaded, the surest means. The character of the gentlemen you have\r\ndeputed, and still more the character of the Government which deputes\r\nthem, are safe pledges to their country that nothing incompatible with\r\nits honor or interest, nothing inconsistent with our obligations of good\r\nfaith or friendship to any other nation, will be stipulated.\r\n\r\nWe learn with pleasure that our citizens, with their property, trading\r\nto those ports of St. Domingo with which commercial intercourse has been\r\nrenewed have been duly respected, and that privateering from those ports\r\nhas ceased.\r\n\r\nWith you we sincerely regret that the execution of the sixth article of\r\nthe treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation with Great Britain, an\r\narticle produced by a mutual spirit of amity and justice, should have\r\nbeen unavoidably interrupted. We doubt not that the same spirit of amity\r\nand the same sense of justice in which it originated will lead to\r\nsatisfactory explanations, and we hear with approbation that our\r\nminister at London will be immediately instructed to obtain them. While\r\nthe engagements which America has contracted by her treaty with Great\r\nBritain ought to be fulfilled with that scrupulous punctuality and good\r\nfaith to which our Government has ever so tenaciously adhered, yet no\r\nmotive exists to induce, and every principle forbids us to adopt, a\r\nconstruction which might extend them beyond the instrument by which they\r\nare created. We cherish the hope that the Government of Great Britain\r\nwill disclaim such extension, and by cordially uniting with that of the\r\nUnited States for the removal of all difficulties will soon enable the\r\nboards appointed under the sixth and seventh articles of our treaty\r\nwith that nation to proceed and bring the business committed to them\r\nrespectively to a satisfactory conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe buildings for the accommodation of Congress and of the President and\r\nfor the public offices of the Government at its permanent seat being\r\nin such a state as to admit of a removal to that District by the time\r\nprescribed by the act of Congress, no obstacle, it is presumed, will\r\nexist to a compliance with the law.\r\n\r\nWith you, sir, we deem the present period critical and momentous. The\r\nimportant changes which are occurring, the new and great events which\r\nare every hour preparing in the political world, the spirit of war which\r\nis prevalent in almost every nation with whose affairs the interests\r\nof the United States have any connection, demonstrate how unsafe and\r\nprecarious would be our situation should we neglect the means of\r\nmaintaining our just rights. Respecting, as we have ever done, the\r\nrights of others, America estimates too correctly the value of her\r\nown and has received evidence too complete that they are only to be\r\npreserved by her own vigilance ever to permit herself to be seduced by\r\na love of ease or by other considerations into that deadly disregard of\r\nthe means of self-defense which could only result from a carelessness\r\nas criminal as it would be fatal concerning the future destinies of our\r\ngrowing Republic. The result of the mission to France is indeed, sir,\r\nuncertain. It depends not on America alone. The most pacific temper will\r\nnot always insure peace. We should therefore exhibit a system of conduct\r\nas indiscreet as it would be new in the history of the world if we\r\nconsidered the negotiation happily terminated because we have attempted\r\nto commence it, and peace restored because we wish its restoration. But,\r\nsir, however this mission may terminate, a steady perseverance in a\r\nsystem of national defense commensurate with our resources and the\r\nsituation of our country is an obvious dictate of duty. Experience, the\r\nparent of wisdom and the great instructor of nations, has established\r\nthe truth of your position, that, remotely as we are placed from the\r\nbelligerent nations and desirous as we are, by doing justice to all,\r\nto avoid offense to any, yet nothing short of the power of repelling\r\naggressions will secure to our country a rational prospect of escaping\r\nthe calamities of war or national degradation.\r\n\r\nIn the progress of the session we shall take into our serious\r\nconsideration the various and important matters recommended to our\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nA life devoted to the service of your country, talents and integrity\r\nwhich have so justly acquired and so long retained the confidence\r\nand affection of your fellow-citizens, attest the sincerity of your\r\ndeclaration that it is your anxious desire so to execute the trust\r\nreposed in you as to render the people of the United States prosperous\r\nand happy.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 9, 1799.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 10, 1799_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThis very respectful address from the Representatives of the people of\r\nthe United States, at their first assembly after a fresh election, under\r\nthe strong impression of the public opinion and national sense, at this\r\ninteresting and singular crisis of our public affairs, has excited my\r\nsensibility and receives my sincere and grateful acknowledgments.\r\n\r\nAs long as we can maintain with harmony and affection the honor of our\r\ncountry consistently with its peace, externally and internally, while\r\nthat is attainable, or in war when that becomes necessary, assert its\r\nreal independence and sovereignty, and support the constitutional\r\nenergies and dignity of its Government, we may be perfectly sure, under\r\nthe smiles of Divine Providence, that we shall effectually promote and\r\nextend our national interest and happiness.\r\n\r\nThe applause of the Senate and House of Representatives, so justly\r\nbestowed upon the volunteers and militia for their zealous and active\r\ncooperation with the judicial power, which has restored order and\r\nsubmission to the laws, as it comes with peculiar weight and propriety\r\nfrom the Legislature, can not fail to have an extensive and permanent\r\neffect for the support of Government upon all those ingenuous minds who\r\nreceive delight from the approving and animating voice of their country.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 5, 1799_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress certain documents which have relation to the\r\ncommunications made on Tuesday, on the subjects of the insurrection in\r\nPennsylvania, the renewal of commerce with St. Domingo, and the mission\r\nto the French Republic.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 6, 1799_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you, for your consideration, a treaty of amity and commerce\r\nbetween the United States and the King of Prussia, signed by their\r\nministers on the 11th of July last.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 19, 1799_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe letter herewith transmitted will inform you that it has pleased\r\nDivine Providence to remove from this life our excellent fellow-citizen,\r\nGeorge Washington, by the purity of his character and a long series of\r\nservices to his country rendered illustrious through the world. It\r\nremains for an affectionate and grateful people, in whose hearts he\r\ncan never die, to pay suitable honors to his memory.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOUNT VERNON, _December 15, 1799_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: It is with inexpressible grief that I have to announce to you the\r\ndeath of the great and good General Washington. He died last evening\r\nbetween 10 and 11 o'clock, after a short illness of about twenty hours.\r\nHis disorder was an inflammatory sore throat, which proceeded from a\r\ncold of which he made but little complaint on Friday. On Saturday\r\nmorning about 3 o'clock he became ill. Dr. Craik attended him in the\r\nmorning, and Dr. Dick, of Alexandria, and Dr. Brown, of Port Tobacco,\r\nwere soon after called in. Every medical assistance was offered, but\r\nwithout the desired effect. His last scene corresponded with the whole\r\ntenor of his life; not a groan nor a complaint escaped him in extreme\r\ndistress. With perfect resignation and in full possession of his reason,\r\nhe closed his well-spent life.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the highest respect, sir, your most\r\nobedient and very humble servant,\r\n\r\nTOBIAS LEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Senate, having resolved to wait on the President of the United\r\nStates \"to condole with him on the distressing event of the death of\r\nGeneral George Washington,\" proceeded to the house of the President,\r\nwhen the President of the Senate, in their name, presented the address\r\nwhich had previously been agreed to, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nThe Senate of the United States respectfully take leave, sir, to express\r\nto you their deep regret for the loss their country sustains in the\r\ndeath of General George Washington.\r\n\r\nThis event, so distressing to all our fellow-citizens, must be\r\npeculiarly heavy to you, who have long been associated with him in deeds\r\nof patriotism. Permit us, sir, to mingle our tears with yours. On this\r\noccasion it is manly to weep. To lose such a man at such a crisis is\r\nno common calamity to the world. Our country mourns her father. The\r\nAlmighty Disposer of Human Events has taken from us our greatest\r\nbenefactor and ornament. It becomes us to submit with reverence to\r\nHim who maketh darkness His pavilion.\r\n\r\nWith patriotic pride we review the life of our Washington and compare\r\nhim with those of other countries who have been preeminent in fame.\r\nAncient and modern names are diminished before him. Greatness and guilt\r\nhave too often been allied, but his fame is whiter than it is brilliant.\r\nThe destroyers of nations stood abashed at the majesty of his virtue. It\r\nreproved the intemperance of their ambition and darkened the splendor of\r\nvictory. The scene is closed, and we are no longer anxious lest\r\nmisfortune should sully his glory. He has traveled on to the end of his\r\njourney and carried with him an increasing weight of honor. He has\r\ndeposited it safely, where misfortune can not tarnish it, where malice\r\ncan not blast it. Favored of Heaven, he departed without exhibiting the\r\nweakness of humanity. Magnanimous in death, the darkness of the grave\r\ncould not obscure his brightness.\r\n\r\nSuch was the man whom we deplore. Thanks to God, his glory is\r\nconsummated. Washington yet lives on earth in his spotless example; his\r\nspirit is in Heaven.\r\n\r\nLet his countrymen consecrate the memory of the heroic general, the\r\npatriotic statesman, and the virtuous sage. Let them teach their\r\nchildren never to forget that the fruit of his labors and his example\r\nare their inheritance.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL LIVERMORE,\r\n\r\n_President of the Senate pro tempore_.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 23, 1799.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo which the President replied as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 23, 1799_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI receive with the most respectful and affectionate sentiments in this\r\nimpressive address the obliging expressions of your regard for the loss\r\nour country has sustained in the death of her most esteemed, beloved,\r\nand admired citizen.\r\n\r\nIn the multitude of my thoughts and recollections on this melancholy\r\nevent you will permit me only to say that I have seen him in the days of\r\nadversity, in some of the scenes of his deepest distress and most trying\r\nperplexities; I have also attended him in his highest elevation and most\r\nprosperous felicity, with uniform admiration of his wisdom, moderation,\r\nand constancy.\r\n\r\nAmong all our original associates in that memorable league of the\r\ncontinent in 1774, which first expressed the sovereign will of a\r\nfree nation in America, he was the only one remaining in the General\r\nGovernment. Although with a constitution more enfeebled than his at\r\nan age when he thought it necessary to prepare for retirement, I\r\nfeel myself alone bereaved of my last brother; yet I derive a strong\r\nconsolation from the unanimous disposition which appears in all ages\r\nand classes to mingle their sorrows with mine on this common calamity\r\nto the world.\r\n\r\nThe life of our Washington can not suffer by comparison with those of\r\nother countries who have been most celebrated and exalted by fame. The\r\nattributes and decorations of royalty could have only served to eclipse\r\nthe majesty of those virtues which made him, from being a modest\r\ncitizen, a more resplendent luminary.\r\n\r\nMisfortune, had he lived, could hereafter have sullied his glory only\r\nwith those superficial minds who, believing that characters and actions\r\nare marked by success alone, rarely deserve to enjoy it. Malice could\r\nnever blast his honor, and envy made him a singular exception to her\r\nuniversal rule. For himself, he had lived enough to life and to glory.\r\nFor his fellow-citizens, if their prayers could have been answered, he\r\nwould have been immortal. For me, his departure is at a most unfortunate\r\nmoment. Trusting, however, in the wise and righteous dominion of\r\nProvidence over the passions of men and the results of their councils\r\nand actions, as well as over their lives, nothing remains for me but\r\nhumble resignation.\r\n\r\nHis example is now complete, and it will teach wisdom and virtue to\r\nmagistrates, citizens, and men, not only in the present age, but in\r\nfuture generations as long as our history shall be read. If a Trajan\r\nfound a Pliny, a Marcus Aurelius can never want biographers, eulogists,\r\nor historians.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives having resolved unanimously to wait on\r\nthe President of the United States '\"in condolence of this national\r\ncalamity,\" the Speaker, attended by the House, withdrew to the house of\r\nthe President, when the Speaker addressed the President as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR: The House of Representatives, penetrated with a sense of the\r\nirreparable loss sustained by the nation in the death of that great and\r\ngood man, the illustrious and beloved Washington, wait on you, sir, to\r\nexpress their condolence on this melancholy and distressing event.\r\n\r\nTo which the President replied as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 19, 1799_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI receive with great respect and affection the condolence of the House\r\nof Representatives on the melancholy and affecting event in the death\r\nof the most illustrious and beloved personage which this country ever\r\nproduced.

As the\r\nsentiments of that virtuous lady, not less beloved by this nation than\r\nshe is at present greatly afflicted, can never be so well expressed as\r\nin her own words, I transmit to Congress her original letter.\r\n\r\nIt would be an attempt of too much delicacy to make any comments upon\r\nit, but there can be no doubt that the nation at large, as well as\r\nall the branches of the Government, will be highly gratified by any\r\narrangement which may diminish the sacrifice she makes of her individual\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOUNT VERNON, _December 31, 1799_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: While I feel with keenest anguish the late dispensation of Divine\r\nProvidence, I can not be insensible to the mournful tributes of respect\r\nand veneration which are paid to the memory of my dear deceased husband;\r\nand as his best services and most anxious wishes were always devoted to\r\nthe welfare and happiness of his country, to know that they were truly\r\nappreciated and gratefully remembered affords no inconsiderable\r\nconsolation.\r\n\r\nTaught by the great example which I have so long had before me never\r\nto oppose my private wishes to the public will, I must consent to the\r\nrequest made by Congress, which you have had the goodness to transmit\r\nto me; and in doing this I need not, I can not, say what a sacrifice\r\nof individual feeling I make to a sense of public duty.\r\n\r\nWith grateful acknowledgments and unfeigned thanks for the personal\r\nrespect and evidences of condolence expressed by Congress and yourself,\r\nI remain, very respectfully, sir, your most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nMARTHA WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 13, 1800_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nA report made to me on the 5th of this month by the Secretary of War\r\ncontains various matters in which the honor and safety of the nation are\r\ndeeply interested.

MARSHALL,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH ANNUAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _November 22, 1800_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nImmediately after the adjournment of Congress at their last session in\r\nPhiladelphia I gave directions, in compliance with the laws, for the\r\nremoval of the public offices, records, and property. These directions\r\nhave been executed, and the public officers have since resided and\r\nconducted the ordinary business of the Government in this place.\r\n\r\nI congratulate the people of the United States on the assembling of\r\nCongress at the permanent seat of their Government, and I congratulate\r\nyou, gentlemen, on the prospect of a residence not to be changed.\r\nAlthough there is cause to apprehend that accommodations are not now\r\nso complete as might be wished, yet there is great reason to believe\r\nthat this inconvenience will cease with the present session.\r\n\r\nIt would be unbecoming the representatives of this nation to assemble\r\nfor the first time in this solemn temple without looking up to the\r\nSupreme Ruler of the Universe and imploring His blessing.\r\n\r\nMay this territory be the residence of virtue and happiness! In this\r\ncity may that piety and virtue, that wisdom and magnanimity, that\r\nconstancy and self-government, which adorned the great character whose\r\nname it bears be forever held in veneration! Here and throughout our\r\ncountry may simple manners, pure morals, and true religion flourish\r\nforever!\r\n\r\nIt is with you, gentlemen, to consider whether the local powers over the\r\nDistrict of Columbia vested by the Constitution in the Congress of the\r\nUnited States shall be immediately exercised. If in your opinion this\r\nimportant trust ought now to be executed, you can not fail while\r\nperforming it to take into view the future probable situation of the\r\nterritory for the happiness of which you are about to provide. You will\r\nconsider it as the capital of a great nation advancing with unexampled\r\nrapidity in arts, in commerce, in wealth, and in population, and\r\npossessing within itself those energies and resources which, if not\r\nthrown away or lamentably misdirected, will secure to it a long course\r\nof prosperity and self-government.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a law of the last session of Congress, the officers\r\nand soldiers of the temporary army have been discharged. It affords real\r\npleasure to recollect the honorable testimony they gave of the patriotic\r\nmotives which brought them into the service of their country, by the\r\nreadiness and regularity with which they returned to the station of\r\nprivate citizens.\r\n\r\nIt is in every point of view of such primary importance to carry the\r\nlaws into prompt and faithful execution, and to render that part of the\r\nadministration of justice which the Constitution and laws devolve on the\r\nFederal courts as convenient to the people as may consist with their\r\npresent circumstances, that I can not omit once more to recommend to\r\nyour serious consideration the judiciary system of the United States. No\r\nsubject is more interesting than this to the public happiness, and to\r\nnone can those improvements which may have been suggested by experience\r\nbe more beneficially applied.\r\n\r\nA treaty of amity and commerce with the King of Prussia has been\r\nconcluded and ratified. The ratifications have been exchanged, and\r\nI have directed the treaty to be promulgated by proclamation.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties which suspended the execution of the sixth article\r\nof our treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation with Great Britain\r\nhave not yet been removed. The negotiation on this subject is still\r\ndepending. As it must be for the interest and honor of both nations\r\nto adjust this difference with good faith, I indulge confidently the\r\nexpectation that the sincere endeavors of the Government of the United\r\nStates to bring it to an amicable termination will not be disappointed.\r\n\r\nThe envoys extraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary from the United\r\nStates to France were received by the First Consul with the respect due\r\nto their character, and three persons with equal powers were appointed\r\nto treat with them. Although at the date of the last official\r\nintelligence the negotiation had not terminated, yet it is to be hoped\r\nthat our efforts to effect an accommodation will at length meet with a\r\nsuccess proportioned to the sincerity with which they have been so often\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\nWhile our best endeavors for the preservation of harmony with all\r\nnations will continue to be used, the experience of the world and our\r\nown experience admonish us of the insecurity of trusting too confidently\r\nto their success. We can not, without committing a dangerous imprudence,\r\nabandon those measures of self-protection which are adapted to our\r\nsituation and to which, notwithstanding our pacific policy, the violence\r\nand injustice of others may again compel us to resort While our vast\r\nextent of seacoast, the commercial and agricultural habits of our\r\npeople, the great capital they will continue to trust on the ocean,\r\nsuggest the system of defense which will be most beneficial to\r\nourselves, our distance from Europe and our resources for maritime\r\nstrength will enable us to employ it with effect. Seasonable and\r\nsystematic arrangements, so far as our resources will justify, for a\r\nnavy adapted to defensive war, and which may in case of necessity be\r\nquickly brought into use, seem to be as much recommended by a wise and\r\ntrue economy as by a just regard for our future tranquillity, for the\r\nsafety of our shores, and for the protection of our property committed\r\nto the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe present Navy of the United States, called suddenly into existence by\r\na great national exigency, has raised us in our own esteem, and by the\r\nprotection afforded to our commerce has effected to the extent of our\r\nexpectations the objects for which it was created.\r\n\r\nIn connection with a navy ought to be contemplated the fortification of\r\nsome of our principal seaports and harbors. A variety of considerations,\r\nwhich will readily suggest themselves, urge an attention to this measure\r\nof precaution. To give security to our principal ports considerable sums\r\nhave already been expended, but the works remain incomplete. It is for\r\nCongress to determine whether additional appropriations shall be made in\r\norder to render competent to the intended purposes the fortifications\r\nwhich have been commenced.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of arms within the United States still invites the\r\nattention of the National Legislature. At a considerable expense to the\r\npublic this manufacture has been brought to such a state of maturity as,\r\nwith continued encouragement, will supersede the necessity of future\r\nimportations from foreign countries.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI shall direct the estimates of the appropriations necessary for the\r\nensuing year, together with an account of the public revenue and\r\nexpenditure to a late period, to be laid before you. I observe with much\r\nsatisfaction that the product of the revenue during the present year has\r\nbeen more considerable than during any former equal period. This result\r\naffords conclusive evidence of the great resources of this country and\r\nof the wisdom and efficiency of the measures which have been adopted by\r\nCongress for the protection of commerce and preservation of public\r\ncredit.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAs one of the grand community of nations, our attention is irresistibly\r\ndrawn to the important scenes which surround us. If they have exhibited\r\nan uncommon portion of calamity, it is the province of humanity to\r\ndeplore and of wisdom to avoid the causes which may have produced\r\nit. If, turning our eyes homeward, we find reason to rejoice at the\r\nprospect which presents itself; if we perceive the interior of our\r\ncountry prosperous, free, and happy; if all enjoy in safety, under the\r\nprotection of laws emanating only from the general will, the fruits of\r\ntheir own labor, we ought to fortify and cling to those institutions\r\nwhich have been the source of such real felicity and resist with\r\nunabating perseverance the progress of those dangerous innovations\r\nwhich may diminish their influence.\r\n\r\nTo your patriotism, gentlemen, has been confided the honorable duty of\r\nguarding the public interests; and while the past is to your country a\r\nsure pledge that it will be faithfully discharged, permit me to assure\r\nyou that your labors to promote the general happiness will receive from\r\nme the most zealous cooperation.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF THE SENATE TO JOHN ADAMS, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: Impressed with the important truth that the hearts of rulers and\r\npeople are in the hand of the Almighty, the Senate of the United States\r\nmost cordially join in your invocations for appropriate blessings upon\r\nthe Government and people of this Union.\r\n\r\nWe meet you, sir, and the other branch of the National Legislature in\r\nthe city which is honored by the name of our late hero and sage, the\r\nillustrious Washington, with sensations and emotions which exceed our\r\npower of description.\r\n\r\nWhile we congratulate ourselves on the convention of the Legislature at\r\nthe permanent seat of Government, and ardently hope that permanence and\r\nstability may be communicated as well to the Government itself as to its\r\nseat, our minds are irresistibly led to deplore the death of him who\r\nbore so honorable and efficient a part in the establishment of both.\r\nGreat indeed would have been our gratification if his sum of earthly\r\nhappiness had been completed by seeing the Government thus peaceably\r\nconvened at this place; but we derive consolation from a belief that the\r\nmoment in which we were destined to experience the loss we deplore was\r\nfixed by that Being whose counsels can not err, and from a hope that\r\nsince in this seat of Government, which bears his name, his earthly\r\nremains will be deposited, the members of Congress, and all who inhabit\r\nthe city, with these memorials before them, will retain his virtues in\r\nlively recollection, and make his patriotism, morals, and piety models\r\nfor imitation. And permit us to add, sir, that it is not among the least\r\nof our consolations that you, who have been his companion and friend\r\nfrom the dawning of our national existence, and trained in the same\r\nschool of exertion to effect our independence, are still preserved by a\r\ngracious Providence in health and activity to exercise the functions of\r\nChief Magistrate.\r\n\r\nThe question whether the local powers over the District of Columbia,\r\nvested by the Constitution in the Congress of the United States, shall\r\nbe immediately exercised is of great importance, and in deliberating\r\nupon it we shall naturally be led to weigh the attending circumstances\r\nand every probable consequence of the measures which may be proposed.\r\n\r\nThe several subjects for legislative consideration contained in your\r\nspeech to both Houses of Congress shall receive from the Senate all the\r\nattention which they can give, when contemplating those objects, both in\r\nrespect to their national importance and the additional weight that is\r\ngiven them by your recommendation.\r\n\r\nWe deprecate with you, sir, all spirit of innovation from whatever\r\nquarter it may arise, which may impair the sacred bond that connects the\r\ndifferent parts of this Empire, and we trust that, under the protection\r\nof Divine Providence the wisdom and virtue of the citizens of the United\r\nStates will deliver our national compact unimpaired to a grateful\r\nposterity.\r\n\r\nFrom past experience it is impossible for the Senate of the United\r\nStates to doubt of your zealous cooperation with the Legislature in\r\nevery effort to promote the general happiness and tranquillity of the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nAccept, sir, our warmest wishes for your health and happiness.\r\n\r\nJOHN E. HOWARD,\r\n\r\n_President of the Senate pro tempore_.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 25, 1800.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nCITY OF WASHINGTON, _November 26, 1800_.\r\n\r\n_Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nFor this excellent address, so respectful to the memory of my\r\nillustrious predecessor, which I receive from the Senate of the United\r\nStates at this time and in this place with peculiar satisfaction, I pray\r\nyou to accept of my unfeigned acknowledgments. With you I ardently hope\r\nthat permanence and stability will be communicated as well to the\r\nGovernment itself as to its beautiful and commodious seat. With you\r\nI deplore the death of that hero and sage who bore so honorable and\r\nefficient a part in the establishment of both. Great indeed would have\r\nbeen my gratification if his sum of earthly happiness had been completed\r\nby seeing the Government thus peaceably convened at this place, himself\r\nat its head; but while we submit to the decisions of Heaven, whose\r\ncouncils are inscrutable to us, we can not but hope that the members of\r\nCongress, the officers of Government, and all who inhabit the city or\r\nthe country will retain his virtues in lively recollection and make his\r\npatriotism, morals, and piety models for imitation.\r\n\r\nI thank you, gentlemen, for your assurance that the several subjects for\r\nlegislative consideration recommended in my communication to both Houses\r\nshall receive from the Senate a deliberate and candid attention.\r\n\r\nWith you, gentlemen, I sincerely deprecate all spirit of innovation\r\nwhich may weaken the sacred bond that connects the different parts\r\nof this nation and Government, and with you I trust that under the\r\nprotection of Divine Providence the wisdom and virtue of our citizens\r\nwill deliver our national compact unimpaired to a free, prosperous,\r\nhappy, and grateful posterity. To this end it is my fervent prayer that\r\nin this city the foundations of wisdom may be always opened and the\r\nstreams of eloquence forever flow. Here may the youth of this extensive\r\ncountry forever look up without disappointment, not only to the\r\nmonuments and memorials of the dead, but to the examples of the living,\r\nin the members of Congress and officers of Government, for finished\r\nmodels of all those virtues, graces, talents, and accomplishments which\r\nconstitute the dignity of human nature and lay the only foundation for\r\nthe prosperity or duration of empires.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO JOHN ADAMS, PRESIDENT OF THE\r\nUNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS,\r\n\r\n_President of the United States_.\r\n\r\nSIR: The House of Representatives have received with great respect the\r\ncommunication which you have been pleased to make to the two Houses of\r\nCongress at the commencement of the present session.\r\n\r\nThe final establishment of the seat of National Government, which has\r\nnow taken place, within the District of Columbia is an event of no small\r\nimportance in the political transactions of our country, and we\r\ncordially unite our wishes with yours that this Territory may be the\r\nresidence of happiness and virtue.\r\n\r\nNor can we on this occasion omit to express a hope that the spirit\r\nwhich animated the great founder of this city may descend to future\r\ngenerations, and that the wisdom, magnanimity, and steadiness which\r\nmarked the events of his public life may be imitated in all succeeding\r\nages.\r\n\r\nA consideration of those powers which have been vested in Congress over\r\nthe District of Columbia will not escape our attention, nor shall we\r\nforget that in exercising these powers a regard must be had to those\r\nevents which will necessarily attend the capital of America.\r\n\r\nThe cheerfulness and regularity with which the officers and soldiers of\r\nthe temporary army have returned to the condition of private citizens is\r\na testimony clear and conclusive of the purity of those motives which\r\ninduced them to engage in the public service, and will remain a proof on\r\nall future occasions that an army of soldiers drawn from the citizens of\r\nour country deserve our confidence and respect.\r\n\r\nNo subject can be more important than that of the judiciary, which you\r\nhave again recommended to our consideration, and it shall receive our\r\nearly and deliberate attention.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States having confided the management\r\nof our foreign negotiations to the control of the Executive power, we\r\ncheerfully submit to its decisions on this important subject; and in\r\nrespect to the negotiations now pending with France, we sincerely hope\r\nthat the final result may prove as fortunate to our country as the most\r\nardent mind can wish.\r\n\r\nSo long as a predatory war is carried on against our commerce we\r\nshould sacrifice the interests and disappoint the expectations of our\r\nconstituents should we for a moment relax that system of maritime\r\ndefense which has resulted in such beneficial effects. At this period it\r\nis confidently believed that few persons can be found within the United\r\nStates who do not admit that a navy, well organized, must constitute the\r\nnatural and efficient defense of this country against all foreign\r\nhostility.\r\n\r\nThe progress which has been made in the manufacture of arms leaves\r\nno doubt that the public patronage has already placed this country\r\nbeyond all necessary dependence on foreign markets for an article so\r\nindispensable for defense, and gives us assurances that, under the\r\nencouragement which Government will continue to extend to this important\r\nobject, we shall soon rival foreign countries not only in the number but\r\nin the quality of arms completed from our own manufactories.\r\n\r\nFew events could have been more pleasing to our constituents than that\r\ngreat and rapid increase of revenue which has arisen from permanent\r\ntaxes. Whilst this event explains the great and increasing resources of\r\nour country, it carries along with it a proof which can not be resisted\r\nthat those measures of maritime defense which were calculated to meet\r\nour enemy upon the ocean, and which have produced such extensive\r\nprotection to our commerce, were founded in wisdom and policy. The mind\r\nmust, in our opinion, be insensible to the plainest truths which can not\r\ndiscern the elevated ground on which this policy has placed our country.\r\nThat national spirit which alone could vindicate our common rights has\r\nbeen roused, and those latent energies which had not been fully known\r\nwere unfolded and brought into view, and our fellow-citizens were\r\nprepared to meet every event which national honor or national security\r\ncould render necessary. Nor have its effects been much less important in\r\nother respects.\r\n\r\nWhilst many of the nations of the earth have been impoverished and\r\ndepopulated by internal commotions and national contests, our internal\r\npeace has not been materially impaired; our commerce has extended, under\r\nthe protection of our infant Navy, to every part of the globe; wealth\r\nhas flowed without intermission into our seaports, and the labors of the\r\nhusbandman have been rewarded by a ready market for the productions of\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nBe assured, sir, that the various and important subjects recommended to\r\nour consideration shall receive our early and deliberate attention; and,\r\nconfident of your cooperation in every measure which may be calculated\r\nto promote the general interest, we shall endeavor on our part to\r\ntestify by our industry and dispatch the zeal and sincerity with which\r\nwe regard the public good\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 26, 1800.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _November 27, 1800_.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Speaker and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nCompelled by the habits of a long life, as well as by all the principles\r\nof society and government which I could ever understand and believe, to\r\nconsider the great body of the people as the source of all legitimate\r\nauthority no less than of all efficient power, it is impossible for\r\nme to receive this address from the immediate Representatives of the\r\nAmerican people at this time and in this place without emotions which\r\nit would be improper to express if any language could convey them.\r\n\r\nMay the spirit which animated the great founder of this city descend\r\nto future generations, and may the wisdom, magnanimity, and steadiness\r\nwhich marked the events of his public life be imitated in all succeeding\r\nages.\r\n\r\nI thank you, gentlemen, for your assurance that the judiciary system\r\nshall receive your deliberate attention.\r\n\r\nWith you, gentlemen, I sincerely hope that the final result of the\r\nnegotiations now pending with France may prove as fortunate to our\r\ncountry as they have been commenced with sincerity and prosecuted with\r\ndeliberation and caution. With you I cordially agree that so long as a\r\npredatory war is carried on against our commerce we should sacrifice the\r\ninterests and disappoint the expectations of our constituents should we\r\nfor a moment relax that system of maritime defense which has resulted in\r\nsuch beneficial effects. With you I confidently believe that few persons\r\ncan be found within the United States who do not admit that a navy, well\r\norganized, must constitute the natural and efficient defense of this\r\ncountry against all foreign hostility.\r\n\r\nThose who recollect the distress and danger to this country in former\r\nperiods from the want of arms must exult in the assurance from their\r\nRepresentatives that we shall soon rival foreign countries not only\r\nin the number but in the quality of arms completed from our own\r\nmanufactories.\r\n\r\nWith you, gentlemen, I fully agree that the great increase of revenue is\r\na proof that the measures of maritime defense were founded in wisdom.\r\nThis policy has raised us in the esteem of foreign nations. That\r\nnational spirit and those latent energies which had not been and are not\r\nyet fully known to any were not entirely forgotten by those who had\r\nlived long enough to see in former times their operation and some of\r\ntheir effects. Our fellow-citizens were undoubtedly prepared to meet\r\nevery event which national honor or national security could render\r\nnecessary. These, it is to be hoped, are secured at the cheapest and\r\neasiest rate; if not, they will be secured at more expense.\r\n\r\nI thank you, gentlemen, for your assurance that the various subjects\r\nrecommended to your consideration shall receive your deliberate\r\nattention. No further evidence is wanting to convince me of the zeal\r\nand sincerity with which the House of Representatives regard the public\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nI pray you, gentlemen, to accept of my best wishes for your health and\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 15, 1800_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for their consideration and decision, a\r\nconvention, both in English and French, between the United States of\r\nAmerica and the French Republic, signed at Paris on the 30th day of\r\nSeptember last by the respective plenipotentiaries of the two powers.\r\nI also transmit to the Senate three manuscript volumes containing the\r\njournal of our envoys.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 7, 1801_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to both Houses of Congress, for their information and\r\nconsideration, copies of laws enacted by the governor and judges of the\r\nMississippi Territory from the 30th of June until the 31st of December,\r\nA.D. 1799.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 17, 1801_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have received from Elias Boudinot, esq., Director of the Mint of\r\nthe United States, a report of the 2d of January, representing the\r\nstate of it, together with an abstract of the coins struck at the\r\nMint from the 1st of January to the 31st of December, 1800; an abstract\r\nof the expenditures of the Mint from the 1st of January to the 31st of\r\nDecember, inclusive; a statement of gain on copper coined at the Mint\r\nfrom the 1st of January to the 31st of December, 1800, and a certificate\r\nfrom Joseph Richardson, assayer of the Mint, ascertaining the value of\r\nSpanish milled doubloons in proportion to the gold coins of the United\r\nStates to be no more than 84 cents and 424/500 parts of a cent for 1\r\npennyweight, or 28 grains and 24256/84848 parts of a grain to one\r\ndollar. These papers I transmit to Congress for their consideration,\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 21, 1801_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with your request, signified in your resolution of the\r\n20th day of this month, I transmit you a report made to me by the\r\nSecretary of State on the same day, a letter of our late envoys to him\r\nof the 4th of October last, an extract of a letter from our minister\r\nplenipotentiary in London to him of the 22d of November last, and an\r\nextract of another letter from the minister to the Secretary of the 31st\r\nof October last.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning in the letter of our late envoys to France is so fully\r\nsupported by the writers on the law of nations, particularly by Vattel,\r\nas well as by his great masters, Grotius and Puffendorf, that nothing is\r\nleft to be desired to settle the point that if there be a collision\r\nbetween two treaties made with two different powers the more ancient has\r\nthe advantage, for no engagement contrary to it can be entered into in\r\nthe treaty afterwards made; and if this last be found in any case\r\nincompatible with the more ancient one its execution is considered as\r\nimpossible, because the person promising had not the power of acting\r\ncontrary to his antecedent engagement. Although our right is very clear\r\nto negotiate treaties according to our own ideas of right and justice,\r\nhonor and good faith, yet it must always be a satisfaction to know that\r\nthe judgment of other nations with whom we have connection coincides\r\nwith ours, and that we have no reason to apprehend that any disagreeable\r\nquestions and discussions are likely to arise. The letters from Mr. King\r\nwill therefore be read by the Senate with particular satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe inconveniences to public officers and the mischiefs to the public\r\narising from the publication of the dispatches of ministers abroad are\r\nso numerous and so obvious that I request of the Senate that these\r\npapers, especially the letters from Mr. King, be considered in close\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 30, 1801_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress for their consideration a letter from William\r\nThornton, Alexander White, and William Cranch, esquires, commissioners\r\nof the city of Washington, with a representation of the affairs of the\r\ncity made by them to the President of the United States, dated 28th of\r\nJanuary, 1801, accompanied with a series of documents marked from A to\r\nH, inclusively.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 16, 1801_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI wish to know the pleasure of Congress and request their direction\r\nconcerning the disposition of the property of the United States now in\r\nmy possession; whether I shall deliver it into the hands of the heads of\r\nDepartments, or of the commissioners of the city of Washington, or of a\r\ncommittee of Congress, or to any other persons Congress may appoint, to\r\nbe delivered into the hands of my successor, or whether I shall present\r\nit myself to the President of the United States on the 4th of March\r\nnext. Any of these modes will be agreeable to me.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 20, 1801_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a report received this morning from Elias\r\nBoudinot, esq., Director of the Mint, dated February 13, 1801, which\r\nwill require the attention and decision of Congress before the close of\r\nthe session.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _March 2, 1801_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI have considered the advice and consent of the Senate to the\r\nratification of the convention with France under certain conditions.\r\nAlthough it would have been more conformable to my own judgment and\r\ninclination to have agreed to that instrument unconditionally, yet as\r\nin this point I found I had the misfortune to differ in opinion from\r\nso high a constitutional authority as the Senate, I judged it more\r\nconsistent with the honor and interest of the United States to ratify it\r\nunder the conditions prescribed than not at all. I accordingly nominated\r\nMr. Bayard minister plenipotentiary to the French Republic, that he\r\nmight proceed without delay to Paris to negotiate the exchange of\r\nratifications; but as that gentleman has declined his appointment,\r\nfor reasons equally applicable to every other person suitable for the\r\nservice, I shall take no further measures relative to this business,\r\nand leave the convention, with all the documents, in the Office of\r\nState, that my successor may proceed with them according to his wisdom.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 30, 1801.\r\n\r\n_To the Senators of the United States, respectively_.\r\n\r\nSIR: It appearing to me proper and necessary for the public service that\r\nthe Senate of the United States should be convened on Wednesday, the 4th\r\nof March next, you are desired to attend in the Chamber of the Senate on\r\nthat day, at 10 o'clock in the forenoon, to receive and act upon any\r\ncommunications which the President of the United States may then lay\r\nbefore you touching their interests, and to do and consider all other\r\nthings which may be proper and necessary for the public service for the\r\nSenate to do and consider.\r\n\r\n JOHN ADAMS,\r\n_President of the United States_.",
