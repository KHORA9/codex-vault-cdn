T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{vi}\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nThe essay which follows had been printed, and was on the point of being\r\npublished, when the outbreak of war involved my venture in the general\r\ndevastation from which we are only now emerging.  More than four years\r\nof military service lie between me and the studies of which this book\r\nis the summary.  It was written under one dispensation; it is being\r\npublished under another.  My first impulse, therefore, was to ask\r\nwhether the change which has rendered so much of the old world obsolete\r\nhad not invalidated also the conclusions here arrived at.  But\r\nreflection has simply confirmed me in the desire to complete the\r\narrangements for publication.  Self-government is the keynote of the\r\nessay, and it is unlikely that self-government will cease to be the\r\ncentral principle of sane politics either in the British Empire or in\r\nthe world outside.  I watched a Canadian division coming out of the\r\nlast great battle in France, battered and reduced in numbers, but with\r\nall {viii} its splendid energy and confidence untouched.  The presence\r\nof the Canadians there, their incomparable spirit and resolution, the\r\nsacrifices they had just been making, with unflinching generosity, for\r\nthe Empire, seemed only the last consequences of the political struggle\r\nfor autonomy described in the pages which follow.  They would have been\r\nimpossible had the views of all the old imperialists from Wellington to\r\nDisraeli prevailed.\r\n\r\nThe material on which this volume is based falls into three groups.\r\nFirst in importance are the state papers and general correspondence of\r\nthe period, contained in the Canadian Archives at Ottawa.  In addition\r\nto the correspondence, ordinary and confidential, between the\r\nSecretaries of State for the Colonies, and the Governors-General, from\r\n1839 to 1867, I read two very notable collections, designated in the\r\nfoot-notes the Bagot Correspondence and the Elgin-Grey Correspondence.\r\nIn the former are contained not only Bagot's private correspondence\r\nwith Lord Stanley, but also letters from Bagot's British friends and\r\nCanadian political advisers.  These constitute the most important\r\nevidence which exists for Bagot's year of office.  In the same way, the\r\nprivate correspondence, carried on between Earl Grey and the Earl of\r\nElgin from {ix} 1847 to 1852, takes precedence of all other Canadian\r\nmaterial of that period; and is, indeed, the most enlightening series\r\nof documents in existence on mid-Victorian Colonial policy.\r\n\r\nThe second group is composed of pamphlets and early newspapers, more\r\nespecially the admirable collection of pre-confederation pamphlets in\r\nthe Archives at Ottawa, and the Bell and Morris collections at Queen's\r\nUniversity.  Kingston.  I cannot pretend to have mastered all the\r\nmaterial supplied by the newspapers of the period; but I have attempted\r\nto work through such representative journals as the _Toronto Globe_,\r\nthe _Montreal Witness_, and the Kingston papers published while\r\nKingston was capital of the united Provinces.  I consulted certain\r\nothers, French and English, on definite points of political interest,\r\nsuch as the reappearance of Papineau in politics in 1847.\r\n\r\nThe _Canadiana_ of Queen's University Library gave me my third group of\r\ndocuments: and the facts from books were confirmed or modified by\r\ninformation gathered, chiefly in Kingston, from persons whose memories\r\nof the period under discussion were still fresh and interesting.\r\n\r\nAs the work proceeded, certain impressions were {x} very definitely\r\ncreated in my mind.  It seemed clear, in the first place, that no\r\nstatesman, whose experience was limited by unbroken residence in\r\nEurope, quite understood the elements which, between 1839 and 1867,\r\nconstituted the Home Rule problem in Canada.  More especially on\r\nfundamental points concerning Canadian opinion, and the general temper\r\nof the populace, even the best men in England seemed singularly\r\nignorant.  A second impression was that, while the colony remained\r\nthroughout essentially loyal, and while the political leaders in Canada\r\ndisplayed really great qualities of statesmanship at critical moments,\r\nthe general development of Canadian political life was seriously\r\ndelayed by the crudities and rudeness of provincial politicians.\r\nBritish ignorance was not the only obstacle in the way.\r\n\r\nThe last impression was that the relations between Britain and Canada\r\ndepended then, as now, not on constitutional forms, or commercial\r\nbargains, or armed protection, but on racial solidarity, and community\r\nin social and moral ideals.  It was this solidarity, far more than\r\nconscious statesmanship, which held Canada and Britain together.  These\r\nimpressions I have tried to analyse and elucidate in the chapters which\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\n{xi}\r\n\r\nI have to thank the Dominion Archivist, Dr. A. G. Doughty, for many\r\nkindnesses, and more especially for permitting me to read the\r\nElgin-Grey Correspondence.  To my friends, Mr. K. K. M. Leys, of\r\nUniversity College, Oxford, Dr. Adam Shortt, Ottawa, and Professor W.\r\nD. Taylor, of Queen's University, Kingston, I am indebted for advice\r\nand information.  Mr. James MacLehose and Dr. George Neilson made the\r\nfinal stages of printing easy by their generous assistance.

For growth in the political world is not always\r\ngradual; accidents, discoveries, sudden developments, call into\r\nexistence new creations, which only the generous logic of events and\r\nthe process of time can reconcile with pre-existing facts and systems.\r\nIt is the object of this essay to examine one of these political\r\nantinomies--the contradiction between imperial ascendancy and colonial\r\nautonomy--as it was illustrated by events in early Victorian Canada.\r\n\r\nThe problem was no new one in 1839.  Indeed it was coeval with the\r\nexistence of the empire, and sprang from the very nature of colonial\r\ngovernment.  Beneath the actual facts of the great {2} American\r\nrevolution--reaching far beyond quarrels over stamp duties, or the\r\ndifferentiation between internal and external taxation, or even the\r\nrights of man--was the fundamental difficulty of empire, the need to\r\nreconcile colonial independence with imperial unity.  It was the\r\nperception of this difficulty which made Burke so much the greatest\r\npolitical thinker of his time.  As he wrote in the most illuminating of\r\nhis letters, \"I am, and ever have been, deeply sensible of the\r\ndifficulty of reconciling the strong presiding power, that is so useful\r\ntowards the conservation of a vast, disconnected, infinitely\r\ndiversified empire, with that liberty and safety of the provinces,\r\nwhich they must enjoy (in opinion and practice, at least), or they will\r\nnot be provinces at all.  I know, and have long felt, the difficulty of\r\nreconciling the unwieldy haughtiness of a great ruling nation,\r\nhabituated to command, pampered by enormous wealth, and confident from\r\na long course of prosperity and victory, to the high spirit of free\r\ndependencies, animated with the first glow and activity of juvenile\r\nheat, and assuming to themselves as their birthright, some part of that\r\nvery pride which oppresses them.\"[1]\r\n\r\n{3}\r\n\r\nDissatisfied as he ever was with merely passive or negative views,\r\nBurke was led to attempt a solution of the problem.  He had never been\r\nunder any illusion as to the possibility of limiting colonial\r\nconstitutional pretensions.  A free government was what the colonists\r\nthought free, and only they could fix the limit to their claims.  But\r\nmany considerations made him refuse to despair of the empire.  His\r\nintensely human view of politics led him to put more trust in the bonds\r\nof kindred and affection than in constitutional forms.  He hated the\r\npetty quibbles of political legists and pedants--their dilemmas, and\r\nmetaphysical distinctions, and catastrophes.  In his opinion the bulk\r\nof mankind was not excessively curious concerning any theories whilst\r\nthey were really happy.  But perhaps his political optimism depended\r\nmost on his belief that institutions, as living things, were\r\nindefinitely adaptable, and that the logic of life and progress\r\nnaturally overcame all opposing arguments.  In his ideal state there\r\nwas room for many mansions, and he did not speak of disaster when\r\nAmerican colonists proposed to build according to designs not ratified\r\nin Westminster.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt on the views of Burke because here, as in Indian affairs,\r\nhe was the first of British {4} statesmen to recognize what was implied\r\nin the empire, and because his views still stand.  But his\r\ncontemporaries failed utterly, either to see the danger as he saw it,\r\nor to meet it as he bade them meet it.  Save Chatham, they had no\r\nunderstanding of provincial opinion; in their political methods they\r\nwere corrupt individualists, and their general equipment in imperial\r\npolitics was contemptibly inadequate.\r\n\r\nAfter the loss of the American colonies, the government in England\r\ncontrived for a time to evade the problems and responsibilities of\r\ncolonial empire.  The colonies which remained to England were limited\r\nin extent and population; and such difficulties as existed were faced,\r\nnot so much by the government in London, as beyond the seas by\r\nstatesmen with local knowledge, like Dorchester.  At the same time, the\r\nconsequences of the French Revolution and the great wars drew to\r\nthemselves the attention of all active minds.  Under these\r\ncircumstances imperial policy lost much of its prestige, and imperial\r\nproblems either vanished or were evaded.  It was a period of \"crown\r\ncolony\" administration.[2]  The connexion, as it was called, was\r\nmaintained through oligarchic {5} institutions, strictly controlled\r\nfrom Westminster; local officials were selected from little groups of\r\nsemi-aristocrats, more English than the home government itself; and the\r\nonly policy which recommended itself to a nation, which still lacked\r\nboth information and imagination, was to try no rash constitutional\r\nexperiments, and to conciliate colonial opinion by economic favours and\r\nlow taxation.\r\n\r\nYet the old contradiction between British ascendancy and colonial\r\nautonomy could not for long be ignored; and as in the early nineteenth\r\ncentury a new colonial empire arose, greater and more diversified than\r\nthe old, the problem once more recurred, this time in Canada.  It is\r\nnot the purpose of this book to discuss the earlier stages of the\r\nCanadian struggle.  The rebellions under Mackenzie in the West and\r\nPapineau in the East were abnormal and pathological episodes, in\r\nconsidering which the attention is easily diverted from the essential\r\nquestions to exciting side issues and personal facts.  In any case,\r\nthat chapter in Canadian history has received adequate attention.[3]\r\nBut after Colborne's firmness had repressed the {6} armed risings, and\r\nDurham's imperious dictatorship had introduced some kind of order,\r\nthere followed in Canada a period of high constitutional importance, in\r\nwhich the old issue was frankly faced, both in England and in Canada,\r\nalmost in the very terms that Burke had used.  It is not too much to\r\nsay that the fifteen years of Canadian history which begin with the\r\npublication, in 1839, of _Durham's Report_, are the most important in\r\nthe history of the modern British empire; and that in them was made the\r\nexperiment on the success of which depended the future of that empire.\r\n\r\nThese years are the more instructive, because in them there are few\r\ndistracting events drawing the attention from the main constitutional\r\nquestion.  There were minor points--whether voluntaryism, or the\r\nprinciple of church establishment, was best for Canada; what place\r\nwithin the empire might safely be conceded to French-Canadian\r\nnationalism; how Canadian commerce was to relate itself to that of\r\nBritain and of the United States.  All of these, however, were included\r\nin, or dominated by, the essential difficulty of combining, in one\r\nempire, Canadian self-government and British supremacy.\r\n\r\n{7}\r\n\r\nThe phrase, responsible government, appears everywhere in the writings\r\nand speeches of those days with a wearisome iteration.  Yet the\r\ndiscussion which hinged on that phrase was of primary importance.  The\r\nBritish government must either discover the kind of self-government\r\nrequired in the greater dependencies, the _modus vivendi_ to be\r\nestablished between the local and the central governments, and the seat\r\nof actual responsibility, or cease to be imperial.  Under four\r\ngovernors-general[4] the argument proceeded, and it was not until 1854\r\nthat Elgin, in his departure from Canada, was able to assure the\r\nBritish government that the question had been for the time settled.\r\n\r\nThe essay which follows will describe the character of the political\r\ncommunity within which the question was raised; the fortunes and policy\r\nof the governors-general concerned in the discussion; the modifications\r\nintroduced into British political thought by the Canadian agitation;\r\nand the consequences, in England and Canada, of the firm establishment\r\nof colonial self-government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Burke, _Letter to the Sheriffs of Bristol_.\r\n\r\n[2] Sir C. P. Lucas, _Introduction to Lord Durham's Report_, p. 266.\r\n\r\n[3] Its latest statement may be found in Sir C. P. Lucas's admirable\r\nedition of _Lord Durham's Report_, Oxford, 1912.\r\n\r\n[4] I omit from my reckoning the brief and unimportant tenure of office\r\nby the Earl Cathcart, who filled a gap between Metcalfe's retirement\r\nand Elgin's arrival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{8}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE CANADIAN COMMUNITY.\r\n\r\nTo understand the political evolution of Canada it is essential to\r\nbegin with a study of the elements of Canadian society.  Canadian\r\nconstitutionalists would have written to better purpose, had they\r\nfollowed the example of the Earl of Durham, in whose _Report_ the\r\nconcluding practical suggestions develop naturally from the vivid\r\nsocial details which occupy its earlier pages, and raise it to the\r\nlevel of literature.  In pioneering communities there is no such thing\r\nas the constitution, or politics, _per se_; and the relation between\r\nthe facts, sordid and mean as they often are, of the life of the\r\npeople, and the growth of institutions and political theories, is\r\nfundamental.\r\n\r\nCanadian society, in 1839 and long afterwards, was dominated by the\r\nphysical characteristics of the seven hundred miles of country which\r\nstretched from Quebec to the shores of Lake Huron, with {9} its long\r\nwater-front and timid expansion, north and south; its forests\r\nstubbornly resisting the axes of the settlers; its severe extremities\r\nof heat and cold; the innumerable inconveniences inflicted by its\r\nuncultivated wastes on those who first invaded it; and the imperfect\r\nlines of land communication which multiplied all distances in Canada at\r\nleast four-fold.  It was perhaps this sense of distance, and difficulty\r\nof locomotion, which first impressed the settler and the visitor.  To\r\nbegin with, the colony was, for practical purposes, more than a month's\r\ndistance from the centre of government.  Steam was gradually making its\r\nway, and the record passage by sailing ship, from Quebec to Portsmouth,\r\nhad occupied only eighteen days and a half,[1] but sails were still the\r\nordinary means of propulsion, and the average length of voyage of 237\r\nvessels arriving at Quebec in 1840 was well over forty days.[2]  To the\r\nimmigrant, however, the voyage across the Atlantic was the least of his\r\ntroubles; for the internal communications of Canada left much to be\r\ndesired.  The assistance {10} of railway transportation might be\r\nentirely ignored,--as late as 1847 only twenty-two miles of railway\r\nlines had been laid and worked.[3]  There was, of course, during the\r\nopen season, the wonderful passage by river and lake into the heart of\r\nthe continent; although the long winter months broke into the\r\nregularity of the traffic by water, and the St. Lawrence rapids added\r\nto the traveller's difficulties and expenses.  Even the magic of a\r\ngovernor-general's wand could not dispel the inconveniences of this\r\nsimplest of Canadian routes.  \"I arrived here on Thursday week,\"\r\ngrumbled Poulett Thomson, writing from Toronto in 1839.  \"The journey\r\nwas bad enough; a portage to Lachine; then the steamboat to the\r\nCascades, twenty-four miles further; then road again (if road it can be\r\ncalled) for sixteen miles; then steam to Cornwall forty miles; then\r\nroad, twelve miles; then, by a change of steamers on to Lake Ontario to\r\nKingston, and thence here.  I slept one night on the road, and two on\r\nboard the steamers.  Such, as I have described it, is the boasted\r\nnavigation of the St. Lawrence!\"[4]  For military purposes there was\r\nthe alternative route, up the Ottawa to Bytown, {11} and thence by the\r\nRideau military canal to Kingston and the Lakes.  On land, progress was\r\nmuch more complicated, for even the main road along the river and lake\r\nfront was in shamefully bad condition, more especially when autumn\r\npassed into winter, or when spring once more loosened up the roads.\r\nThere is a quite unanimous chorus of condemnation from all--British,\r\nAmericans, and Canadians.  One lively traveller in 1840 protested that\r\non his way from Montreal, he was compelled to walk at the carriage side\r\nfor hours, ankle-deep in mud, with the reins in his hands, and that,\r\nwith infinite fatigue to both man and beast, he accomplished sixty\r\nmiles in two days--a wonderful performance.[5]  In the very heart of\r\nthe rebellion, W. L. Mackenzie seems to have found the roads fighting\r\nagainst him, for he speaks of the march along Yonge Street as over\r\n\"thirty or forty miles of the worst roads in the world\"; and attributes\r\npart of the disheartening of his men to what one may term\r\nmud-weariness.[6]  Local tradition still remembers with a sense of\r\nwonder that Sydenham, eager to return to his work in Lower Canada, once\r\ntravelled by sleigh {12} the 360 miles from Toronto to Montreal in\r\nthirty-six hours.\r\n\r\nOff the main routes, roads degenerated into corduroy roads, and these\r\ninto tracks, and even \"blazed trails \"; while, as for bridges, cases\r\nwere known where the want of them had kept settlers who were living\r\nwithin three miles of a principal town, from communicating with it for\r\ndays at a time.[7]  And, as the roads grew rougher, Canadian conditions\r\nseemed to the stranger to assert themselves more and more offensively,\r\nanimate and inanimate nature thrusting man back on the bare elements of\r\nthings.  The early descriptions of the colony are crowded with pictures\r\nof wretched immigrants, mosquito-bitten, or, in winter, half dead with\r\ncold, struggling through mud and swamp, to find the land whither they\r\nhad come to evade the miseries of civilization, confronting them with\r\nthe squalor and pains of nature.  Far into the Victorian era Canada,\r\nwhether French or British, was a dislocated community, with settlements\r\nset apart from each other as much by mud, swamp, and wood-land, as by\r\ndistance.  Her population, more particularly in the west, was engaged\r\nnot with political ideals, but in an incessant struggle {13} with the\r\nforests; and the little jobs, which enabled the infant community to\r\nbuild a bridge or repair a road at the public expense, must naturally\r\nhave seemed to the electors more important items of a political\r\nprogramme than responsible government or abolition of the clergy\r\nreserves.  No doubt, in the older towns and cities, the efforts of the\r\nearlier settlers had gained for their sons leisure and a chance of\r\nculture; yet even in Toronto, the wild lands were but a few miles\r\ndistant, and, as Richardson saw it, London was \"literally a city of\r\nstumps, many of the houses being still surrounded by them.\"\r\n\r\nStraggling along these 700 miles, although here and there concentrated\r\ninto centres like Quebec, Three Rivers, Montreal, Kingston, and\r\nToronto, was a population numbering well over a million, which from its\r\ninternal divisions, its differences in origin and disposition, and its\r\nrelation to the British government, constituted the central problem at\r\nthe time in British colonial politics.  The French population formed,\r\nnaturally, the chief difficulty.  Thanks to the terms of the surrender\r\nin 1763, and the policy of Dorchester, a unit which called itself _la\r\nnation Canadienne_ had been formed, _nationalité_ had become a force in\r\nLower {14} Canada, imperfectly appreciated even by the leaders of the\r\nprogressive movement in England and Western Canada.  In the Eastern\r\ntownships, and in Quebec and Montreal, flourishing and highly organized\r\nBritish societies existed.  The Rebellion had found sturdy opponents in\r\nthe British militia from the townships, and the constitutional\r\nsocieties of Quebec and Montreal expressed, in innumerable resolutions\r\nand addresses, the British point of view.  But Lower Canada was for\r\npractical purposes a French unit, Roman Catholic in religion, and, in\r\nstructure, semifeudal.  In the cities, the national self-consciousness\r\nof the French was most conspicuously present; and leaders like\r\nPapineau, La Fontaine, and Cartier proved the reality of French culture\r\nand political skill.  Below the higher classes, Durham and Metcalfe\r\nnoticed that in Lower Canada the facilities given by the church for\r\nhigher education produced a class of smaller professional men, from\r\nwhose number the ordinary politicians and agitators were drawn.  To the\r\nchurch they owed their entrance into the world of ideas; but apparently\r\nthey were little more loyal to the clergy than they were to Britain.\r\n\"I am led to believe,\" wrote Metcalfe in 1845, \"that the influence of\r\nthe clergy is not predominant, {15} among the French-Canadian people,\r\nand that the avocat, the notary, and the doctor, generally disposed to\r\nbe political demagogues, and most of them hostile to the British\r\ngovernment, are the parties who exercise the greatest influence.\r\nWhatever power the clergy might have acting along with these\r\ndemagogues, it would, I fear, be slight when exercised in opposition to\r\nthem.\"[8]\r\n\r\nThese active, critical, political groups were not, however,\r\nrepresentative of French Canada.  So long as their racial pride\r\nremained unhurt, the French community was profoundly conservative.  It\r\nwas noticed that the rebels of 1837 and 1838 had received no support\r\nfrom the Catholic priesthood; and in a country where the reverence for\r\nthat ancient form of Christianity was, in spite of Metcalfe's opinion\r\nto the contrary, profound, it was unlikely that any anti-religious\r\npolitical movement could make much permanent headway.  Devoted to their\r\nreligion, and controlled more especially in education by their\r\npriests,[9] the _habitants_ formed the peculiar people of the American\r\ncontinent.  Education flourished not at all among {16} the rank and\r\nfile.  Arthur Buller found the majority of those whom he met either not\r\nable to write, or able to write little more than their names.[10]  The\r\nwomen, he said, were the active, bustling portion of the _habitants_,\r\nthanks to the admirable and yet inexpensive training to be had in the\r\nnunneries.  As for the men, they farmed and lived as their fathers had\r\ndone before them.  They cleared their land, or tilled it where it had\r\nbeen cleared, and thought little of improvement or change.  M'Taggart,\r\nwhose work on the Rideau Canal, made him an expert in Canadian labour,\r\nmuch preferred French Canadians to the Irish as labourers, and thought\r\nthem \"kind, tender-hearted, very social, no way very ambitious, nor\r\nindustrious, rarely speculative.\"[11]  To the Canadian commonwealth,\r\nthe French population furnished a few really admirable statesmen; a\r\ndominant and loyal church; some groups of professional men,\r\ndisappointed and discontented sons of humble parents, too proud to sink\r\nto the level of their uninstructed youth, and without the opportunity\r\nof rising higher; and a great mass of men who hewed wood and drew\r\nwater, not for a master, but for themselves, {17} submissive to the\r\nchurch, and well-disposed, but ignorant, and at the mercy of any clever\r\ndemagogue who might raise the cry of nationalism.  Still, when\r\nnationality remained unchallenged, the French-Canadians were at least\r\nwhat, till recently, they remained, the most purely conservative\r\nelement in Canada.\r\n\r\nThe second element, in point of stability and importance, in the\r\nCanadian population was that of the United Empire Loyalists, the\r\nremnants of a former British supremacy in the United States.  They had\r\nproved their steadfastness and courage by their refusal to accept the\r\nrules of the new republic; and their arrival in Canada gave that\r\ncountry an aristocracy of Anglo-Saxon origin to counterbalance that of\r\nthe seigneurs on the Lower St. Lawrence.  The men had in many cases\r\nbeen trained to arms in the revolutionary war, and they served a second\r\nand perhaps a harder apprenticeship in the Canadian forests.  They had\r\nformed the centre of resistance to American attacks in the war of 1812.\r\nTheir sons and grandsons had once more exhibited the hereditary loyalty\r\nof the group, in resisting the rebels of 1837-38; and Metcalfe, who was\r\ntheir best friend among the governors of the United Provinces, justly\r\n{18} looked on them as the most conspicuous examples of devotion to\r\nconnection with the British Empire, and loyal subjection to the\r\nCrown.[12]  Robinsons, Cartwrights, Ryersons, and a score of other\r\nwell-known families, proved, generation after generation, by their\r\nsustained public capacity, how considerably the struggle for existence,\r\noperating on sound human material, may raise the average of talent and\r\nenergy.  The tendency of the Loyalists to conservatism was, under the\r\ncircumstances, only natural.  Their possession, for a time, of all the\r\nplaces in Upper Canada which were worth holding, was the consequence of\r\ntheir priority in tenure, and of their conspicuous pre-eminence in\r\npolitical ingenuity.  Critics of a later date forgot, and still forget,\r\nin their wholesale indictment of the Family Compact, that the Loyalist\r\ngroup called by that name had earned their places by genuine ability.\r\nIf, like other aristocracies, they found it hard to mark the precise\r\nmoment for retirement before the rise of democracy, their excuse must\r\nbe found in their consciousness of high public spirit and their\r\nhereditary talents for administration.\r\n\r\nPolitically and socially one may include among the Loyalists the\r\nhalf-pay officers, from both {19} navy and army, whom the great peace\r\nafter Waterloo sent to Canada, as to the other colonies; and certain\r\nmen of good family, Talbots or Stricklands, who held fast by English\r\nconservative tradition, played, where they could, the English gentleman\r\nabroad, and incidentally exhibited no mean amount of public spirit.\r\nConspicuous among these was Colonel Talbot, who had come to Upper\r\nCanada with Simcoe in 1793, and became there an erratic but energetic\r\ninstrument of empire.  \"For sixteen years,\" says Mrs. Jameson, writing\r\nwith a pardonably feminine thrill after a visit to the great man, \"he\r\nsaw scarce a human being, except a few boors and blacks employed in\r\nclearing and logging his land; he himself assumed the blanket coat and\r\naxe, slept upon the bare earth, cooked three meals a day for twenty\r\nwoodsmen, cleaned his own boots, washed his own linen, milked his cows,\r\nchurned the butter, and made and baked the bread.\"[13]  Yet, as\r\nStrickland confesses, in his _Twenty-Seven Years in Canada West_, there\r\nwere few Talbots.  \"Many high-spirited gentlemen,\" he says, \"were\r\ntempted by the grants of land bestowed on them by the government, which\r\nmade actual settlement one of the conditions of {20} the grant.  It\r\nfollowed, as a matter of course, that the majority of these persons\r\nwere physically disqualified for such an undertaking, a fact which many\r\ndeserted farms in the rear townships of the county in which I reside\r\npainfully indicate.\"[14]\r\n\r\nFrench Canadians and United Empire Loyalists constituted the stable\r\nfactors in Canadian public life; but the process of immigration, which\r\nthe years of rebellion checked only for a time, had by 1840 prepared\r\nanother element, and that the most incalculable and disturbing both\r\nsocially and politically.  Indeed the real problem of Canadian public\r\nlife lay simply in the influence of the humbler class of immigrants on\r\nexisting administration and opinion.  It was natural for the other\r\nsettlers and the governing class to regard the larger part of the new\r\npopulation as beneath the political level.  The very circumstances of\r\nthe emigrating process carried with them a suggestion of degradation.\r\nDurham had embodied in his _Report_ the more flagrant examples of the\r\nhorrors of emigration;[15] but a later review, written in 1841, proves\r\nthat many of the worst features of the old system still continued.\r\nThere were still the privations, the {21} filth and the diseases of\r\nthis northern \"middle passage,\" the epidemics and disorders inflicted\r\non the Canadian community as ship-load after ship-load of poor wretches\r\npassed ashore at Quebec.  On land their sorrows were renewed, for many\r\nof them were paupers, and there was still no organized effort to\r\nintroduce the labourer to those who required his labour.  More than one\r\nhalf of the 12,000 who, according to the report of 1841, passed in that\r\nyear through Bytown locks, were considered objects of charity.  Many of\r\nthem were common labourers with families, men who had little but their\r\nphysical strength as capital for the new venture; and cholera, typhus,\r\nor smallpox had in many cases reduced even that to the vanishing point.\r\nMore especially among the Irish settlers, who, in these years and\r\nlater, fled in dismay from the distresses of Ireland, the misery\r\ncontinued long after the first struggle.  M'Taggart, who had his\r\nprejudices, but who had unusually good opportunities for observation,\r\nthought that a tenth of the poorer Irish settlers died during their\r\nfirst two years in the country.  He found them clumsy at their work,\r\naccustomed to the spade and shovel, not to the axe, and maiming\r\nthemselves most fearfully, or even killing themselves, in their {22}\r\nexperiments in clearing the ground.[16]  Of all who came, the\r\nimmigration agents thought the Lowland Scots and the Ulster Irishmen\r\nthe best, and while the poorer class of settler lagged behind in the\r\ncities of Lower Canada, these others generally pushed on to find a hard\r\nearned living among the British settlers in the Upper Province.  Some\r\nof them found their way to the United States.  Others, faced with the\r\nintolerable delays of the land administration, took the risk of\r\n\"squatting,\" that is, settling on wild land without securing a right to\r\nit--often to find themselves dislodged by a legal owner at the moment\r\nwhen their possession _de facto_ seemed established.  The majority\r\nsettled as small farmers in the more frequented districts, or became\r\nshop-keepers and artisans in the towns.  Politically their position was\r\ncurious.  The Reform Act of 1832 had extended the British franchise,\r\nbut the majority had still no votes; and the immigrants belonged to the\r\nunenfranchised classes.  The Irish had the additional disability of\r\nbeing reckoned disloyal, followers of the great Irish demagogue, and\r\ndisorderly persons until proved otherwise.[17] To government servants\r\nand {23} the older settlers alike, it seemed perilous to the community\r\nto share political power with them.  Yet they were British citizens;\r\nmany of them at once became active members of the community through\r\ntheir standing as freeholders; the democratic influence of the United\r\nStates told everywhere on their behalf; and even where hard work left\r\nlittle time for political discussion, the fact that local needs might\r\nbe assisted by political discussion, and the stout individualism bred\r\nby the life of struggle in village, town, and country, forced the new\r\nsettlers to interest themselves in politics.  Many of the new arrivals\r\nhad some pretensions to education--more especially those from Scotland.\r\nIndeed it is worthy of note that from the Scottish stream of\r\nimmigration there came not only the earlier agitators, Gourlay and\r\nMackenzie, but, at a later date, George Brown, the first great\r\npolitical journalist in Canada, Alexander Mackenzie and Oliver Mowat,\r\nfuture leaders of Canadian liberalism, and John A. Macdonald, whose\r\nimperialism never lacked a tincture of traditional Scottish caution.\r\nThe new immigrants were unlikely to challenge the social supremacy of\r\nthe old aristocracy, but they formed so large an accession to the\r\npopulation that they could not {24} long remain without political\r\npower.  They must either be granted the rights of numerical majority or\r\nbe exasperated into destructive agitation.\r\n\r\nIt is not altogether easy to describe the community or chain of\r\ncommunities created out of these diverse elements.  Distance, climatic\r\ndifficulties, and racial misunderstandings weakened the sense of unity\r\nin the colony; and the chief centres of population were still too young\r\nand unformed to present to the visitor the characteristics of a\r\nfinished civilization.\r\n\r\nEverywhere, but more especially in the west, the town population showed\r\nremarkable increases.  Montreal, which had, in 1790, an estimated\r\npopulation of 18,000, had almost trebled that number by 1844; in the\r\nsame interval, Quebec increased from 14,000 to nearly 36,000.  In the\r\nUpper Province, immigration and natural increase produced an even more\r\nremarkable expansion.  In the twenty-two years between 1824 and 1846,\r\nToronto grew from a village of 1,600 inhabitants to be a flourishing\r\nprovincial capital of 21,000.  In the census of 1848, the population of\r\nHamilton was returned as 9,889; that of Kingston as 8,416; Bytown, the\r\nfuture capital, had 6,275 inhabitants; while a score of villages such\r\nas London, Belleville, {25} Brockville, and Cobourg had populations\r\nvarying from one to four thousand.[18]\r\n\r\nSocial graces and conveniences had, however, hardly kept pace with the\r\nincrease in numbers.  The French region was, for better or worse,\r\nhomogeneous, and Quebec formed a social centre of some distinction,\r\nwherein the critical M'Taggart noted less vanity and conceit than was\r\nto be met with in the country.[19]  But further west, British observers\r\nwere usually something less than laudatory.  The municipal franchise in\r\nthe cities of Lower Canada, being confined to the possessors of real\r\nestate, shut out from civic management the more enterprising trading\r\nclasses, with the natural result that mismanagement and inefficiency\r\neverywhere prevailed.  In Quebec there was no public lighting, the\r\ncommunity bought unwholesome water from carters who took it from the\r\nSt. Lawrence, and the gaol--a grim but useful test of the civilization\r\nof the place--not merely afforded direct communication between the\r\nprisoners and the street, but was so ill ordered that, according to a\r\nclerical authority, \"they who happily are {26} pronounced innocent by\r\nlaw may consider it a providential deliverance if they escape in the\r\nmeantime the effects of evil communication and example.\"[20]  While\r\nMontreal had a better water supply, it remained practically in darkness\r\nduring the winter nights, through the lapsing in 1836 of its earlier\r\nmunicipal organization.[21]  Strangers were said to find the provincial\r\nself-importance of its inhabitants irritating.  At the other extreme of\r\nthe province, Mrs. Jameson found fault with the citizens of Toronto for\r\ntheir social conventionalism.  \"I did not expect to find here,\" she\r\nwrote, \"in the new capital of a new country, with the boundless forests\r\nwithin half a mile of us on almost every side, concentrated as it were,\r\nthe worst evils of our old and most artificial social system at home,\r\nwith none of its _agrémens_, and none of its advantages.  Toronto is\r\nlike a fourth or fifth rate provincial town with the pretensions of a\r\ncapital city.\"[22]\r\n\r\nEverywhere, if contemporary prints of the cities may be taken as\r\nevidence, the military element was very prominent, and the tone was\r\ndistinctly English.  The leaders of society looked {27} to London for\r\ntheir fashions, and men like John Beverley Robinson moved naturally, if\r\na little stiffly, in the best English circles when they crossed to\r\nEngland.  It was, indeed, a straining after a social standard not quite\r\nwithin the reach of the ambitious provincial, which produced the\r\nconventionalism and dullness, noticed by British visitors in Canadian\r\ntowns.\r\n\r\nIn the smaller towns or villages where pretensions were fewer, and\r\nsociety accepted itself for that which it really was, there was much\r\nrude plenty and happiness.  An Ayrshire settler writing in 1845, after\r\nan orthodox confession that Canada, like Scotland, \"groaned under the\r\ncurse of the Almighty,\" described his town, Cobourg, as a place where\r\nwages were higher and prices lower than at home.  \"A carpenter,\" he\r\nwrites, \"asks 6s. sterling for a day's work (without board), mason 8s.,\r\nmen working by the day at labourer's work 2s. and board, 4s. a day in\r\nharvest.  Hired men by the month, 10 and 11 dollars in summer, and 7\r\nand 8 in winter, and board.  Women, 3 and 4 dollars per month, not much\r\nhigher than at home.  Provisions are cheaper here than at home.  Wheat,\r\n4s. per bushel; oats 1s. 3d. and 1s. 6d per bushel; potatoes, 1s. 6d.;\r\nbeef and pork, 3d. and 4d. per {28} lb.; butter, 6d. per lb.; cheese,\r\n6d.; tobacco, 1s. per lb.; whisky, 1s. 6d. per gallon; apples, 1s. 6d.\r\nper bushel; tea from 2s. 6d. to 4s., and sugar, 6d. per lb....  A man\r\nby honest industry here may live comfortably and support himself\r\ndecently--I can, I know--and save something too.  We live much better\r\nhere than at home.\"[23]\r\n\r\nMore especially in the smaller towns, the externals must have presented\r\na steady and dull monotony--the jail and court-house, three or four\r\nchurches, a varying number of mean-looking stores including a liberal\r\nproportion of taverns, and the irregular rows of private houses.\r\n\r\nIf lack of efficient public spirit, and social monotony, marked the\r\ntowns, the settlers in the bush were hardly likely to show a vigorous\r\ncommunal spirit.  They had their common life, building, clearing,\r\nharvesting in local \"bees,\" primitive assemblies in which work,\r\ndrinking, and recreation welded the primitive community together, and\r\nthe \"grog-boss\" became for a time the centre of society.[24]  But the\r\naverage day of the farmer was solitary, and, except where politics\r\nmeant {29} bridges, roads, and material gifts, his outlook was limited\r\nby the physical strain of his daily life, and work and sleep followed\r\ntoo closely on each other's track to leave time for other things.\r\nM'Taggart has a quaint picture of a squatter, which must have been\r\ntypical of much within the colony in 1839.  He found the settler, Peter\r\nArmstrong, \"in a snug little cabin, with a wife, two children, some\r\ngood sleek grey cats, and a very respectable-looking dog.  He had but\r\nfew wants, his health was aye good; there was spring water plenty just\r\naside him, and enough to make a good fire in winter, while with what he\r\ncaught, shot, gathered and grew in the yard, he lived well enough.\"\r\nHis relation to the state, secular and ecclesiastical, is best gauged\r\nby his admission that when it came to marriage, he and his\r\nwife--Scottish like himself--\"just took ane anither's word on't.\"[25]\r\nCrime, on the whole, considering the elements out of which the\r\ncommunity had been formed, was surprisingly little in evidence.[26]  In\r\ncertain regions it had a natural fertility.  Wherever the white trader\r\nmet the Indian, or rival {30} fur-traders strove in competition, the\r\ncontact between the vices of the two communities bred disorder, and\r\nCanadian trading success was too often marked by the indiscriminate\r\nruin of the Indians through drink and disease.[27]  At Bytown, where\r\nthe lumberers gathered to vary their labours in the bush with\r\ndissipation, the community \"was under the control of a very dangerous\r\nclass of roughs, who drank, gambled, and fought continually, and were\r\nthe terror of all well-disposed citizens.\"[28]  Drunkenness seems to\r\nhave been a very prevalent vice, probably because whisky was so cheaply\r\nproduced; and where self-restraint was weak, and vast numbers of the\r\npoorest classes from Britain formed the basis of society, drunkenness\r\nwas accompanied by bestial violence, or even death, in sudden and\r\ndreadful forms.[29]  But it was the verdict of a Scottish clergyman,\r\nwho played his part in pioneer work round Perth, that \"considering the\r\nmixture of worthless persons, which our population formerly contained,\r\nit was astonishing how few crimes had been committed.\"\r\n\r\n{31}\r\n\r\nThree powerful influences helped to shape the young Canadian community\r\nand to give it some appearance of unity--education, religion, and\r\npolitics.  It now becomes necessary to examine these factors in\r\nCanadian existence in the years prior to, and immediately after, the\r\nvisit of Durham to the colony.  In religion and education, however, our\r\nanalysis must concern Upper and British Canada rather than the French\r\nregion.  In the latter the existence and dominance of the Catholic\r\nchurch greatly simplified matters.  Thanks to the eighteenth century\r\nagreements with the French, Roman Catholicism had been established on\r\nvery favourable terms in Lower Canada, and dominated that region to the\r\nexclusion of practically all other forms of religious life.  As has\r\nalready been shown, the church controlled not only religion but\r\neducation.  If the women of the Lower Province were better educated\r\nthan the men, it was because the convent schools provided adequately\r\nfor female education.  If higher education was furnished in\r\nsuperabundance, again the church was the prime agent, as it was also in\r\nthe comparative neglect of the rank and file; and comment was made by\r\nDurham's commissioners on the fact that the priesthood resented\r\nanything which weakened {32} its control over the schools.  This\r\nCatholic domination had a very notable influence in politics, for,\r\nafter the first outbursts of nationality were over, the Catholic laity\r\nin politics proved themselves a steadily conservative force.  La\r\nFontaine, the first great French leader who knew how to co-operate with\r\nthe British Canadians, was only by accident a progressive, and escaped\r\nfrom politics when the growth of Upper Canada radicalism began to draw\r\nhim into dangerous religious questions.[30]  But in the Upper Province,\r\neducation and religion did not show this stationary and consistent\r\ncharacter, and played no little part in preparing for and accentuating\r\nthe political agitation.\r\n\r\nEducation had a history rather of good intentions than of brilliant\r\nachievement.  At different times in the earlier nineteenth century,\r\nschemes for district grammar schools and general common schools were\r\nprepared, and sums of money, unhappily not in increasing amounts, were\r\nvoted for educational purposes.  But, apart from the doubtful\r\nenthusiasm of the legislators, the education {33} of the British\r\nsettlers was hampered by an absence of suitable teachers, and the\r\ndifficulty of letting children, who were often the only farm assistants\r\nat hand, attend school for any length of time.  According to good\r\nevidence, half of the true school population never saw the schools, and\r\nthe other half could give only seven months in the year to their\r\ntraining.[31]\r\n\r\nIn most country districts, the settlers had to trust to luck both for\r\nteachers and for schoolhouses, and beginnings which promised better\r\nthings too often ended in blank failure.  There is both humour and\r\nromance in these early struggles after education.  In Ekfried, by the\r\nThames, in Western Canada, there had been no school, till the arrival\r\nof an honest Scot, Robert Campbell, and the backwardness of the season\r\nin 1842, gave the settlement a schoolmaster, and the new settler some\r\nready money.  \"I get a dollar and a half, a quarter per scholar,\" he\r\nwrote to his friends in Scotland, \"and seeing that the wheat did\r\nlittle, I am glad I did engage, for we got plenty of provisions.\"[32]\r\nIn Perth, a more ambitious start {34} met with a tragic end.  The\r\nScottish clergyman, appointed to the district by government, opened a\r\nschool at the request of the inhabitants.  All went well, and a\r\ngenerous government provided fifty pounds by way of annual stipend;\r\nuntil a licentiate of the Anglican Church arrived.  By virtue of the\r\nstanding of his church, the newcomer took precedence of the Scottish\r\nminister and displaced him as educational leader.  But, says the Scot,\r\nwith an irony, unchristian but excusable, \"the school under the\r\ndirection of my clerical successor, soon after died of a consumption,\r\nand the school-house has been for sometime empty.\"[33]\r\n\r\nThe main difficulty in education was to provide an adequate supply of\r\ncompetent teachers.  Complaints against those who offered their\r\nservices were almost universal.  According to a Niagara witness, not\r\nmore than one out of ten teachers in the district was competent to\r\ninstruct his pupils even in the humblest learning,[34] and the\r\ncommissioners who reported to the government of Upper Canada in 1839\r\nboth confirmed these {35} complaints, and described the root of the\r\noffence when they said, \"In this country, the wages of the working\r\nclasses are so high, that few undertake the office of schoolmaster,\r\nexcept those who are unable to do anything else; and hence the\r\nimportant duties of education are often entrusted to incompetent and\r\nimproper persons.  The income of the schoolmaster should, at least, be\r\nequal to that of a common labourer.\"[35]  In so precarious a position,\r\nit was unfortunate that sectarian and local feeling should have\r\nprovoked a controversy at the capital of the western district.  Much as\r\nthe education of the province owed to John Strachan, he did infinite\r\nharm by involving the foundation of a great central school, Upper\r\nCanada College, and of the provincial university, in a bitter religious\r\ndiscussion.  It was not until the public capacity and unsectarian\r\nenthusiasm of Egerton Ryerson were enlisted in the service of\r\nprovincial education, that Upper Canada emerged from her period of\r\nfailure and struggle.\r\n\r\nApart from provincial and governmental efforts, there were many\r\nvoluntary experiments, of which Strachan's famous school at Cornwall,\r\nwas perhaps the most notable.  After all, the colonists were {36}\r\nBritons, many of them trained in the Scottish system of national\r\ndemocratic education, and wherever the struggle for existence slackened\r\ndown, they turned to plan a Canadian system as like as possible to that\r\nwhich they had left.  Kingston was notably enterprising in this\r\nrespect.  Not only were there schools for the more prosperous classes,\r\nbut attempts were made to provide cheap education for the poor, at\r\nfirst supported by the voluntary contributions of ladies, and then by a\r\ncommittee representative of the best Anglican and Presbyterian\r\nsentiment.  Three of these schools were successfully conducted at very\r\nsmall charges, and, in certain cases, the poorest received education\r\nfree.[36]  In higher education the period of union in Canada exhibited\r\ngreat activity.  The generous provision made for a King's College in\r\nToronto had been for a long time stultified by the ill-timed sectarian\r\nspirit of the Bishop of Toronto; but a more reasonable temper prevailed\r\nafter the Rebellion, and the second governor-general of the united\r\nprovinces, Sir Charles Bagot, spent much of his short time of service\r\nin securing professors and seeing the provincial university\r\nlaunched.[37] {37} At the same time, the two other Canadian colleges of\r\nnote, M'Gill University and Queen's College, came into active\r\nexistence.  In October, 1839, after many years of delay, Montreal saw\r\nthe corner-stone of the first English and Protestant College in Lower\r\nCanada laid,[38] and in the winter of 1841-2, Dr. Liddell sailed from\r\nScotland to begin the history of struggle and gallant effort which has\r\ncharacterized Queen's College, Kingston, from first to last.  It is\r\nperhaps the most interesting detail of early university education in\r\nCanada, that the Presbyterian College started in a frame house, with\r\ntwo professors, one representing Arts and one Theology, and with some\r\ntwenty students, very few of whom, however, were \"fitted to be\r\nmatriculated.\"[39]\r\n\r\nIt is well to remember, in face of beginnings so irregular, and even\r\nsqualid, that deficiencies in Canadian college education had been made\r\ngood by the English and Scottish universities, and that Canadian higher\r\neducation was from the outset assisted by the genuine culture and\r\nlearning of the British colleges; for the main sources of university\r\ninspiration in British North America {38} were Oxford and Cambridge,\r\nGlasgow and Edinburgh.[40]\r\n\r\nThere were, of course, other less formal modes of education.  When once\r\npolitical agitation commenced, the press contributed not a little to\r\nthe education of the nation, and must indeed be counted one of the\r\nchief agencies of information, if not of culture.  Everywhere, from\r\nQuebec to Hamilton, enterprising politicians made their influence felt\r\nthrough newspapers.  The period prior to the Rebellion had seen\r\nMackenzie working through his _Colonial Advocate_; and the cause of\r\nresponsible government soon found saner and abler exponents in Francis\r\nHincks and George Brown.  At every important centre, one, two, or even\r\nmore news-sheets, not without merit, were maintained; and the secular\r\npress was reinforced by such educational enterprise as the Dougalls\r\nattempted in the _Montreal Witness_, or by church papers like the\r\nMethodist _Christian Guardian_.[41] {39} Nothing, perhaps, is more\r\ncharacteristic of this phase of Canadian intellectual growth than the\r\nearlier volumes of the _Witness_, which played a part in Canada similar\r\nto that of the Chambers' publications in Scotland.  The note struck was\r\ndeeply sober and moral; the appeal was made to the working and middle\r\nclasses who in Canada as in Scotland were coming into possession of\r\ntheir heritage; and if the intellectual level attained was never very\r\nhigh, an honest attempt was being made to educate the shop-keepers and\r\nfarmers of Canada into wholesome national ideals.\r\n\r\nLittle literary activity seems to have existed outside of politics and\r\nthe newspapers.  For a time cheap reprints from America assisted\r\nBritons in Canada with their forbidden fruits, but government at last\r\nintervened.  It is a curious fact that this perfectly just and natural\r\nprohibition had a most unfortunate effect in checking the reading\r\nhabits of the colony.[42]  In the larger towns there {40} were\r\ncirculating libraries, and presumably immigrants occasionally brought\r\nbooks with them; but newspaper advertisements suggest that school\r\nbooks, and the like, formed almost the only stock-in-trade of the\r\nbook-shop; and the mercurial Major Richardson, after agitating the\r\nchief book-sellers in Canada on behalf of one of his literary ventures,\r\nfound that his total sales amounted to barely thirty copies, and even\r\nan auction sale at Kingston discovered only one purchaser, who limited\r\nhis offer to sevenpence halfpenny.  In speaking, then, of the Canadian\r\npolitical community in 1839, one cannot say, as Burke did of the\r\nAmericans in 1775, that they were a highly educated or book-reading\r\npeople.  Their politicians, progressive and conservative alike, might\r\nhave shortened, simplified, and civilized certain stages in their\r\npolitical agitations, had they been able more fully to draw on the\r\nauthority of British political experience; and their provincialism\r\nwould not have thrust itself so disagreeably on the modern student, had\r\nLocke, Rousseau, Burke, and the greater leaders in modern political\r\nscience, been household names in early Victorian Canada.\r\n\r\nAs with other young communities, the church and religion had their part\r\nto play in the shaping {41} of modern Canada.  And yet it would be\r\nimpossible to attribute to any of the Canadian churches an influence so\r\ndecisive as that which religion exercised through Presbyterianism in\r\nthe creation of the Scottish democracy, or through Independency in\r\nmoulding the New England character.  For while the question of a\r\nreligious establishment proved one of the most exciting issues in\r\npolitics, influences more truly religious suffered a natural\r\ndegradation and diminution through their over-close association with\r\nsecular affairs.\r\n\r\nOnce again the situation in Lower Canada was simplified by the\r\nconditions prevailing among the French Canadians.  For Lower Canada was\r\nwhole-heartedly Catholic, and the Canadian branch of the Roman Church\r\nhad its eulogy pronounced in no uncertain fashion by the Earl of\r\nDurham, who, after praising its tolerant spirit, summed up the services\r\nof the priesthood in these terms: \"The Catholic priesthood of this\r\nProvince have, to a remarkable degree, conciliated the good-will of\r\npersons of all creeds; and I know of no parochial clergy in the world,\r\nwhose practice of all the Christian virtues, and zealous discharge of\r\ntheir clerical duties, is more universally admired, and has been\r\nproductive of more beneficial consequences.  {42} Possessed of incomes\r\nsufficient, and even large, according to the notions entertained in the\r\ncountry, and enjoying the advantage of education, they have lived on\r\nterms of equality and kindness with the humblest and least instructed\r\ninhabitants of the rural districts.  Intimately acquainted with the\r\nwants and characters of their neighbours, they have been the promoters\r\nand dispensers of charity, and the effectual guardians of the morals of\r\nthe people; and in the general absence of any permanent institutions of\r\ncivil government, the Catholic Church has presented almost the only\r\nsemblance of stability and organization, and furnished the only\r\neffectual support for civilization and order.  The Catholic clergy of\r\nLower Canada are entitled to this expression of my esteem, not only\r\nbecause it is founded on truth, but because a grateful recognition of\r\ntheir eminent services, in resisting the arts of the disaffected, is\r\nespecially due to them from one who has administered the government of\r\nthe Province in these troubled times.\"[43]\r\n\r\nUpper Canada and the British community presented a somewhat different\r\npicture.  Certain Roman Catholic elements among the Irish and the\r\nScottish Highlanders reinforced the ranks of {43} Catholicism, but for\r\nthe greater part Anglicanism and Presbyterianism were the\r\necclesiastical guides of the settlers.  At first, apart from official\r\nreligion, the Church of England appeared in Canada in missionary form,\r\nand about 1820 the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel had\r\nfifteen missionaries in Lower Canada, and seventeen in Upper Canada.\r\nBut under the fostering care of governors like Colborne, and the\r\norganizing genius of Dr. Strachan, Rector, Archdeacon, and latterly\r\nBishop in Toronto, the Anglican Church in Canada became a\r\nself-dependent unit.  The Bishop of Toronto was able to boast in 1842\r\nthat in his western visitation, which lasted from June till October, he\r\nhad \"consecrated two churches and one burial ground, confirmed 756\r\npersons at twenty-four different stations, and travelled, including his\r\njourneys for the formation of District Branches of the Church Society,\r\nupwards of 2,500 miles.\"[44]  In cities like Toronto and Kingston it\r\nwas on the whole the church of the governing class, and shared in the\r\nculture and public qualities of that class.  Nor was it negligent of\r\nthe cure of poorer souls, for Anglicans co-operated with Presbyterians\r\nin the {44} management of the poor schools in Kingston, and in that and\r\nthe other more prominent towns of the province, the English parish\r\nchurch system seems to have been transplanted and worked most\r\nefficiently.  Equal in importance, if not in numbers, Scottish\r\nPresbyterianism claimed its section of the community.  Down to 1822,\r\nthere were but six organized congregations in Upper and Lower Canada\r\nconnected with the Church of Scotland,[45] but at the first\r\nPresbyterian Synod held in Canada, in 1831, fourteen ministers and five\r\nelders gathered at Kingston to represent the Church;[46] and by 1837\r\nthe number of congregations had grown to 37 in Upper Canada, and 14 in\r\nLower Canada.  Nor were these weak and struggling efforts.  The\r\nScottish Church at Kingston had in 1841 a membership of 350, and an\r\naverage attendance of 800.  Like its Anglican rival, it was simply a\r\nparish church, and its minister, trained in Edinburgh, as the Anglican\r\ncleric came naturally from an English college, visited, preached, and\r\ndisciplined according to the rules of Knox and Melville, and\r\nmaintained, perhaps more genuinely than either school or {45} newspaper\r\ncould, an educational influence on his flock not unworthy of the mother\r\ncountry.  Here and there the ties, which still remained strong, between\r\nCanadian settlements and the districts in Scotland whence the settlers\r\nwere drawn, proved useful aids in church extension.  Lanark, in Upper\r\nCanada, owed its church to the efforts of friends in Lanarkshire, in\r\nScotland, who collected no less a sum than £290 for the purpose.[47]\r\n\r\nBut the religious life of Canada was assisted by another less official\r\nforce, the Methodist Church.  Methodism in its earlier days incurred\r\nthe reproach of being rather American than British, and, in one of his\r\nmost unjustifiable perversions of the truth, Strachan tried to make the\r\nfact tell against the sect, in his notorious table of ecclesiastical\r\nstatistics.  Undoubtedly there was a stronger American element in the\r\nMethodist connection than in either of the other churches; and its\r\nspirit lent itself more readily to American innovations.  Its fervent\r\nmethods drew from the ranks of colder churches the more emotional, and\r\nbeing freer and homelier in its ritual, it appealed very directly to a\r\nrude and half-educated community.  Thus the Methodist preachers made\r\n{46} rapid headway, more especially in regions untouched by the\r\nofficial churches.\r\n\r\nIn the representative man of early Canadian Methodism, Egerton Ryerson,\r\nqualities conspicuously British and conservative, appeared.  Through\r\nhim Methodism came forward as the supporter of the British connection\r\nin the Metcalfe troubles, as through him it may claim some of the glory\r\nof organizing an adequate system of provincial education.  But, after\r\nall, the noblest work of the sect was done in informal and irregular\r\nfashion.  They were the pioneers and _coureurs du bois_ of the British\r\nprovince in the religious world.  Perhaps the most genuine tribute paid\r\nto this earlier phase of Methodism was that of John Beverley Robinson,\r\nwhen his fellow Anglicans blamed him in 1842 for granting a plot of\r\nground for a Methodist chapel.  \"Frequently,\" he retorted, \"in the most\r\nlonely parts of the wilderness, in townships where a clergyman of the\r\nChurch of England had never been heard, and probably never seen, I have\r\nfound the population assembled in some log building, earnestly engaged\r\nin acts of devotion, and listening to those doctrines and truths which\r\nare inculcated in common by most Christian denominations, but which, if\r\nit had not been for {47} the ministration of dissenting preachers,\r\nwould for thirty years have been but little known, if at all, to the\r\ngreater part of the inhabitants of the interior of Upper Canada.\"[48]\r\nStill the Canadian Methodist Church did not occupy so conspicuous a\r\nplace in the official public life of Canada, and in Sydenham's\r\nLegislative Council of 1841, out of twenty-four members, eight\r\nrepresented Anglicanism, eight Presbyterianism, eight Catholicism, and\r\nMethodism had to find lowlier places for its political leaders.[49]\r\n\r\nHitherto religion has been viewed in its social and spiritual aspects.\r\nBut Canadian history has, with perhaps over-emphasis, selected one\r\ngreat controversy as the central point in the religious life of the\r\nprovince.  It is not my intention to enter here into the wearisome\r\ndetails of the Clergy Reserve question.  But the fight over the\r\nestablishment principle forms an essential factor in the social and\r\npolitical life of Canada between 1839 and 1854, the year in which it\r\nwas finally settled.  It is first necessary to discriminate between\r\nwhat may be called casual and incidental support to churches in Canada,\r\nand the main Clergy Reserve {48} fund.  When Dr. Black challenged, in\r\nthe interests of Presbyterianism, certain monies paid to Anglican\r\nchurches in Upper and Lower Canada, he was able to point to direct\r\nassistance given by the Imperial Parliament to the Anglican Church in\r\nCanada.  He was told in answer that these grants were temporarily made\r\nto individuals with whose lives they terminated, and that a pledge had\r\nbeen given in 1832 that Britain should be relieved of such\r\nexpenses.[50]  In a similar fashion, when the district of Perth, in\r\nUpper Canada, was settled by discharged soldiers and emigrants from\r\nScotland, \"Government offered assistance for the support of a minister,\r\n_without respect to religious denomination_,\" and, as a matter of fact,\r\nthe community thus assisted to a clergyman, received, not a minister of\r\nthe Church of Scotland, but one ordained by the Secession Church in\r\nScotland--a curious but laudable example of laxity on the part of\r\ngovernment.[51]\r\n\r\nThe root and ground of offending lay in the thirty-sixth and following\r\nclauses of the Constitutional Act of 1791, which proposed to support\r\n{49} and maintain a Protestant clergy in the provinces by grants of\r\nland, equal in value to the seventh part of lands granted for other\r\npurposes.  On the face of it, and interpreted by the clauses which\r\nfollow, the Act seems to bear out the Anglican contention that the\r\nEnglish Church establishment received an extension to Canada through\r\nthe Act, and that no other church was expected to receive a share.  It\r\nis true that the legal decision of 1819, and the views of colonial\r\nsecretaries like Glenelg, admitted at least the Scottish Church to a\r\nportion of the benefits.  But for the purposes of the situation in\r\n1839, it is merely necessary to say that a British parliament in 1791,\r\nignorant of actual colonial conditions, and more especially of the\r\ncurious ecclesiastical developments with which the American colonies\r\nhad modified the British system before 1776, and probably forgetful of\r\nthe claims of the Church of Scotland to parliamentary recognition, had\r\ngiven Canada the beginnings of an Anglican Church establishment; and\r\nthat the Anglicans in Canada, and more especially those led by Dr. John\r\nStrachan, had more than fulfilled the sectarian and monopolist\r\nintentions of the legislators.\r\n\r\nThree schools of opinion formed themselves in {50} the intervening\r\nyears.  First and foremost came the establishment men, mainly Anglican,\r\nbut with a certain Presbyterian following, who claimed to monopolize\r\nthe benefits, such as they were, of the Clergy Reserve funds.  Canada\r\nas a British colony was bound to support the one or two state churches\r\nof the mother country; religious inequality was to flourish there as at\r\nhome; dissent was to receive the same stigma and disqualification, and\r\nthe dominant church or churches were to live, not by the efforts of\r\ntheir members, but at the expense of all citizens of the state, whether\r\nAnglican, Presbyterian, or Methodist.  This phase of opinion received\r\nits most offensive expression from leaders like the Bishop of Toronto.\r\nTo these monopolists, any modification of the Anglican settlement\r\nseemed a \"tyrannical and unjust measure,\" and they adopted an\r\necclesiastical arrogance towards their fellow-Christians, which did\r\nmuch to alienate popular sympathies throughout the province.\r\n\r\nAt the other extreme was a solid mass of public sentiment which had\r\nlittle interest in the ecclesiastical theories of the Bishop of\r\nToronto, and which resented alike attempts to convert the provincial\r\nuniversity into an Anglican college, and the cumbrous and unjust form\r\nof church establishment, {51} the most obvious evidence of which lay in\r\nthe undeveloped patches of Clergy Reserve land scattered everywhere\r\nthroughout the settlements.  It was the undoubted desire of a majority\r\nin 1840 that the Clergy Reserve system should be ended, the former\r\nreserves sold, and the proceeds applied to educational and general\r\npurposes; a desire which had been registered in the House of Assembly\r\non fourteen different occasions since 1826.[52]  The case for the\r\nvoluntary principle in Canada had many exponents, but these words of\r\nDr. John Rolph in 1836 express the spirit of the movement in both its\r\nstrength and its weakness: \"Instead of making a State provision for any\r\none or more churches; instead of apportioning the Clergy Reserves among\r\nthem with a view to promoting Christianity; instead of giving pensions\r\nand salaries to ministers to make them independent of voluntary\r\ncontributions from the people, I would studiously avoid that policy,\r\nand leave truth unfettered and unimpeded to make her own conquests....\r\nThe professions of law and physic are well represented in this\r\nAssembly, and bear ample testimony to the generosity of the people\r\ntowards them.  Will good, pious and evangelical ministers of our holy\r\nreligion be likely to {52} fare worse than the physicians of the body,\r\nor the agents for our temporal affairs?  Let gospel ministers, as the\r\nScriptures say, live by the gospel, and the apostolic maxim that the\r\nworkman is worthy of his hire implies the performance of duty rewarded\r\ntemporarily by those who impose it.  There is no fear that the\r\nprofession will become extinct for want of professors.\"[53]\r\n\r\nBetween the extremes, however, there existed a group of moderate\r\npoliticians, represented, in the Upper Province by Baldwin, in the\r\nLower by La Fontaine, and among British statesmen apparently by both\r\nSydenham and Elgin.  Especially among its Canadian members, this group\r\nfelt keenly the desirability of supporting religion, as it struggled\r\nthrough the difficulties inevitably connected with early colonial life.\r\nBut neither Baldwin, who was a devoted Anglican, nor La Fontaine, a\r\nfaithful son of his Church, showed any tinge of Strachan's bitterness\r\nas they considered the question; and nothing impressed Canadian opinion\r\nmore than did La Fontaine's speech, in a later phase of the Clergy\r\nReserve troubles, when he solemnly renounced on behalf of his\r\ncoreligionists any chance of stealing an advantage while the\r\nProtestants {53} were quarrelling, and when he stated his opinion that\r\nthe endowment belonged to the Protestant clergy, and should be shared\r\nequally among them.  It was this school of thought---to anticipate\r\nevents by a year or two--which received the sanction of Sydenham's\r\nstatesmanship, and that energetic mind never accomplished anything more\r\nnotable than when, in the face of a strong secularizing feeling, to the\r\njustification for which he was in no way blind, he repelled the party\r\nof monopoly, and yet retained the endowment for the Protestant churches\r\nof Canada.  \"The Clergy Reserves,\" he wrote in a private letter, \"have\r\nbeen, and are, the great overwhelming grievance--the root of all the\r\ntroubles of the province, the cause of the Rebellion--the never-failing\r\nwatchword at the hustings--the perpetual source of discord, strife, and\r\nhatred.  Not a man of any party but has told me that the greatest boon\r\nwhich could be conferred on the country would be that they should be\r\nswept into the Atlantic, and that nobody should get them.  My Bill[54]\r\nhas gone through the Assembly by a considerable majority, thirty to\r\ntwenty, and I feel confident that I can get it through the {54} Council\r\nwithout the change of a word.  If it is really carried, it is the\r\ngreatest work that ever has been done in this country, and will be of\r\nmore solid advantage to it than all the loans and all the troops you\r\ncan make or send.  It is worth ten unions, and was ten times more\r\ndifficult.\"[55]\r\n\r\nIt is a melancholy comment on the ecclesiastical interpretation of\r\nreligion that, ten years later, when the firmly expressed desires of\r\nall moderate men had given the Bishop of Toronto a good excuse for\r\nacquiescence in Sydenham's _status quo_, that pugnacious ecclesiastic\r\nstill fought to save as much of the monopoly as could be secured.[56]\r\n\r\nWith the Clergy Reserve dispute, the region of politics has been\r\nreached; and, after all, politics furnished the most powerful influence\r\nin the young Canadian community.  But politics must be taken less in\r\nthe constitutional sense, as has been the custom with Canadian writers,\r\nand more in the social and human sense.  It is important also to note\r\nthe broad stretches of Canadian existence {55} into which they hardly\r\nintruded.  Political questions found few exponents among the pioneers\r\nas they cleared the forests, or gathered lumber for the British market,\r\nor pushed far to the west and north in pursuit of furs.  Even the\r\nRebellion, when news of it reached Strickland and his fellow-settlers\r\nin the Peterborough country, came to them less as part of a prolonged\r\nstruggle in which they all were taking part, than as an abnormal\r\nincident, to be ended outright by loyal strength.  They hardly seem to\r\nhave thought that any liberties of theirs were really endangered.  When\r\nMackenzie himself complained that instead of entering Toronto with four\r\nor five thousand men, he found himself at the head of a poor two\r\nhundred, he does not seem to have realized that, even had his\r\nfellow-conspirators not mismanaged things, it would still have been\r\ndifficult to keep hard-working settlers keyed up to the pitch of\r\nrevolutionary and abstract doctrines.[57]  There must have been many\r\nsettlers of the temper of the humble Scottish janitor in Queen's\r\nCollege, Kingston, who wrote, in the midst of the struggle of parties\r\nin 1851: \"For my part I never trouble my head about one of them.\r\nAlthough the polling-house was just across {56} the street, I never\r\nwent near it.\"[58]  In the cities, however, and along the main lines of\r\ncommunication, the interest must have been keen, and the country\r\nundoubtedly attained its manhood as it struggled towards the solution\r\nof questions like those of the Clergy Reserves, the financing of the\r\ncolony, the regulation of trade and immigration, and, above all others,\r\nthe definition of responsible government.\r\n\r\nSomething has already been said of the various political groups in the\r\ncolony, for they corresponded roughly to the different strata of\r\nsettlement--French, Loyalist, and men of the later immigration.  It is\r\ntrue, as Sydenham and Elgin pointed out, that the British party names\r\nhardly corresponded to local divisions--and that these divisions were\r\nreally too petty to deserve the name of parties.  Yet it would be\r\nfoolish to deny the actual existence of the groups, or to refuse to see\r\nin their turbulence and strife the beginning of national\r\nself-consciousness, and the first stage in a notable political\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nMost conspicuous among the political forces, because the bond of party\r\nunion was for them {57} something deeper than opinion, and must be\r\ncalled racial, was the French-Canadian group, with the whole weight of\r\n_habitant_ support behind it.  From the publication of Lord Durham's\r\n_Report_, through the Sydenham regime, and down till Sir Charles Bagot\r\nsurrendered to their claims, the French politicians presented an\r\nunbroken and hostile front to the British community.  Colborne had\r\nrepressed their risings at the point of the bayonet; a Whig government\r\nhad deprived them temporarily of free institutions; Durham--their\r\nfriend after his fashion--had bidden them be absorbed into the greater\r\nBritish community; Sydenham came to enforce what Durham had suggested;\r\nand, with each new check, their pride had grown more stubborn and their\r\nnationalism more intense.  Bagot, who understood them and whom they\r\ncame to trust, may be allowed to describe their characteristics,\r\nthrough the troubled first years of union: \"On Lord Sydenham's\r\narrival,\" he wrote to Stanley, \"he found the Lower Province deprived of\r\na constitution, the legislative functions of the government being\r\nadministered by a special council, consisting of a small number of\r\nmembers nominated by the Crown.  A large portion of the people, at\r\nleast those of French origin, prostrate under {58} the effects of the\r\nRebellion, overawed by the power of Great Britain, and excluded from\r\nall share in the government, had resigned themselves to a sullen and\r\nreluctant submission, or to a perverse but passive resistance to the\r\ngovernment.  This temper was not improved by the passing of the Act of\r\nUnion.  In this measure, heedless of the generosity of the Imperial\r\ngovernment, in overlooking their recent disaffection, and giving them a\r\nfree and popular constitution, ... they apprehended a new instrument of\r\nsubjection, and accordingly prepared to resist it.  Lord Sydenham found\r\nthem in this disposition, and despairing, from its early\r\nmanifestations, of the possibility of overcoming or appeasing it,\r\nbefore the period at which it would be necessary to put in force the\r\nAct of Union, he determined upon evincing his indifference to it, and\r\nupon taking steps to carry out his views, in spite of the opposition of\r\nthe French party....  They have from that time declared and evinced\r\ntheir hostility to the Union ... and have maintained a consistent,\r\nunited, and uncompromising opposition to the government which was\r\nconcerned in carrying it into execution.\"[59]\r\n\r\nTo describe the French in politics, it has been {59} necessary to\r\nadvance a year or two beyond 1839, for the Rebellion had terminated one\r\nphase of their political existence, and the characteristics of the next\r\nphase did not become apparent till the Union Assembly of 1841 and 1842.\r\nIt was indeed an abnormal form of the national and racial question\r\nwhich there presented itself.  French Canada found itself represented\r\nby a party, over twenty in number, the most compact in the House of\r\nAssembly, and with _la nation Canadienne_ solidly behind them.  In La\r\nFontaine, Viger, Morin and others, it had leaders both skilful and\r\nfully trusted.  Yet the party of the British supremacy quoted Durham\r\nand others in favour of a plan for the absorption of French Canada in\r\nthe British element; and the same party could recount, with telling\r\neffect, the past misdeeds, or at least the old suspicions, connected\r\nwith the names of the French leaders.  Misunderstood, and yet half\r\nexcusably misunderstood; self-governing, and yet deprived of many of\r\nthe legitimate consequences and fruits of self-government; without\r\nplaces or honours, and yet coherent, passionately French, and\r\ncompetently led, the French party stood across the path of Canadian\r\npeace, menacing, and with a racial rather than a party threat.\r\n\r\n{60}\r\n\r\nIn the Upper Province, the party in possession, the so-called Family\r\nCompact group, posed as the only friends of Britain.  They had never\r\npossessed more than an accidental majority in the Lower House, and,\r\nsince Durham's rule, it seemed likely that their old supremacy in the\r\nExecutive and Legislative Councils had come to an end.  Yet as their\r\npower receded, their language became the more peremptory, and their\r\ncontempt for other groups the more bitter.  One of the most respectable\r\nof the group, J. S. Cartwright, frankly confessed that he thought his\r\nfellow-colonists unfit for any extension of self-government \"in a\r\ncountry where almost universal suffrage prevails, where the great mass\r\nof the people are uneducated, and where there is but little of that\r\nsalutary influence which hereditary rank and great wealth exercise in\r\nGreat Britain.\"[60]  Their position had an apparent but unreal\r\nstrength, because they knew that the older type of Colonial official,\r\nthe entire British Conservative party, and the Church of England, at\r\nhome and abroad, supported them.  As late as July, 1839, Arthur, the\r\nrepresentative of the Crown in Upper Canada, could write thus to his\r\ngovernment concerning more than half the {61} population under his\r\nauthority: \"There is a considerable section of persons who are disloyal\r\nto the core; reform is on their lips, but separation is in their\r\nhearts.  These people having for the last two or three years made a\r\n'responsible government' their watch-word, are now extravagantly elated\r\nbecause the Earl of Durham has recommended that measure.  They regard\r\nit as an unerring means to get rid of all British connection, while the\r\nEarl of Durham, on the contrary, has recommended it as a measure for\r\ncementing the existing bond of union with the mother country.\"[61]\r\n\r\nTheir programme was precise and consistent.  The influence of a too\r\ndemocratic franchise was to be modified by a Conservative upper house,\r\nand an executive council, chosen not in accordance with popular wishes,\r\nbut from the class--their own--which had so long been dominant in the\r\nexecutive.  The British connection depended, in their view, on the\r\npermanent alliance between their group and whatsoever representative\r\nthe British crown might send to Canada.  French Canadian feeling they\r\nwere prepared to repress as a thing rebellious and un-English, and the\r\n{62} friends of the French in Upper Canada they regarded very much as a\r\nSouth African might the Englishman who should be prepared to strengthen\r\nhis political position by an alliance with the native peoples; although\r\nevents were to prove that, when other elements of self-interest\r\ndictated a different course, they were not unwilling to co-operate in\r\nthe interests of disorder with the French.  In ecclesiastical affairs,\r\nthey supported the establishment of an Anglican Church in Canada, and\r\ninsulted religion never found more eloquent defenders than did the\r\nClergy Reserve establishment at the hands of Sir Allan MacNab, the\r\nConservative leader, and his allies.  But events and their own factious\r\nexcesses had broken their power.  They had allowed nothing for the\r\npossibilities of political education, in a land where the poorest had\r\ninfinite chances of gaining independence.  They scorned democracy at a\r\ntime when nothing else in politics had a stable future; and the country\r\nnaturally distrusted constitutional logicians whose conclusions\r\ninvariably landed them in the sole possession of emoluments and place.\r\nSydenham's quick eye foresaw the coming rout, and it was his opinion,\r\nbefore the Assembly of 1841 came to make matters certain, that moderate\r\nmen would overturn the {63} sway of old Toryism, and that the wild\r\nheads under MacNab would stultify themselves by their foolish\r\nconduct.[62]\r\n\r\nIn Upper Canada, the Conservative and Family Compact group had to face\r\na vigorous Reforming opposition.  It is well, however, after 1838, to\r\ndiscriminate between any remnants of the old Mackenzie school, and the\r\nmen under whom Canada was to secure unrestricted self-government.  The\r\ntruth is that the situation up to 1837 had been too abnormal to permit\r\nthe constitutional radicals to show themselves in their true character.\r\nMackenzie himself, in the rather abject letter with which he sought\r\nreinstatement in 1848, admitted the falsity of his old position: \"Had I\r\nseen things in 1837 as I do in 1848, I would have shuddered at the very\r\nidea of revolt, no matter what our wrongs might have been.  I ought, as\r\na Scotsman, to have stood by the government in America to the last;\r\nexerted any energy I possessed to make it better, more just, more\r\nperfect; left it for a time, if too oppressive, but never tried, as I\r\ndid, to put it down.\"[63]  Mackenzie's ideal, discovered {64} by him\r\ntoo late to be very useful, was actually that of the Reforming\r\nLoyalists who refused to indulge in treason in 1837, but who determined\r\nto secure their ends by peaceful persuasion.  Their leader in public\r\naffairs was Robert Baldwin, whose career and opinions may be more fitly\r\nconsidered at a later point, and Francis Hincks expounded their views\r\nin his paper _The Examiner_.  They were devoted adherents of the\r\nResponsible Government school; that is, they desired to have provincial\r\ncabinets, not simply chosen so that they might not conflict with public\r\nopinion, but imposed upon the governor by public opinion through its\r\nrepresentatives in the House of Assembly.  They had for years protested\r\nagainst the Clergy Reserves monopoly, and although Baldwin seems always\r\nto have favoured the retention of some form of assistance to religion,\r\nthe ordinary reformer was vehement for absolute secularization.\r\nSydenham when he came, refused to admit that the British party names\r\nwere anything but misnomers in Canada; and yet Hincks was not singular\r\namong the reformers when he said that he had been in favour of all the\r\nmeasures advocated by the British progressives--Catholic Emancipation,\r\nthe Repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, Abolition of {65} Slavery,\r\nand Parliamentary Reform.[64]  Their relation to the French was\r\ncurious.  Unlike the French, they were usually strong advocates of a\r\nunion of the two provinces, and they sympathized neither with\r\nPapineau's doctrinaire republicanism, nor with the sullen negative\r\nhatred of things British which then possessed so many minds in Lower\r\nCanada.  But grievances still unredressed created a fellow-feeling with\r\nthe French, and from 1839 until 1842 the gradual formation of an\r\nAnglo-French reforming _bloc_, under Baldwin and La Fontaine, was one\r\nof the most notable developments in Canadian political life.\r\n\r\nAfter the Union, as before it, the political life of Canada was\r\ncharacterized by a readiness to resort to violence, and a lack of\r\npolitical good manners, which contrasted painfully with the eloquent\r\nphrases and professions of the orators on either side.  The earliest\r\nimpression which the first governor-general of the Union received of\r\npolitics in his province was one of disorder and mismanagement.  \"You\r\ncan form no idea of the manner in which a Colonial Parliament transacts\r\nits business,\" Poulett Thomson wrote from Toronto, in 1839.  \"When they\r\ncame to their own affairs, {66} and, above all, to the money matters,\r\nthere was a scene of confusion and riot of which no one in England can\r\nhave any idea.  Every man proposes a vote for his own job, and bills\r\nare introduced without notice, and carried through all their stages in\r\na quarter of an hour.\"[65]  The first efforts in the struggle for\r\nresponsible government were rendered needlessly irritating by the\r\nabsence of that spirit of courteous moderation which usually\r\ncharacterizes the proceedings of the Imperial Parliament.  The\r\nrelations between the governor and his ministers, at the best\r\ndifficult, were made impossible for a man like Metcalfe by the\r\nill-mannered disdain with which, as all the citizens of his capital\r\nknew, the cabinet spoke of their official head; and in debate the\r\npersonal element played far too prominent a part.  In all the early\r\nUnion assemblies, too, the house betrayed its inexperience by passing\r\nrapidly from serious constitutional questions to petty jobs and\r\nquarrels, and as rapidly back again to first principles.  There was a\r\ngeneral failure to see the risk run by too frequent discussions on\r\nfundamentals, and much of the bitterness of party strife would have\r\nbeen avoided if the rival parties could have prosecuted their {67}\r\nadverse operations by slower and more scientific approaches.\r\n\r\nThe warmth of feeling and the disorder exhibited in the councils of\r\nstate and the assembly, met with a ready response in the country.  It\r\nis only fair to say that many of the gravest disturbances were caused\r\nby recent immigrants, more especially by the Irish labourers on the\r\ncanals in the neighbourhood of Montreal.[66]  But the whole community\r\nmust share in the discredit.  The days had not yet ceased when\r\npolitical bills called on adherents of one or other party to assemble\r\n\"with music and good shillelaghs\";[67] and indeed the decade from 1840\r\nto 1850 was distinctly one of political rioting.  The election of 1841\r\nwas disgraced, more especially in Lower Canada, by very violent strife.\r\nIn 1843 an Act was deemed necessary \"to provide for the calling and\r\norderly holding of public meetings in this province and for the better\r\npreservation of the public peace thereat.\"[68]  In the Montreal\r\nelection of April, 1844, Metcalfe accused both his former\r\ninspector-general and the reform candidate of using inflammatory and\r\nreckless language, and {68} certainly both then and in November\r\ndisgraceful riots made the elections no true register of public\r\nsentiment.  At the very end of the decade, the riots caused by the\r\npassing of the \"Rebellion Losses\" Act, organized, it must be\r\nremembered, by the so-called loyal party, endangered the life of a\r\ngovernor-general, and made Montreal no longer possible as the seat of\r\ngovernment.  One may perhaps over-estimate the importance of these\r\ndetails; for, after all, the communal life of Canada was yet in its\r\nextreme youth, and in England itself there were still remnants of the\r\nold eighteenth century disorders, with hints of the newer\r\nrevolutionism.  Their importance is rather that they complicated the\r\ntask of adjusting imperial standards to suit Canadian self-government,\r\nand introduced unnecessary errors into the conduct of affairs by the\r\nprovincial statesmen.\r\n\r\nIt was obvious then that the United Provinces of Canada had, in 1839,\r\nstill some distance to travel before their social, religious, and\r\npolitical organization could be regarded as satisfactory.  Individually\r\nand collectively poor, the citizens of Canada required direct aid from\r\nthe resources of the mother country.  Material improvements in roads\r\nand canals, the introduction of steam, {69} the organization of labour,\r\nwere immediately necessary.  Education in all its stages must receive\r\nencouragement and recognition.  Religion must be freed from the\r\nencumbrance of a vexatious controversy.  Municipal institutions and\r\nlocal government had still to be introduced to teach the people the\r\nelements of self-government; and a broader system of colonial\r\nlegislation and administration substituted for the discredited rule of\r\nassemblies and councils at Toronto and Quebec.  There was racial hate\r\nto be quenched; and petty party jealousies to be transmuted into more\r\nuseful political energy.  A nation was at its birth.  The problem was\r\nwhether in Great Britain there were minds acute and imaginative enough\r\nto see the actual dangers; generous enough not to be dissuaded from\r\ntrying to avert them by any rudeness on the part of those who were\r\nbeing assisted; prophetic enough to recognize that Anglo-Saxon\r\ncommunities, whether at home or across the seas, will always claim the\r\nright to govern themselves, and that to such self-government none but\r\nthe community actually affected may set a limit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Robinson, _Life of Sir John Beverley Robinson_, Bart., pp. 75-6.\r\n\r\n[2] _Report of the Agent for Emigration_, Toronto, January, 1841.  \"The\r\npassage extended to seven complete weeks,\" writes a Scottish settler,\r\nRobert Campbell, in 1840, \"and to tell the truth we were weary enough\r\nof it.\"  MS. letter, _penes me_.\r\n\r\n[3] _Conditions and Prospects of Canada in 1854_, London, 1855.\r\n\r\n[4] Poulett Scrope, _Life of Lord Sydenham_, pp. 141-2.\r\n\r\n[5] Richardson, _Eight Years in Canada_, p. 117.\r\n\r\n[6] See an interesting letter of January, 1838 in Christie, _History of\r\nLower Canada_, v. 109.\r\n\r\n[7] _Lord Durham's Report_, Appendix B.

In consequence, their conduct with reference to colonial\r\nautonomy and all the questions therewith connected, demands the most\r\ncareful and detailed treatment.\r\n\r\nWhen Lord John Russell, then leader of the House of Commons, and\r\nSecretary of State for the {71} Colonies, selected a new\r\ngovernor-general of Canada to complete the work begun by Durham, he\r\nentrusted to him an elaborate system of government, most of it\r\nexperimental and as yet untried.  He was to superintend the completion\r\nof that Union between Upper and Lower Canada, which Durham had so\r\nstrenuously advocated; and the Union was to be the centre of a general\r\nadministrative reconstruction.  The programme outlined in Russell's\r\ninstructions proposed \"a legislative union of the two provinces, a just\r\nregard to the claims of either province in adjusting the terms of that\r\nunion, the maintenance of the three Estates of the Provincial\r\nLegislature, the settlement of a permanent Civil List for securing the\r\nindependence of the judges, and, to the executive government, that\r\nfreedom of action which is necessary for the public good, and the\r\nestablishment of a system of local government by representative bodies,\r\nfreely elected in the various cities and rural districts.\"[2]  In\r\nattaining these ends, all of them obviously to the advantage of the\r\ncolony, the Colonial Secretary desired to consult, and, as far as\r\npossible, to defer to Canadian public opinion.[3]\r\n\r\n{72}\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Lord John Russell had no sooner entered upon his\r\nadministrative reforms, than he found himself face to face with a\r\nfundamental constitutional difficulty.  He proposed to play the part of\r\na reformer in Canada; but the majority of reformers in that province\r\nadded to his programme the demand for executive councils, not merely\r\nsympathetic to popular claims, but responsible to the representatives\r\nof the people in a Canadian Parliament.  Now according to all the\r\ntraditions of imperial government a demand so far-reaching involved the\r\ndisruption of the empire, and ended the connection between Canada and\r\nEngland.  To this general objection the British minister added a\r\nsubtler point in constitutional law.  To yield to colonial reforming\r\nideas would be to contradict the existing conventions of the\r\nconstitution.  \"The power for which a minister is responsible in\r\nEngland,\" he wrote to his new governor, \"is not his own power, but the\r\npower of the crown, of which he is for the time the organ.  It is\r\nobvious that the executive councillor of a colony is in a situation\r\ntotally different....  Can the colonial council be the advisers of the\r\ncrown of England?  Evidently not, for the crown has other advisers for\r\nthe same functions, and with {73} superior authority.  It may happen,\r\ntherefore, that the governor receives, at one and the same time,\r\ninstructions from the Queen and advice from his executive council\r\ntotally at variance with each other.  If he is to obey his instructions\r\nfrom England, the parallel of constitutional responsibility entirely\r\nfails; if, on the other hand, he is to follow the advice of his\r\ncouncil, he is no longer a subordinate officer, but an independent\r\nsovereign.\"[4]  The governor-general, then, was in no way to concede to\r\nthe Canadian assembly a responsibility and power which resided only in\r\nthe British ministry.\r\n\r\nAt the same time large concessions, in spirit if not in letter, helped\r\nto modify the rigour of this constitutional doctrine.  \"I have not\r\ndrawn any specific line,\" Russell wrote at the end of the despatch\r\nalready quoted, \"beyond which the power of the governor on the one\r\nhand, and the privileges of the assembly on the other, ought not to\r\nextend....  The governor must only oppose the wishes of the assembly\r\nwhen the honour of the crown, or the interests of the empire, are\r\ndeeply concerned; and the assembly must be ready to modify {74} some of\r\nits measures for the sake of harmony, and from a reverent attachment to\r\nthe authority of Great Britain.\"\r\n\r\nTwo days later, an even more important modification than was contained\r\nin this exhortation to charity and opportunism was proposed.  It had\r\nbeen the chief grievance in both provinces that the executive positions\r\nin Canada had been filled with men who held them as permanencies, and\r\nin spite of the clamour of public opinion against them.  Popular\r\nrepresentative rights had been more than counterbalanced by entire\r\nexecutive irresponsibility.  A despatch, nominally of general\r\napplication to British colonies, but, under the circumstances, of\r\nspecial importance to the United Provinces of Canada, changed the\r\nstatus of colonial executive offices: \"You will understand, and will\r\ncause it to be generally known, that hereafter the tenure of colonial\r\noffices held during her Majesty's pleasure, will not be regarded as\r\nequivalent to a tenure during good behaviour, but that not only such\r\nofficers will be called upon to retire from the public service as often\r\nas any sufficient motives of public policy may suggest the expediency\r\nof that measure, but that a change in the person of the governor will\r\nbe considered as a sufficient reason for any {75} alterations which his\r\nsuccessor may deem it expedient to make in the list of public\r\nfunctionaries, subject of course to the future confirmation of the\r\nSovereign.  These remarks do not apply to judicial offices, nor are\r\nthey meant to apply to places which are altogether ministerial and\r\nwhich do not devolve upon the holders of them duties in the right\r\ndischarge of which the character and policy of the government are\r\ndirectly involved.  They are intended to apply rather to the heads of\r\ndepartments, than to persons serving as clerks or in similar capacities\r\nunder them; neither do they extend to officers in the service of the\r\nLords Commissioners of the Treasury.  The functionaries who will be\r\nchiefly, though not exclusively, affected by them are the Colonial\r\nSecretary, the Treasurer or Receiver-General, the Surveyor-General, the\r\nAttorney and Solicitor-General, the Sheriff or Provost Marshal, and\r\nother officers who, under different designations from these, are\r\nentrusted with the same or similar duties.  To this list must also be\r\nadded the Members of the Council, especially in those colonies in which\r\nthe Executive and Legislative Councils are distinct bodies.\"[5]\r\n\r\n{76}\r\n\r\nThe importance of this general circular of October 16th is that, at a\r\ntime when the Colonial Secretary was exhorting the new governor-general\r\nto part with none of his prerogatives, and in a colony where public\r\nopinion was importuning with some persistence for a more popular\r\nexecutive, one of the best excuses for withholding from the people\r\ntheir desires was removed.  The representative of the crown in\r\nconsequence found himself with a new and not altogether comfortable\r\nopportunity for exercising his freedom of choice.\r\n\r\nIt fell to Charles Poulett Thomson, President of the Board of Trade in\r\nthe Whig ministry, to carry out the Union of the two Canadian\r\nprovinces, and to administer them in accordance with this doctrine of\r\nmodified autonomy.  The choice of the government seemed both wise and\r\nfoolish.  Poulett Thomson had had an admirable training for the work.\r\nIn a colony where trade and commerce were almost everything, he brought\r\nnot Durham's aristocratic detachment but a real knowledge of commerce,\r\nsince his was a great mercantile family.  In Parliament, he had become\r\na specialist in the financial and economic issues, which had already\r\ndisplaced the diplomatic or purely political questions of the last\r\ngeneration.  {77} His speeches on the revision of taxes, the corn laws,\r\nand British foreign trade, proved that, in a utilitarian age, he knew\r\nthe science of utilities and had freed himself from bureaucratic red\r\ntape.  His parliamentary career too had taught him the secret of the\r\nmanagement of assemblies, and Canada would under him be spared the\r\nfriction which the rigid attitude of soldiers, trained in the school of\r\nWellington, had been causing throughout the British colonies for many\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, many who doubted whether the man had a character\r\nand will powerful enough to dominate the turbulent forces of Canadian\r\npolitics.  Physically he was far from strong, and almost the first\r\ncomment made by Canadians on him was that their new governor-general\r\ncame to them a valetudinarian.  There seemed to be other and more\r\nserious elements of weakness.  Charles Greville spoke of him with just\r\na tinge of good-natured contempt as \"very good humoured, pleasing and\r\nintelligent, but the greatest coxcomb I ever saw, and the vainest dog,\r\nthough his vanity is not offensive or arrogant\";[6] and a writer in the\r\n_Colonial Gazette_, whose words reached Canada {78} almost on the day\r\nwhen the new governor arrived, warned Canadians of the imbecility of\r\ncharacter which the world attributed to him.  \"While therefore,\" the\r\narticle continues, \"we repeat our full conviction that Mr. Thomson is\r\ngone to Canada with the opinions and objects which we have here\r\nenumerated, let it be distinctly understood that we have little hope of\r\nseeing them realised, except through the united and steadfast\r\ndetermination of the Colonists to make use of him as an instrument for\r\naccomplishing their own ends.\"[7]  With such an introduction one of the\r\nmost strongly marked personalities ever concerned with government in\r\nCanada entered on his work.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem in face of these disparaging comments, the new\r\ngovernor-general had already determined to make the assertion of his\r\nauthority the fundamental thing in his policy, although with him\r\nauthority always wore the velvet glove over the iron hand.  In Lower\r\nCanada the suspension of the constitution had already placed\r\ndictatorial powers in his hand; but, even in the Upper Province, he\r\nseemed to have expected that diplomacy would have to be supported by\r\nauthority to compel it to come into {79} the Union; and he had no\r\nintention of leaving the supremacy over all British North America,\r\nwhich had been conferred on him by his title, to lie unused.  The two\r\nstrenuous years in which he remade Canada fall into natural\r\ndivisions--the brief episode in Lower Canada of the first month after\r\nhis arrival; his negotiations with Upper Canada, from November, 1839,\r\nto February, 1840; the interregnum of 1840 which preceded the actual\r\nproclamation of Union, during which he returned to Montreal, visited\r\nthe Maritime Provinces, and toured through the Upper Province; and the\r\ndecisive months, from February till September 19th, 1841, from which in\r\nsome sort modern Canada took its beginnings.\r\n\r\nThe first month of his governorship, in which he settled the fate of\r\nFrench Canada, is of greater importance than appears on the surface.\r\nThe problem of governing Canada was difficult, not simply because\r\nBritons in Canada demanded self-government, but because self-government\r\nmust be shared with French-Canadians.  That section of the community,\r\ndistinct as it was in traditions and political methods, might bring\r\nruin on the Colony either by asserting a supremacy odious to the\r\nAnglo-Saxon elements of the population, or by {80} resenting the\r\nefforts of the British to assimilate or dominate them.  When Poulett\r\nThomson landed, on October 19th, 1839, at Quebec, he was brought at\r\nonce face to face with the relation between French nationalism and the\r\nconstitutional resettlement of Canada.\r\n\r\nDurham had had no doubt about the true solution.  It was to confer free\r\ninstitutions on the colony, and to trust to the natural energy and\r\nincrease of the Anglo-Saxon element to swamp French _nationalité_.  \"I\r\nhave little doubt,\" he said, \"that the French, when once placed, by the\r\nlegitimate course of events and the working of natural causes, in a\r\nminority, would abandon their vain hopes of nationality.\"[8]  It was in\r\nthis spirit that his successor endeavoured to govern the French section\r\nin Canada.  Being both rationalist and utilitarian, like others of his\r\nschool he minimized the strength of an irrational fact like racial\r\npride, and, almost from the first he discounted the force of French\r\nopposition, while he let it, consciously or unconsciously, influence\r\nhis behaviour towards his French subjects.  \"If it were possible,\" he\r\nwrote in November, 1839, \"the best thing for Lower Canada would be a\r\ndespotism for ten years {81} more; for, in truth, the people are not\r\nyet fit for the higher class of self-government, scarcely indeed, at\r\npresent, for any description of it.\"[9]  A few months later, his\r\nlanguage had become even stronger:--\"I have been back three weeks, and\r\nhave set to work in earnest in this province.  It is a bad prospect,\r\nhowever, and presents a lamentable contrast to Upper Canada.  There\r\ngreat excitement existed; the people were quarrelling for realities,\r\nfor political opinions and with a view to ulterior measures.  Here\r\nthere is no such thing as a political opinion.  No man looks to a\r\npractical measure of improvement.  Talk to any one upon education, or\r\npublic works, or better laws, let him be English or French, you might\r\nas well talk Greek to him.  Not a man cares for a single practical\r\nmeasure--the only end, one would suppose, of a better form of\r\ngovernment.  They have only one feeling--a hatred of race.\"[10]\r\n\r\nBut at the outset his task was simple.  His powers in Lower Canada, as\r\nhe confessed on his first arrival, were of an extraordinary nature; and\r\nindeed it lay with him, and his Special Council, to settle the fate of\r\nthe province.  Pushing on {82} from Quebec to Montreal, he lost no time\r\nin calling a meeting of the Special Council, whose members, eighteen in\r\nnumber, he purposely left unchanged from the regime of his predecessor\r\nOn November 13th and 14th, after discussions in which the minority\r\nnever exceeded three, that body accepted Union with the Upper Province\r\nin six propositions, affirming the principle of union, agreeing to the\r\nassimilation of the two provincial debts, and declaring it to be their\r\nopinion \"that the present temporary legislature should, as soon as\r\npracticable, be succeeded by a permanent legislature, in which the\r\npeople of these two provinces may be adequately represented, and their\r\nconstitutional rights exercised and maintained.\"[11]  Before he left\r\nMontreal, he assured the British ministry that the large majority of\r\nthose with whom he had spoken, English and French, in the Lower\r\nProvince were warm advocates of Union.[12]\r\n\r\nYet here lay his first mis judgment, and one of the most serious he\r\nmade.  It was true and obvious that the British inhabitants of Eastern\r\nCanada earnestly desired a union which would promote {83} their racial\r\ninterests; true also that a group of Frenchmen took the same point of\r\nview.  But the governor was guilty of a grave political error, when he\r\nignored the feeling generally prevalent among the French that Union\r\nmust be fought.  Colborne's judgment in 1839, that French aversion to\r\nUnion was growing less, seems to have been mistaken.[13]  The British\r\ngovernment, more especially in the person of Durham, had not disguised\r\ntheir intention--the destruction of French nationalism as it had\r\nhitherto existed.  They had taken, and were taking, the risk of\r\nconducting the experiment in the face of a grant of self-government to\r\nthe doomed community; and the first governor-general of union and\r\nconstitutionalism was now to find that French racial unity, combined\r\nwith self-government, was too strong even for his masterful will,\r\nalthough he had all the weight of Imperial authority behind him.  But,\r\nfor the time, Lower Canada had to be left to its council, and the\r\ncentre of interest changed to Toronto and Upper Canada.\r\n\r\nThere, although no racial troubles awaited him, the governor had to\r\npersuade a popular assembly before he could have his way; and there for\r\nthe {84} first time he was made aware of the perplexing cross-currents\r\nand side eddies, and confusion of public opinion, which existed\r\neverywhere in Canadian politics.  So doubtful was the main issue that\r\nhe debated with himself whether he should venture to meet the Assembly\r\nwithout a dissolution and election on the definite issue of the Union;\r\nbut the need for haste, and his natural inclination to take risks, and\r\nto trust to his powers of management, decided him to face the existing\r\nlocal parliament.  By the end of November he had arrived at Toronto,\r\nand the Assembly met on December 3rd.  Two plain but difficult tasks\r\nlay before him: to persuade both houses of Parliament to accept his\r\nscheme of Union, and to arrange, on some moderate basis, the whole\r\nClergy Reserve question.  To complicate these practical duties, the\r\nspeculative problem of responsible government, long keenly canvassed in\r\nToronto, and the peculiar conditions and methods of local politics, lay\r\nas dangerous obstacles in his path.  The manners and methods of the\r\npoliticians of Upper Canada drew him even in his despatches into vivid\r\ncriticism.  After a month's observation, he sent Russell a long and\r\nvery able description of the prevailing disorders.  In spite of a\r\ngeneral loyalty the people {85} had been fretted into vexations and\r\npetty divisions, and for the most part felt deep-rooted animosity\r\ntowards the executive authorities.  Indeed, apart from the party bias\r\nof the government, its inefficiency and uncertainty had destroyed all\r\npublic confidence in it.  Under the executive government, the authority\r\nof the legislative council had been exercised by a very few\r\nindividuals, representing a mere clique in the capital, frequently\r\nopposed both to the government and to the Assembly, and considered by\r\nthe people hostile to their interests.  In the lower chamber, the loss\r\nof public influence by the ministry had introduced absolute legislative\r\nchaos, and even the control over expenditure, and the examination of\r\naccounts, were of the loosest and most irregular character.[14]  In a\r\nprivate letter he allowed himself a freedom of expression which renders\r\nhis description the _locus classicus_ for political conditions before\r\nthe Union:--\"The state of things here is far worse than I had expected.\r\nThe country is split into factions animated with the most deadly hatred\r\nto each other.  The people have got into the way of talking so much of\r\n_separation_, {86} that they begin to believe in it.  The\r\nConstitutional party is as bad or worse than the other, in spite of all\r\ntheir professions of loyalty.  The finances are more deranged than we\r\nbelieved even in England.  The deficit, £75,000 a year, more than equal\r\nto the income.  All public works suspended.  Emigration going on fast\r\n_from_ the province.  Every man's property worth only half what it was.\r\nWhen I look to the state of government, and to the departmental\r\nadministration of the province, instead of being surprised at the\r\ncondition in which I find it, I am only astonished it has been endured\r\nso long.  I know that, much as I dislike Yankee institutions and rule,\r\nI would not have fought against them, which thousands of these poor\r\nfellows, whom the Compact call rebels, did, if it were only to keep up\r\nsuch a Government as they got....  Then the Assembly is such a House!\r\nSplit into half a dozen parties.  The Government having _none--and no\r\none man_ to depend on!  Think of a house in which half the members hold\r\nplaces, yet in which the Government does not command a single vote; in\r\nwhich the place-men generally vote against the Executive; and where\r\nthere is no one to defend the Government when attacked, or {87} to\r\nstate the opinion and views of the Governor.\"[15]\r\n\r\nWith the eye of a political strategist, Poulett Thomson prepared his\r\nalternative system, a curious kind of despotism, based, however, simply\r\non his own powers of influencing opinion in the House.  It was plain to\r\nhim that the previous governments had wantonly neglected public\r\nopinion.[16]  It was also plain that the populace had regarded these\r\ngovernments as consisting not of the governor with his ministers under\r\nhim, but of the Family Compact clique in place of the governor.[17]\r\nThe system which he proposed to substitute expressed very fully his\r\nworking theory.  Responsible government in the sweeping sense of that\r\nterm employed by the reforming party he resisted, holding that, whether\r\nagainst his ministers, or the electors, he must be personally\r\nresponsible for all his administrative acts.  At the same time he\r\nassured parliament that \"he had received her Majesty's commands to\r\nadminister the government of these provinces in accordance with the\r\nwell-understood wishes and interests of the people, and to pay to their\r\nfeelings, {88} as expressed through their representatives, the\r\ndeference that is justly due to them.\"[18]  To secure this end, he\r\ncalled public attention to the despatch from Russell, definitely\r\nannouncing the change of tenure of all save judicial and purely\r\nministerial places, thereby making it clear that no man would be\r\nretained in office longer than he seemed acceptable to the governor and\r\nthe community.  Then he set to work to build up, out of moderate men\r\ndrawn from all groups, a party of compromise and good sense to support\r\nhim and his ministry; and finally, he claimed for himself the central\r\nauthority without any modifying conditions.  Concerning the ultimate\r\nseat of that authority he never hesitated.  Whatever power he had came\r\nfrom the Home Ministry as representing the Crown, and to them alone he\r\nacknowledged responsibility.  For the rest, he had to carry on the\r\nQueen's government; that is, to govern Canada so that peace and\r\nprosperity might remain unshaken; and as a first condition he had to\r\ndefer to the wishes of the people.  But it cannot be too strongly\r\nre-asserted that he refused to surrender one iota of his\r\nresponsibility, and that the ideal which he set for himself was a\r\ncombination of governor and prime-minister.  The efficiency {89} of his\r\nsystem was to depend on the honestly benevolent intentions which the\r\ngovernor-general cherished towards the people, and on the fidelity of\r\nboth the ministry and the parliamentary majority established and\r\nsecured through belief in those intentions.\r\n\r\nThe new system met with an astounding success.  The scheme of Union was\r\nlaid before both Houses.  On the thirteenth of December the Council,\r\nwhich had hitherto been the chief obstacle, approved of the scheme by\r\nfourteen votes to eight, the minority consisting of Toronto 'die-hards'\r\nwith the Bishop, recalcitrant as usual, at their head.  Ten days later,\r\nthe governor-general was able to assure Russell that the Lower House\r\nhad, after some strenuous debates and divisions, assented also; the\r\nonly change from his own outline being an amendment that \"such part of\r\nthe civil list as did not relate to the salaries of the judges, and the\r\ngovernor, and the administration of justice, which are made permanent,\r\nshould be granted for the lifetime of the Queen, or for a period of not\r\nless than ten years.\"[19]  On one point, not without its influence in\r\nembittering opinion among the French, {90} Parliament and Governor were\r\nagreed, that while the debates in the Union parliament might be\r\nconducted in either English or French, in the publication of all\r\nrecords of the Legislature the English language only should be\r\nadopted.[20]\r\n\r\nSwept on by this great initial success, Poulett Thomson determined if\r\npossible to settle the Clergy Reserve trouble out of hand.  As has been\r\nshown above, this ecclesiastical difficulty affected the whole life of\r\nthe community; and its settlement would mean peace, such as Upper\r\nCanada had not known for a generation.  The pacificator, however, had\r\nto face two groups of irreconcilables, the Bishop of Toronto with his\r\nextremist following, and the secularizing party resolute to have done\r\nwith any form of subsidy to religion.  As he himself confessed, he had\r\nlittle hope of succeeding in the Assembly, but he trusted to his new\r\npopularity, then at its spring tide, and he won.  Before the end of\r\nJanuary the question had been settled on a compromise, by a majority of\r\n28 to 20 in the Assembly, and of 14 to 4 in the Council.  It was even\r\nmore satisfactory to know that out of 22 members of Assembly who were\r\ncommunicants of the Church of England, only 8 {91} voted in favour of\r\nthe _status quo_.  There was but one set-back.  Legal opinion in\r\nEngland decided that the local assembly had not powers to change the\r\noriginal act of 1791; and in the Imperial legislation which this check\r\nmade necessary, other influences crept in, and the governor-general\r\nbitterly complained that the monstrous proportion allotted to the\r\nChurch of England, and the miserable proportion set apart for other\r\nchurches, rendered the Act only less an evil than if the question had\r\nbeen left unsettled.[21]  Still, the settlement retained existing\r\nreserves for religious purposes, ended the creation of fresh reserves,\r\ndivided past sales of land between the Churches of England and of\r\nScotland, and arranged for the distribution of the proceeds of future\r\nsales roughly in proportion to the numbers and importance of all the\r\nchurches in Canada.  It was not an ideal arrangement, but quiet men\r\nwere anxious to clear the obstacle from the way, and through such men\r\nPoulett Thomson worked his will.  It is the most striking testimony to\r\nthe governor's power of management that, as a politician stated in\r\n1846, three-quarters of the people believed the arrangement unjust and\r\npartial, and acquiesced only because their political head desired it.\r\nBut {92} the end was not yet, and the uneasy ambition of the Bishop of\r\nToronto was in a few years to bring on his head just retribution for\r\nthe strife his policy continued to create.  Nothing now remained but to\r\nclose this, the last parliament of Upper Canada under the old regime,\r\nand the governor, who never suffered from lack of self-appreciative\r\noptimism, wrote home in triumph: \"Never was such unanimity.  When the\r\nspeaker read my speech in the Commons, after the prorogation, they gave\r\nme three cheers, in which even the ultras joined.\"[22]  It was perhaps\r\nthe last remnant of this pardonable exultation which swept him over the\r\n360 miles between Toronto and Montreal in thirty-six hours, breaking\r\nall records for long-distance sleighing in the province.\r\n\r\nThe primary duty of the governor had now been accomplished, for he had\r\npersuaded both local governments to accept an Imperial Act of Union,\r\nand it might seem natural to pass over the intervening months, until\r\nUnion had been officially proclaimed, and the first Union parliament\r\nhad been elected and had met.  But the _interregnum_ from February,\r\n1840, to February, 1841, must not be ignored.  In these twelve short\r\nmonths he turned {93} once again to the problem of Lower Canada,\r\nhurried on a short visit to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to settle\r\nconstitutional difficulties there, returned in a kind of triumphal\r\nprocession through the English-speaking district of Lower Canada known\r\nas the Eastern Townships,[23] and spent the autumn in a tour through\r\nthe Western part of the newly united colony.  It was only fitting that\r\na grateful Queen and Ministry should bestow on him a peerage;\r\nhenceforward he must appear as Baron Sydenham of Sydenham and Toronto.\r\n\r\nBut apart from these mere physical activities, he was preparing for the\r\nculmination of his work in the new parliament.  It must be remembered\r\nnot only that he distrusted the intelligence and initiative of colonial\r\nministers too much to dream of giving place to them, but that his\r\ntheory of his own position--the benevolent despot, secured in his\r\nsupremacy through popular management--forced on him an elaborate\r\nprogramme of useful administration.  He must face the new Parliament\r\nwith a good record, and definite promises.  The failure of the home\r\nministry to include the local government clauses, which formed a\r\nfundamental {94} part of the Union Bill, made such efforts even more\r\nnecessary than before.  It had been plain to Durham and Charles Buller,\r\nas well as to Sydenham, that, if an Act of Union were to pass, it could\r\nonly be made operative by joining to it an entirely new system of local\r\ngovernment.  Accordingly, when opposition forced Russell to omit the\r\nessential clauses from his Act of Union, Sydenham penned one of his\r\nmost vigorous despatches in reply.  \"Owing to this (rejection), duties\r\nthe most unfit to be discharged by the general legislature are thrown\r\nupon it; powers equally dangerous to the subject and to the Crown are\r\nassumed by the Assembly.  The people receive no training in those\r\nhabits of self-government which are indispensable to enable them\r\nrightly to exercise the power of choosing representatives in\r\nparliament.  No field is open for the gratification of ambition in a\r\nnarrow circle, and no opportunity given for testing the talents or\r\nintegrity of those who are candidates for popular favour.  The people\r\nacquire no habits of self-dependence for the attainment of their own\r\nlocal objects.  Whatever uneasiness they may feel--whatever little\r\nimprovement in their respective neighbourhoods may appear to be\r\nneglected, afford grounds for complaint against the executive.  All\r\n{95} is charged upon the Government, and a host of discontented spirits\r\nare ever ready to excite these feelings.  On the other hand, whilst the\r\nGovernment is thus brought directly in contact with the people, it has\r\nneither any officer in its own confidence, in the different parts of\r\nthese extended provinces, from whom it can seek information, nor is\r\nthere any recognized body, enjoying the public confidence, with whom it\r\ncan communicate, either to determine what are the real wants and wishes\r\nof the locality, or through whom it may afford explanation.\"[24]\r\n\r\nNothing could be done to remedy the evil in Upper Canada, until the new\r\nparliament had met, but the temporary dictatorship still remained in\r\nFrench Canada, and at once Sydenham set to work to create all that he\r\nwanted there, recognizing shrewdly that what had been granted in the\r\nLower Province to the French must prove a powerful argument for a\r\nsimilar grant to Upper Canada, when the time should come for action.\r\nAbout the same time, he established by ordinance a popular system of\r\nregistry offices, to simplify the difficulties introduced into land\r\ntransfers by the French law--\"all {96} the old French law of before the\r\nRevolution, _Hypothèques tacites et occultes_, Dowers' and Minors'\r\nrights, _Actes par devant notaires_, and all the horrible processes by\r\nwhich the unsuspecting are sure to be deluded, and the most wary are\r\noften taken in.\"[25]\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, although his love of good government drove him to\r\namend conditions among the French, Sydenham's relations with that\r\npeople seem to have grown steadily worse.  He had made advances to the\r\nforemost French politician, La Fontaine, offering him the\r\nsolicitor-generalship of Lower Canada; but La Fontaine, who never had\r\nany enthusiasm for British Whig statesmanship,[26] regarded the offer\r\nas a bribe to draw him away from his countrymen and their national\r\nideal, and declined it, thereby increasing the tension.  Thus, as the\r\ntime for the election drew near, the French were still further\r\nhardening their hearts against the governor-general of United Canada,\r\nand Sydenham, his patience now exhausted, could but exclaim in baffled\r\nanger, \"As for the French, nothing but time will do anything with them.\r\nThey hate British rule--British connection--improvements of {97} all\r\nkinds, whether in their laws or their roads; so they will sulk, and\r\nwill try, that is, their leaders, to do all the mischief they can.\"[27]\r\n\r\nMeantime he had prepared two other politic strokes before he called\r\nParliament: the regulation of immigration, and a project for raising a\r\nBritish loan in aid of Canadian public works.  Immigration, more\r\nespecially now that the current had set once more towards Canada, was\r\none of the essential facts in the life of the colony; and yet the evils\r\nattendant on it were still as obvious as the gains.  Most of the\r\ndefects so vividly portrayed by Durham and his commissioners still\r\npersisted--unsuitable immigrants, over-crowded ships, disease which\r\nspread from ship to land and overcrowded the local hospitals, wretched\r\nand poverty-stricken masses lingering impotently at Quebec, and a\r\nstraggling line of westbound settlers, who obtained work and land with\r\ndifficulty and after many sorrows.[28]  Sydenham had none of Gibbon\r\nWakefield's doctrinaire enthusiasm on the subject; and, as he said, the\r\ninducements, to parishes and landlords to send out their surplus\r\npopulation were already {98} sufficiently strong.  But much could and\r\nmust be done by way of remedy.  It was his plan to regulate more\r\nstrictly the conditions on board emigrant ships, and to humanize the\r\nprocess of travelling.  Government agents must safeguard the rights of\r\nignorant settlers; relief, medical and otherwise, should be in\r\nreadiness for the destitute and afflicted when they arrived; sales of\r\nland were to be simplified and made easier; and a system of public\r\nworks might enable the local authorities to solve two problems at one\r\ntime, by giving the poorer settler steady employment, and by completing\r\nthe great tasks, only half performed in days when money and labour\r\nalike were wanting.[29]  The final achievement of these objects\r\nSydenham reserved until he should meet parliament, but he had laid his\r\nplans, and had primed the home authorities with facts long before that\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nIn the same way he had foreseen the need of Canada for Imperial\r\nassistance, both in her public works, and in her finance.  Assistance\r\nin the former of these matters was peculiarly important.  Colonists,\r\nmore especially in the Upper Province, had undertaken the development\r\nof Canadian natural resources, but poverty had called a halt {99}\r\nbefore the development was complete, or, by preventing necessary\r\nadditions and improvements, had rendered useless what had already been\r\ndone.  Conspicuous among such imperfect works were the canals; and\r\nSydenham realized the strange dilemma into which provincial enterprise\r\nseemed doomed to run.  The province, he told Russell, was sinking under\r\nthe weight of engagements which it could only meet by fresh outlay,\r\nwhilst that outlay the condition of its credit preventing it from\r\nmaking.[30]  He was therefore prepared to come before the United\r\nParliament with a proposal, backed by the British Ministry, for a great\r\nloan of £1,500,000 to be negotiated by the home government, and to be\r\nutilized, partly in redeeming the credit of the province, and partly in\r\ncompleting its public works.  \"It will therefore be absolutely\r\nnecessary that Her Majesty's government should enable the governor of\r\nthe province of Canada to afford this relief when the Union is\r\ncompleted, and the financial statement takes place; and I know of no\r\nbetter means than those originally proposed--of guaranteeing a loan\r\nwhich would remove a considerable charge arising from the high rate of\r\ninterest payable by the province on the debt already contracted, or\r\n{100} which it would have to pay for raising fresh loans which may be\r\nrequired hereafter for great local improvements.\"[31]\r\n\r\nThere remained now the last and greatest of Sydenham's labours before\r\nhis stewardship could be honourably accounted for and surrendered, the\r\nsummoning, meeting, and managing, of a parliament representative of\r\nthat Canada, English and French, which he had restored and irritated.\r\nHis reputation must depend the more on this political adventure,\r\nbecause he had already determined that 1841 should be his last year in\r\nCanada--he would not stay, he said, though they made him Duke of Canada\r\nand Prince of Regiopolis.  And indeed the Parliament of 1841, in all\r\nits circumstances, still remains one of the salient points in modern\r\nCanadian history.\r\n\r\nThe Union came into force on the tenth of February, but long before\r\nthat time all the diverse political interests in Canada had organized\r\nthemselves for the fray.  Sydenham himself naturally occupied the\r\nforemost place.  He was acting now, not merely as governor-general, but\r\nas the prime minister of a new cabinet, and as a party manager, {101}\r\nwhose main duty it was to secure parliamentary support for his men and\r\nhis measures by the maintenance of a sound central group.  By the\r\nbeginning of the year he thought he had evidence for believing that, in\r\nUpper Canada, a great majority of the members would be men who had at\r\nheart the welfare of the province, and the British connection, and who\r\ndesired to make the Act of Union operate to the advantage of the\r\ncountry.[32]  But even in Upper Canada there were doubtful elements.\r\nThe Family Compact men, few as they might be in number, were unlikely\r\nto leave their enemy, the governor-general, in peace; nor were all the\r\nReformers prepared to acquiesce in Sydenham's very restrained and\r\nlimited interpretation of responsible government.  Late in 1840, and\r\nearly in 1841, the Upper Canadian progressives had organized their\r\nstrength; and additional significance was given to their action by\r\ntheir communications with Lower Canada.[33]  There, indeed, was the\r\ncrux of the experiment.  The French Canadians, already organized in\r\nsullen opposition, had just received what they counted a fresh insult.\r\nBut Sydenham may be allowed to {102} explain his own action.  \"There\r\nwere,\" he wrote to Russell in March, 1841, \"attached to the cities,\r\nboth of Montreal and Quebec, very extensive suburbs, inhabited\r\ngenerally by a poor population, unconnected with the mercantile\r\ninterests to which these cities owe their importance.  Had these cities\r\nbeen brought within the electoral limits, the number of their\r\npopulation would have enabled them to return one, if not both, of the\r\nmembers for each city.  But such a result would have been directly at\r\nvariance with the grounds on which increased representation was given\r\nby Parliament to these cities.  On referring to the discussions which\r\ntook place in both houses when the Union Bill was before them, I find\r\nthat members on all sides laid great stress on the necessity of\r\nsecuring ample representation to the mercantile interests of Canada....\r\nFeeling myself, therefore, bound in duty to carry out the views of the\r\nBritish parliament in this matter, _I was compelled in fixing the\r\nlimits of Quebec and Montreal to transfer to the county a large portion\r\nof the suburbs of each_.\"[34]  Whatever Sydenham's intentions may have\r\nbeen, the actual result of his action was to secure for his party four\r\nseats in the very heart of the enemy's country; {103} and the French\r\nCanadians, naturally embittered, resented the governor's action as a\r\npiece of gerrymandering, which had practically disfranchised many\r\nFrench voters.  Already, in 1840, under the active leadership of\r\nNeilson of Quebec, a British supporter of French claims, an anti-union\r\nmovement had been started.[35]  In July of the same year La Fontaine\r\nvisited Toronto, to canvass, said scandal, for the speaker's chair in\r\nthe united assembly; and in any case he was able to assure his\r\ncompatriots that they had sympathizers among the British in the West.\r\nThe Tory paper in Sydenham's new capital, Kingston, in a review and\r\nforecast of the situation, settled on this Anglo-French co-operation as\r\none of the serious possibilities of the future;[36] and Sydenham as he\r\nwatched developments in the Lower Province, found himself growing\r\nunwontedly pessimistic.  \"In Lower Canada,\" he wrote, \"the elections\r\nwill be bad.  The French Canadians have forgotten nothing and learnt\r\nnothing by the Rebellion, and the suspension of the constitution, and\r\nare more unfit for representative government {104} than they were in\r\n1791.  In most of the French counties, members, actuated by the old\r\nspirit of the Assembly, and without any principle except that of\r\ninveterate hostility to British rule and British connection, will be\r\nreturned without a possibility of opposition.\"[37]\r\n\r\nThe elections began on the 8th of March, and the date on which\r\nparliament was to meet was postponed, first from April 8th to May 26th,\r\nand then, in consequence of the continued lateness of the season,[38]\r\nfrom May 26th to June 14th.  The result of the elections, known early\r\nin April, gave matter for serious thought to many, Sydenham himself not\r\nexcluded.  Absolute precision is difficult, but Sydenham's biographer\r\nhas tabulated the groups as follows:\r\n\r\n  Government Members - - - -  24\r\n  French Members - - - - - -  20\r\n  Moderate Reformers - - - -  20\r\n  Ultra Reformers  - - - - -   5\r\n  Compact Party  - - - - - -   7\r\n  Doubtful - - - - - - - - -   6\r\n  Special Return - - - - - -   1\r\n  Double Return  - - - - - -   1\r\n                              --\r\n                              84[39]\r\n\r\n{105}\r\n\r\nIn the confusion of groups, Sydenham still trusted to the centre--a\r\nparty almost precisely similar to that which in 1867 was called\r\nLiberal-Conservative.  This centre he hoped to create out of moderate\r\nConservatives who had enlarged their earlier views, and moderate\r\nReformers who anxiously desired to see Sydenham's proposed improvements\r\ncarried out.[40]  A shrewd observer, himself a member, and\r\nappreciatively critical of Sydenham's work, counted at least five\r\nparties in the new parliament.  Three of these groups came from Upper\r\nCanada--the Conservatives under Sir Allan MacNab; the Ministerialists,\r\nthat is the Reformers and moderate Conservatives, under the\r\nAttorney-General Draper, and the Secretary Harrison, and the\r\nultra-reformers who looked to Robert Baldwin for guidance.  From Lower\r\nCanada came the French nationalists, with some British supporters,\r\nunder Morin, Neilson, and Aylwin, and the defenders of the Union\r\npolicy, chiefly British, but with a few conservative French allies.\r\n\"The division lists of the session 1841,\" writes the same observer,\r\n\"cannot fail to strike anyone acquainted with the state of parties, as\r\nextraordinary.  Mr. Baldwin on several occasions voted with\r\nconsiderable {106} majorities in opposition to the Government, while as\r\nfrequently he was in insignificant minorities.  There was a decided\r\ntendency towards a coalition with the Reformers of French origin, on\r\nthe part of Sir Allan MacNab and the Upper Canada Conservatives.  The\r\nMinisterial strength lay in the support which it received from the\r\nBritish party of Lower Canada, and from the majority of the Upper\r\nCanada Reformers.\"[41]  Well might Sydenham speak of the delusive\r\nnature of the party nicknames borrowed by his legislators from England.\r\n\r\nWhatever were the characteristic faults of the parliament in 1841,\r\nsloth was not one of them.  All through the summer it worked with\r\nfeverish energy.  Writing to his brother at the end of August, Sydenham\r\nboasted--\"The five great works I aimed at have been got through--the\r\nestablishment of a board of works with ample powers; the admission of\r\naliens; a new system of county courts; the regulation of the public\r\nlands ceded by the Crown under the Union Act; and lastly the District\r\nCouncil Bill.  I think you will admit this to be pretty good work for\r\none session, especially when superadded to half a dozen minor measures,\r\nas well {107} as the fact of having set up a government, brought\r\ntogether two sets of people, who hated each other cordially, and\r\nsilenced all the threatened attacks upon the Union, which were expected\r\nto be so formidable....  What do you think of this, you miserable\r\npeople in England, who spend two years upon a single measure?\"[42]\r\n\r\nBut the chief significance of the session lies in the persistent\r\nwarfare waged between Sydenham and the advocates of a more extended\r\nsystem of autonomy.  The result, as will be shewn, was indecisive, but,\r\nunder the circumstances a drawn battle was equivalent to defeat for the\r\ngovernor-general.\r\n\r\nSydenham had never before flung himself so completely into the fight.\r\n\"I actually breathe, eat, drink, and sleep nothing but government and\r\npolitics,\" was his own description of life in Kingston.  He had\r\naccomplished with little resistance from others all that his opening\r\nspeech had promised.  His ministry owned him as their actively\r\ndirecting head.  His power of managing individuals in spite of\r\nthemselves passed into a jest.  Playing with men's vanity, tampering\r\nwith their interests, their passions and their prejudices, placing\r\nhimself in a position of familiarity with those from whom {108} he\r\nmight at once obtain assistance and information--such, according to an\r\neccentric writer of the day, were the secrets of Sydenham's\r\nsuccess.[43]  Few men ever played the part of benevolent despot more\r\nadmirably, and his achievements were the more creditable because he\r\ncould count on no allegiance except that which he induced by his\r\npersuasive arts, and by the proofs he had given of a sincere desire to\r\npromote Canadian prosperity.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, throughout the summer months, there occurred a series of\r\nsharp encounters with a half-organized party of reform; and the end of\r\nthe session, while it saw Sydenham successful, saw also his adversaries\r\nas eager as ever, and much more learned than they had been in the ways\r\nof political opposition and agitation.  The opposition leaders massed\r\ntheir whole strength on one fundamental point--the claim to possess as\r\nfully as their fellow-citizens in Great Britain did, the cabinet and\r\nparty system of government.  In other words, if any group, or coalition\r\nof groups, should succeed in establishing an ascendency in the popular\r\nassembly, that ascendency must receive acknowledgment by the creation\r\nof a cabinet, and the appointment of {109} a prime minister, approved\r\nby the parliamentary majority and responsible to them; and Sydenham's\r\ningenious device of an eclectic ministry responsible to him alone was\r\ndenounced as unconstitutional.  The first encounter came, two days\r\nbefore the session started, and Robert Baldwin of Toronto was the\r\nleader of the revolt.  In February, 1840, Sydenham had invited Robert\r\nBaldwin to be his Solicitor-General in the Upper Province.  Baldwin,\r\nalthough his powers were not those of a politician of the first rank,\r\nwas perhaps the soundest constitutionalist in Western Canada.  He had\r\nbeen from the first a reformer, but he had never encouraged the wild\r\nideas of the rebels of 1837.  Sir F. B. Head had called him to his\r\ncouncils in 1836, as a man \"highly respected for his moral character,\r\nmoderate in his politics and possessing the esteem and confidence of\r\nall parties,\"[44] and only Head's impracticability had driven him from\r\npublic service.  There is not a letter or official note from his pen,\r\nwhich does not bear the stamp of unusual conscientiousness, and a very\r\nearnest desire to serve his country.  So little was he a self-seeker,\r\nthat he earned the lasting ill-will of his eldest son by passing a bill\r\nabolishing primogeniture, and thus {110} ending any hopes that existed\r\nof founding a great colonial family.  The Earl of Elgin, who saw much\r\nof him after 1847, regarded him not merely as a great public servant,\r\nbut as one who was worth \"two regiments to the British connection,\" and\r\nperhaps the most truly conservative statesman in the province.[45]  In\r\nhis quiet, determined way, he had made up his mind that responsible\r\ngovernment, in the sense condemned by both Sydenham and Russell, must\r\nbe secured for Canada, and Sydenham's benevolent plans did not disguise\r\nfrom him the insidious attempt to limit what he counted the legitimate\r\nconstitutional liberty of the colony.  It cannot justly be objected\r\nthat his acceptance of office misled the governor-general, either in\r\n1840 or in 1841.  \"I distinctly avow,\" he wrote publicly in 1840,\r\n\"that, in accepting office, I consider myself to have given a public\r\npledge that I have a reasonably well-grounded confidence that the\r\ngovernment of my country is to be carried on in accordance with the\r\nprinciples of Responsible Government which I have ever held....  I have\r\nnot come into office by means of any coalition with the\r\nAttorney-General,[46] or with any others now in {111} the public\r\nservice, but have done so under the governor-general, and expressly\r\nfrom my confidence in him.\"[47]  In the same way, when Sydenham chose\r\nhim for the Solicitor-Generalship of Upper Canada in the Union\r\nMinistry, Baldwin, who had no belief in Sydenham's cabinet of all the\r\ntalents, wrote bluntly to say that he \"had an entire want of political\r\nconfidence in all of his colleagues except Mr. Dunn, Mr. Harrison, and\r\nMr. Daly.\"[48]  In view of his later action, his critics charged him\r\nwith error in thus accepting an office which placed him in an\r\nimpossible position; but Baldwin's ready answer was: \"The head of the\r\ngovernment, the heads of departments in both provinces, and the country\r\nitself, were in a position almost anomalous.  That of the head of the\r\ngovernment was one of great difficulty and embarrassment.  While he\r\n(Baldwin) felt bound to protect himself against misapprehensions as to\r\nhis views and opinions, he also felt bound to avoid, as far as\r\npossible, throwing any difficulties in the way of the governor-general.\r\nAt the time he was called to a seat in the Executive Council, he was\r\nalready one of those public servants, the political character {112}\r\nnewly applied to whose office made it necessary for them to hold seats\r\nin that Council.  Had he, on being called to take that seat, refused to\r\naccept it, he must of course have left office altogether, or have been\r\nopen to the imputation of objecting to an arrangement for the conduct\r\nof public affairs which had always met with his most decided\r\napprobation.\"[49]  At worst, the Solicitor-General can only be blamed\r\nfor letting his abnormally sensitive conscience lead him into political\r\ncasuistry, the logic of which might not appear so cogent to the\r\ngovernor as to himself, when the crisis should come.  How sensitive\r\nthat conscience was, may be gathered from the fact that his acceptance\r\nof office in 1841 was accompanied with an avowal of want of confidence,\r\nmade openly to those colleagues with whom he disagreed.  It was further\r\nillustrated when he made a difficulty with Sydenham over taking the\r\nOath of Supremacy, which, in a country, many of whose inhabitants were\r\nRoman Catholics protected in their religion by treaty rights, declared\r\nthat no foreign prince, person, prelate, state or potentate hath or\r\nought to have any jurisdiction, {113} power, superiority, pre-eminence\r\nof authority, ecclesiastical or spiritual within this realm.\"[50]\r\n\r\nThe crisis came, as Baldwin expected it to come, when parliament met.\r\nAlready, as has been seen, the French Canadians had organized their\r\nforces and formed the most compact group in the Assembly, while the\r\nlittle band of determined reformers from Upper Canada made up in\r\ndecision and principle what they lacked in numbers.  Hincks, who was\r\none of the latter group, says that, before parliament met, the two\r\nsections consulted together concerning the government, and although La\r\nFontaine had lost his election through a display of physical force on\r\nthe other side, Baldwin was able to lead the combined groups into\r\naction.  On June 12th, he wrote to Sydenham stating that the United\r\nReform Party represented the political views of the vast majority of\r\nCanadians, that four ministers--Sullivan, Ogden, Draper, and Day--were\r\nhostile to popular sympathies and ideals, and that he thought the\r\naccession of Lower Canada Reformers absolutely essential to a sound\r\npopular administration.  It was a perfectly consistent, if somewhat\r\nunhappily executed, attempt to secure {114} the absolute responsibility\r\nof the Executive Council to the representatives of the people; and a\r\nweek later, in the Assembly, when no longer in office, he defended his\r\naction.  He believed that when the election had determined of what\r\nmaterials the House of Assembly was to be composed, it then became his\r\nduty to inform the head of the government that the administration did\r\nnot possess the confidence of the House of Assembly, and to tender to\r\nthe representative of his sovereign the resignation of the office which\r\nhe held, having first, as he was bound to do, offered his advice to his\r\nExcellency that the administration of the country should be\r\nreconstructed.[51]\r\n\r\nIt was the directest possible challenge to Sydenham's system.\r\nBaldwin's claim was that, once the representatives of the people had\r\nmade known the people's will, it was the duty of the ministry to\r\nreflect that will in their programme and actions, or to resign.  As for\r\nthe governor-general, he must obviously adjust whatever theories he\r\nmight have, to a situation where colonial ministers were content to\r\nhold office only where they had the confidence of the people.\r\n\r\nThe action of the governor-general was {115} characteristically\r\nsummary.  His answer to Baldwin reproved him for a \"proposal in the\r\nhighest degree unconstitutional, as dictating to the crown who are the\r\nparticular individuals whom it should include in the ministry\";\r\nintimated the extreme displeasure of his Excellency, and assumed the\r\nletter to be equivalent to resignation.[52]  To the home government he\r\nspoke of the episode with anger and some contempt: \"Acting upon some\r\nprinciple of conduct which I can reconcile neither with honour nor\r\ncommon sense, he strove to bring about this union (between Upper and\r\nLower Canadian reformers), and at last, having as he thought effected\r\nit, coolly proposed to me, on the day before Parliament was to meet, to\r\nbreak up the Government altogether, dismiss several of his colleagues,\r\nand replace them by men whom I believe he had not known for 24\r\nhours--but who are most of them thoroughly well known in Lower Canada\r\nas the principal opponents of any measure for the improvement of the\r\nprovince.\"[53]\r\n\r\nThe crisis once passed, Sydenham hoped, and not without justification,\r\nthat Baldwin would carry few supporters over to the opposition, and\r\n{116} that the Assembly would settle quietly down to enact the measures\r\nso bountifully set out in the opening speech.  The first day of\r\nAssembly saw the party of responsible government make a smothered\r\neffort to state their views in the debate on the election of a speaker.\r\nOn June 18th, an elaborate debate, nominally on the address, really on\r\nthe fundamental point, found the attorney-general stating the case for\r\nthe government, and Baldwin and Hincks pushing the logic of responsible\r\ngovernment to its natural conclusion.  Baldwin once more grappled with\r\nthe problem of the responsibility of the members of council, and the\r\nadvice they should offer to the governor-general.  He admitted freely\r\nthat unless the representative of the sovereign should acquiesce in the\r\nmeasures so recommended, there would be no means by which that advice\r\ncould be made practically useful; but this consideration did not for a\r\nmoment relieve a member of the council from the fulfilment of an\r\nimperative duty.  If his advice were accepted, well and good; if not,\r\nhis course would be to tender his resignation.[54]\r\n\r\n{117}\r\n\r\nThe government came triumphantly out of the ordeal, and all amendments,\r\nwhether affecting the Union, or responsible government, were defeated\r\nby majorities, usually of two to one.  \"I have got the large majority\r\nof the House ready to support me upon any question that can arise,\"\r\nSydenham wrote at the end of June; \"and, what is better, thoroughly\r\nconvinced that their constituents, so far as the whole of Upper Canada\r\nand the British part of Lower Canada are concerned, will never forgive\r\nthem if they do not.\"[55]\r\n\r\nBut the enemy was not so easily routed.  There had been much violence\r\nat the recent elections; and, among others, La Fontaine had a most just\r\ncomplaint to make, for disorder, and, as he thought, government\r\ntrickery had ousted him from a safe seat at Terrebonne.  Unfortunately\r\nthe protests were lodged too late, and a furious struggle sprang up, as\r\nto whether the legal period should, in the cases under consideration,\r\nbe extended, or whether, as the government contended, an inquiry and\r\namendments affecting only the future should suffice.  It was ominous\r\nfor the cause of limited responsibility, that the government had to own\r\ndefeat in the Lower House, and saved itself only {118} by the veto of\r\nthe Legislative Council.  Nor was that the end.  A mosaic work of\r\nopposition, old Tories, French Canadians, British anti-unionists, and\r\nUpper Canada Reformers, was gradually formed, and at any moment some\r\nchance issue might lure over a few from the centre to wreck the\r\nadministration.  Most of the greater measures passed through the ordeal\r\nsafely, including a bill reforming the common schools and another\r\nestablishing a Board of Works.  The critical moment of the latter part\r\nof the session, however, came with the introduction of a bill to\r\nestablish District Councils in Upper Canada, to complete the work\r\nalready done in Lower Canada.  The forces in opposition rallied to the\r\nattack, Conservatives because the bill would increase the popular\r\nelement in government, Radicals because the fourth clause enacted that\r\nthe governor of the province might appoint, under the Great Seal of the\r\nprovince, fit and proper persons to hold during his pleasure the office\r\nof Warden of the various districts;[56] and, as Sydenham himself\r\nhinted, there were those who regretted the loss to members of Assembly\r\nof a great opportunity for jobbery.  One motion passed by the\r\nchairman's casting vote; {119} and nothing, in the governor-general's\r\njudgment, saved the bill but the circumstance of his having already\r\nestablished such councils in Lower Canada.[57]\r\n\r\nThere was one more attack in force before the session ended.  On\r\nSeptember 3rd, Baldwin, seconded by a French Canadian, moved \"that the\r\nmost important as well as the most undoubted of the political rights of\r\nthe people of the province, is that of having a provincial parliament\r\nfor the protection of their liberties, for the exercise of a\r\nconstitutional influence over the executive departments of the\r\ngovernment, and for legislation upon all matters, which do not on the\r\nground of absolute necessity constitutionally belong to the\r\njurisdiction of the Imperial parliament, as the paramount authority of\r\nthe Empire.\"[58]  The issue was stated moderately but quite directly,\r\nand there are critics of Sydenham who hold that his answer--for it was\r\nhis voice that spoke--surrendered the whole position.  That answer took\r\nthe form of resolutions, moved by the most moderate reformer in the\r\nAssembly, S. B. Harrison:\r\n\r\n(i) That the head of the provincial executive {120} government of the\r\nprovince, being within the limits of his government the representative\r\nof the Sovereign, is not constitutionally responsible to any other than\r\nthe authority of the Empire.\r\n\r\n(ii) That the representative of the Sovereign, for the proper conduct\r\nand efficient disposal of public business, is necessarily obliged to\r\nmake use of the advice and assistance of subordinate officers in the\r\nadministration of his government.\r\n\r\n(iii) That in order to preserve the harmony between the different\r\nbranches of the Provincial Parliament which is essential to the happy\r\nconduct of public affairs, the principal of such subordinate officers,\r\nadvisers of the representative of the Sovereign, and constituting as\r\nsuch the provincial administration under him ... ought always to be men\r\npossessed of the public confidence of the people, thus affording a\r\nguarantee that the well-understood wishes and interests of the people,\r\nwhich our gracious Sovereign has declared shall be the rule of the\r\nProvincial Government, will on all occasions be faithfully represented\r\nand advocated.\r\n\r\n(iv) That the house has the constitutional right of holding such\r\nadvisers politically responsible for every act of the Provincial\r\nGovernment of a local {121} character sanctioned by such government\r\nwhile such advisers continue in office.\"[59]\r\n\r\nOf Sydenham's own doctrine of colonial government the outlines are\r\nunmistakeable.  A governor-general existed, responsible for his actions\r\nsolely to the imperial authority.  Under that government the people had\r\nfull liberty to elect their representatives, through whom their desires\r\ncould be made known.  It was the duty of the governor-general to\r\nconsult, on every possible detail, the popular will.  Sydenham\r\ntherefore held it essential that the governor-general in Canada should\r\nbe one trained in the Imperial Parliament to interpret and to guide\r\npopular expression of opinion; and he believed that in such\r\nparliamentary diplomacy the governor-general would have to make many\r\nminor surrenders.  But he never recoiled from a position, which was\r\nalso that of Durham, that, as the proclamation of Union asserted, the\r\ngrant of local autonomy was subject to certain limitations, and that\r\nthese limitations no action of the Provincial Legislature could affect.\r\nNor did he admit that his own responsibility to the Crown could be\r\nmodified by the existence of a responsibility on the {122} part of his\r\nministers to the Canadian people.  Moreover, his own imperious temper\r\nand sense of superior enlightenment made him act in the very spirit of\r\nhis doctrine with a resolution which few imperial servants of his time\r\ncould have surpassed.  It may be then that the final resolutions, and\r\nespecially the last of them, were marked by a gentler mode of\r\nexpression than before, but they were actually a reaffirmation of\r\nSydenham's early views, and were quite consistent with the initial\r\ndespatch of the colonial secretary.\r\n\r\nThe end was now near.  Sydenham had already applied for and received\r\npermission, first to leave Canada, should his health require that step,\r\nand then, to resign.  He had delayed to act on this permission, until\r\nhe should see the end of the session, and the accomplishment of his\r\nambitions.  But, on September 4th, a fall from horseback inflicted\r\ninjuries which grew more complicated through his generally enfeebled\r\ncondition, and he died on Sunday, September 19th.  On the preceding\r\nday, one of the most useful and notable sessions in the history of the\r\nCanadian Parliament came to an end.\r\n\r\nBoth by his errors, and by his acts of statesmanship, Sydenham\r\ncontributed more than any other {123} man, except Elgin, to establish\r\nthat autonomy in Canada which his theories rejected.  Before\r\nself-government could flourish in the colony, there must be some solid\r\nmaterial progress, and two years of incessant legislation and\r\nadministrative innovation, all of it suggested by Sydenham, had turned\r\nthe tide of Canadian fortunes.  It was necessary, too, that some larger\r\nfield than a trivial provincial assembly with its local jobs should be\r\nprovided for the new adventure in self-government; and Sydenham not\r\nonly engineered a difficult Act of Union past all preliminary\r\nobstacles, but, of his own initiative, gave Canada the local\r\ninstitutions through which alone the country could grow into\r\ndisciplined self-dependence.\r\n\r\nBut even his errors aided Canadian development.  Acting for a\r\ngovernment in whose counsels there was no hesitation, Sydenham\r\nexpounded in word and practice a perfectly self-consistent theory of\r\ncolonial government.  It was he who, by the virility of his thought and\r\naction, forced those who demanded responsible government to test and\r\nthink over again their own position.  The criticism which Elgin passed\r\non him in 1847 is final: \"I never cease to marvel what study of human\r\nnature, or of history, led him to the conclusion {124} that it would be\r\npossible to concede to a pushing and enterprising people, unencumbered\r\nby an aristocracy, and dwelling in the immediate vicinity of the United\r\nStates, such constitutional privileges as were conferred on Canada at\r\nthe time of Union, and yet restrict in practice their powers of\r\nself-government as he proposed.\"[60]  Yet he had raised the question,\r\nfor both sides, to a higher level, and his adversaries owed something\r\nof their triumph, when it came, to the man who had taught them a more\r\nspacious view of politics.\r\n\r\nBut it may be urged that he roused the French, insulted them, excluded\r\nthem, and almost precipitated a new French rising.  Undoubtedly he was\r\nan enemy to French claims, but, at the time, most of these claims were\r\ninadmissible.  The French had brought the existing system of local\r\ngovernment to a standstill.  Few of those who took part in the\r\nRebellion had any reasonable or adequate conception of a reformed\r\nconstitution.  As a people they had set themselves to obstruct the\r\nstatesmen who came to assist them, and to oppose a Union which was\r\ndoubtless imperfect as an instrument of government, but which was a\r\nnecessary stage in the construction of a {125} better system.  Here\r\nagain Sydenham aimed at carrying out a perfectly clear and consistent\r\nprogramme, the political blending of the French with the British\r\ncolonists.  Unfortunately that programme was impossible.  It had been\r\nconstructed by men who did not understand the racial problem, and who,\r\neven if they had understood it, would not have accepted the modern\r\nsolution.  Yet French nationalism, between 1839 and 1841, had certain\r\nnegative lessons still to learn.  As, in Upper Canada, Robert Baldwin\r\ndiscovered from his opposition to the governor-general the methods and\r\nlimits of parliamentary opposition, so La Fontaine, the worthiest\r\nrepresentative of French Canada, began in these years to substitute\r\nconstitutional co-operation with the reformers of the West, for the old\r\nsullen negative nationalism which had failed so utterly in 1837, as the\r\nmost suitable means for maintaining the rights of his people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] I disregard Cathcart's tenure of office.  For all practical\r\npurposes it was merely that of an acting governor.\r\n\r\n[2] Instructions to the Right Hon. C.

He was a man of the Regency, and of Canning's set.  Since\r\n1814 he had occupied positions of considerable importance in the\r\ndiplomatic world, not because of transcendent parts, but because of his\r\nconnections.  He had been ambassador at Washington, St. Petersburg, and\r\nthe Hague; and in the United States, where, to the end, his friends\r\nremembered him with real affection, he had rendered service permanently\r\nbeneficial both to Britain and to America by negotiating the Rush-Bagot\r\ntreaty, which established the neutralization of the great lakes.  In\r\nEurope, he had been known to fame mainly as the recipient of George\r\nCanning's rhyming despatch; and for the rest, he allowed the great\r\nminister to make him, as he had made all {127} his other agents, a pawn\r\nin the game where he alone was player.  In his correspondence he stands\r\nout as an old-fashioned, worldly, cultured, and unbusiness-like\r\ndiplomatist, worthy perhaps of a satiric but kindly portraiture by\r\nThackeray--a genuine citizen of Vanity Fair.  Apart from his\r\ncorrespondence, his friendships, and his American achievements, he\r\nmight have passed through life, deserving nothing more than some few\r\nreferences in memoirs of the earlier nineteenth century.  But by one\r\nfreak of fortune he found himself transported to Canada in 1842, and,\r\nby another, he became one of the foremost figures in the history of\r\nCanadian constitutional development.  There have been few better\r\nexamples of the curious good-fortune which has attended on the growth\r\nof British greatness than the story of Bagot's short career in Canada.\r\nWhen a very eminent personage demanded from the existing government\r\nsome explanation of their selection of Bagot, Stanley, who was then\r\nSecretary of State for the Colonies, pointed, not to administrative\r\nqualifications, but to his diplomatic services in the United States.\r\nRelations with the American Republic do not here concern us, but it may\r\nbe remembered that the situation in 1841 and 1842, just before the\r\n{128} Ashburton Treaty, was full of peril; and Bagot was sent to Canada\r\nas a person not displeasing to the Americans, and a diplomatist of\r\nconciliatory temper.  But his work was to be concerned with domestic,\r\nnot international, diplomacy.\r\n\r\nThree factors must be carefully studied in the year of political\r\nturmoil which followed: the Imperial government, the Canadian political\r\ncommunity, and the new governor-general.\r\n\r\nDuring this and the following governor-generalship, the predominant\r\ninfluence at the Colonial Office was Lord Stanley, almost the most\r\ndistinguished of the younger statesmen of the day.  Peel's judicial and\r\nscientific mind usually controlled those of his subordinates; but even\r\nPeel found it hard to check the brilliant individualism of his colonial\r\nsecretary; and this most interesting of all the great failures in\r\nEnglish politics exercised an influence in Canadian affairs, such as\r\nnot even Lord John Russell attempted.  Judged from his colonial\r\ndespatches, Stanley seems to have found it very hard to understand that\r\nthere could be another side to any question on which he had made up his\r\nmind.  His party had consented to a modification of the old oligarchic\r\nrule in Canada; but they were intent upon limiting the scope of the\r\n{129} change, and upon conducting all their operations in a very\r\nconservative spirit.  Stanley's instructions to Bagot had been drawn up\r\nin no ungenerous fashion.  Bagot was to know no distinctions of\r\nnational origin or religious creed, and in so far as it might be\r\nconsistent with his duty to his Sovereign, he was to consult the wishes\r\nof the mass of the community.[1]  Their happiness it was his main duty\r\nto secure.  In ecclesiastical matters, Stanley, who had changed his\r\nparty rather than consent to weaken the Anglican Church in Ireland, was\r\nwilling to acknowledge \"that the habits and opinions of the people of\r\nCanada were, in the main, averse from the absolute predominance of any\r\nsingle church.\"[2]  But the theory inspiring the instructions was one\r\nwhich denied to the colonists any but the most partial responsibility\r\nand independence, and which regarded their party divisions as factious\r\nand at times treasonable.  This disbelief in the reality of Canadian\r\nparties was, however, discounted, and yet at the same time rendered\r\nmore insulting to the reformers, because the colonial secretary\r\nregarded the fragments of old Family Compact Toryism as still the best\r\nguarantee in Canada for the British connection.  \"Although {130} I am\r\nfar from wishing to re-establish the old Family Compact of Upper\r\nCanada,\" he wrote, at a later date, \"if you come into difficulties,\r\nthat is the class of men to fall back upon, rather than the\r\nultra-liberal party.\"[3]  Confidence in political adventurers and the\r\ndisaffected French seemed to him a kind of madness.  In addition to\r\nthis attitude towards existing parties, Stanley held stiffly to every\r\nconstitutional expedient which asserted the supremacy of the Imperial\r\ngovernment.  The Union had, by fixing a Civil List, taken the power of\r\nthe purse within certain limits from Canadian hands, and this Civil\r\nList Stanley regarded as quite essential to the maintenance of British\r\nauthority.[4]  In fact, any discussion of the subject seemed to him the\r\n\"reopening of a chapter which has already led to such serious\r\nconsequences, and in the prosecution of which I contemplate seriously\r\nthe prospect of the dismemberment of the Empire.\"[5]  Holding views so\r\nresolute, he could not, like Russell, trust his representative on the\r\nspot; and, from the first, the troubles of the new governor-general\r\nwere multiplied by Stanley's {131} determination to make the views of\r\nthe Colonial Office prevail in Canada.  \"I very much doubt,\" wrote\r\nMurdoch, Sydenham's former secretary, \"how far Lord Stanley is really\r\nalive to the true state of Canada, and to the necessity of governing\r\nthrough the assembly.\"[6]\r\n\r\nLocal influences provide the second factor in the situation.  As has\r\nbeen seen, the Canadian political community was demanding both\r\nresponsible government, and the admission of the French to a share in\r\noffice.  Sydenham had exhibited the most wonderful skill in working an\r\nanomalous system of government, and he had found himself on the brink\r\nof failure.  His Council, which Bagot had inherited, \"might be said to\r\nrepresent the Reform or popular party of Upper Canada, and the moderate\r\nConservatives of both provinces, to the exclusion of the French and the\r\nultra-conservatives of both provinces,\"[7] but the compromise\r\nrepresented less a popular demand for moderation, than Sydenham's own\r\nindividual idea of what a Canadian Council should be.  There had been\r\nuneasiness in adjusting the opinions of individual members; there was a\r\nsteady decline in the willingness of the Assembly {132} and the country\r\nto support them; and a determined constitutional opposition found\r\nadditional strength through the support of the French party, whom the\r\ngovernor had alienated not simply as a political division but as a\r\nrace.  In a sense, there was no imminent danger, as there had been in\r\n1837, for Sydenham's sound administration had given the country peace\r\nand prosperity.  English money and immigrants were flowing in; the\r\nwoods were ringing with the axes of settlers too busy in clearing the\r\nground to trouble much with politics; the lines of communication were\r\nbeing improved and transportation simplified; and, thanks to Ashburton,\r\nthe war-cloud to the south had vanished over the horizon.  Yet the\r\npoliticians held the central position--everything depended on them; and\r\nthe crisis for Bagot would arise, first, when he should be called on to\r\nfill certain places in the Executive Council, and then, when Parliament\r\nmet.  It is often assumed that public opinion was seriously divided on\r\nthe question of the responsibility of the ministry to the Assembly, and\r\nof the extent of the concessions to be made to the French; and that the\r\nopposition to reform was almost equal in the numbers of its supporters\r\nto the progressive party.  But this is to over-estimate the forces of\r\n{133} reaction.  The Family Compact men had fallen on evil days.\r\nStrachan with his church party, and MacNab with his tail of Tory\r\nirreconcilables, had really very little substantial backing; and honest\r\nTory gentlemen, like J. S. Cartwright, who openly advocated an\r\naristocratic administration, were unlikely to attract the crowd.  The\r\nwork of Sydenham had contributed much to the political education of\r\nCanada; popular opinion was now firmer and more self-consistent, and\r\nthat opinion went directly contrary to the views of Stanley and his\r\nsupporters.  One may find evidence of this in the views of moderates on\r\neither side.\r\n\r\nHarrison, who represented the moderate reforming party in Sydenham's\r\nministry, held that responsible government, in some form or other, was\r\nessential, and that French nationalism must also receive concessions.\r\n\"Looking at the present position of parties,\" he wrote to Bagot in\r\nJuly, \"it may, I think, be safely laid down that, to obtain a working\r\nmajority in the House of Assembly, it is absolutely necessary that the\r\ngovernment should be able to carry with it the bulk of the\r\nFrench-Canadian members....  There is no disguising the fact that the\r\nFrench members possess the power of the country; and he who directs\r\nthat {134} power, backed by the most efficient means of controlling it,\r\nis in a situation to govern the province best.\"[8]  It was his opinion\r\nthat Bagot should anticipate the coming crisis by calling in Baldwin\r\nand the French, before events forced that step on him.\r\n\r\nOn the Conservative side, a moderate man like W. H. Draper, the\r\nattorney-general for Upper Canada in Sydenham's ministry, argued in\r\nfavour of a policy almost identical.  While his views tended to\r\noscillate, now to this side, now to that, their general direction was\r\nclear.  He felt that the ideal condition was one of union between the\r\nparties of Western Canada, which would \"render the position of the\r\ngovernment safer in its dealings with the French-Canadians.\"  But no\r\nsuch union was possible, and Draper, with that honest opportunism which\r\nbest expressed his mind and capacity, assured Bagot that action in the\r\nvery teeth of his instructions was the only possible course.  \"One\r\nthing I do not doubt at all,\" he wrote in July 1842, \"and that is that,\r\nwith the present House of Assembly, you cannot get on without the\r\nFrench, while it is necessary for me at the same time to declare\r\nfrankly that I cannot sit at the {135} council-board with Mr.\r\nBaldwin.\"[9]  In other words, since Draper admitted that the opposition\r\nleaders must receive office, and at the same time declared the\r\nimpossibility of his holding office with them, he was consenting to\r\nCabinet government, not in the restricted form permitted in Lord John\r\nRussell's despatches, but after the regular British fashion.\r\n\r\nOutside the sphere of party politics moderate opinion took precisely\r\nthe same stand.  Murdoch had been Sydenham's right-hand man, and was\r\nstill the fairest critic of Canadian politics.  That he distrusted\r\nStanley's methods is apparent in his letters to Bagot; and it was his\r\nsuggestion that the Imperial position should be modified, and that some\r\nconcession should be made to French national feeling.  \"No half\r\nmeasures,\" he told Bagot, \"can now be safely resorted to.  After the\r\nRebellion, the government had the option, either of crushing the French\r\nand anglifying the province, or of pardoning them and making them\r\nfriends.  And as the latter policy was adopted, it must be carried out\r\nto its legitimate consequences.\"[10]\r\n\r\n{136}\r\n\r\nThe situation in Canada during the spring and summer of 1842 stood\r\nthus.  A governor-general, entirely new to the work of domestic\r\nadministration, and to the province which had fallen to his lot, faced\r\na curious dilemma.  The British cabinet, the minister responsible for\r\nthe colonies, and all those in Canada who claimed to be the peculiar\r\nfriends of the British connection, bade him govern for, but not by the\r\npeople, and exclude from office almost all the French-Canadians, on the\r\nground that they were devotedly French in sympathies.  Another group,\r\nat times aggressive, and very little accustomed to the orthodox methods\r\nof parliamentary opposition, bade him venture and trust; and warned him\r\nthat no half measures would satisfy the claims of constitutional\r\nliberty and nationality.\r\n\r\nThe administration of Bagot occupied a single year, and its more\r\nimportant episodes were crowded into a few weeks in the autumn of 1842.\r\nYet there have been few years of equal significance in the history of\r\nCanadian political development.  There were intervals in which Bagot\r\nhad time to reveal to Canada his genius for making friends; and the\r\nfoundation of a provincial university in Toronto deeply interested one\r\nwho had something of {137} Canning's wit and literary inclinations.\r\nBut politics usually claimed all his attention.  The Union of the\r\nProvinces, and the Imperial supremacy, had to be defended against their\r\nassailants; the vacant places in the Executive Council had to be\r\nfilled, as nearly as was possible in harmony with the wishes of the\r\ncommunity; and whatever the character of that council might be, it\r\nwould have to face the test of criticism from an Assembly, which had\r\nalready striven not unsuccessfully with Sydenham.  In his attempt to\r\nanswer these various problems, Bagot was at his worst in finance.  He\r\nhad not the requisite business training, and entirely lacked Sydenham's\r\nknowledge, boldness, and precision.  In the correspondence over the\r\nmode in which the province should dispose of the British loan of\r\n£1,500,000, Stanley's views show a clearness and force, lacking in\r\nthose of Bagot; and in the one really unfortunate episode of the year,\r\nhis want of financial skill drew on the governor-general's head the\r\nremonstrances of both Stanley and the Treasury authorities.  To escape\r\nfinancial difficulties in Canada, Bagot had anticipated the loan, by\r\ndrawing on British funds for £100,000, and the Treasury did not spare\r\nhim.  \"He ought,\" wrote the Chancellor of the Exchequer, \"to have {138}\r\nconsidered those (difficulties) which must arise here from the\r\npresentation of large drafts at the Treasury, for which Parliament had\r\nmade no provision; and for which, as Parliament was not sitting, no\r\nregular provision could be made.  The situation to which the Treasury\r\nis reduced is this: either to protest the bills for want of funds, or\r\nto accept the bills, and find within thirty days the means of paying\r\nthem.\"[11]  This incident furnished to Stanley fresh proof, if any were\r\nneeded, of Bagot's inexperience.  An anxious and mistrustful temper\r\nappears in all his despatches to Bagot; but, in fact, with little\r\njustification.  He never learned how completely the governor for whom\r\nhe trembled was his master in the art of governing a half-autonomous\r\ncolony.\r\n\r\nAs early as March, Bagot had begun to feel that the views of the\r\nCabinet in Britain were impracticable: and that even the Civil List\r\nmight not be so easily defended as Stanley imagined.  \"I know well by\r\nwhat a slender thread the adhesion of the colony will hang whenever we\r\nconsent to leave the matter entirely in its own hands....  But the\r\npresent supply is not sufficient for its purposes.  We must always be\r\ndependent on the Legislature for provision to meet its excess; and I\r\ncannot but {139} think that the sooner the Legislature succeeds, if\r\nthey are to succeed, in carrying the point, the more generous they may\r\npossibly be in the use of their victory.\"[12]  Bagot was already\r\ndefining the policy which was to be peculiarly his own.  He had a\r\nsingularly clear eye for facts, even when they contradicted his\r\npreconceived ideas; and, being a man of the world, he saw that\r\ncompromise with the opposition was as natural in Canada as in Britain.\r\nBut in answer to his despatches, proposing such a compromise, Stanley,\r\nwith his dogmatic omniscience, and eloquent certainty, had nothing but\r\nregrets to express, and difficulties to suggest.  England, he thought,\r\nhad dealt generously with Canada in the terms of the Act of Union, and\r\nsound statesmanship lay in resolute defence of that measure.  And,\r\nsince there always seems to be in such imperialists a sense of\r\npolitical pathos--the _lacrymae rerum politicarum_--he began to have\r\npessimistic views of the permanence of the connection: \"I am very far\r\nfrom underrating the value to Great Britain of her extensive and\r\nrapidly improving North American possessions, but I cannot conceal from\r\nmyself the fact that they are maintained to her at no light cost, and\r\nat no {140} trifling risk.  To all this she willingly submits, so long\r\nas the bonds of union between herself and her colonies are strengthened\r\nby mutual harmony, good will, and confidence; and it would be indeed\r\npainful to me to contemplate the possibility that embarrassments,\r\narising from uncalled for and unfounded jealousies on the part of\r\nCanada, might lead the people of England to entertain a doubt how far\r\nthe balance of advantages preponderated in favour of the continuance of\r\nthe present relations.\"[13]  The Civil List raised the fundamental\r\nquestion, but it was a simple issue, and it lay still far in the\r\nfuture.  The constitution of the ministry, however, and its relation to\r\nthe coming parliament, could be neither evaded nor delayed.\r\n\r\nBagot's instructions gave him a certain scope, for he was permitted to\r\navail himself of the advice and services of the ablest men, without\r\nreference to the distinction of local party.  In making use of this\r\nliberty, Bagot had to consider chiefly the need of finding a majority\r\nin the Lower House--happily he could postpone their meeting till\r\nSeptember.  Of the probable tone of that Assembly the estimates varied,\r\nbut Murdoch, who knew the situation as well as any man, calculated that\r\nwhile {141} the government party would number thirty, the French, with\r\ntheir British Radical friends, would be thirty-six strong, the old\r\nConservatives eight, and some ten or so would \"wait on providence or\r\nrather on patronage.\"[14]  In Sydenham's last days, the government\r\nmajority, which he had so subtly, and by means so machiavellian, got\r\ntogether, had vanished.  Reformers, not all of them so scrupulous as\r\nBaldwin, were ready to ruin a government which kept them from a\r\ncomplete triumph.  Sir Allan MacNab with his old die-hards, fulminating\r\nagainst all enemies of the British tradition, was still willing to make\r\nan unholy alliance with the French, if only he could checkmate a\r\ngovernor-general who did not seem to appreciate his past services to\r\nBritain.  And the French themselves, alienated and insulted by\r\nSydenham, sat gloomily alone, restless over the Union, seemingly on the\r\nthreshold of some fresh racial conflict.  Everything was uncertain,\r\nsave the coming government defeat.[15]\r\n\r\nAt the very outset, Bagot had this question of French Canada thrust\r\nupon him.  From the moment of his arrival his council advised the {142}\r\nadmission of the French Canadians to a share in power.  He refused, for\r\nStanley had very carefully instructed him on that subject.  The\r\nColonial Secretary had spoken of the wisdom of forgetting old\r\ndivisions, but he never permitted himself to forget that the French\r\nleaders--La Fontaine, Viger, Girouard--had all been, in some fashion or\r\nother, involved in the troubles of 1837.  He believed that there still\r\nexisted in Lower Canada a gloomy, rebellious, French Canadian party,\r\nwhich no responsible British statesman could afford to recognize.\r\nSober-minded Canadian statesmen told him that it was useless to attempt\r\nto detach from the party individuals--_les Vendus_ their compatriots\r\ncalled them.  He answered that he would like to multiply such _Vendus_;\r\nand he hoped for a day when the anglicising of the Lower Province\r\nshould have been completed.  It was his intention to break down all\r\nforces tending in the opposite direction.  He was conscious of a\r\nrepulsion, equally strong, in his feelings towards Baldwin, and the\r\nReform party.  Whether it came by French racial hate, or Upper Canadian\r\nrepublicanism, which was the name he gave to all views of a reforming\r\ncolour, the ruin of the Empire would follow hard on concession to\r\nagitation.  In his heart, he trusted only {143} the old Tories, and not\r\nall his disgust at MacNab's interested advances could alter his\r\nconviction that one party alone cared for Britain--the former Family\r\nCompact men.  When he bade Bagot disregard party divisions in his\r\nchoice of ministers, he was unconsciously limiting Bagot's choice to a\r\nvery little circle, all of them most unmistakably displeasing to the\r\npopulace, whose wishes he professed to be willing to consult.  He\r\nclaimed to be a man of principle--mistaking the clearness of\r\ndoctrinaire ignorance for the certainty of honest knowledge.\r\n\r\nHappily the governor-general of Canada was not in this sense a man of\r\nprinciple.  He observed, took counsel, and began to shape his own\r\npolicy.  It is not easy to describe that policy in a sentence, or even\r\nto make it absolutely clear.  He had come out to Canada, forewarned\r\nagainst Baldwin and the school of constitutionalists associated with\r\nhim; and the warning made him reluctant to consent to their ideas.  He\r\nhad been advised to draw his councillors from all directions, and his\r\nnaturally moderate spirit approved a policy of judicious selection.\r\nBut the noteworthy feature in the line of action which he ultimately\r\nfollowed was that he allowed his diplomatic instincts to overbalance\r\nthe advice imposed on him by the British ministry.  {144} In selecting\r\nindividuals for his councils, he almost unconsciously followed the\r\nwishes of Baldwin and his party, until, at the end, he found himself in\r\nthe hands of resolute advocates of responsible government, and did\r\nnothing to withstand their doctrine.  But this is to anticipate events,\r\nand to simplify what was actually a process involved in some confusion.\r\nHe filled two vacant places--one with the most brilliant of reforming\r\nfinanciers, Francis Hincks, whose merits he saw at once; the other,\r\nafter a gentlemanly refusal from Cartwright, with Sherwood, a sound but\r\ncomparatively moderate Conservative from Upper Canada.  In an admirable\r\nletter to Stanley at the beginning of the summer, he outlined his\r\npolicy.  Stanley, ever fearful of rash experiments, warned him that a\r\ncombination of black and white does not necessarily produce grey.  To\r\nthis he answered: \"My hope is that, circumstanced as I am, I possibly\r\nmay be able to do this, that is, to take from all sides the best and\r\nfittest men for the public service....  The attempt to produce such a\r\ngrey, whether it succeed or not, must, I think, after all that has\r\npassed, and at this particular crisis in which I find myself here, be\r\nthe safest line.\"[16]  Stanley, then, limited his {145} choice of men,\r\nand in the event of a crisis, was prepared that he should risk a defeat\r\nand the violent imposition of an alien ministry, on the chance that\r\nsuch a reverse might provoke a loyalist uprising to defend the British\r\nconnection.  Baldwin dreamed of a consistently Radical cabinet.\r\nMacNab, with his eyes shut to the consequences, seems to have\r\nconsidered a leap in the dark--a coalition between his men and the\r\nFrench Canadians.  Bagot, as opportunist as the Tories, but opportunist\r\nfor the sake of peace, and some kind of constitutional progress, laid\r\naside lofty ideals, and said, as his most faithful advisers also said,\r\nthat the future lay with _judicious selection_, no party being barred\r\nexcept where their conduct should have made recognition of them\r\nimpossible to a self-respecting governor.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to name all the influences which operated on Bagot's\r\nmind.  He corresponded largely and usefully with Draper, the soundest\r\nof his conservative advisers.  His own innate courtesy led him to end\r\nthe social ostracism of the French, and taught him their good\r\nqualities.  Being quick-witted and observant, his political instincts\r\nbegan almost unconsciously to force a new programme upon him.  Before\r\nAugust, he had conciliated moderate reforming opinion through Hincks;\r\nhe {146} had proved to the French, by legal appointments, which met\r\nwith a stiff and forced acquiescence in Stanley, that at least he was\r\nnot their enemy.  He had begun to question the certainty of Stanley's\r\nwisdom on the Civil List, and various other subjects.  Then, between\r\nJuly 28th and September 26th, the date of two sets of despatches,\r\nwhich, if despatches ever deserve the term, must be called works of\r\ngenius, he completed his plan, brought it to the test of practice, and\r\nchallenged the home government to acquiesce, or recall him.  With his\r\nministry constituted as it was in July, he had to face the certainty of\r\na vote of no confidence as soon as parliament met.  Were he to do\r\nnothing, some unholy alliance of groups would defeat the government.\r\nIn that case, his ministers, pledged as they were to constitutionalism\r\nby the resolutions of September, 1841, had warned him beforehand, that\r\nthey would resign in a body.  All hold over the French would be lost,\r\nand responsible government, whether he and Stanley willed it or not,\r\nwould be established in its most obnoxious form.  To fill the vacant\r\nplaces, or to reconstruct the ministry, the field of choice was very\r\nsmall, even if men of every connection were included.  \"Out of the 84\r\nmembers of the House of {147} Assembly,\" he told Stanley, \"not above\r\n30, as far as I can judge, are at all qualified for office, by the\r\ncommon advantages of intelligence and education, and of these, ten at\r\nleast are not in a position to accept it.\"[17]  In the case of the\r\nFrench he seemed to have reached an absolute deadlock.  He found offers\r\nto individual Frenchmen useless, for he did not gain the party, and he\r\nruined the men whom he honoured.  The Assembly was to meet on the 8th\r\nof September, and as that date drew near, the excitement rose.  It was\r\na crisis with many possibilities both for England and for Canada.\r\n\r\nAs certainly as Stanley, with all the wisdom of Peel's cabinet behind\r\nhim, was wrong, and fatally so, Bagot's conduct between September 10th\r\nand September 14th was precisely right.  In a correspondence with Peel,\r\njust before the crisis, Stanley sought to get his great leader to take\r\nhis view.  Even Peel's genius proved incompetent to settle a problem of\r\nlocal politics, three thousand miles away from the scene of action.\r\nThe wisdom of his answer lay, not in its suggestions, which were\r\nuseless to Bagot, but in its hint \"that much must be left to the\r\njudgment and discretion of those who have to act at a great distance\r\nfrom the supreme {148} authority.\"[18]  Stanley himself, from first to\r\nlast, was for allowing Bagot to face defeat, although he always thought\r\nit possible that stubborn resistance to what he counted treason would\r\nrally a secure majority to Bagot and the Crown.  Time and again after\r\nassuring Bagot that he and the ministry acquiesced, which, to do them\r\njustice, they did like men, he harked back to the idea of allowing\r\nevents to prove that the government was indeed powerless, before it\r\nmade a definitive surrender.  Long before Parliament met, the situation\r\nhad been discussed in all its bearings; and the only doubt that\r\nremained was concerning which out of three or four foreshadowed\r\ncatastrophes would end the existence of the government.  The ministers\r\nthemselves had their negative programme ready; for, having consented to\r\nthe constitutional resolutions of September, 1841, they forewarned\r\nBagot that if they were left in a minority, or in a very small\r\nmajority, they should feel themselves compelled to resign, and they\r\nadded that, if Bagot did not accept their recommendation to admit the\r\nFrench Canadians, they would insist upon his accepting their\r\nresignation.[19]\r\n\r\n{149}\r\n\r\nWhen the Assembly met, events moved very rapidly.  On the opening day,\r\nNeilson brought forward the exciting question of amnesty; and the air\r\nwas filled with rumours and schemes, of which the most ominous for\r\ngovernment was the project of coalition between Conservatives and\r\nFrench Canadians.  The time had come for action--if anything could\r\nreally be done.  To understand the boldness of Bagot's tactics, it must\r\nbe remembered that they went \"in the teeth of an almost universal\r\nfeeling at home ... certainly in opposition to Lord Durham's recorded\r\nsentiments, and as certainly to Lord Sydenham's avowed practice\"--to\r\nsay nothing of Stanley's own wishes.  La Fontaine was definitely\r\napproached on the tenth, and, seemingly, Bagot was not quite prepared\r\nfor the greatness of his claims--\"four places in the Council, with the\r\nadmission of Mr. Baldwin into it.\"[20]  But he had no alternative, for\r\non the 12th he received a plain statement from his cabinet that, if he\r\nfailed, they were not prepared to carry on the government.[21]  To his\r\ndismay, the surrender, if one may so term it, which he signed next day,\r\nwas not accepted, since Baldwin could not {150} countenance the\r\npensioning of the ministers, Ogden and Davidson, who had been\r\ncompulsorily retired, and, although MacNab was at hand with the offer\r\nof sixteen Conservative stalwarts, the plan was useless, and, in view\r\nof MacNab's general conduct at this time, irritating.  When Bagot wrote\r\nthat night to Stanley it was as a despairing man, for the attack had\r\nbegun at 3 o'clock, Baldwin leading off with an address, as usual\r\npledging the House to responsible government, and there was every\r\nchance that he would defeat the ministry.  At this point Bagot took the\r\nstrange and daring plan of allowing Draper to read his letter to La\r\nFontaine in the House, that the Lower Canadians might \"learn how\r\nabundantly large an offer their leaders have rejected, and the honest\r\nspirit in which that offer was made.\"[22]  His unconventionality won\r\nthe day, by convincing the House that the governor-general was in\r\nearnest.  Successive adjournments staved off the debate on the address;\r\nand by September 16th, terms had been settled.  La Fontaine, Small,\r\nAylwin, Baldwin, and Girouard if he cared to take office, were to\r\nenter, Draper, Davidson, Ogden and Sherwood passing out.\r\nUnfortunately, since neither Ogden nor Sherwood happened to be {151}\r\npresent, Bagot had to accept their resignations on his own initiative,\r\nand without previous consultation with them.  Not even that dexterous\r\ncorrespondent could quite disguise the awkwardness of his position when\r\nhe wrote to tell both men that they had ceased to be his ministers.[23]\r\nSo the crisis ended.\r\n\r\nThe address was carried by fifty-five votes to five, the malcontents\r\nbeing MacNab, foiled once more in his ambitions; Moffat and Cartwright,\r\nrepresenting inflexible Toryism; Neilson, whose position as a\r\nrecognized opponent of the Union tied his hands, and Johnstone, a\r\ndisappointed place man.  Peace ruled in the Assembly, and the battle\r\npassed to the province, the newspapers, and most ominous of all for the\r\ngovernor, to the cabinet and public in Britain.  A storm of abuse,\r\ncriticism, and regrets broke over Bagot's devoted head.  The opposition\r\npress in Canada called him \"a radical, a puppet, an old woman, an\r\napostate, a renegade descendant of old Colonel Bagot who fell at Naseby\r\nfighting for his King.\"[24]  MacNab, in the House, led a bitterly\r\npersonal opposition.  At least one {152} cabinet meeting in England was\r\ncalled specially to consider the incident, and for some months Stanley\r\ntempered assurances that he and the government would support their\r\nrepresentative, with caustic expressions of regret.  The necessity of\r\nthe change, he reiterated, had not been fully proven.  The French\r\nmembers and Baldwin were doubtful characters.  If the worst must be\r\naccepted, and a ministry constructed, containing both Baldwin and the\r\nFrench, then Bagot had better obtain from the new cabinet some\r\nassurance of \"their intention of standing by the provisions of the Act\r\nof Union, including the Civil List, and every other debatable\r\nquestion.\"  Then, fearing lest the very citadel of responsibility and\r\ncontrol should be surrendered, he set forth his theory of government in\r\nan elaborate letter which revealed distinct distrust of his\r\ncorrespondent's power of resistance.  \"Your position is different from\r\nthat of the Crown in England.  The Crown acts avowedly and exclusively\r\non the advice of its ministers, and has no political opinions of its\r\nown.  You act in concert with your Executive Council, but the ultimate\r\ndecision rests with yourself, and you are recognised, not only as\r\nhaving an opinion, but as supreme and irresponsible, except to the Home\r\ngovernment, for {153} your acts in your executive capacity.\r\nPractically you are (influenced) by the advice you receive, and by\r\nmotives of prudence, in not running counter to the advice of those who\r\ncommand a majority in the Legislature; but you cannot throw on them the\r\nonus of your actions in the same sense that the Crown can in this\r\ncountry.\"[25]\r\n\r\nYet, so far as Canada was concerned, Bagot had reason to feel\r\nsatisfied.  Threatened with half a dozen hostile combinations, he had\r\nforestalled them all, and found the Assembly filled with friends, not\r\nenemies.  He had approached a sullen French nation--and thereafter the\r\nFrench party formed as solid an accession to Canadian political\r\nstability as they had once been dangerous to Imperial peace; and their\r\nunion with the moderate reformers in government, while it gave them all\r\nthey asked, enabled the governor to exercise a natural restraint on\r\nthem, should they again be tempted to nationalist excesses.  He had not\r\nexplicitly surrendered to any sweeping doctrine of responsible\r\ngovernment.  There was peace at last.  The Assembly which passed over\r\nthirty acts, reaffirmed the rights of the royal prerogative, and {154}\r\nwas dismissed in the most amiable temper with itself, and the\r\ngovernor-general.\r\n\r\nOne may discern, however, a curious contradiction between the\r\nsuperficial consequences of the crisis, as described by Bagot, and the\r\nfundamental changes the beginnings of which he was able to trace in the\r\nmonths which followed.  On the face of it, Bagot's policy of frank\r\nexpediency had saved Stanley and his party from a crushing defeat and a\r\nhumiliating surrender to extreme views.  So far, he had assisted the\r\ncause of conservatism.  But the disaster and the humiliation would have\r\ncome, not from the grant of responsible government, but from the misuse\r\nof it to which a victory, won against a more resolute governor, might\r\nhave tempted Baldwin and La Fontaine, and from the false position in\r\nwhich the imperial government would have stood, towards the men who had\r\nchallenged imperial authority and won.  It is interesting to follow the\r\nprocess by which Bagot came to see all that lay in his action.\r\nYielding to Canadian autonomy, he went on to new surrenders.  He had\r\nalready warned Stanley that the agitation over the Civil List would\r\ncertainly reawaken; to the end he seems to have been considering the\r\nadvisability of a complete surrender {155} on that point.  When he\r\nwrote communicating to the minister the Assembly's acknowledgment of\r\nthe royal prerogative, in recognizing the right of the Crown to name\r\nthe capital, he pointed out that, prerogative or no prerogative, the\r\npossessor of the purse had the final voice.  He rebuked his new\r\nminister, Baldwin, for tacking on question-begging constitutional\r\nphrases to a legal opinion, but he told Stanley, quite frankly, that,\r\n\"whether the doctrine of responsible government is openly acknowledged,\r\nor is only tacitly acquiesced in, _virtually it exists_.\"[26]  During\r\nthe remainder of his tenure of office, partly because of his own\r\nill-health, but partly also, I think, from conviction, he gave his\r\nministers the most perfect freedom of action.  And, although he did not\r\ngain the point, he was willing to make sweeping concessions in answer\r\nto the call for an amnesty for the rebels of 1837.  He recognized the\r\nforce of trusting, in a self-governing community, even those who had\r\nonce striven against the British rule with arms--the final proof in any\r\nman that he has come to understand the secrets, at once of Empire, and\r\nof constitutional government.\r\n\r\nThere is little more to tell of Bagot's rule, for {156} the last months\r\nof his life were spent in a struggle to overcome extreme bodily\r\nsickness in the interest of public duty; and Stanley himself, in the\r\nname of the Cabinet, expressed his admiration for the gallantry of his\r\nstand.\r\n\r\nTo the end, he held himself justified in his political actions, and if\r\nthere were moments when he questioned whether Stanley would see things\r\nin a reasonable light, he possessed the perfect confidence of his\r\nCanadian ministers, who did not neglect his injunction to them to\r\ndefend his memory.[27]\r\n\r\nNevertheless the irritation of the Colonial Secretary was neither\r\nunnatural nor unjustifiable.  He confidently expected that separation\r\nfrom England would be the immediate consequence of a surrender to the\r\nreform party in Canada; and he believed that Bagot had made that\r\nsurrender.  In the latter opinion he was correct.  There are times when\r\nthe party of reaction sees more clearly than their opponents the scope\r\nand consequences of innovation, however blind they may be to the\r\ndevelopments which by their parallel advance check the obvious dangers;\r\nand Sir Charles Metcalfe, whom Stanley sent to Canada to stay the\r\nflowing tide, has furnished the most accurate negative criticism of\r\n{157} the Bagot incident: \"The result of the struggle naturally\r\nincreased the conviction that Responsible Government was effectually\r\nestablished, new Councillors were forced on the governor-general....\r\nThe Council was no longer selected by the governor.  It was thrust on\r\nhim by the Assembly of the people.  Some of the new members of the\r\nCouncil had entered it with extreme notions of the supremacy of the\r\nCouncil over the governor; and the illness of Sir Charles Bagot, after\r\nthis change, threw the current business of administration almost\r\nentirely into their hands, which tended much to confirm these\r\nnotions.\"[28]  It fell to the lot of this critic to attempt to correct\r\nBagot's mistakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Stanley to Bagot, 8 October, 1841.\r\n\r\n[2] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[3] Bagot Correspondence: Stanley to Bagot, 17 May, 1842.

Bagot's successor was one of\r\nthose men of principle who are continually revealing the flaws and\r\nlimitations implicit in their principles by earnest over-insistence on\r\nthem.  It is unfortunate that Sir Charles Metcalfe should appear in\r\nCanadian history as the man whose errors almost precipitated another\r\nrebellion, for among his predecessors and successors few have equalled\r\nhim, none has outstripped him, in public virtue or experience.  He had\r\nearned, throughout thirty-seven years in India, a reputation for\r\nefficiency in every kind of administrative work.  As a lad of little\r\nmore than twenty he had negotiated with Ranjit Singh the treaty which,\r\nfor a generation, kept Sikhs and British at peace.  In the {159}\r\nresidency at Hyderabad he had fought, in the face of the\r\ngovernor-general's displeasure, a hard but ultimately successful battle\r\nfor incorrupt administration.  After Bentinck had resigned, Metcalfe\r\nhad been appointed acting governor-general, and he might have risen\r\neven higher, had not the courageous act, by which he freed the press in\r\nIndia from its earlier disabilities, set the East India Company\r\nauthorities against him.  He was something more than what Macaulay\r\ncalled him--\"the ablest civil servant I ever knew in India\"; his\r\nfaculty for recommending himself to Anglo-Indian society on its lighter\r\nside, and the princely generosity which bound his friends to him by a\r\ncurious union of reverence and affection, combined with his genius for\r\nadministration to make him an unusual and outstanding figure in that\r\ngeneration of the company officials in India.  Led by the sense of duty\r\nwhich ever dominated him, he had passed from retirement in England to\r\nreconcile the warring elements in Jamaica to each other; and his\r\nsuccess there had been as great as in India.  In English politics, in\r\nwhich he had naturally played little part, he identified himself with\r\nthe more liberal wing of the Whigs, although his long absence from the\r\ncentre of affairs, and the inclination natural to {160} an\r\nadministrator, to think of liberalism rather as a thing of deeds and\r\nacts than of opinion, gave whatever radicalism he may have professed a\r\nbureaucratic character.  He described himself not inaptly to a friend\r\nthus: \"A man who is for the abolition of the corn laws, Vote by Ballot,\r\nExtension of the Suffrage, Amelioration of the Poor-laws for the\r\nbenefit of the poor, equal rights to all sects of Christians in matters\r\nof religion, and equal rights to all men in civil matters...; and (who)\r\nat the same time, is totally disqualified to be a demagogue--shrinks\r\nlike a sensitive plant from public meetings; and cannot bear to be\r\ndrawn from close retirement, except by what comes in the shape of real\r\nor fancied duty to his country.\"[1]  Outside of the greater figures of\r\nthe time, he was one of the first citizens of the Empire, and Bagot, as\r\nhe thought of possible successors, only dismissed the suggestion of\r\nMetcalfe's appointment because it seemed too good news to be true.\r\nNevertheless Sir Charles Metcalfe had one great initial disadvantage\r\nfor work in Canada.  Distinguished as were his virtues, a very little\r\ndiscernment in the home government might have discovered the obstacles\r\nwhich must meet an absolutely efficient, {161} liberal administrator in\r\na country where democracy, the only possible principle of government\r\nfor Canada, was still in its crude and repulsive stage.  The\r\ndelimitation of the frontier between Imperial control and Canadian\r\nself-government required a subtler and more flexible mind than\r\nMetcalfe's, and a longer practice than his in the ways of popular\r\nassemblies.  Between March, 1843, when he assumed office, and the end\r\nof 1845, when he returned to die in England, Metcalfe's entire energy\r\nwas spent in grappling with the problem of holding the balance level\r\nbetween local autonomy and British supremacy.  His real contribution to\r\nthe question was, in a sense, the confusion and failure with which his\r\ncareer ended; for his serious practical logic reduced to an absurdity,\r\nas nothing else could have done, the position stated so firmly by\r\nRussell in 1839.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Metcalfe came to Canada at a moment when responsible\r\ngovernment in its most extended interpretation seemed to have\r\ntriumphed.  In Upper and Lower Canada the reforming party had accepted\r\nBagot's action as the concession of their principle, and the two chief\r\nministers, Baldwin and La Fontaine, were men resolute to endure no\r\ndiminution of their share of responsibility.  Bagot's {162} illness had\r\ngiven additional strength to their authority, and Gibbon Wakefield, who\r\nwas then a member of Assembly, believed that Baldwin had already taken\r\ntoo great a share of responsibility to be willing to occupy a secondary\r\nplace under an energetic governor.[2]  Indeed an unwillingness to allow\r\nthe governor-general his former unlimited initiative becomes henceforth\r\na mark of the leaders of the Reformers, and La Fontaine, who had\r\nresented Sydenham's activity as much as his anti-nationalist policy,\r\nprotested against the suggestion that Charles Buller should be sent to\r\nCanada, because he \"apprehended that Buller would be disposed to take\r\nan active part himself in our politics.\"[3]  There seemed to be no\r\nobstacle in the way of a complete victory for reforming principles.\r\nThe French remained as solidly as ever a unit, and under La Fontaine\r\nthey were certain to continue to place their solidarity at the disposal\r\nof the Upper Canada reformers.  The latter, _ultras_ and moderates\r\nalike, were too adequately represented, in all their shades and\r\naspects, in the cabinet, to be willing to shake its power; and {163}\r\nthe sympathetic co-operation between Irishmen in Canada, and those who\r\nat that time in Ireland were beginning another great democratic\r\nagitation, made the stream of Hibernian immigration a means of\r\nreinforcing the Canadian progressives.  One of the best evidences of\r\nthe growth of Reform was the persistent agitation of the Civil List\r\nquestion.  Following up their action under Bagot, the reformers\r\ndemanded the concession of a completer control than they seemed then to\r\npossess over their own finances, and a more economical administration\r\nof them.  The inspector-general, in a report characterized by all his\r\nadmirable clearness, stated the issue thus: \"It is impossible for any\r\ngovernment to support a Civil List to which objections are raised, and\r\nwith justice, by the people at large; first, on the ground that its\r\nestablishment was a violation of their constitutional rights; second,\r\nthat the services provided for are more than ought to be placed on the\r\npermanent Civil List; third, on the ground that the salaries provided\r\nare higher than the province can afford to pay with a due regard to the\r\npublic interests, and more especially to the maintenance of the public\r\ncredit.\"[4]\r\n\r\n{164}\r\n\r\nMetcalfe, then, found in Canada a ministry not far from being\r\nunanimous, supported by a union of French and British reformers; and he\r\nought to have realized how deeply the extended view of self-government\r\nhad affected the minds of all, so that only by a serious struggle could\r\nSydenham's position of 1839 be recovered.  But Metcalfe was an\r\nAnglo-Indian, trained in the school of politics most directly opposed\r\nto the democratic ways of North America.  He was entirely new to\r\nCanadian conditions; and one may watch him studying them\r\nconscientiously, but making just those mistakes, which a clever\r\nexamination candidate would perpetrate, were he to be asked of a sudden\r\nto turn his studies to practical account.  The very robustness of his\r\nsense of duty led him naturally to the two most contentious questions\r\nin the field--those which concerned the responsibility of the colonial\r\nexecutive government, and the place of party in dictating to the\r\ngovernor-general his policy and the use to be made of his patronage.\r\n\r\nHis study of Sydenham's despatches revealed to him the contradiction\r\nbetween that statesman's resolute proclamation of Russell's doctrine,\r\nand the course of practical surrender which his actions seemed to have\r\nfollowed in 1841.  \"In adopting {165} the very form and practice of the\r\nHome Government, by which the principal ministers of the Crown form a\r\nCabinet, acknowledged by the nation as the executive administration,\r\nand themselves acknowledging responsibility to Parliament, he rendered\r\nit inevitable that the council here should obtain and ascribe to\r\nthemselves, in at least some degree, the character of a cabinet of\r\nministers.\"[5]  In a later despatch, Metcalfe attempted to demonstrate\r\nthe inapplicability of such a form of government to a colony: \"a system\r\nof government which, however suitable it may be in an independent\r\nstate, or in a country where it is qualified by the presence of a\r\nSovereign and a powerful aristocracy, and by many circumstances in\r\ncorrespondence with which it has grown up and been gradually formed,\r\ndoes not appear to be well adapted for a colony, or for a country in\r\nwhich those qualifying circumstances do not exist, and in which there\r\nhas not been that gradual progress, which tends to smooth away the\r\ndifficulties, otherwise sure to follow the confounding of the\r\nlegislative and executive powers, and the inconsistency of the practice\r\nwith the theory of the Constitution.\"[6]\r\n\r\n{166}\r\n\r\nTo his mind, what Durham had advocated was infinitely sounder--\"that\r\nall officers of the government except the governor and his secretary\r\nshould be responsible to the united Legislature; and that the governor\r\nshould carry on his government by heads of departments, in whom the\r\nUnited Legislature repose confidence....  The general responsibility of\r\nheads of departments, acting under the orders of the Governor, each\r\ndistinctly in his own department, might exist without the destruction\r\nof the former authority of her Majesty's Government.\"[7]  So set was he\r\nin his opposition to cabinet government on British lines in Canada,\r\nthat he prophesied separation as the obvious consequence of concession.\r\nIt was natural that one so distrustful of cabinet machinery in a colony\r\nshould altogether fail to see the place of party.  It must always be\r\nremembered that party, in Canada, had few of those sanctions of\r\nmanners, tradition, and national service, which had given Burke his\r\nsoundest arguments, when he wrote the apologetic of the eighteenth\r\ncentury Whigs.  Personal and sometimes corrupt interests, petty ideas,\r\nignoble quarrels, a flavour of pretentiousness which came from the\r\nmisapplication of British terms, and a {167} lack of political\r\ngood-manners--in such guise did party present itself to the British\r\npolitician on his arrival in British North America.  Metcalfe, from his\r\nprevious experience, had come to identify party divisions with\r\nfactiousness, a political evil which the efficient governor must seek\r\nto extirpate.  His triumph in Jamaica had secured the death of party\r\nthrough the benevolent despotism of the governor, and there can be no\r\ndoubt that he hoped in Canada to perform a precisely similar task.\r\n\"The course which I intend to pursue with regard to all parties,\" he\r\nwrote to Stanley in April, 1843, \"is to treat all alike, and to make no\r\ndistinctions, as far as depends on my personal conduct.\"  But since\r\nparties did exist, and were unlikely to cease to exist, the\r\ngovernor-general's distaste for party in theory merely forced him to\r\nbecome in practice the unconscious leader of the Canadian\r\nconservatives, who, under men like MacNab and the leaders of the Orange\r\nLodges, differed only from other parties in the loudness of their\r\nloyalist professions, and the paucity of their supporters among the\r\npeople.  Metcalfe complained that at times the whole colony must be\r\nregarded as a party opposed to her Majesty's Government.[8]  He might\r\nhave {168} seen that what he deplored proceeded naturally from the\r\nidentification of himself with the smallest and least representative\r\ngroup of party politicians in the colony.\r\n\r\nThe radical opposition between the governor and the coalition which his\r\nexecutive council represented led naturally to the crisis of November\r\n26th, 1843.  For months the feeling of mutual alienation had been\r\ngrowing.  On several occasions, more notably in the appointment to the\r\nspeakership of the legislative council, and in one to a vacant\r\nclerkship of the peace, the governor's use of patronage had caused\r\noffence to his ministers; and, towards the end of November, the entire\r\nCabinet, with the exception of Daly, whose nickname \"the perpetual\r\nsecretary\" betokened that he was either above party feeling or beneath\r\nit, handed in their resignations.  The motives of their action became,\r\nas will be shown, the subject of violent controversy; but the statement\r\nof Sir Charles Metcalfe seems in itself the fairest and most probable\r\naccount of what took place.  \"On Friday, Mr. La Fontaine and Mr.\r\nBaldwin came to the Government House, and after some irrelevant matters\r\nof business, and preliminary remarks as to the course of their\r\nproceedings, demanded of {169} the Governor-general that he should\r\nagree to make no appointment, and no offer of an appointment, without\r\npreviously taking the advice of the Council; that the lists of\r\ncandidates should in every instance be laid before the Council; that\r\nthey should recommend any others at discretion; and that the\r\nGovernor-general in deciding, after taking their advice, shall not make\r\nany appointment prejudicial to their influence.\"[9]\r\n\r\nAt a slightly later date the ministers attributed their resignation to\r\na serious difference between themselves and the governor-general on the\r\ntheory of responsible government.  To that statement Metcalfe took\r\nserious exception, but he admitted that \"in the course of the\r\nconversations which both on Friday and Saturday followed the explicit\r\ndemand made by the Council regarding the patronage of the Crown, that\r\ndemand being based on the construction put by some of the gentlemen on\r\nthe meaning of responsible government, different opinions were elicited\r\non the abstract theory of that still undefined question as applicable\r\nto a colony.\"[10]  There can be no doubt that the _casus belli_ was an\r\nabsolute assertion of the right of the council to control patronage,\r\nbut it is, at the same time, {170} perfectly clear that in the opinion\r\nof the ministers the disposal of patronage formed part of the system of\r\nresponsible government, and that they were quite explicit to Metcalfe\r\nin their statements on that point.  The incident, striking enough in\r\nitself, gave occasion for an extraordinary outburst of pamphleteering;\r\nand the reckless or incompetent statements of men on either side make\r\nit necessary to dispel one or two illusions created by the partizan\r\nexcitement of the time.  On the side of the council, Hincks, the\r\ninspector-general, then and afterwards contended that the incident was\r\nonly an occasion and a pretext; that Stanley had sent Metcalfe out to\r\nwreck the system of responsible government, so far conceded by Sydenham\r\nand Bagot; and that the episode of 1843 was part of a deeper plot to\r\ncheck the growth of Canadian freedom.[11]  Apart from the absurdities\r\ncontained in Hincks' statement of the case, the only answer which need\r\nbe made to the charge is that, if Stanley could have descended to such\r\nignoble plotting, Metcalfe was the last man in the world to act as his\r\ndishonoured instrument.  On the other side, Gibbon Wakefield believed\r\nthat {171} the council chose the occasion to escape from a defeat\r\notherwise inevitable, in the hope that a renewed agitation for\r\nresponsible government might reinstate them in public favour.  As\r\nMetcalfe gave the suggestion some authority by accepting it\r\nprovisionally in a despatch,[12] the details of Wakefield's charge may\r\nbe given.  The ministry, he held, had been steadily weakening.  Two\r\nbills, advocated by them, had been abandoned owing to the opposition of\r\ntheir followers.  The French solidarity had begun to break up, and La\r\nFontaine had found in Viger a rival in the affections of his adherents.\r\nThe ministers, intoxicated by the possession of a little brief\r\nauthority, had offended the sense of the House by their arrogance; and\r\nthe debates concerning the change of the seat of government from\r\nKingston to Montreal had been a cause of stumbling to many.  With their\r\nauthority weakened in the House, doubtful in the country, and more than\r\ndoubtful with the governor-general, the resignation of the ministers,\r\nin Wakefield's view of the case, \"upon a ground which was sure to\r\nobtain for them much popular sympathy, was about the most politic of\r\ntheir ministerial acts.\"[13]\r\n\r\n{172}\r\n\r\nBut the ministry possessed and continued to possess a great\r\nparliamentary majority; and a dissolution could not in any way have\r\nimproved their position.  Besides this, the alienation of the\r\ncouncillors from the governor-general had developed far more deeply\r\nthan was generally supposed; indeed it is difficult to see how common\r\naction between the opposing interests could have continued with any\r\nreal benefit to the public.  On May 23rd, that is six months before the\r\nresignation, Captain Higginson, the Governor's civil secretary, had an\r\ninterview with La Fontaine, to ascertain his views on the appointment\r\nof a provincial aide-de-camp, and on general topics.  The accuracy of\r\nHigginson's _précis_ of the conversation was challenged by La Fontaine,\r\nbut its terms seem moderate and probable, and do not misrepresent the\r\nactual position of the Executive Council in 1843--a determined\r\nopposition to the governor-general's attempt to destroy government by\r\nparty: \"Mr. La Fontaine said, 'Your attempts to carry on the government\r\non principles of conciliation must fail.  Responsible government has\r\nbeen conceded, and when we lose our majority we are prepared to retire;\r\nto strengthen us we must have the entire confidence of the\r\nGovernor-general exhibited most {173} unequivocally--and also his\r\npatronage--to be bestowed exclusively on our political adherents.  We\r\nfeel that His Excellency has kept aloof from us.  The opposition\r\npronounce that his sentiments are with them.  There must be some acts\r\nof his, some public declaration in favour of responsible government,\r\nand of confidence in the Cabinet, to convince them of their error.\r\nThis has been studiously avoided.'\"[14]  The truth is that the ministry\r\nfelt the want of confidence, which, on the governor's own confession,\r\nexisted in his mind towards them.  Believing, too, as all of them did\r\nmore or less, in party, they must already have learned the views of\r\nMetcalfe on that subject, and they suspected him of taking counsel with\r\nthe conservatives, whom Metcalfe declared to be the only true friends\r\nto Britain in Canada.  Matters of patronage Metcalfe had determined, as\r\nfar as possible, to free from party dictation; and so he and his\r\nministers naturally fell out on the most obvious issue which their\r\nmutual differences could have raised.  There was nothing disingenuous\r\nin the popular party claiming that the patronage question stood in this\r\ncase for the broader issue.  Indeed Metcalfe's own statement that \"he\r\nobjected to the {174} exclusive distribution of patronage with party\r\nviews and maintained the principle that office ought, in every\r\ninstance, to be given to the man best qualified to render efficient\r\nservice to the State\" was actually a challenge to the predominance of\r\nthe party-cabinet system, which no constitutionalist could have allowed\r\nto pass in silence.  Egerton Ryerson, to whom in this instance the\r\nmaxim about the cobbler sticking to his last is applicable, erected a\r\nridiculous defence for Metcalfe, holding that \"according to British\r\npractice, the councillors ought to have resigned on what Metcalfe had\r\ndone, and not on what he would not promise to do.  If the Crown\r\nintended to do just as they desired the governor-general to do, still\r\nthe promise ought not to be given, nor ought it to have been asked.\r\nThe moment a man promises to do a thing he ceases to be as free as he\r\nwas before he made the promise.\"[15]  The actual struggle lay between\r\ntwo schools directly opposed in their interpretation of responsible\r\ngovernment; and since Sir Charles Metcalfe definitely and avowedly set\r\nhimself against cabinet government, the party system, and the place of\r\nparty in allocating patronage, the ministers were not free to allow him\r\nto {175} appoint men at his own discretion.  For the sake of a theory\r\nof government for which many of them had already sacrificed much, they\r\nwere bound to defend what their opponents called the discreditable\r\ncause of party patronage.\r\n\r\nThe line of action which the members of council followed had already\r\nbeen sketched out by Robert Baldwin in his encounter with Sydenham.  In\r\nthe debate of June 18th, 1841, Baldwin had admitted that should the\r\nrepresentative of the Crown be unwilling to accept the advice offered\r\nto him by his council, it would be impossible by any direct means to\r\nforce that advice upon him.  But he also held that this did not relieve\r\nthe members of council for a moment from the fulfilment of an\r\nimperative duty.  \"If their advice,\" he said, \"were accepted--well and\r\ngood.  If not, their course would be to tender their resignations.\"[16]\r\n\r\nThis indeed was battle _à outrance_ between two conflicting theories of\r\ngovernment.  Russell, Sydenham, and Metcalfe, had refused to admit\r\nself-government beyond a certain limit, and Metcalfe, in accepting the\r\nsituation created by the resignation of his ministers, was battling\r\nvery directly for his view.  On the other side, Baldwin and the {176}\r\ncolonial politicians had claimed autonomy as far as it might be granted\r\nwithin the empire.  By resigning their offices, they called on their\r\nopponents to make the alternative system work.  For two years Metcalfe\r\noccupied himself with the task they set him.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to enter into all the details of those years.  The\r\nrelevant facts group themselves round three centres of interest--the\r\npainful efforts put forth by Metcalfe to build up a new council, the\r\ngeneral election through which he sought to find a party for his\r\nministers, and the attitude of the colony towards the new ministers,\r\nand of both toward the representative of the Crown on the eve of his\r\ndeparture for England in 1845.\r\n\r\nThe struggle to reconstruct the ministry was peculiarly distressing,\r\nand ended in a very qualified success.  Daly, Metcalfe's one remaining\r\ncouncillor, carried no weight in the country.  Baldwin and his group\r\ncould not be approached; and Harrison, the most moderate of the\r\nreformers, had previously resigned over the question of the removal of\r\nthe seat of government from Kingston.  In Lower Canada, Metcalfe found\r\nhimself almost as much the object of French hatred as Sydenham had\r\nbeen, and it was with great difficulty that he {177} secured Viger to\r\nrepresent the French Canadians in his council--at the expense of\r\nViger's influence among his compatriots.[17]  By the end of 1843,\r\nMetcalfe had secured the services of three men, \"Viger representing the\r\nFrench party, and Mr. Daly and Mr. Draper representing in some degree\r\nas to each both the British and moderate Reform parties.\"[18]\r\nOfficious supporters, of whom Egerton Ryerson was chief, did their best\r\nto introduce to the governor competent outsiders, and Draper used his\r\nreputation for moderation in the effort to secure suitable candidates.\r\nEven after the election of 1844 was over, Draper, and Caron, the\r\nSpeaker in the Upper House, actually attempted an intrigue with La\r\nFontaine; and although the episode brought little credit to any of the\r\nparties concerned, La Fontaine at least recognized how much was\r\ninvolved in acceptance or rejection of the proposals of\r\ngovernment--when he said: \"If under the system of accepting office at\r\nany price, there are persons, who, for a personal and momentary\r\nadvantage, do not fear to break the only bond which constitutes our\r\nstrength, union among ourselves, I do not wish to be, and I never will\r\nbe, of the {178} number.\"[19]  Eventually a patchwork ministry was\r\nconstructed, but its pitiable weakness proved how difficult it was to\r\ncreate a council, except along orthodox British party lines.  It was a\r\n_reductio ad absurdum_ of the eclectic principle of cabinet building.\r\n\r\nThe reconstruction of the council involved a dissolution of Parliament.\r\nThe late councillors had a steady and decisive majority in the existing\r\nAssembly; and the governor-general found it necessary to face the risk\r\nof an appeal to the country.  The fate of Lower Canada he could imagine\r\nbeforehand; nothing but accident could prevent the return of an\r\noverwhelming majority against his men.  Even among the western British\r\nsettlers an unprejudiced observer reported early in 1844 that more than\r\nnine-tenths of the western voters were supporters of the late Executive\r\nCouncil.[20]  Montreal, which, thanks to Sydenham's manoeuvres, counted\r\namong the British seats, returned an opponent of the new Ministers at a\r\nbye-election in April, 1844, although the {179} government party\r\nexplained away the defeat by stories of Irish violence.  But Metcalfe's\r\nextraordinary persistence, and his belief that the battle was really\r\none for the continuance of the British connection, gave him and his\r\nsupporters renewed vigour, and, even to-day, the election of November,\r\n1844, is remembered as one of the fiercest in the history of the\r\ncolony.  Politics in Canada still recognized force as one of the\r\nnatural, if not quite legitimate, elements in the situation, and it was\r\neminently characteristic of local conditions that, early in his term of\r\noffice, Metcalfe should have reported that meetings had been held near\r\nKingston at which large numbers of persons attended armed with\r\nbludgeons, and, in some cases, with firearms.[21]  Montreal, with all\r\nits possibilities of conflict, and with its reputation for disorder to\r\nmaintain, led the-way in election riots.  In April, 1844, according to\r\nthe loyalists, the reformers had won through the use of Irish labourers\r\nbrought in from the Lachine canal.  However that may be, the military\r\nhad been called in, and at least one death had resulted from the\r\nconfused rioting of the day.[22]  In November, the loyalists in their\r\nturn organized {180} a counter demonstration, and the success of the\r\nloyal party was not altogether disconnected with physical force.[23]\r\nFrom the west came similar stories of violence and trickery.  In the\r\nWest Riding of Halton, the Tories were said to have delayed voting,\r\nwhich seemed to be setting against them, by various stratagems,\r\nincluding the swearing in of old grey-headed men as of 21 years of age,\r\nand among the accusations made by the defeated candidate was one that\r\ncertain deputy returning officers had allowed seven women to vote for\r\nthe sitting member.[24]  On the whole the election went in favour of\r\nthe governor-general, although Metcalfe took too favourable a view of\r\nthe situation when he reported the avowed supporters of government as\r\n46, as against 28 avowed adversaries.  At best his majority could not\r\nrise above six.  Yet even so, the decision of the country still seems\r\nastonishing.  There was the unflinching Tory element at the centre; and\r\nthe British members from Lower Canada.  Ryerson had used his great\r\ninfluence among the Methodists, and, since the cry was one of loyalty\r\nto the Crown, many waverers {181} may have voted on patriotic grounds\r\nfor the government candidates.  Metcalfe's reputation, too, counted for\r\nhim, for he had already become known as more than generous, and one of\r\nhis successors estimated that he spent £6,000 a year in excess of his\r\nofficial income.  \"It must be admitted,\" he himself wrote to Stanley,\r\n\"that this majority has been elected by the loyalty of the majority of\r\nthe people of Upper Canada, and of those of the Eastern townships in\r\nLower Canada.\"[25]\r\n\r\nThe government, and presumably also the governor-general, were accused\r\nof having secured their victory by doubtful tactics, and Elgin reported\r\nin 1847 that his Assembly, which was that of the 1844 election, had had\r\nmuch discredit thrown on it on the ground that the late\r\ngovernor-general had interfered unduly in the elections.[26]  Neither\r\nside had been perfectly scrupulous in its methods of warfare, and it is\r\nnot necessary to blame Metcalfe for the misguided zeal and cunning of\r\nhis Ministers and his country supporters.  Be that as it may, the\r\ngovernor-general had won a hard-fought victory--Pyrrhic as it proved.\r\n\r\nThroughout this political warfare, Metcalfe had {182} been sustained by\r\nthe strong support of the home government.  The cabinet announced\r\nitself ready to give him every possible support in maintaining the\r\nauthority of the Queen, and of her representative, against unreasonable\r\nand exorbitant pretensions.[27]  In the debate on the troubles, which\r\nRoebuck introduced on May 30th, 1844, all the leading men on either\r\nside, Stanley, Peel, Russell, and Buller, warmly supported the\r\ngovernor, Russell and Buller being as strong in their reprobation of\r\nthe demands of the council as Stanley himself.[28]  And the chorus of\r\napproval culminated in the letters from Peel and Stanley, which\r\nannounced the conferring of a peerage on Metcalfe \"as a public mark of\r\nher Majesty's cordial approbation of the judgment, ability, and\r\nfidelity, with which he had discharged the important trust confided to\r\nhim by her Majesty.\"[29]  In a sense the honours and praise were not\r\naltogether out of place.  Metcalfe had been sent out to conduct the\r\nadministration of Canada on what we now regard as an impossible system;\r\nand unlike his immediate predecessors he had conceded not one point to\r\nthe other side.  In spite of all that his enemies could say, his {183}\r\npersonal honour and dignity remained untarnished.  The nicknames and\r\ncruel taunts flung at him, in the earlier months, apparently by his own\r\nministers, recoil now on their heads, as the petty insults of\r\nunmannerly politicians; indeed, the accusations which they made of\r\nsimplicity and honesty, simply reinforce the impression of quixotic\r\nhigh-mindedness, which was not the least noble feature in Metcalfe's\r\ncharacter.  His generosity had been unaffected by his difficulties; and\r\nthere are few finer things in the history of British administration\r\nthan the sense of duty exhibited throughout 1845 by Lord Metcalfe,\r\nwhen, dying of cancer in the cheek, almost blind, and altogether unable\r\nto write his despatches, he still clung to his post \"to secure the\r\npreservation of this colony and the supremacy of the mother country.\"\r\nIt is easy to separate the man from the official, and to praise the\r\nformer as one of the noblest of early Victorian administrators.\r\n\r\nBut even before Lord Metcalfe's departure at the end of 1845, the\r\ninadequacy of his system stood revealed.  He had indeed a majority in\r\nthe Assembly, but a small and doubtful majority; and since its members\r\nhad been elected rather to support Metcalfe than to co-operate with his\r\nill-assorted {184} ministry, difficulties very soon revealed\r\nthemselves.  There were causes of dissension, chief among them the\r\nUniversity question in Upper Canada, which threatened to wreck the\r\ngovernment party.  But the most ominous sign of coming defeat was the\r\nincompatibility of temper which rapidly developed between loyal\r\nministers and loyal Assembly.  \"It is remarkable,\" Metcalfe wrote in\r\nMay, 1845, \"that none of the Executive Council, although all are\r\nestimable and respectable, exercise any great influence over the party\r\nwhich supports the government.  Mr. Draper is universally admitted to\r\nbe the most talented man in either House of the Legislature, and his\r\npresence in the Legislative Assembly was deemed to be so essential,\r\nthat he resigned his seat in the Upper House, sacrificing his own\r\nopinions in order that he might take the lead in the Assembly;\r\nnevertheless he is not popular with the party that supports the\r\ngovernment, nor with any other, and I do not know that, strictly\r\nspeaking, he can be said to have a single follower.  The same may be\r\nremarked of every other member of the Executive Council; and although I\r\nhave much reason to be satisfied with them, and have no expectation of\r\nfinding others who would serve her Majesty better, still I do not {185}\r\nperceive that any of them individually have brought much support to the\r\ngovernment.\"[30]\r\n\r\nThat is the confession of a man who has attempted the impossible, and\r\nwho is being forced reluctantly to witness his own defeat.  The\r\nministry which he had created lacked the authority which can come only\r\nfrom the best political talent of a people acting in sympathy with the\r\nopinions of that people.  He had, with great difficulty, found a House\r\nof Assembly willing by a narrow majority to support him, but personal\r\nsupport is not in itself a political programme, and the fallacy of his\r\ncalculations appeared when work in detail had to be accomplished.  He\r\nhad reprobated party, and he found in a party--narrower in practice\r\neven than that which he had displaced--the only possible foundation for\r\nhis authority.  He had come to Canada to complete the reconciliation of\r\nopposing races within the colony, and, when he left, the French seemed\r\nonce more about to retreat into their old position of invincible\r\nhostility to all things British.  The governor-generalship of Lord\r\nMetcalfe is almost the clearest illustration in the nineteenth century\r\nof the weakness of the doctrinaire in practical politics.\r\nUnfortunately, the {186} doctrine which Metcalfe had strenuously\r\nenforced was backed by the highest of imperial authorities, and\r\nsanctioned by monarchy itself.  In less than ten years after the\r\nRebellion, the renovated theory of colonial autonomy had produced a new\r\ndilemma.  It remained with Metcalfe's successor to decide whether\r\nBritain preferred a second rebellion and probable separation to a\r\nradical change of system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Kaye, _Life of Lord Metcalfe_, revised edition, ii. p. 313.\r\n\r\n[2] _A View of Sir Charles Metcalfe's Government of Canada_, by a\r\nmember of the Provincial Parliament, p. 29.\r\n\r\n[3] Baldwin Correspondence: La Fontaine to Baldwin, 26 July, 1845.\r\n\r\n[4] _Parliamentary Paper concerning the Canadian Civil List_ (1 April,\r\n1844), p. 5.\r\n\r\n[5] Metcalfe to Stanley, 5 August, 1843.\r\n\r\n[6] Metcalfe to Stanley, 13 May, 1845.\r\n\r\n[7] Metcalfe to Stanley, 6 August, 1843.\r\n\r\n[8] Metcalfe to Stanley, 13 May, 1845.\r\n\r\n[9] Kaye, _Life of Lord Metcalfe_, ii. pp. 367-8.\r\n\r\n[10] _Ibid._ ii. p. 369.\r\n\r\n[11] See Hincks, _Lecture on the Political History of Canada_; and\r\nDent, _The Last Forty Years_.

Earl Cathcart, who held office in the interval, was chosen\r\nbecause relations with the United States at that time were serious\r\nenough to make it desirable to combine the civil and the military\r\nheadship in Canada in one person.  In domestic politics the\r\ngovernor-general was a negligible quantity, as his successor confessed:\r\n\"Lord Cathcart, not very unreasonably perhaps, has allowed everything\r\nthat required thought to lie over for me.\"[1]\r\n\r\nBut the arrival of Elgin changed the whole aspect of affairs, and\r\nintroduced the most {188} important modification that was made in\r\nCanadian government between 1791 and the year of Confederation.  Since\r\n1839, governors-general who took their instructions from Britain, and\r\nwho seldom allowed the Canadian point of view to have more than an\r\nindirect influence on their administration, had introduced the most\r\nunhappy complications into politics.  Both they and the home government\r\nwere now reduced to the gloomiest speculations concerning the\r\npermanence of the British connection.  In place of the academic or\r\nofficial view of colonial dependence which had hitherto dominated\r\nCanadian administration, Elgin came to substitute a policy which\r\nfrankly accepted the Canadian position, and which as frankly trusted to\r\na loyalty dependent for none of its sanctions upon external coercion or\r\nencouragement.  With 1846, Great Britain entered on an era of which the\r\npredominating principle was _laissez faire_, and within twelve months\r\nof the concession of that principle in commerce, Elgin applied it with\r\neven more astonishing results in the region of colonial Parliamentary\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian episode in Elgin's career furnishes the most perfect and\r\npermanently useful service rendered by him to the Empire.  Although he\r\n{189} gathered laurels in China and India, and earned a notable place\r\namong diplomatists, nothing that he did is so representative of the\r\nwhole man, so valuable, and so completely rounded and finished, as the\r\nseven years of his work in Canada.  Elsewhere he accomplished tasks,\r\nwhich others had done, or might have done as well.  But in the history\r\nof the self-governing dominions of Britain, his name is almost the\r\nfirst of those who assisted in creating an Empire, the secret of whose\r\nstrength was to be local autonomy.\r\n\r\nHe belonged to the most distinguished group of nineteenth century\r\npoliticians, for with Gladstone, Canning, Dalhousie, Herbert, and\r\nothers, he served his apprenticeship under Sir Robert Peel.  All of\r\nthat younger generation reflected the sobriety, the love of hard fact,\r\nthe sound but progressive conservatism, and the high administrative\r\nfaculty of their great master.  It was an epoch when changes were\r\ninevitable; but the soundest minds tended, in spite of a powerful party\r\ntradition, to view the work in front of them in a non-partizan spirit.\r\nGladstone himself, for long, seemed fated to repeat the party-breaking\r\nrecord of Peel; and three great proconsuls of the group, Dalhousie,\r\nCanning, and Elgin, found in imperial administration a more {190}\r\ncongenial task than Westminster could offer them.  Elgin occupies a\r\nmediate position between the administrative careers of Dalhousie and\r\nCanning, and the parliamentary and constitutional labours of Gladstone.\r\nHe was that strange being, a constitutionalist proconsul; and his chief\r\nwork in administration lay in so altering the relation of his office to\r\nCanadian popular government, as to take from the governor-generalship\r\nmuch of its initiative, and to make a great surrender to popular\r\nopinion.  Between his arrival in Montreal at the end of January, 1847,\r\nand the writing of his last official despatch on December 18th, 1854,\r\nhe had established on sure foundations the system of democratic\r\ngovernment in Canada.\r\n\r\nNever was man better fitted for his work.  He came, a Scotsman, to a\r\ncolony one-third Scottish, and the name of Bruce was itself soporific\r\nto the opposition of a perfervid section of the reformers.  His wife\r\nwas the daughter of Lord Durham, whom Canadians regarded as the\r\nbeginner of a new age of Canadian constitutionalism.  He had been\r\nappointed by a Whig Government, and Earl Grey, the new Colonial\r\nSecretary, was already learned in liberal theory, both in politics and\r\neconomics, and understood that Britons, abroad as at home, {191} must\r\nhave liberty to misgovern themselves.  Elgin's personal qualities were\r\nprecisely those best fitted to control a self-governing community.  Not\r\nonly was he saved from extreme views by his caution and sense of\r\nhumour, but he had, to an extraordinary degree, the power of seeing\r\nboth sides, and more especially the other side, of any question.  In\r\nCanada too, as later in China and India, he exhibited qualities of\r\nhumanity which some might term quixotic;[2] and, as will be illustrated\r\nvery fully below, his gifts of tact and _bonhomie_ made him a\r\nsingularly persuasive force in international affairs, and secured for\r\nBritain at least one clear diplomatic victory over America.\r\n\r\nFollowing on a succession of short-lived and troubled governorships,\r\nunder which, while the principle of government had remained constant,\r\nnothing else had done so, Elgin had practically to begin Durham's work\r\nafresh, and build without much regard for the foundations laid since\r\n1841.  The alternatives before him were a grant of really responsible\r\ngovernment, or a rebellion, with annexation to the United States as its\r\nprobable end.  The {192} new Governor saw very clearly the dangers of\r\nhis predecessor's policy.  \"The distinction,\" he wrote at a later date,\r\n\"between Lord Metcalfe's policy and mine is twofold.  In the first\r\nplace he profoundly distrusted the whole Liberal party in the\r\nprovince--that great party which, excepting at extraordinary\r\nconjunctures, has always carried with it the mass of the\r\nconstituencies.  He believed its designs to be revolutionary, just as\r\nthe Tory party in England believed those of the Whigs and Reformers to\r\nbe in 1832.  And, secondly, he imagined that when circumstances forced\r\nthe party upon him, he could check these revolutionary tendencies by\r\nmanifesting his distrust of them, more especially in the matter of the\r\ndistribution of patronage, thereby relieving them in a great measure\r\nfrom that responsibility, which is in all free countries the most\r\neffectual security against the abuse of power, and tempting them to\r\nendeavour to combine the role of popular tribunes with the prestige of\r\nministers of the crown.\"[3]\r\n\r\nThe danger of a crisis was the greater because, as has been shown,\r\nMetcalfe's anti-democratic policy had been more than the expression of\r\na personal {193} mood.  It was the policy of the British government.\r\nAfter Metcalfe's departure, and Stanley's resignation of the Colonial\r\noffice, Gladstone, then for a few months Colonial Secretary, assured\r\nCathcart that \"the favour of his Sovereign and the acknowledgment of\r\nhis country, have marked (Metcalfe's) administration as one which,\r\nunder the peculiar circumstances of the task he had to perform, _may\r\njustly be regarded as a model for his successors_.\"[4]  In truth, the\r\nBritish Colonial office was not only wrong in its working theory, but\r\nignorant of the boiling tumult of Canadian opinion in those days;\r\nignorant of the steadily increasing vehemence of the demand for true\r\nhome rule, and of the possibility that French nationalism, Irish\r\nnationalism, and American aggression, might unite in a great upheaval,\r\nand the political tragedy find its consummation in another Declaration\r\nof Independence.\r\n\r\nBut Elgin was allowed little leisure for general reflections; the\r\nconcrete details of the actual situation absorbed all his energies.\r\nSince Metcalfe's resignation, matters had not improved.  There was\r\nstill an uncertain majority in the House of Assembly, although, in the\r\neyes of probably a {194} majority of voters, the disorders of the late\r\nelection had discredited the whole Assembly.  But the ministry had gone\r\non from weakness to further weakness.  Draper, who did his best to\r\npreserve the political decencies, had been forced to ask Cathcart to\r\nassist him in removing certain of his colleagues.  Viger had been a\r\ncomplete failure as President of the Council, and performed none of the\r\nduties of his department except that of signing his name to reports\r\nprepared by others.  Daly was of little use to him; and, as for the\r\nsolicitor-general for Upper Canada, Sherwood, \"his repeated absence on\r\nimportant divisions, his lukewarm support, and occasional (almost)\r\nopposition, his habit of speaking of the Members of your Excellency's\r\nGovernment and of the policy pursued by them, his more than suspected\r\nintrigues to effect the removal of some members of the council, have\r\naltogether destroyed all confidence in him.\"[5]  Draper himself had\r\nseemingly grown tired of the dust and heat of the struggle, and, soon\r\nafter Elgin's assumption of authority, resigned his premiership for a\r\nlegal position as honourable and more peaceful.\r\n\r\n{195}\r\n\r\nElgin, then, found a distracted ministry, a doubtful Assembly, and an\r\nirritated country.  His ministers he thought lacking in pluck, and far\r\ntoo willing to appeal to selfish and sordid motives in possible\r\nsupporters.[6]  He was irritated by what seemed to him the petty and\r\ninconsistent divisions of Canadian party life: \"In a community like\r\nthis, where there is little, if anything, of public principle to divide\r\nmen, political parties will shape themselves under the influence of\r\ncircumstances, and of a great variety of affections and antipathies,\r\nnational, sectarian, and personal....  It is not even pretended that\r\nthe divisions of party represent corresponding divisions of sentiment\r\non questions which occupy the public mind, such as voluntaryism, Free\r\nTrade, etc., etc.  Responsible Government is the one subject on which\r\nthis coincidence is alleged to exist.\"[7]  The French problem he found\r\npeculiarly difficult.  Metcalfe's policy had had results disconcerting\r\nto the British authorities.  Banishing, as he thought, sectarianism or\r\nracial views, he had yet practically shut out French statesmen from\r\noffice so successfully, that, when Elgin, acting through Colonel Taché,\r\n{196} attempted to approach them, he found in none of them any\r\ndisposition to enter into alliance with the existing ministry.[8]\r\nElgin, who was willing enough to give fair play to every political\r\nsection, could not but see the obvious fault of French Canadian\r\nnationalism.  \"They seem incapable of comprehending that the principles\r\nof constitutional government must be applied against them, as well as\r\nfor them,\" he wrote to Grey.  \"Whenever there appears to be a chance of\r\nthings taking this turn they revive the ancient cry of nationality, and\r\ninsist on their right to have a share in the administration, not\r\nbecause the party with which they have chosen to connect themselves is\r\nin the ascendant, but because they represent a people of distinct\r\norigin.\"[9]  Most serious of all, because it hampered his initiative,\r\nhe found every party except that in office suspicious of the governor's\r\nauthority, and newspapers like Hincks' _Pilot_ grumbling over Imperial\r\ninterference.\r\n\r\nOne sweeping remedy, he had, within a few months of his arrival, laid\r\naside as impossible.  Lord John Russell and Grey had discussed with\r\n{197} him the possibility of raising Canadian politics out of their\r\npettiness by a federal union of all the British North American\r\ncolonies.  But as early as May 1847, Elgin had come to doubt whether\r\nthe free and independent legislatures of the colonies would be willing\r\nto delegate any of their authority to please a British ministry.[10]\r\nIt was necessary then to fall back on the unromantic alternative of\r\nmodifying the constitution of the ministry; and here French solidarity\r\nhad made his task difficult.  Yet the amazing thing in Elgin was the\r\nspeed, the ease, and the accuracy, with which he saw what none of his\r\npredecessors had seen--the need to concede, and the harmlessness of\r\nconceding, responsible government in Baldwin's sense of the term.\r\nWithin two months of his accession to power, he declared, \"I am\r\ndetermined to do nothing which will put it out of my power to act with\r\nthe opposite party, if it is forced upon me by the representatives of\r\nthe people.\"[11]  Two months later, sick of the struggles by which his\r\nministers were trying to gain here and there some trivial vote to keep\r\nthem in office, he recurred to the same idea as not merely harmless but\r\nsound.  That ministers {198} and opposition should occasionally change\r\nplaces struck him not merely as constitutional, but as the most\r\nconservative convention in the constitution; and in answer to the older\r\nschool to whom a change of ministers at the dictation of a majority in\r\nthe Assembly meant the degradation of the governor-generalship, he\r\nhoped \"to establish a moral influence in the province, which will go\r\nfar to compensate for the loss of power consequent on the surrender of\r\npatronage to an executive responsible to the local parliament.\"[12]\r\n\r\nTo give his ministers a last fair chance of holding on to office, he\r\ndissolved parliament at the end of 1847, recognizing that, in the event\r\nof a victory, their credit would be immensely increased.  The struggle\r\nof December 1847, to January 1848, was decisive.  While the French\r\nconstituencies maintained their former position, even in Upper Canada\r\nthe discredited ministry found few supporters.  The only element in the\r\nsituation which disturbed Elgin was the news that Papineau, the\r\narch-rebel of 1837, had come back to public life with a flourish of\r\nagitating declarations; and that the French people had not condemned\r\nwith sufficient decisiveness his seditious utterances.  Yet he need\r\nhave {199} had no qualms.  _La Revue Canadienne_ in reviewing the\r\nsituation certainly refused to condemn Papineau's extravagances, but\r\nits conclusion took the ground from under the agitator's feet, for it\r\ndeclared that \"cette modération de nos chefs politiques a puissamment\r\ncontribué à placer notre parti dans la position avantageuse qu'il\r\noccupe maintenant.\"[13]  Now Papineau was incapable of political\r\nmoderation.\r\n\r\nThe fate of the ministry was quickly settled.  Their candidate for the\r\nspeakership of the Lower House was defeated by 54 votes to 19; a vote\r\nof no confidence was carried by 54 to 20; on March 23rd parliament was\r\nprorogued and a new administration, the first truly popular ministry in\r\nthe history of Canada, accepted office, and the country, satisfied at\r\nlast, was promised \"various measures for developing the resources of\r\nthe province, and promoting the social well-being of its\r\ninhabitants.\"[14]\r\n\r\nThe change was the more decisive because it was made with the approval\r\nof the Whig government in England.  \"I can have no doubt,\" Grey wrote\r\nto Elgin on February 22nd, \"that you must accept {200} such a council\r\nas the newly elected parliament will support, and that however unwise\r\nas relates to the real interests of Canada their measures may be, they\r\nmust be acquiesced in, until it shall pretty clearly appear that public\r\nopinion will support a resistance to them.  There is no middle course\r\nbetween this line of policy, and that which involves in the last resort\r\nan appeal to parliament to overrule the wishes of the Canadians, and\r\nthis I agree with Gladstone and Stanley in thinking impracticable.\"[15]\r\nThe only precaution he bade Elgin take was to register his dissent\r\ncarefully in cases of disagreement.  Having conceded the essential, it\r\nmattered little that Grey could not quite rid himself of doubts as to\r\nthe consequences of his previous daring.  The concession had come most\r\nopportunely, for Elgin, who feared greatly the disturbing influences of\r\nEuropean revolutionism, Irish discontent, and American democracy in its\r\ncruder forms, believed that, had the change not taken place, \"we should\r\nby this hour (November 30th, 1848) either have been ignominiously\r\nexpelled from Canada, or our relations with the United States would\r\nhave been in a most precarious condition.\"\r\n\r\n{201}\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to follow Elgin through all the details of more\r\nthan seven busy years.  It will suffice to watch him at work on the\r\nthree great allied problems which combined to form the constitutional\r\nquestion in Canada; the character of the government to be conceded to,\r\nand worked along with, the colonists; the recognition to be given to\r\nFrench nationalist feeling; and the nature of the connection between\r\nBritain and Canada which would exist after concessions had been made on\r\nthese points.  The significance of his policy is the greater, because\r\nthe example of Canada was certain, _mutatis mutandis_, to be followed\r\nby the other greater colonies.  Elgin's solution of the question of\r\nresponsible government was so natural and easy that the reader of his\r\ndespatches forgets how completely his task had baffled all his\r\npredecessors, and that several generations of colonial secretaries had\r\nrefused to admit what in his hands seemed a self-evident truth.  At the\r\noutset Elgin's own mind had not been free from serious doubt.  He had\r\ncome to Canada with a traditional suspicion of the French Canadians and\r\nthe progressives of Upper Canada; yet within a year, since the country\r\nso willed it, he had accepted a cabinet, composed entirely of these two\r\nsections.  On his {202} way to the formation of that cabinet he not\r\nonly brushed aside old suspicions, but he refused to surrender to the\r\nseductions of the eclectic principle, which allowed his predecessors to\r\nevade the force of popular opinion by selecting representatives of all\r\nshades of that opinion.  He saw the danger of allowing responsible\r\ngovernment to remain a party cry, and he removed \"that most delicate\r\nand debatable subject\" from party politics by conceding the whole\r\nposition.  The defects of the Canadian party system never found a\r\nseverer critic than Elgin, but he saw that by party Canada would be\r\nruled, and he could not, as Metcalfe had done, deceive himself into\r\nthinking he had abolished it by governing in accordance with the least\r\npopular party in the state.  With the candour and the discriminating\r\njudgment which so distinguished all his doings in Canada, he admitted\r\nthat, notwithstanding the high ground Lord Metcalfe had taken against\r\nparty patronage, the ministers favoured by that governor-general had\r\n\"used patronage for party purposes with quite as little scruple as his\r\nfirst council.\"[16]\r\n\r\nSince the first general election had proved beyond a doubt that\r\nCanadians desired a {203} progressive ministry, he made the change with\r\nperfect success, and remained a consistent guide and friend to his new\r\nministers.\r\n\r\nThere was something dramatic in the contrast between the possibilities\r\nof trouble in the year when the concession was made, and the peace\r\nwhich actually ensued.  It was the year of revolution, and the men whom\r\nhe called to his assistance were \"persons denounced very lately by the\r\nSecretary of State to the Governor-General as impracticable and\r\ndisloyal\";[17] but before the year was out he was able to boast that\r\nwhen so many thrones were tottering and the allegiance of so many\r\npeople was waxing faint, there is less political disaffection in Canada\r\nthan there ever had been before.  From 1848 until the year of his\r\nrecall, he remained in complete accord with his liberal administration,\r\nand never was constitutional monarch more intimately and usefully\r\nconnected with his ministers than was Elgin, first with Baldwin and La\r\nFontaine, and then with Hincks and Morin.\r\n\r\nElgin gave a rarer example of what fidelity to colonial\r\nconstitutionalism meant.  In these years of liberal success, \"Old\r\nToryism\" faced a new strain, and faced it badly.  The party had {204}\r\nsupported the empire, when that empire meant their supremacy.  They had\r\nbefriended the representative of the Crown, when they had all the\r\nplaces and profits.  When the British connection took a liberal colour,\r\nwhen the governor-general acted constitutionally towards the\r\nundoubtedly progressive tone of popular opinion, some of the tories\r\nbecame annexationists.  Many of them, as will be shown later,\r\nencouraged a dastardly assault on the person of their official head;\r\nand all of them, supported by gentlemen of Her Majesty's army, treated\r\nthe representative of the Crown with the most obvious discourtesy.[18]\r\nNevertheless, when opinion changed, and when a coalition attacked and\r\nunseated the Progressive ministry of 1848-1854, Elgin, without a\r\nmoment's hesitation, turned to the men who had insulted him.  \"To the\r\ngreat astonishment of the public, as well as to his own,\" wrote\r\nLaurence Oliphant, who was then on Elgin's staff, \"Sir Allan MacNab,\r\nwho had been one of his bitterest opponents ever since the Montreal\r\nevents, was sent for to form a ministry--Lord Elgin by this act\r\nsatisfactorily disproving the charges of {205} having either personal\r\nor political partialities in the selection of his ministers.\"[19]\r\n\r\nBut the first great constitutional governor-general of Canada had to\r\ninterpret constitutionalism as something more than mere obedience to\r\npublic dictation with regard to his councillors.  He had to educate\r\nthese councillors, and the public, into the niceties of British\r\nconstitutional manners; and he had to create a new vocation for the\r\ngovernor-general, and to exchange dictation for rational influence.  He\r\nhad to teach his ministers moderation in their measures, and,\r\nindirectly, to show the opposition how to avoid crude and extreme\r\nmethods in their fight for office.  When his high political courage, in\r\nconsenting to a bill very obnoxious to the opposition, forced them into\r\nviolence, he kept his temper and his head, and the opposition leaders\r\nlearned, not from punishment, but from quiet contempt, to express\r\ndissent in modes other than those of arson and sticks and stones.  For\r\nseven years, by methods so restrained as to be hardly perceptible even\r\nin his private letters to Grey, he guided the first experimental\r\ncabinets into smooth water, and when he resigned, he left behind him\r\npoliticians {206} trained by his efforts to govern Canada according to\r\nBritish usage.\r\n\r\nAt the same time his influence on the British Cabinet was as quiet and\r\ncertain.  He was still responsible to the British Crown and Cabinet,\r\nand a weaker man would have forgotten the problems which the new\r\nCanadian constitutionalism was bound to create at the centre of\r\nauthority.  Two instances will illustrate the point, and Elgin's clear\r\nperception of his duty.  They are both taken from the episode of the\r\nRebellion Losses Bill, and the Montreal riots of 1849.  The Bill which\r\ncaused the trouble had been introduced to complete a scheme of\r\ncompensation for all those who had suffered loss in the late Rebellion,\r\nwhether French or English, and had been passed by majorities in both\r\nhouses; but while there seemed no valid reason for disallowing it,\r\nElgin suspected trouble--indeed, at first, he viewed the measure with\r\npersonal disapproval.[20]  He might have refused permission to bring in\r\nthe bill; but the practical consequences of such a refusal were too\r\nserious to {207} be accepted.  \"Only imagine,\" he wrote, \"how difficult\r\nit would have been to discover a justification for my conduct, if at a\r\nmoment when America was boiling over with bandits and desperadoes, and\r\nwhen the leaders of every faction in the Union, with the view of\r\nsecuring the Irish vote for the presidential election, were vying with\r\neach other in abuse of England, and subscribing funds for the Irish\r\nRepublican Union, I had brought on such a crisis in Canada by refusing\r\nto allow my administration to bring in a bill to carry out the\r\nrecommendation of Lord Metcalfe's commissioners.\"[21]  He might have\r\ndissolved Parliament, but, as he rightly pointed out, \"it would be\r\nrather a strong measure to have recourse to dissolution because a\r\nParliament, elected one year ago under the auspices of the present\r\nopposition, passed by a majority of more than two to one a measure\r\nintroduced by the Government.\"  There remained only the possibility of\r\nreserving the bill for approval or rejection at home.  A weaker man\r\nwould have taken this easy and fatal way of evading responsibility; but\r\nElgin rose to the height of his vocation, when he explained his reason\r\nfor acting on his own {208} initiative.  \"I should only throw upon her\r\nMajesty's Government, or (as it would appear to the popular eye here)\r\non Her Majesty herself, a responsibility which rests, and ought I think\r\nto rest, on my own shoulders.\"[22]  He gave his assent to the bill,\r\nsuffered personal violence at the hands of the Montreal crowd and the\r\nopposition, but, since he stood firm, he triumphed, and saved both the\r\ndignity of the Crown and the friendship of the French for his\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe other instance of his skill in combining Canadian autonomy with\r\nBritish supremacy is less important, but, in a way, more extraordinary\r\nin its subtlety.  As a servant of the Crown, he had to furnish\r\ndespatches, which were liable to be published as parliamentary papers,\r\nand so to be perused by Canadian politicians.  Elgin had therefore to\r\nreckon with two publics--the British Parliament, which desired\r\ninformation, and the Canadian Parliament, which desired to maintain its\r\ndignity and freedom.  Before the Montreal outrage, and when it was\r\nextremely desirable to leave matters as vague as possible, Elgin simply\r\nrefrained from giving details to the Colonial Office.  \"I could not\r\nhave made my official communication to {209} you in reference to this\r\nBill, which you could have laid before Parliament, without stating or\r\nimplying an irrevocable decision on this point.  To this circumstance\r\nyou must ascribe the fact that you have not heard from me\r\nofficially.\"[23]  With even greater shrewdness, at a later date, he\r\nmade Grey expunge, in his book on Colonial Policy, details of the\r\noutrage which followed the passing of the Act; for, said he, \"I am\r\nstrongly of opinion that nothing but evil can result from the\r\npublication, at this period, of a detailed and circumstantial statement\r\nof the disgraceful proceedings which took place after the Bill\r\npassed....  _The surest way to arrest a process of conversion is to\r\ndwell on the errors of the past, and to place in a broad light the\r\ncontrast between present sentiments and those of an earlier date_.\"[24]\r\nIn constitutional affairs manners make, not merely the statesman, but\r\nthe possibility of government; and Elgin's highest quality as a\r\nconstitutionalist was, not so much his understanding of the machinery\r\nof government, as his knowledge of the constitutional temper, and the\r\nneed within it of humanity and common-sense.\r\n\r\n{210}\r\n\r\nGreat as was Elgin's achievement in rectifying Canadian constitutional\r\npractice, his solution of the nationalist difficulty in Lower Canada\r\nwas possibly a greater triumph of statesmanship; for the present _modus\r\nvivendi_, which still shows no signs of breaking down, dates from the\r\nyears of Elgin's governorship.  The decade which included his rule in\r\nCanada was pre-eminently the epoch of nationalism.  Italy, Germany, and\r\nHungary, with Mazzini as their prophet, were all struggling for the\r\nacknowledgment of their national claims, and within the British Islands\r\nthemselves, the Irish nationalists furnished, in Davis and the writers\r\nto _The Nation_, disciples and apostles of the new gospel.  It is\r\nalways dangerous to trace European influences across the Atlantic; but\r\nthere is little doubt that as the French rebellion of 1837 owed\r\nsomething to Europe, so the arch-rebel Papineau's paper, _L'Avenir_,\r\nechoed in an empty blustering fashion, the cries of the nationalist\r\nrevolution of 1848.[25]\r\n\r\nElgin found on his arrival that British administration had thrown every\r\nelement in French-Canadian politics into headlong opposition to itself.\r\nHow dangerous the situation was, one may infer from {211} the\r\ndisquieting rumours of the ambitions of the American Union, and from\r\nthe passions and memories of injustice which floods of unkempt and\r\nwretched Irish immigrants were bringing with them to their new homes in\r\nAmerica.  In Elgin's second year of office, 1848, he had to face the\r\npossibility of a rising under the old leaders of 1837.  His solution of\r\nthe difficulty proceeded _pari passu_ with his constitutional work.  In\r\nthe latter he had seen that he must remove the disquieting subject of\r\n\"responsible government\" from the party programme of the progressives,\r\nand the politic surrender of 1847 had gained his end.  Towards French\r\nnationalism he acted in the same spirit.  As has already been seen, he\r\nwas conscious of the political shortcomings of the French.  Yet there\r\nwas nothing penal in his attitude towards them, and he saw, with a\r\nclearness to which Durham never attained, how idle all talk of\r\nanglicizing French Canada must be.  \"I for one,\" he said, \"am deeply\r\nconvinced of the impolicy of all such attempts to denationalize the\r\nFrench.  Generally speaking, they produce the opposite effect from that\r\nintended, causing the flame of national prejudice and animosity to burn\r\nmore fiercely.\"[26]\r\n\r\n{212}\r\n\r\nBut how could the pathological phase of nationalism be ended?  His\r\nfirst Tory advisers suggested the old trick of making converts, but the\r\npractice had long since been found useless.  His next speculation was\r\nwhether the French could be made to take sides as Liberals or Tories,\r\napart altogether from nationalist considerations.  But the political\r\nsolidarity of the French had been a kind of trades-unionism, claiming\r\nto guard French interests against an actual menace to their very\r\nexistence as a nation within the empire; and they were certain to act\r\nonly with Baldwin and his friends, the one party which had regarded\r\nthem as other than traitors or suspects, or at best tools.\r\n\r\nNo complete solution of the problem was possible; but when Elgin\r\nsurrendered to the progressives, he was making concessions also to the\r\nFrench--by admitting them to a recognized place within the\r\nconstitution, and doing so without reservation.  The joint ministry of\r\nLa Fontaine and Baldwin was, in a sense, the most satisfactory answer\r\nthat could be made to the difficulty.  From the moment of its creation\r\nElgin and Canada were safe.  He remained doubtful during part of 1848,\r\nfor Papineau had been elected by acclamation to the Parliament which\r\nheld its first session that year; and he \"had {213} searched in vain\r\n... through the French organs of public opinion for a frank and decided\r\nexpression of hostility to the anti-British sentiments propounded in\r\nPapineau's address.\"[27]  He did not at first understand that La\r\nFontaine, not Papineau, was the French leader, and that the latter\r\nrepresented only himself and a few _Rouges_ of violent but\r\nunsubstantial revolutionary opinions.  Nevertheless, he gave his French\r\nministers his confidence, and he applied his singular powers of winning\r\nmen to appeasing French discontent.  As early as May, 1848, he saw how\r\nthe land lay--that French Canada was fundamentally conservative, and\r\nthat discontent was mainly a consequence of sheer stupidity and error\r\non the part of England.  \"Who will venture to say,\" he asked, \"that the\r\nlast hand which waves the British flag on American ground may not be\r\nthat of a French Canadian?\"[28]\r\n\r\nHis final settlement of the question came in 1849, and the introduction\r\nof that Rebellion Losses Bill which has been already mentioned.  The\r\nmeasure was, in the main, an act of justice to French sufferers from\r\nthe disturbances created by the Rebellion; for they had naturally\r\nshared but slightly {214} in earlier and partial schemes of\r\ncompensation; and the opposition to the bill was directed quite frankly\r\nagainst the French inhabitants of Canada as traitors, who deserved, not\r\nrecompense, but punishment.  Now there were many cases of real\r\nhardship, like that of the inhabitants of St. Benoit, a village which\r\nSir John Colborne had pledged himself to protect when he occupied it\r\nfor military purposes, but which, in his absence, the loyalist\r\nvolunteers had set on fire and destroyed.  The inhabitants might be\r\ndisloyal, but in the eyes of an equal justice a wrong had been done,\r\nand must be righted.  The idea of the bill was not new--it was not\r\nElgin's bill; and if his predecessors had been right, then the French\r\npoliticians were justified in claiming that the system of compensation\r\nalready initiated must be followed till all legitimate claims had been\r\nmet.\r\n\r\nIt would be disingenuous to deny that Elgin calculated on the pacific\r\ninfluence which his support of the bill would exert in Lower Canada.\r\n\"I was aware of two facts,\" he told Grey in 1852: \"Firstly, that M. La\r\nFontaine would be unable to retain the support of his countrymen if he\r\nfailed to introduce a measure of this description; and secondly, that\r\nmy refusal would be taken by him and his friends {215} as a proof that\r\nthey had not my confidence.\"  But his chief concern was to hold the\r\nbalance level, to redress an actual grievance, and to repress the fury\r\nof Canadian Tories whose unrestrained action would have flung Canada\r\ninto a new and complicated struggle of races and parties.  \"I am firmly\r\nconvinced,\" he told Grey in June, speaking of American election\r\nmovements at this time, \"that the only thing which prevented an\r\ninvasion of Canada was the political contentment prevailing among the\r\nFrench Canadians and Irish Catholics\"; and that political contentment\r\nwas the result of Elgin's action in supporting his ministers.  A happy\r\nchance, utilized to the full by Elgin's cautious wisdom, had enabled\r\nhim to do the French what they counted a considerable service; and the\r\nrage and disorder of the opposition only played the more surely into\r\nthe hands of the governor-general, and established, beyond any risk of\r\nalteration, French loyalty to him personally.[29]\r\n\r\nFrom that day, with trivial intervals or incidents of misunderstanding,\r\nthe British and the French in Canada have played the political game\r\ntogether.  It was in the La Fontaine-Baldwin ministry that {216} the\r\njoint action, within the Canadian parties, of the two races had its\r\nreal beginning; and while the traditions and idiosyncrasies of Quebec\r\nwere too ingrained and fundamental to admit of modification beyond a\r\ncertain point, Canadian parliamentary life was henceforth based on the\r\nfree co-operation of French and English, in a party system which tried\r\nto forget the distinction of race.  From this time, too, Elgin began to\r\ndiscern the conservative genius of the French people, and to prophesy\r\nthat, when Baldwin's moderate reforming influence should have been\r\nwithdrawn, the French would naturally incline to unite with the\r\nmoderate Conservatives--the combination on which, in actual fact, John\r\nA. Macdonald based his long control of power in Canada.\r\n\r\nThe nationalist question is so intermingled with the constitutional\r\nthat it is not always easy to separate the two issues.  The same\r\nqualities which settled the latter difficulty ended also French\r\ngrievances--saving common-sense which did not refuse to do the obvious\r\nthing; _bonhomie_ which understood that a well-mannered people may be\r\nwooed from its isolation by a little humouring; a mind resolute to\r\nadminister to every British subject equal rights; and an austere\r\nrefusal to let an {217} arrogant and narrow-minded minority claim to\r\nitself a kind of oligarchic glory at the expense of citizens who did\r\nnot belong to the Anglo-Saxon stock.\r\n\r\nThere is a third aspect of Elgin's work in Canada of wider scope than\r\neither of those already mentioned, and one in which his claims to\r\ndistinction have been almost forgotten--his contribution to the working\r\ntheory of the British Empire.  Elgin was one of those earlier sane\r\nimperialists whose achievements it is very easy to forget.  It is not\r\ntoo much to say that, when Elgin came to Canada, the future of the\r\nBritish colonial empire was at best gloomy.  Politicians at home had\r\nplaced in front of themselves an awkward dilemma.  According to the\r\nstiffer Tories, the colonies must be held in with a firm hand--how\r\nfirm, Stanley had illustrated in his administration of Canada.  Yet\r\nTory stiffness produced colonial discontent, and colonial discontent\r\nbred very natural doubts at home as to the possibility of holding the\r\ncolonies by the old methods.  On the other hand, there were those, like\r\nCobden, who, while they believed with the Tories that colonial\r\nhome-rule was certain to result in colonial independence, were\r\nnevertheless too loyal to their doctrine of political liberty to resist\r\ncolonial claims.  They looked to an immediate but {218} peaceful\r\ndissolution of the empire.  It seemed never to strike anyone but a few\r\nradicals, like Durham and Buller, that Britons still held British\r\nsentiments, even across the seas, and that they desired to combine a\r\ncontinuance of the British connection with the retention of all those\r\npopular rights in government which they had possessed at home.  A\r\nCanadian governor-general, then, had to deal with British Cabinets\r\nwhich alternated between foolish rigour and foolish slackness, and with\r\npoliticians who reflected little on the responsibilities of empire,\r\nwhen they flung before careless British audiences irresponsible\r\ndiscussions on colonial independence--as if it were an academic subject\r\nand not a critical issue.\r\n\r\nElgin had imperial difficulties, all his own, to make his task more\r\ncomplicated.  Not only were there French and Irish nationalists ready\r\nfor agitation, but the United States lay across the southern border;\r\nand annexation to that mighty and flourishing republic seemed to many\r\nthe natural euthanasia of British rule in North America.  Peel's\r\nsweeping reforms in the tariff had rekindled annexationist talk; for\r\nwhile Lord Stanley's bill of 1843 had attracted all the produce of the\r\nwest to the St. Lawrence by its grant of preference to the {219}\r\ncolony, \"Peel's bill of 1846 drives the whole of the produce down the\r\nNew York channels of communication ... ruining at once mill-owners,\r\nforwarders and merchants.\"[30]  And every petty and personal\r\ndisappointment, every error in colonial office administration, raised a\r\nnew group to cry down the British system, and to call for a peaceful\r\njunction with the United States.\r\n\r\nElgin had not been long in Canada before he saw one important\r\nfact--that the real annexationist feeling had commercial, not political\r\nroots.  Without diminishing the seriousness of the situation, the\r\ndiscovery made it more susceptible of rational treatment.  A colony\r\nsuffering a severe set-back in trade found the precise remedy it looked\r\nfor in transference of its allegiance.  \"The remedy offered them,\"\r\nwrote Elgin, \"is perfectly definite and intelligible.  They are invited\r\nto form part of a community which is neither suffering nor free-trading\r\n... a community, the members of which have been within the last few\r\nweeks pouring into their multifarious places of worship, to thank God\r\nthat they are exempt from the ills which affect other men, from those\r\nmore especially which affect their despised neighbours, the inhabitants\r\nof North {220} America, who have remained faithful to the country which\r\nplanted them.\"[31]  With free-trade in the ascendant, and, to the\r\nmaturest minds of the time, unanswerably sound in theory, Elgin had to\r\ndismiss schemes of British preference from his mind; and, towards the\r\nend of his rule, when American policy was irritating Canada, he had\r\neven to restrict the scope within which Canadian retaliation might be\r\npractised.  There could be no imperial Zollverein.  But he saw that a\r\nmeasure of reciprocity might give the Canadians all the economic\r\nbenefits they sought, and yet leave to them the allegiance and the\r\ngovernment which, in their hearts, they preferred.  The annexationist\r\nclamour fell and rose, mounting highest in Montreal, and reaching a\r\ncrisis in the year of the Rebellion Losses disturbance; but Elgin,\r\nwhile sometimes he grew despondent, always kept his head, and never\r\nceased to hope for the reciprocity which would at once bring back\r\nprosperity and still the disloyal murmurs.  Once or twice, when the\r\nannexationists were at their worst, and when his Tory opponents chose\r\nsupport of that disloyal movement as the means of insulting their\r\ngovernor, he took stern measures for repressing an unnatural evil.  \"We\r\nintend,\" {221} he wrote in November, 1849, after an annexation meeting\r\nat which servants of the State had been present, \"to dismiss the\r\nmilitia officers and magistrates who have taken part in these affairs,\r\nand to deprive the two Queen's Counsels of their silk gowns.\"  But he\r\nrelied mainly on the positive side of his policy, and few statesmen\r\nhave given Canada a more substantial boon than did Elgin when, just\r\nbefore his recall, he went to Washington on that mission which Laurence\r\nOliphant has made classic by his description, and concluded by far the\r\nmost favourable commercial treaty ever negotiated by Britain with the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps a tendency to underestimate the work of his\r\npredecessors and assistants in preparing the way, but no one can doubt\r\nthat it was Elgin's persistence in urging the treaty on the home\r\nCabinet, and his wonderful diplomatic gifts, which ultimately won the\r\nday.  Oliphant, certainly, had no doubt as to his chief's share in the\r\nmatter.  \"He is the most thorough diplomat possible--never loses sight\r\nfor a moment of his object, and while he is chaffing Yankees, and\r\nslapping them on the back, he is systematically pursuing that\r\nobject\";[32] and again, \"There was concluded in {222} exactly a\r\nfortnight a treaty, to negotiate which had taxed the inventive genius\r\nof the Foreign Office, and all the conventional methods of diplomacy,\r\nfor the previous seven years.\"[33]\r\n\r\nIt was a long, slow process by which Elgin restored the tone of\r\nCanadian loyalty.  Frenchmen who had dreamed of renouncing allegiance\r\nhe won by his obvious fairness, and the recognition accorded by him to\r\ntheir leaders.  He took the heart out of Irish disaffection by his\r\npopular methods and love of liberty.  Tory dissentients fell slowly in\r\nto heel, as they found their governor no lath painted to look like\r\niron, but very steel.  To desponding Montreal merchants his reciprocity\r\ntreaty yielded naturally all they had expected from a more drastic\r\nchange.  It is true that, owing to untoward circumstances, the treaty\r\nlasted only for the limited period prescribed by Elgin; but it tided\r\nover an awkward interval of disaffection and disappointment.\r\n\r\nHe did more, however, than cure definite phases of Canadian\r\ndisaffection; his influence through Earl Grey told powerfully for a\r\nfuller and more optimistic conception of empire.  With all its virtues,\r\nthe bureaucracy of the Colonial Office did not understand the\r\ngovernment of colonies such {223} as Canada; and where colonial\r\nsecretaries had the ability and will, they had not knowledge sufficient\r\nto lead them into paths at once democratic and imperial.  Even Grey\r\nrelapsed on occasion from the optimism which empire demands of its\r\nstatesmen.  It was not simply that he emphasized the wrong\r\npoints--military and diplomatic issues, which in Canada were minor and\r\neven negligible matters; but at times he seemed prepared to believe\r\nthat the days of the connection were numbered.[34]\r\n\r\nIn 1848 he had impaled himself on the horns of one of those dilemmas\r\nwhich present themselves so frequently to absentee governments and\r\nsecretaries of state--either reciprocity and an Americanized colony, or\r\na new rebellion as the consequence of a refusal in Britain to consent\r\nto a reciprocity treaty.[35]  In 1849, \"looking at these indications of\r\nthe state of feeling in Canada, and at the equally significant\r\nindications as to the feeling of the House of Commons respecting the\r\nvalue of our colonies,\" he had begun to despair of their retention.[36]\r\nBut there were greater sinners than those of the Colonial Office.\r\nWhile Elgin {224} was painfully removing all the causes of trouble in\r\nCanada, and proving without argument, but in deeds, that the British\r\nconnection represented normal conditions for both England and Canada,\r\npoliticians insisted on making foolish speeches.  At last, an offence\r\nby the Prime Minister himself drove Elgin into a passion unusual in so\r\nequable a mind, and which, happily, he expressed in the best of all his\r\nletters.  \"I have never been able to comprehend why, elastic as our\r\nconstitutional system is, we should not be able, now more especially\r\nwhen we have ceased to control the trade of our colonies, to render the\r\nlinks which bind them to the British Crown at least as lasting as those\r\nwhich unite the component parts of the Union....  You must renounce the\r\nhabit of telling the colonies that the colonial is a provisional\r\nexistence....  Is the Queen of England to be the sovereign of an\r\nempire, growing, expanding, strengthening itself from age to age,\r\nstriking its roots deep into fresh earth and drawing new supplies of\r\nvitality from virgin soils?  Or is she to be for all essential purposes\r\nof might and power monarch of Great Britain and Ireland merely, her\r\nplace and that of her land in the world's history determined by the\r\nproductiveness of 12,000 square miles of a coal {225} formation which\r\nis being rapidly exhausted, and the duration of the social and\r\npolitical organization over which she presides dependent on the annual\r\nexpatriation, with a view to its eventual alienization, of the surplus\r\nswarm of her born subjects?\"[37]  That is the final question of\r\nimperialism; and Elgin had earned the right not only to put it to the\r\nhome government with emphasis, but also to answer it in an affirmative\r\nand constructive sense.\r\n\r\nThe argument forbids any mention of the less public episodes in Elgin's\r\nCanadian adventure; his whimsical capacity for getting on with men,\r\nFrench, British, and American; the sly humour of his correspondence\r\nwith his official chief; the searching comments made by him on men and\r\nmanners in America; the charm of such social and diplomatic incidents\r\nas Laurence Oliphant has related in his letters and his _Episodes in a\r\nLife of Adventure_.  But it may be permitted to sum up his qualities as\r\ngovernor, and to connect his work with the general movement towards\r\nself-government which had been proceeding so rapidly since 1839.\r\n\r\nHe was too human, easy, unclassical, and, on {226} the other hand, too\r\nlittle touched with Byronic or revolutionary feeling, even to suggest\r\nthe age of Pitt, Napoleon, Canning; he was too sensible, too orthodox,\r\ntoo firmly based on fact and on the past, to have any affinity with our\r\nown transitionary politics.  Like Peel, although in a less degree, he\r\nhad at once a firm body of opinions, a keen eye for new facts, and a\r\nsure, slow capacity for bringing the new material to bear on old\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nHe was able, as few have been, to set the personal equation aside in\r\nhis political plans, holding the balance between friends and foes with\r\nalmost uncanny fairness, and astonishing his petty enemies by his\r\nmoderation.  His mind could regard not merely Canada but also Britain,\r\nas it reflected on future policy; and, in his letters, he sometimes\r\nseems the one man in the empire at the time who understood the true\r\nrelation of colonial autonomy to British supremacy.  Not even his most\r\nfoolish eulogist will attribute anything romantic to his character.\r\nThere was nothing of Disraeli's \"glitter of dubious gems\" about the\r\nhonest phrases in which he bade Russell think imperially.  Unlike\r\nMazzini, it was his business to destroy false nationalism, not to exalt\r\nthat which was true, and {227} for that cool business the glow and\r\nfervour of prophecy were not required.  We like to see our leaders\r\nstanding rampant, and with sulphurous, or at least thundery,\r\nbackgrounds.  But Elgin's ironic Scottish humour forbade any pose, and\r\nit was his business to keep the cannon quiet, and to draw the lightning\r\nharmless to the ground.  The most heroic thing he did in Canada was to\r\nrefrain from entering Montreal at a time when his entrance must have\r\nmeant insult, resistance, and bloodshed, and he bore quietly the taunts\r\nof cowardice which his enemies flung at his head.\r\n\r\nHe was far too clear-sighted to think that statesmanship consists in\r\ndecisions between very definitely stated alternatives of right and\r\nwrong.  \"My choice,\" he wrote in characteristic words, \"was not between\r\na clearly right and clearly wrong course--_how easy is it to deal with\r\nsuch cases, and how rare are they in life_--but between several\r\ndifficulties.  I think I chose the least.\"[38]  His kindly, shrewd, and\r\nhonest countenance looks at us from his portraits with no appeal of\r\nsentiment or pathos.  He asked of men that which they find it most\r\ndifficult to give--moderation, common-sense, a willingness to look at\r\nboth sides, and to {228} subordinate their egoisms to a wider good; and\r\nhe was content to do without their worship.\r\n\r\nIt is now possible to summarize the movement towards autonomy so far as\r\nit was affected by the governors-general of the transition period.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic note in the earlier stages had been the domination\r\nof the governor-general's mind by a clear-cut theory--that of Lord John\r\nRussell.  That theory was in itself consistent, and of a piece with the\r\nrest of the constitution; and its merits stood out more clearly because\r\nCanadian progressives had an unfortunate faculty for setting themselves\r\nin the wrong--making party really appear as faction, investing\r\nself-government with something of the menace of independence, and\r\ntreating the responsibility they sought in the most irresponsible way.\r\nThe British theory, too, as guaranteeing a definitely British\r\npredominance in Canada, brought into rather lurid relief the mistaken\r\nfervour of French-Canadian nationalism.\r\n\r\nYet Sydenham, who never consciously, or at least openly, surrendered\r\none detail of the system entrusted to him by Russell, found events too\r\nmuch for him; and that which conquered Sydenham's resolution made short\r\nwork of any resistance Bagot may have dreamed of offering.  Metcalfe\r\nwas wrong {229} in suspecting a conscious intention in Sydenham's later\r\nmeasures, but he was absolutely right when he wrote, \"Lord Sydenham,\r\nwhether intending it or not, did concede Responsible Government\r\npractically, by the arrangements which he adopted, although the full\r\nextent of the concession was not so glaringly manifested during his\r\nadministration as in that of his successor.\"[39]\r\n\r\nCanadian conditions were, in fact, evolving for themselves a new\r\nsystem--Home Rule with its limits and conditions left as vague as\r\npossible--and that new system contradicted the very postulates of\r\nRussell's doctrine.  It was only when the system of Russell became\r\nincarnate in a governor, Lord Metcalfe, and when the opposing facts\r\nalso took personal form in the La Fontaine-Baldwin ministry, that both\r\nin Canada and Britain men came to see that two contradictory policies\r\nfaced each other, and that one or other alternative must be chosen.  To\r\nElgin fell the honour not merely of seeing the need to choose the\r\nCanadian alternative, but also of recognizing the conditions under\r\nwhich the new plan would bring a deeper loyalty, and a more lasting\r\nunion with Britain, as well as political content to Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Elgin-Grey Correspondence: Elgin to Grey, 24 February, 1847.

In the present chapter, it is proposed to\r\nexamine these as they operated during the first two decades of the\r\nVictorian era.  But an examination of early Victorian imperialism\r\ndemands, as a first condition, the dismissal of such prejudices and\r\nmisjudgments as are implicit in recent terms like \"Little-Englander\"\r\nand \"Imperialist.\"  It is, indeed, one of the objects of this chapter\r\nto show how little modern party cries correspond to the ideas prevalent\r\nfrom 1840 to 1860, and to exhibit as the central movement in imperial\r\nmatters the gradual development of a doctrine for the colonies, and\r\nmore especially for Canada, not dissimilar to that which dominated the\r\neconomic theory of the day under the title of _laissez faire_.\r\n\r\n{231}\r\n\r\nIt is important to limit the scope of the inquiry, for the problem of\r\nCanadian autonomy was strictly practical and very pressing.  There is\r\nlittle need to exhibit the otiose or irresponsible opinions of men or\r\ngroups of men, which had no direct influence on events.  Little, for\r\nexample, need be said of the views of the British populace.  No doubt\r\nJoseph Hume expressed views in which he had many sympathizers\r\nthroughout the country; but his constituents were too ill-informed on\r\nCanadian politics to make their opinions worthy of study; and their\r\nheated debates, carried on in mutual improvement societies, had even\r\nless influence in controlling the actions of government than had the\r\nspeeches of their leader in Parliament.[1]  After the sensational\r\nbeginning of the reign in Canada, public opinion directed its attention\r\nto Canadian affairs only when fresh sensations offered themselves, and\r\nusually exhibited an indifference which was not without its advantages\r\nto the authorities.  \"People here are beginning to forget Canada, which\r\nis the best thing they can do,\" wrote Grey {232} to Elgin after the\r\nRebellion Losses troubles had fallen quiet.\r\n\r\nThe British press, too, need claim little attention.  On the confession\r\nof those mainly concerned, it was wonderfully ignorant and misleading\r\non Canadian subjects.  Elgin, who was not indifferent to newspaper\r\ncriticism, complained bitterly of the unfairness and haphazard methods\r\nof the British papers, neglecting, as they did, the real issues, and\r\nemphasizing irritating but unimportant troubles.  \"The English press,\"\r\nhe wrote, after an important viceregal visit to Boston in 1851, \"wholly\r\nignores our proceedings both at Boston and Montreal, and yet one would\r\nthink it was worth while to get the Queen of England as much cheered in\r\nNew England as she can be in any part of Old England.\"[2]  Grey in turn\r\nhad to complain, not merely of indifference, but of misrepresentation,\r\nand that too in a crisis in Canadian politics, the Rebellion Losses\r\nagitation; \"I am misrepresented in _The Times_ in a manner which I fear\r\nmay do much mischief in Canada.  I am reported as having said that the\r\nconnexion between Canada and this country was drawing rapidly to a\r\nclose.  This is {233} the very opposite of what I really said.\"[3]  How\r\nirresponsible and inconsistent a great newspaper could be may be\r\ngathered from the treatment by _The Times_ of the Annexationist\r\nmovement in 1849.  Professing at first a calm resignation, it refused\r\nfor the country \"the sterile honour of maintaining a reluctant colony\r\nin galling subjection\"; yet, shortly afterwards, it took the high\r\nimperial line of argument and predicted that \"the destined future of\r\nCanada, and the disposition of her people\" would prevent so unfortunate\r\nan ending to the connection.[4]  The fact is that in all political\r\nquestions demanding expert knowledge, newspaper opinion is practically\r\nworthless; except in cases where the services of some specialist are\r\ncalled in, and there the expert exercises influence, not through his\r\narticles, but because, elsewhere, he has made good his claims to be\r\nheard.  Canadian problems owed nothing of their solution to the British\r\npress.\r\n\r\nAnother factor, irresponsible and indirect, yet closer to the scene of\r\npolitical action than the press, was assumed in those years to have a\r\ngreat {234} influence on events--the permanent element in the Colonial\r\nOffice, and more especially the permanent under-secretary, James\r\nStephen.  Charles Buller's pamphlet on _Responsible Government for the\r\nColonies_ formulates the charge against the permanent men in a famous\r\nsatiric passage.  Buller had been speaking of the incessant change of\r\nministers in the Colonial Office--ten secretaries of state in little\r\nmore than so many years.  \"Perplexed with the vast variety of subjects\r\npresented to him--alike appalled by the important and unimportant\r\nmatters forced on his attention--every Secretary of State is obliged at\r\nthe outset to rely on the aid of some better informed member of his\r\noffice.  His Parliamentary Under-Secretary is generally as new to the\r\nbusiness as himself: and even if they had not been brought in together,\r\nthe tenure of office by the Under-Secretary having on the average been\r\nquite as short as that of the Secretary of State, he has never during\r\nthe period of his official career obtained sufficient information to\r\nmake him independent of the aid on which he must have been thrown at\r\nthe outset.  Thus we find both these marked and responsible\r\nfunctionaries dependent on the advice and guidance of another; and that\r\nother person must of course be one of the permanent {235} members of\r\nthe office....  That mother-country which has been narrowed from the\r\nBritish Isles into the Parliament, from the Parliament into the\r\nexecutive government, from the executive government into the Colonial\r\nOffice, is not to be sought in the apartments of the Secretary of\r\nState, or his Parliamentary Under-Secretary.  Where you are to look for\r\nit, it is impossible to say.  In some back-room--whether in the attic,\r\nor in what storey we know not--you will find all the mother-country\r\nwhich really exercises supremacy, and really maintains connexion with\r\nthe vast and widely-scattered colonies of Britain.\"[5]\r\n\r\nThe directness and strength of the influence which men like Sir Henry\r\nTaylor and Sir James Stephen exercised, both on opinion and events, may\r\nbe inferred from Taylor's confessions with regard to the slave question\r\nin the West Indies, and the extent to which even Peel himself had to\r\ndepend for information, and occasionally for direction, on the\r\npermanent men.[6]  It seems clear, too, that up till the year when Lord\r\nJohn Russell took over the Colonial Office, Stephen had a great {236}\r\nsay in Canadian affairs, especially under Glenelg's regime.  \"As to his\r\nviews upon other Colonial questions,\" says Taylor, \"they were perhaps\r\nmore liberal than those of most of his chiefs; and at one important\r\nconjuncture he miscalculated the effect of a liberal confidence placed\r\nin a Canadian Assembly, and threw more power into their hands than he\r\nintended them to possess.\"[7]  On the assumption that he was\r\nresponsible for Glenelg's benevolent view of Canadian local rights, one\r\nmight attribute something of Lord John Russell's over logical and\r\ncasuistical declarations concerning responsible government to Buller's\r\n\"Mr. Mother-country.\"  But it is absurd to suppose that Russell's\r\nindependent mind operated long under any sub-secretarial influence;\r\nmore especially since the rapid succession of startling events in\r\nCanada made his daring and unconventional statesmanship a fitter means\r\nof government than the plodding methods of the bureaucrat.  After 1841,\r\nStanley and Stephen were too little sympathetic towards each other's\r\nmethods and ideas, and Gladstone too strongly fortified in his own\r\nopinions, for Stephen's influence to creep in; while the Whig\r\ngovernment which entered as he left the Colonial Office, had, {237} in\r\nGrey, a Secretary of State too learned in the affairs of his department\r\nto reflect the last influences of his retiring under-secretary.\r\nWhatever, then, Mr. Over-Secretary Stephen did to dominate Lord\r\nGlenelg, and to initiate the concession of responsible government to\r\nCanada, his influence must speedily have sunk to a very secondary\r\nposition, and the independent and conscious intentions of the\r\nresponsible ministers held complete sway.  It is interesting to note\r\nthat, according to his son, he seems to have come to share \"the\r\nopinions prevalent among the liberal party that the colonies would soon\r\nbe detached from the mother-country.\"[8]\r\n\r\nThe actual starting-point of the development of British opinion with\r\nregard to Canadian institutions is perfectly definite.  It dates from\r\nthe co-operation and mutual influence of a little group of experts in\r\ncolonial matters, of whom Charles Buller and Gibbon Wakefield were the\r\nmoving spirits, and the Earl of Durham the illustrious mouthpiece.  The\r\nend of the Rebellion furnished the occasion for their propaganda.\r\n\r\nThe situation was one peculiarly susceptible to {238} the treatment\r\nlikely to be proposed by these radical and unconventional spirits.  It\r\nwas difficult to describe the constitutional position of Canada without\r\nestablishing a contradiction in terms, and neither abstract and logical\r\nminds like that of Cornewall Lewis, nor bureaucratic intelligences like\r\nStephen's, could do more than intensify the difficulty and emphasize\r\nit.  The _deus ex machina_ must appear and solve the preliminary or\r\ntheoretic difficulties by overriding them.  There are some who describe\r\nthe pioneers of Canadian self-government as philosophic radicals; but\r\nthey were really not of that school.  It was through the absence of any\r\nphilosophy or rigid logic that they succeeded.\r\n\r\nForemost in the group came Edward Gibbon Wakefield, one of those\r\nerratic but creative spirits whose errors are often as profitable to\r\nall (save themselves) as their sober acts.  It is not here necessary to\r\nenter on the details of his emigration system; in that he was, after\r\nall, a pioneer in the south and east rather than in the west.  But in\r\nthe stirring years of colonial development, in which Canada, Australia,\r\nand New Zealand took their modern form, Wakefield was a leader in\r\nconstitutional as well as in economic matters, and Canada was favoured\r\nnot only with his opinions, but with {239} his presence.  In the _Art\r\nof Colonization_ he entered into some detail on these matters.  There\r\nwas a certain breezy informality about his views, which carried him\r\ndirectly to the heart of the matter.  He understood, as few of his\r\ncontemporaries did, that in all discussions concerning the \"connexion,\"\r\nthe final argument was sentimental rather than constitutional; and he\r\naccepted without further argument the incapacity of Englishmen for\r\nbeing other than English in the politics of their colony.  \"There would\r\nstill be hostile parties in a colony,\" he wrote as he planned reforms,\r\n\"yes, parties instead of factions: for every colony would have its\r\n'ins' and 'outs,' and would be governed as we are--as every free\r\ncommunity must be in the present state of the human mind--by the\r\nemulation and rivalries, the bidding against each other for public\r\nfavour, of the party in power and the party in opposition.  Government\r\nby party, with all its passions and corruptions, is the price that a\r\nfree country pays for freedom.  But the colonies would be free\r\ncommunities: their internal differences, their very blunders, and their\r\nmethods of correcting them, would be all their own; and the colonists\r\nwho possessed capacity for public business would govern in turns far\r\nbetter on the whole than {240} it would be possible for any other set\r\nof beings on earth to govern that particular community.\"[9]  He was,\r\nthen, for a most entire and whole-hearted control by colonists, and\r\nespecially Canadians, of their own affairs.  But when he came to define\r\nwhat these affairs included, he had limits to suggest, and although he\r\nwas aware of the dangers implicit in such a limitation, he was very\r\nemphatic on the need of imperial control in diplomacy and war, and more\r\nespecially in the administration of land.[10]  How practical and\r\nsincere were his views on the supremacy of the home government, he\r\nproved by supporting, in person and with his pen, Sir Charles Metcalfe\r\nin his struggle to limit the claims of local autonomy.\r\n\r\nPowerful and suggestive as Wakefield's mind was, he had, nevertheless,\r\nto own a master in colonial theory; for the most distinguished, and by\r\nfar the clearest, view of the whole matter is contained in Charles\r\nBuller's _Responsible Government for the Colonies_, which he published\r\nanonymously in 1840.  Buller was indeed the ablest of the whole group,\r\nand his early death was one of the greatest losses which English\r\npolitics sustained in the nineteenth {241} century--\"an intelligent,\r\nclear, honest, most kindly vivacious creature; the genialist Radical I\r\nhave ever met,\"[11] said Carlyle.  The ease of his writing and his gift\r\nfor light satire must not be permitted to obscure the consistency and\r\npenetration of his views.  Even if Durham contributed more to his\r\nReport than seems probable, the view there propounded of the scope of\r\nResponsible Government is not nearly so cogent as that of the later\r\npamphlet.  Buller, like the other members of his group, believed in the\r\nacknowledgment of a supremacy, vested in the mother country, and\r\nexpressed in control of foreign affairs, inter-colonial affairs, land,\r\ntrade, immigration, and the like; but outside the few occasions on\r\nwhich these matters called for imperial interference, he was for\r\nabsolute non-interference, and protested that \"that constant reference\r\nto the authorities in England, which some persons call responsibility\r\nto the mother country, is by no means necessary to insure the\r\nmaintenance of a beneficial colonial connexion.\"[12]  His originality\r\nindeed is best tested by the vigour and truth of his criticisms of the\r\nexisting administration.  First of all representation had been given\r\nwithout {242} executive responsibility.  Then for practical purposes\r\nthe colonists were allowed to make many of their own laws, without the\r\nliberty to choose those who would administer them.  Then a colonial\r\nparty, self-styled the party of the connexion, or the loyal party,\r\nmonopolized office.  To Buller the idea of combining a popular\r\nrepresentation with an unpopular executive seemed the height of\r\nconstitutional folly; and, like Wakefield, he understood, as perhaps\r\nnot five others in England did, the place of party government and\r\npopular dictation in colonial constitutional development.  \"The whole\r\ndirection of affairs,\" he said, \"and the whole patronage of the\r\nExecutive practically are at present in the hands of a colonial party.\r\nNow when _this is the case, it can be of no importance to the mother\r\ncountry in the ordinary course of things, which of these local parties\r\npossesses the powers and emoluments of office_.\"[13]  Unlike the\r\nmajority of his contemporaries, he believed in assuming the colonists\r\nto be inspired with love for their mother country, common sense, and a\r\nregard for their own welfare; and it seemed obvious that men so\r\ndisposed were infinitely better qualified than the Colonial Office to\r\nmanage their own affairs.  Nothing but evil {243} could result \"from\r\nthe attempt to conduct the internal affairs of the colonies in\r\naccordance with the public opinion, not of those colonies themselves,\r\nbut of the mother country.\"[14]  It may seem a work of supererogation\r\nto complete the sketch of this group with an examination of the\r\nopinions expressed in Lord Durham's Report; yet that Report is so\r\nfundamental a document in the development of British imperial opinion\r\nthat time must be found to dispel one or two popular illusions.[15]  It\r\nis a mistake to hold that Durham advocated the fullest concession of\r\nlocal autonomy to Canada.  Sir Francis Hincks, a protagonist of\r\nResponsible Government, once quoted from the Report sentences which\r\nseemed to justify all his claims: \"The crown must submit to the\r\nnecessary consequences of representative institutions, and if it has to\r\ncarry on the government in union with a representative body, it must\r\nconsent to carry it on by means of those in whom that representative\r\nbody has confidence\"; and again, \"I admit that the system which I\r\npropose would in fact place the internal government of the colony in\r\nthe hands of the {244} colonists themselves, and that we should thus\r\nleave to them the execution of the laws of which we have long entrusted\r\nthe making solely to them.\"[16]  Public opinion in Canada also put this\r\nextreme interpretation on the language of the Report.\r\n\r\nYet, as a first modification, it was Lord Metcalfe's confident opinion\r\nthat the responsibility of ministers to the Assembly for which Durham\r\npled, was not that of a united Cabinet, but rather of departmental\r\nheads in individual isolation,[17] and certainly one sentence in the\r\nReport can hardly be interpreted otherwise: \"This (the change) would\r\ninduce responsibility for every act of the Government, and, as a\r\nnatural consequence, it would necessitate _the substitution of a system\r\nof administration by means of competent heads of departments, for the\r\npresent rude machinery of an executive council_.\"[18]\r\n\r\nIn the second place, while Durham did indeed speak of making the\r\ncolonial executive responsible to a colonial Assembly, he discriminated\r\nbetween the internal government of the colony and its {245} imperial\r\naspect.[19]  In practice he modified his gift of home rule, by placing,\r\nlike Wakefield and Buller, many things beyond the scope of colonial\r\nresponsibility, for example, \"the constitution of the form of\r\ngovernment, the regulation of foreign relations, and of trade with the\r\nmother country, the other British colonies, and foreign nations, and\r\nthe disposal of the public lands.\"[20]  There is too remarkable a\r\nconsensus of opinion on this point within the group to leave any doubt\r\nas to the intention of Durham and his assistants; that an extensive\r\nregion should be left subject to strictly imperial supervision.\r\nDurham's career ended before his actions could furnish a practical test\r\nof his theories, but Buller, like Wakefield, gave a plain statement of\r\nwhat he meant by supporting Metcalfe against his council, at a time\r\nwhen the colonial Assembly seemed to be infringing on imperial rights.\r\n\"No man,\" said Buller, of the Metcalfe affair, \"could seriously think\r\nof saying that in the appointment of every subordinate officer in every\r\ncounty in Canada, the opinion of the Executive Council was to be\r\ntaken.\"[21]\r\n\r\n{246}\r\n\r\nTo pass from controversy to certainty, there was one aspect of the\r\nReport which made it the most notable deliverance of its authors, and\r\nwhich set that group apart from every other political section in\r\nBritain, whether Radical, Whig, or Tory--I mean its robust and\r\nunhesitating imperialism.  How deeply pessimism concerning the Empire\r\nhad pervaded all minds at that time, it will be the duty of this\r\nchapter to prove, but, in the Report at least, there is no doubt of its\r\nauthors' desire, \"to perpetuate and strengthen the connexion between\r\nthis Empire and the North American Colonies, which would then form one\r\nof the brightest ornaments in your Majesty's Imperial Crown.\"  This\r\nconfident imperial note, then, was the most striking contribution of\r\nthe Durham Radicals to colonial development; and the originality and\r\nunexpectedness of their confidence gains impressiveness when contrasted\r\nwith general contemporary opinion.\r\n\r\nThey contributed, too, in another and less simple fashion, to the\r\nconstitutional question.  Nowhere so clearly as in their writings are\r\nboth sides of the theoretic contradiction--British supremacy and\r\nCanadian autonomy--so boldly stated, and, in spite of the\r\ncontradiction, so confidently accepted.  They would trust implicitly to\r\nthe sense and {247} feelings, however crude, of the colony: they would\r\nsurrender the entire control of domestic affairs: they would sanction,\r\nas at home, party with all its faults, popular control of the\r\nexecutive, and apparently the decisive influence of that executive in\r\nadvising the governor in internal affairs.  Yet, in the great imperial\r\nfederation of which they dreamed, they never doubted the right of the\r\nmother country to act with overmastering authority in certain crises.\r\nThat right, and the unquenchable affection of exiles for the land\r\nwhence they came, constituted for them \"the connexion.\"\r\n\r\nThese were the views which came to dominate political opinion in\r\nBritain, for Molesworth was right when he declared that to Buller and\r\nWakefield, more than to any other persons, was the country indebted for\r\nsound views on colonial policy.  The interest of the present inquiry\r\nlies in tracing the development of these views into something unlike,\r\nand distinctly bolder than, anything which these rash and\r\nunconventional thinkers had planned.\r\n\r\nWhatever might be the shortcomings of the Radical group, the daring of\r\ntheir trust in the colonists stands out in high relief against a\r\nbackground of conservative restriction and distrust.  It was natural\r\nfor the Tories to think of colonies as {248} they did.  Under the\r\nleadership of North and George III. they had experienced what might\r\nwell seem to them the natural consequences of the old constitutional\r\nsystem of colonial administration.  After 1782 they were disinclined to\r\nexperiment in Assemblies as free as those of Massachusetts and\r\nConnecticut had been.  The reaction caused by the French Revolution\r\ndeepened their distrust of popular institutions; and the war of 1812\r\nquickened their hatred of the United States--the zone of political no\r\nless than military danger for Canada.  The conquests which they made\r\nhad given them a second colonial empire, and they had administered that\r\nempire with financial generosity and constitutional parsimony, hoping\r\nagainst hope that a fabric so unexpected and difficult as colonial\r\nempire might after all disappoint their fears by remaining true to\r\nBritain.  Developing in spite of themselves, and with the times, they\r\nhad still learned little and forgotten little.  So it was that Sir\r\nGeorge Arthur, a Tory governor _in partibus infidelium_, was driven\r\ninto panic by Durham's frank criticisms, and expounded to Normanby, his\r\nWhig chief, fears not altogether baseless: \"The bait of responsible\r\ngovernment has been eagerly taken, and its poison is working most\r\nmischievously....  {249} The measure recommended by such high authority\r\nis the worst evil that has yet befallen Upper Canada\":[22] and again,\r\n\"since the Earl of Durham's Report was published, the reform party, as\r\nI have already stated, have come out in greater force--not in favour of\r\nthe Union, nor of the other measures contemplated by the Bill, that has\r\nbeen sent out to this country, but for the daring object so strenuously\r\nadvocated by Mackenzie, familiarly denominated responsible\r\ngovernment.\"[23]\r\n\r\nThe distrust and timidity of Arthur's despatches are shared in by\r\npractically the entire Tory party in its dealings with Canada, after\r\nthe Rebellion.  The Duke of Wellington opposed the Union of the\r\nprovinces, because, among other consequences, \"the union into one\r\nLegislature of the discontented spirits heretofore existing in two\r\nseparate Legislatures will not diminish, but will tend to augment, the\r\ndifficulties attending the administration of the government;\r\nparticularly under the circumstances of the encouragement given to\r\nexpect the establishment in the united province of a local responsible\r\nadministration of government.\"[24]  He {250} was greatly excited when\r\nthe news of Bagot's concessions arrived.  Arbuthnot describes his\r\nchief's mood as one of anger and indignation.  \"What a fool the man\r\nmust have been,\" he kept exclaiming, \"to act as he has done! and what\r\nstuff and nonsense he has written! and what a bother he makes about his\r\npolicy and his measures, when there are no measures but rolling himself\r\nand his country in the mire.\"[25]\r\n\r\nDuring these years, and until late in 1845, Lord Stanley presided at\r\nthe Colonial Office.  Naturally of an arrogant and unyielding temper,\r\nand with something of the convert's fanatic devotion to the political\r\ncreed of his adoption, he administered Canada avowedly on the lines of\r\nLord John Russell's despatch to Poulett Thomson, but with all the\r\nemphasis on the limitations prescribed in that despatch, and in a\r\nspirit singularly irritating.  His conduct towards Bagot exhibited a\r\nconsistent distrust of Canadian self-government; and the fundamental\r\ndefects of his advice to Bagot's successor cannot be better exhibited\r\nthan in the letter warning Metcalfe of \"the extreme risk which would\r\nattend any disruption of the present Conservative party of Canada.\r\nTheir own steadiness {251} and your own firmness and discretion have\r\ngone far towards consolidating them as a party and securing a stable\r\nadministration of the colony.\"[26]  In spite of the warnings of Durham\r\nand Buller, Stanley was aiming at restoring all the ancient\r\nlandmarks--an unpopular executive, a small privileged party \"of the\r\nconnexion,\" and a colony quickly and surely passing from the control of\r\nBritain.  Even after Stanley's resignation, and the accession of an\r\navowed Peelite and free-trader, Gladstone, to his office, the change in\r\ncommercial theory did not at first effect any change in the Colonial\r\nOffice interpretation of the Canadian constitution.  No doubt Gladstone\r\nrecommended Cathcart to ascertain the deliberate sense of the Canadian\r\ncommunity at large, and pay respect to the House of Assembly as the\r\norgan of that sense, but he committed himself and the new\r\ngovernor-general to a strong support of Metcalfe's system, and put him\r\non his guard against \"dishonourable abstract declarations on the\r\nsubject of what has been termed responsible government.\"[27]\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious to follow the subject into every detail of Canadian\r\nadministration; but all {252} existing evidence tends to prove that the\r\nrepresentative men of the British Tory party opposed the new\r\ninterpretation of Canadian rights at every crisis in the period.  In\r\nthe Rebellion Losses debate in 1849, Gladstone, taking in this matter a\r\nview more restricted than that of his leader Peel, held that Elgin\r\nshould have referred to the Home Government at the very first moment,\r\nand before public opinion had been appealed to in the colony.[28]  The\r\nfall of the Whig ministry in 1851 was followed by the first of three\r\nbrief Derby administrations: and the Earl of Derby proved himself to be\r\nmore wedded than he had been as Lord Stanley to the old restrictive\r\nsystem.  The Clergy Reserve dispute was nearing its end, but Derby and\r\nSir John Pakington, his colonial secretary, intervened to introduce one\r\nlast delay, and to give the Bishop of Toronto his last gleam of hope.\r\nThe appointment of Pakington, which, according to Taylor, was treated\r\nwith very general ridicule, was in itself significant: even an ignorant\r\nand retrograde politician was adequate for his task when that task was\r\nobstruction.  After the short-lived Derby administration was over,\r\nPakington continued his defence of Anglican rights in Canada, and\r\nalthough {253} Canadian opinion had declared itself overwhelmingly on\r\nthe other side, he refused to admit that \"the argument of\r\nself-government was so paramount that it ought to over-rule the sacred\r\ndedication of this property.\"\r\n\r\nSo far nothing unexpected has been revealed in the early Victorian\r\ncolonial policy of the Tories.  The party naturally and logically\r\nopposed all forms of democratic control; they stood for the strict\r\nsubordination of the outlying regions to the centre in the\r\nadministration of dependencies; they were, as they had always and\r\neverywhere been, the party of the Church, and of church endowment.  But\r\nit is surprising to find that the party of Wellington and of British\r\nsupremacy varied their doctrine of central authority with very\r\npessimistic prophecies concerning the connection between mother country\r\nand colonies.\r\n\r\nStanley has already been exhibited, during the Bagot and Metcalfe\r\nincidents, as a prophet of pessimism; and at the same period, Peel\r\nseems to have shared in the views of his Colonial Secretary.  \"Let us\r\nkeep Nova Scotia and New Brunswick,\" he said, \"but the connection with\r\nthe Canadas _against their wills_, nay without the cordial co-operation\r\nof the predominant party in Canada, is {254} a very onerous one.  The\r\nsooner we have a distinct understanding on that head the better.  The\r\nadvantage of commercial intercourse is all on the side of the colony,\r\nor at least is not in favour of the mother country.  Why should we go\r\non fighting not our own battle (I speak now of a civil battle) but\r\ntheirs--in a minority in the Legislature, the progress of the contest\r\nwidening daily old differences and begetting new ones!  But above all,\r\nif the people are not cordially with us, why should we contract the\r\ntremendous obligation of having to defend, on a _point of honour_,\r\ntheir territory against American aggression?\"[29]\r\n\r\nTen years later, Tory pessimists still talked of separation.  Lord John\r\nManners, in an oration which showed as much rhetorical effort as it did\r\nlittle sense and information, was prepared for disaster over no more\r\ntragic an issue than the Clergy Reserves.  Concession to local demands\r\non that point for him involved something not far from disruption of the\r\nEmpire.  \"Far better than this, if you really believe it to be\r\nnecessary to acknowledge the virtual independence of Canada, recall\r\nyour Governor-General, call back your army, call home your fleet, and\r\nlet Canada, if she be so {255} minded, establish her independence and\r\ncast off her character as a colony, or seek refuge in the extended arms\r\nof the United States.\"[30]  But perhaps it is not fair to confront a\r\nman with his perorations.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable confession of Tory doubt still remains to be told.\r\nIt is not usually noticed that Disraeli's famous phrase \"these wretched\r\ncolonies will all be independent too in a few years, and are a\r\nmill-stone round our necks,\"[31] was used in connection with Canadian\r\nfishery troubles, and belongs to this same region of imperial\r\npessimism.  There is, however, another less notorious but perfectly\r\nexplicit piece of evidence betraying the fears which at this time\r\ndisturbed the equanimity of the founder of modern imperialism.  He had\r\nbeen speaking of the attempts of liberalism to effect the\r\ndisintegration of the Empire; but the speech, which contained his\r\ncounter-scheme of imperial consolidation, was itself an evidence of\r\ndoubt deeper than that harboured by his opponents.  \"When those subtle\r\nviews were adopted by the country, under the plausible plea of granting\r\n{256} self-government to the Colonies, _I confess that I myself thought\r\nthat the tie was broken_.  Not that I for one object to\r\nself-government.  I cannot conceive how our distant colonies can have\r\ntheir affairs administered except by self-government.  But\r\nself-government, in my opinion, when it is conceded, ought to have been\r\nconceded as part of a great policy of Imperial consolidation.\"[32]\r\nDisraeli was speaking of the views on colonial government, which he had\r\nheld, apparently at the time when Grey and Elgin introduced their new\r\nsystem.  That system had since been developed under Gladstone's\r\nsupervision; and, in 1872, the date of Disraeli's speech, it presented\r\nnot fewer, but more decided signs of colonial independence.  Yet the\r\nstatesman who accused the Whigs and Liberals of planning the disruption\r\nof the Empire, never attempted, when in office, to stay the decline of\r\nimperial unity by any practical scheme of federation, and must be\r\ncounted either singularly indifferent to the interests of the empire,\r\nor sceptical as to its future.  A few years later, when the Imperial\r\nTitles Bill was under discussion, Disraeli again revealed a curious\r\ndisbelief in, or misunderstanding of, the character of the\r\nself-governing colonies.  He had been {257} challenged to defend his\r\ndifferentiation of the royal title in India from that authorized in the\r\nrest of the British Empire.  It would have been easy to confess that an\r\nimperial dignity, appropriate to the East, would have been singularly\r\nout of place in communities more democratic than Britain herself.  But\r\nhe chose to argue from the unsubstantiality of separate colonial\r\nexistence, and the natural inclination of prosperous colonists to make\r\nfor England, the moment their fortunes had been made.  \"The condition\r\nof colonial society,\" he said, \"is of a fluctuating character....\r\nThere is no similarity between the circumstances of our colonial\r\nfellow-subjects and those of our fellow-subjects in India.  Our\r\ncolonists are English; they come and go, they are careful to make\r\nfortunes, to invest their money in England; their interests are\r\nimmense, ramified, complicated, and they have constant opportunities of\r\nimproving and enjoying the relations which exist between themselves and\r\ntheir countrymen in the metropolis.  Their relations to their Sovereign\r\nare ample, they satisfy them.  The colonists are proud of those\r\nrelations, they are interested in the titles of the Queen, they look\r\nforward to return when they {258} leave England, they do return--in\r\nshort they are Englishmen.\"[33]\r\n\r\nIt seems fair to argue from these instances that Disraeli, with all his\r\nimagination and insight, did not, even in 1876, understand the\r\nconstitutional and social self-sufficiency of the greater colonies; or\r\nthe nature of the bond which held them fast to the mother country.  His\r\nconsummate rhetorical skill persuaded the nation to be imperial, while\r\nhe himself doubted the very possibility of permanence in an empire\r\norganized on the only lines--those of strict autonomy--which the\r\ncolonists were willing to sanction.\r\n\r\nSo the party of the earlier British Empire distrusted the foundations\r\nlaid by Durham and his group for a new structure; and behind all their\r\nproclamations of authority, there were ill-concealed fears of another\r\ndeclaration or succession of declarations of independence.\r\n\r\nIt is now time to turn to the central body of imperial opinion--that\r\nwhich used Durham's views as the foundation of a new working theory of\r\ncolonial development.  Its chief exponents were the Whigs of the more\r\nliberal school, who counted {259} Lord John Russell their\r\nrepresentative and leader.\r\n\r\nIt was only at the end of a period dominated by other interests that\r\nLord John Russell was able to turn his attention to colonies, and more\r\nparticularly to Canada.  Even in 1839, the leader of the House of\r\nCommons, and the politician on whom, after all, the fate of the Whig\r\nparty depended, had many other claims on his attention.  He was no\r\ntheorist at general on the subject, and his interest in Canada was\r\nlargely the product of events, not of his own will.  But he came at a\r\ndecisive moment in Canadian history; his tenure of the Colonial Office\r\ncoincided with the period in which Durham's Report exercised its\r\ngreatest influence, and Russell, who had the politician's faculty for\r\nflinging himself with all his force into the issue dominating the\r\npresent, inaugurated what proved to be a new regime in colonial\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nIn attributing so decisive a part to Russell's work at the Colonial\r\nOffice, one need not estimate very highly his powers of initiative or\r\nimagination.  It was Lord John Russell's lot, here as in Parliamentary\r\nReform, to read with honest eyes the defects of the existing system, to\r\ninitiate a great and useful change, and then to predicate finality\r\n{260} of an act, which was really only the beginning of greater\r\nchanges.  But in Canadian politics as in British, he must be credited\r\nwith being better than his words, and with doing nothing to hinder a\r\nmovement which he only partially understood.\r\n\r\nHis ideas have in part been criticized in relation to Lord Sydenham's\r\ngovernor-generalship: in a sense, Sydenham was simply the Russell\r\nsystem incarnate.  But it is well to examine these ideas as a whole.\r\nRussell was a Durhamite \"with a difference.\"  Like Durham he planned a\r\ngenerous measure of self-government, but he was a stricter\r\nconstitutional thinker than Durham.  He reduced to a far finer point\r\nthe difficulty which Durham only slightly felt, about the seat of\r\nultimate authority and responsibility; and his instructions to Sydenham\r\nleft no doubt as to the constitutional superior in Canada.  With\r\ninfinitely shrewder practical insight than his prompter, he refused to\r\nsimplify the problem of executive responsibility, by making the council\r\nsubject to the Assembly in purely domestic matters, and to the Crown\r\nand its representative in external matters.  \"Supposing,\" he said,\r\n\"that you could lay down this broad principle, and say that all\r\nexternal matters {261} should be subject to the home government, and\r\nall internal matters should be governed according to the majority of\r\nthe Assembly, could you carry that principle into effect?  I say, we\r\ncannot abandon the responsibility which is cast upon us as Ministers of\r\nthe Executive of this great Empire.\"[34]  Ultimately the surrender had\r\nto be made, but it was well that Russell should have refused to consent\r\nto what was really a fallacy in Durham's reasoning.  In consequence of\r\nthis position, the Whig leader regarded Bagot's surrender as one,\r\ndifficult perhaps to avoid, but unfortunate in its results, and he was\r\nan unflinching supporter of Metcalfe.  He further declared that he\r\nthought Metcalfe's council had an exaggerated view of their power, and\r\nthat to yield to them would involve dangers to the connection.[35]  The\r\nnovelty involved in his policy lay, however, outside this point of\r\nconstitutional logic: it was a matter of practice, not of theory.  Not\r\nonly did he support Sydenham in those practical reforms in which the\r\nnew political life of Canada began, but in spite of his theory he\r\nreally granted all save the form of full responsibility.  So completely\r\nhad he, and his agent Sydenham, undermined their own imperial {262}\r\nposition, that when Peel's ministry fell in 1846, it was one of the\r\nfirst acts of Lord John Russell, now prime minister, to consent to the\r\ndemolition of his own old theories.  If he may not dispute with Grey\r\nthe credit of having conceded genuine responsibility to Canada, at\r\nleast he did not exercise his authority to forbid the grant.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me, indeed, that Russell definitely modified his position\r\nbetween 1841 and 1847.  At the earlier date he had been a stout\r\nupholder of the supremacy of Britain in Canada, for he believed in the\r\nconnection, and the connection depended on the retention of British\r\nsupremacy.  In the debate of January 16th, 1838, he argued thus for the\r\nEmpire: \"On the preservation of our colonies depends the continuance of\r\nour commercial marine; and on our commercial marine mainly depends our\r\nnaval power; and on our naval power mainly depends the strength and\r\nsupremacy of our arms.\"[36]  It is worthy of note that Charles Buller\r\ntook occasion to challenge this description of the pillars of\r\nempire--it seemed a poor theory to him to make the empire a\r\nstalking-horse for the commerce and interests of the mother country.\r\nBut as events taught Russell surely that the casuistry of 1839 {263}\r\nwas false, and that Responsible Government was both a deeper and a\r\nbroader thing than he had counted it, and yet inevitable, he accepted\r\nthe more radical position.  At the same time, he either came to lay\r\nless stress on the unity of Empire, or he was forced to acknowledge\r\nthat, since Home Rule must be granted, and since with Home Rule\r\nseparation seemed natural, Britain had better practise resignation in\r\nview of a possible disruption.  The best known expression of this phase\r\nin Russell's thought is his speech on Colonial Administration in 1850:\r\n\"I anticipate, indeed, with others that some of the colonies may so\r\ngrow in population and wealth that they may say, 'Our strength is\r\nsufficient to enable us to be independent of England.  The link is now\r\nbecome onerous to us; the time is come when we think we can, in amity\r\nand alliance with England, maintain our independence.'  I do not think\r\nthat that time is yet approaching.  But let us make them as far as\r\npossible fit to govern themselves ... let them increase in wealth and\r\npopulation; and whatever may happen, we of this great empire shall have\r\nthe consolation of saying that we have contributed to the happiness of\r\nthe world.\"[37]  It is possible to {264} argue that because Russell\r\nadmitted that the time for separation was not yet approaching he was\r\ntherefore an optimist.  But the evidence leans rather to the less\r\nglorious side.  It was this speech which kindled Elgin into a passion\r\nand made him bid Grey renounce for himself and his leader the habit of\r\ntelling the colonies that the colonial is a provisional existence.  The\r\nsame speech, too, extorted complaints from Robert Baldwin, the man whom\r\nSydenham and Russell had once counted half a traitor.  \"I never saw him\r\nso much moved,\" wrote Elgin, to whom Baldwin had frankly said about a\r\nrecent meeting.  \"My audience was disposed to regard a prediction of\r\nthis nature proceeding from a Prime Minister, less as a speculative\r\nabstraction than as one of that class of prophecies which work their\r\nown fulfilment.\"[38]  The speech was not an accidental or occasional\r\nflash of rhetoric.  The mind of the Whig leader, acquiescing now in the\r\ncompleteness of Canadian local powers, and reading with disquiet the\r\nsigns of the times in the form of Canadian turbulence, seems to have\r\nturned to speculate on the least harmful form which separation might\r\ntake.  Of this there is direct evidence in a private letter from Grey\r\nto Elgin: \"Lord {265} John in a letter I had from him yesterday,\r\nexpresses a good deal of anxiety as to the prospects of Canada, and\r\nreverts to the old idea of forming a federal union of all the British\r\nprovinces, in order to give them something more to think of than their\r\nmere local squabbles;[39] and he says that if to effect this a\r\nseparation of the two Canadas were necessary he should see no objection\r\nto it.  His wish in forming such a union would be to bring about such a\r\nstate of things, that, _if you should lose our North American\r\nprovinces, they might be likely to become an independent state, instead\r\nof being merged in the Union_.\"[40]\r\n\r\nRussell moved then at this period through a most interesting\r\ndevelopment of views.  His initial position was a blend of firm\r\nimperialism and generous liberal concession, the latter more especially\r\ninspired by Durham.  As his genuine sympathies with liberty and\r\ndemocracy operated on his political views, these steadily changed in\r\nthe direction of a more complete surrender to Canadian demands.  But,\r\nsince, in spite of his sympathies, he still remained logical, and since\r\nhe had believed the connection to depend on {266} the\r\ngovernor-general's supremacy, the modification of that supremacy\r\ninvolved the weakening of his hopes of empire.  If the change seem\r\nsomewhat to his discredit, his best defence lies in the fact that Peel,\r\nwho made a very similar modification of his mind on Canadian politics,\r\nwas also contemplating in these years a similar separation.  \"The\r\nutility of our connexion with Canada,\" he said in 1844, \"must depend\r\nupon its being continued with perfect goodwill by the majority of the\r\npopulation.  It would be infinitely better that that connexion should\r\nbe discontinued, rather than that it should be continued by force and\r\nagainst the general feeling and conviction of the people.\"[41]  Indeed,\r\nRussell seems to have been accompanied on his dolorous journey by all\r\nthe Peelites and not a few of the Whigs.  \"There begins to prevail in\r\nthe House of Commons,\" wrote Grey to Elgin in 1849, \"and I am sorry to\r\nsay in the highest quarters, an opinion (which I believe to be utterly\r\nerroneous) that we have no interest in preserving our colonies and\r\nought therefore to make no sacrifice for that purpose.  Peel, Graham,\r\nand Gladstone, if they do not avow this opinion as openly as Cobden and\r\nhis friends, yet betray very clearly that they {267} entertain it, nor\r\ndo I find some members of the Cabinet free from it.\"[42]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the direction of colonial affairs had fallen to the writer\r\nof the letter just quoted: from the formation of the Russell ministry\r\nin 1846 until its fall, Earl Grey was the dominant force in British\r\ncolonial policy.  Unlike Russell, Grey was not so much a politician\r\ninterested in the great parliamentary game, as an expert who had\r\ndevoted most of his attention to colonial and economic subjects.\r\nConsciously or unconsciously, he had imbibed many of Wakefield's ideas,\r\nand in that period of triumphant free trade, he came to office resolute\r\nto administer the colonies on free-trade principles.  It said much for\r\nthe fixity and consistency of his ideas of colonial administration\r\nthat, unlike Russell, Buller, and others, he had not been misled by the\r\nMetcalfe incident.  \"The truth is,\" he said of Metcalfe, \"he did not\r\ncomprehend responsible government at all, nor from his Indian\r\nexperience is this wonderful.\"[43]\r\n\r\nThe most comprehensive description of the Grey regime is that it\r\npractised _laissez faire_ principles in colonial administration as they\r\nnever had been {268} practised before.  Under him Canada first enjoyed\r\nthe advantages or disadvantages of free trade, and escaped from the\r\nshackles of the Navigation Laws.  Grey and Elgin co-operated to bring\r\nthe Clergy Reserve troubles to an end, although the Whigs fell before\r\nthe final steps could be taken.  Grey secured imperial sanction for\r\nchanges in the Union Act of 1840, granting the French new privileges\r\nfor their language, and the colony free control of its own finances.\r\nBut all these were subordinate in importance to the attitude of the new\r\nminister towards the whole question of Canadian autonomy, and its\r\nrelation to the Imperial Parliament.  That attitude may be examined in\r\nrelation to the responsibility of the Canadian executive, the powers of\r\nthe Imperial Parliament, the occasions on which these powers might be\r\nfitly used, and the bearing of all the innovations on the position of\r\nCanada within the British Empire.\r\n\r\nGrey's policy with regard to Responsible Government was simple.  As\r\nCanadians viewed the term, and within the very modest limits set to it\r\nby them, he surrendered the whole position.  So much has already been\r\nsaid on this point in connection with Elgin, that it need not be\r\nfurther elaborated.  Yet, since there might linger a suspicion that the\r\n{269} policy was that rather of the governor than of the minister,\r\nGrey's position may be given in a despatch written to Sir John Harvey\r\nin Nova Scotia, before Elgin went to Canada.\r\n\r\n\"The object,\" wrote Grey, \"with which I recommend to you this course is\r\nthat of making it apparent that any transfer, which may take place, of\r\npolitical power from the hands of one party to those of another is the\r\nresult, not of an act of yours, but of the wishes of the people\r\nthemselves, as shown by the difficulty experienced by the retiring\r\nparty in carrying on the government of the Province according to the\r\nforms of the Constitution.  To this I attach great importance; I have\r\ntherefore to instruct you to abstain from changing your Executive\r\nCouncil until it shall become perfectly clear that they are unable with\r\nsuch fair support from yourself as they have a right to expect, to\r\ncarry on the government of the province satisfactorily, and command the\r\nconfidence of the Legislature....  In giving all fair and proper\r\nsupport to your Council for the time being, you will carefully avoid\r\nany acts which can possibly be supposed to imply the slightest personal\r\nobjection to their opponents, and also refuse to assent to any measures\r\nwhich may be {270} proposed to you by your Council, which may appear to\r\nyou to involve an improper exercise of the authority of the Crown for\r\nparty rather than for public objects.  In exercising however this power\r\nof refusing to sanction measures which may be submitted to you by your\r\nCouncil, you must recollect that this power of opposing a check upon\r\nextreme measures, proposed by the party for the time in the Government,\r\ndepends entirely for its efficacy upon its being used sparingly and\r\nwith the greatest possible discretion.  A refusal to accept advice\r\ntendered to you by your Council is a legitimate ground for its members\r\nto tender to you their resignation--a course they would doubtless\r\nadopt, should they feel that the subject on which a difference had\r\narisen between you and themselves was one upon which public opinion\r\nwould be in their favour.  Should it prove to be so, concession to\r\ntheir views must sooner or later become inevitable, since it cannot be\r\ntoo distinctly acknowledged that it is neither possible nor desirable\r\nto carry on the government of any of the British Provinces in North\r\nAmerica, in opposition to the opinion of the inhabitants.\"[44]\r\n\r\nIn strict accordance with this plan, Grey gave {271} Elgin the most\r\nloyal support in introducing responsible government into Canada, and,\r\nin a note written not long after Papineau had once more awakened the\r\npolitical echoes with a distinctly disloyal address, he expressed his\r\nwillingness to include even the old rebel in the ministerial\r\narrangement, should that be insisted on by the leaders of a party which\r\ncould command a majority.[45]\r\n\r\nComplete as was the concession made by Grey to local claims, it would,\r\nnevertheless, be a grave error to think that he left no space for the\r\nassertion of imperial authority.  No doubt it was part of his system to\r\nreduce to a minimum the occasions on which interference should be\r\nnecessary, but that such occasions might occur, and demand sudden and\r\npowerful action from Britain, he ever held.  Even in matters of a\r\ncharacter purely domestic, he believed, with Lord John Russell, that\r\nintervention might be necessary, and he desired to prevent danger, not\r\nby minimizing the powers of the imperial authority, but by exercising\r\nthem with great discretion.[46]  It was perhaps with this conservation\r\nof central power in view that {272} he was willing to transfer to the\r\nBritish treasury the responsibility of paying the salary of the\r\ngovernor-general, provided the colonists would take over some part of\r\nthe expenses and difficulties of Canadian defence.  But the extent to\r\nwhich he was prepared to exalt the supremacy is best illustrated in the\r\ncontrol of imperial commerce.  A great change had just been made in the\r\neconomic system of Britain.  Free trade was then to its adherents not\r\nan arguable position, but a kind of gospel; and men like Grey, who had\r\nsomething of the propagandist about them, were inclined to compel\r\nothers to come in.  Now, unfortunately for Canada, free trade appeared\r\nthere first rather as foe than as friend.  As has already been seen,\r\nthe measures of 1846 overturned the arrangement made by Stanley in\r\n1843, whereby a preference given to Canadian flour had stimulated a\r\ngreat activity in the milling and allied industries; and the removal of\r\nthe restrictions imposed by the Navigation Acts did not take place till\r\n1849.  At the same time the United States, the natural market for\r\nCanadian products, showed little inclination to listen to talk of\r\nreciprocity; and the Canadians, seemingly deprived of pre-existing\r\nadvantages by Peel's action, talked of retaliation as a means of {273}\r\nbettering their position, at least in relation to the United States.\r\nGrey, however, was an absolute believer in the magic powers of free\r\ntrade.  \"When we rejected all considerations of what is called\r\nreciprocity,\" he wrote to Elgin, \"and boldly got rid of our protective\r\nduties without inquiring whether other nations would meet us or not,\r\nthe effect was immediately seen in the increase of our exports, and the\r\nprosperity of our manufactures.\"[47]  Canada, then, in his opinion\r\ncould retaliate most effectively, not by setting up a tariff against\r\nthe United States, but by opening her ports more freely then before.\r\nHe had a vision, comparable although in contrast, to that of believers\r\nin an imperial tariff, of an empire with its separate parts bound to\r\neach other by a general freedom of trade.  Besides all this, he had a\r\nfirm trust that the evils which other nations less free than Britain\r\nmight for a time inflict on her trade by their prohibitions, would\r\nshortly end, since all would be convinced by the example of Britain and\r\nwould follow it.  Under these circumstances he set imperial policy\r\nagainst local prejudice, and wrote to his governor-general: \"I do trust\r\nyou will be able to prevent the attempt to enter upon that silliest of\r\nall silly policies, the {274} meeting of commercial restrictions by\r\ncounter restrictions; _indeed it is a matter to be very seriously\r\nconsidered, whether we can avoid disallowing any acts of this kind\r\nwhich may be passed_.\"[48]\r\n\r\nIn spite, then, of the present thoroughness of Grey's conversion to the\r\nCanadian position with regard to Home Rule, there was for him still an\r\nempire operating through the Houses at Westminster and the Crown\r\nministers, and striking in, possibly on rare occasions, but, when\r\nnecessary, with a heavy hand.  To such a man, too, belief in the\r\npermanence of empire was natural.  There are fewer waverings on the\r\npoint in Grey's writings than in those of any of his contemporaries,\r\nDurham, Buller, and Elgin alone excepted.  He had, indeed, as his\r\nprivate correspondence shows, moments of gloom.  Under the strain of\r\nthe Montreal riots, and the insults to Elgin in 1849, he wrote: \"I\r\nconfess that looking at these indications of the state of feeling\r\nthere, and at the equally significant indications to the feelings in\r\nthe House of Commons, respecting the value of our colonies, I begin\r\nalmost to despair of our long retaining those in North America; while I\r\nam persuaded that to both parties a hasty separation will be a very\r\nserious {275} evil.\"[49]  Elgin's robust faith, and perfect knowledge,\r\nhowever, set him right.  Indeed, in tracing the growth of Grey's\r\ncolonial policy, it is impossible for anyone to mistake the evidences\r\nof Elgin's influence; and the chapter on Canada in his _Colonial\r\nPolicy_ owes almost more to Elgin than it does to the avowed author.\r\nHis final position may be stated thus.  The empire was to the advantage\r\nof England, for, apart from other reasons, her place among the nations\r\ndepended on the colonies, and the act of separation would also be one\r\nof degradation.  The empire was an unspeakable benefit to the colonies:\r\n\"To us,\" he once wrote in a moment of doubt, \"except the loss of\r\nprestige (no slight one I admit) the loss of Canada would be the loss\r\nof little but a source of heavy expense and great anxiety, while to the\r\nCanadians, the loss of our protection, and of our moderating influence\r\nto restrain the excesses of their own factions, would be one of the\r\ngreatest that can be conceived.\"[50]  But, apart from these lower loss\r\nand gain calculations, to Grey the British Empire was a potent\r\ninstrument, essential to the peace and soundness of the world, and he\r\nexpected the {276} provinces to which he had conceded British rights,\r\nto rally to uphold British standards through a united and loyal\r\nimperial federation.  Those were still days when Britain counted\r\nherself, and not without justification, a means of grace to the less\r\nfortunate remainder of mankind.  \"The authority of the British Crown is\r\nat this moment the most powerful instrument, under Providence, of\r\nmaintaining peace and order in many extensive regions of the earth, and\r\nthereby assists in diffusing among millions of the human race, the\r\nblessings of Christianity and civilization.  Supposing it were clear\r\n(which I am far from admitting) that a reduction of our national\r\nexpenditure (otherwise impracticable) to the extent of a few hundred\r\nthousands a year, could be effected by withdrawing our authority and\r\nprotection from our numerous Colonies, would we be justified, for the\r\nsake of such a saving, in taking this step, and thus abandoning the\r\nduty which seems to have been cast upon us?\"[51]\r\n\r\nSuch, then, was the imperial policy of Britain under the man who\r\ncarried it farthest forward, before the great renaissance at the end of\r\nQueen Victoria's reign.  To Grey, Canada was all that it had meant to\r\nDurham--a province peopled by {277} subjects of the Queen, and one\r\ndestined by providence to have a great future--a fundamental part of\r\nthe Empire, and one without which the imperial whole must be something\r\nmeaner and less glorious.  Like Durham he planned for it a constitution\r\non the most generous lines, and conferred great gifts upon it.  And, in\r\nexchange, he claimed a loyalty proportionate to the generosity of the\r\nCrown, and a propriety of political behaviour worthy of citizens of so\r\ngreat a state.  In the last resort he held that in abnormal crises, or\r\nin response to great and beneficial policies, Canadians must forget\r\ntheir provincial outlook, or, if they could not, at least accept the\r\nruling of an imperial parliament and a crown more enlightened and\r\nauthoritative on these matters than a colonial ministry or people could\r\nbe.  Having conceded all the rights essential to a free existence, he\r\nmentioned duties, and called the sum of these duties Empire.\r\n\r\nThe concluding stage in the evolution of mid-Victorian opinion\r\nconcerning Canada, which must now be described, differs essentially\r\nfrom the earlier stages, although, as it seems to me, the chief factor\r\nin the development is still Durham and his group.  It is the period of\r\nseparatism.\r\n\r\nOne thing has appeared very prominently in the {278} foregoing\r\nargument--the prevalence of a fear, or even a fixed belief, that the\r\nconnection between Britain and Canada must soon cease.  Excluding, for\r\nthe present, the entire group of extreme radicals, there was hardly a\r\nstatesman of the earlier years of Victoria, who had not confessed that\r\nCanada must soon leave England, or be left.  Many instances have been\r\nalready cited.  Among the Tories, Stanley thought that Bagot had\r\nalready begun the process of separation, and that Metcalfe's failure\r\nwould involve the end of the connection.  Peel, ever judicial, gave his\r\nverdict in favour of separation, should Canadians persist in resenting\r\nimperial action.  As Lord John Russell's view of autonomy expanded, his\r\nhopes for continued British supremacy contracted; and, on the evidence\r\nof a letter from Grey quoted above, Russell was not alone among the\r\nWhigs in his opinion, nor Peel among his immediate followers.  The\r\nreckless and partizan use of the term Little-Englander has largely\r\nconcealed the fact that apart from Durham, whose faith was not called\r\nupon to bear the test of experience, and Buller, Grey, and Elgin, who\r\nhad special grounds for their confidence, all the responsible\r\npoliticians of the years between 1840 and 1860 moved steadily towards a\r\n\"Little England\" position.  {279} The reasons for that movement are\r\nworthy of examination.\r\n\r\nSo far as the Tories were concerned, the change, already traced in\r\ndetail, was not unnatural.  In the eighteenth century, the colonies,\r\npossessed of just that responsible government for which Canadian\r\nreformers were clamouring, had with one accord left the Empire.  The\r\nearlier nineteenth century had witnessed in the British American\r\ncolonies a steadily increasing demand for the liberties, formerly\r\npossessed by the New England states.  Representative assemblies had\r\nbeen granted; then a modified form of responsibility of the executive\r\nto these assemblies; then the complete surrender of executive to\r\nlegislature.  Attempts had been made to gain some countervailing powers\r\nby bargain; but, in Canada, the civil list had now been surrendered to\r\nlocal control, the endowment of the Church of England was practically\r\nat an end, patronage was in the hands of the provincial ministry, and\r\nall the exceptions which the central authority had claimed as essential\r\nto its continued existence followed in the wake of the lost executive\r\nsupremacy.  Neither Whigs nor Tories quite understood how an Empire was\r\npossible, in which there was no definite federating principle; or, if\r\nthere {280} were, where the federating principle existed only to be\r\nneutralized as, one by one, the restrictions imposed by it were felt by\r\nthe colonists to be annoying to their sense of freedom.  Empire on\r\nthese terms seemed to mean simply a capacity in the mother country for\r\nindefinite surrender.  The accomplishment of the purpose proclaimed by\r\nDurham, Russell, and Grey, would, to a Tory even less peremptory than\r\nthe Duke of Wellington, mean the end of the connection; and as they\r\nfelt, so they spoke and acted.  They were separatists, not of\r\ngood-will, but from necessity and the nature of things.\r\n\r\nAmong the Whigs, an even more important process was at work.  By 1850\r\nthe disintegration of the Whig party was already far advanced.\r\nFinality in reform had already been found impossible, and Russell and\r\nthe advanced men were slowly drawing ahead of conservatives like\r\nMelbourne and Palmerston.  After 1846, the liberalizing power of Peel's\r\nsteady scientific intelligence was at work, transforming the ideas of\r\nhis allies, as he had formerly shattered those of his old friends, and,\r\nof Peel's followers, Gladstone at least seemed to be looking in the\r\nsame direction as his master--towards administrative liberalism.  The\r\n{281} Whig creed and programme were in the melting pot.  Now, what made\r\nthe final product not Whig, but Liberal, was on the whole the\r\nincreasing influence of the parliamentary Radicals; and in colonial\r\nmatters the Radicals, who told on the revived and quickened Whig party,\r\nwere pronouncedly in favour of separation.  It is too often assumed\r\nthat the imperial creed of Durham and Buller was shared in by their\r\nfellow Radicals.  That is a grave mistake.  One may trace a descent\r\ntowards separatism from Molesworth to Roebuck and Brougham.  In\r\nMolesworth, the tendency was comparatively slight.  No doubt in 1837,\r\nunder the stress of the news of rebellion, he had proclaimed the end of\r\nthe British dominion in America as his sincere desire.[52]  But he\r\nbelieved in a colonial empire, if England would only guarantee good\r\ngovernment.  \"The emancipation of colonies,\" he said, in a cooler mood,\r\n\"must be a question of time and a question, in each case, of special\r\nexpediency ... a question which would seldom or never arise between a\r\ncolony and its mother country if all colonies were well governed\"; and\r\nhe explained his language about Canada on grounds of bad government.\r\n\"I hope that the people of {282} that country (Lower Canada) will\r\neither recover the constitution which we have violated, or become\r\nwholly independent of us.\"[53]  It is not necessary to quote Hume's\r\nconfused but well-intentioned wanderings--views sharing with those of\r\nthe people whom Hume represented, their crude philanthropy and\r\nimperfect clearness.  But Roebuck marked a definite stage in advance;\r\nfor, while he was willing to keep \"the connexion,\" where it could be\r\nkept with honour, he seems to have regarded separation as\r\ninevitable--\"come it must,\" he said--and his best hopes were that the\r\nseparation might take place in amity and that a British North American\r\nfederation might counterbalance the Union to the south.[54]  Grote's\r\nplacid and facile radicalism accepted the growing breach with Canada as\r\nthe most desirable thing which could happen both to the mother country\r\nand the colony; and Brougham directed all his eccentric and ill-ordered\r\nenergy and eloquence, not only to denounce the Whig leaders, but to\r\nproclaim the necessity of the new Canadian republic.  \"Not only do I\r\nconsider the possession as worth no breach of the Constitution ... but\r\nin a national view I really hold those colonies to {283} be worth\r\nnothing.  I am well assured that we shall find them very little worth\r\nthe cost they have entailed on us, in men, in money, and in injuries to\r\nour trade; nay, that their separation will be even now a positive gain,\r\nso it be effected on friendly terms, and succeeded by an amicable\r\nintercourse.\"[55]\r\n\r\nSeparation was indubitably a dogma of philosophic radicalism; and yet\r\nit was not so much the influence of this metaphysical and doctrinaire\r\nbelief which moved Whig opinion.  It was rather the plain business-like\r\nand matter-of-fact radicalism of the economist statesmen, led by Bright\r\nand Cobden.  Of the two forces represented by Peel and by Cobden, which\r\ncompleted the formation of a modern Liberal party, the latter was on\r\nthe whole the stronger; and Bright and Cobden took the views of their\r\nRadical predecessors, and out of airy and ineffectual longings created\r\nsolid political facts.  \"I cannot disguise from myself,\" wrote Grey to\r\nElgin in 1850, \"that opinion in this country is tending more and more\r\nto the rejection of any burden whatever, on account of our colonies\";\r\nand the reason for the tendency was certainly the purely economic views\r\nto which {284} Cobden was accustoming Britain, and the cogency of the\r\narguments by which he was driving amateur politicians from their\r\nearlier indefensible positions.  That trade was all-important, and that\r\nthe operations of trade disregarded the irrelevant facts of nationality\r\nand race; that no one community could interfere in the social and\r\npolitical life of another without disaster to both; that the defence of\r\ncolonies was not only dangerous to peace as provoking suspicious\r\nneighbours, but needless expense to the mother country; in short that\r\n_laissez-faire_ was the dominating principle in politics, and that\r\n_laissez-faire_ shattered the earlier dreams of imperial supremacy and\r\ncolonial dependency--these were the views introduced by Cobden and\r\nBright into a newly awakened and imperfectly educated England; and they\r\nplayed just such havoc with earlier political ideas, as Darwin and\r\nevolution did with pre-existing theological orthodoxy.[56]\r\n\r\nIt was hardly wonderful then that the Whigs moved steadily onward until\r\nthey almost acquiesced in the idea of imperial disruption; and, since\r\nPeel {285} had left his party moved almost wholly by Cobden's economic\r\npropaganda, it was not unnatural that the Peelites should share the\r\nviews of their Whig allies.  It is indeed possible to find some cold\r\nconsolation in Gladstone's Chester speech in 1855, when he predicted\r\nthat if only the colonies were left freedom of judgment, it would be\r\nhard to say when the day of separation might come.[57]  But Grey had\r\nalready suspected Gladstone of pessimism on the point, and we now know\r\nthat as an imperialist Gladstone's course from 1855 had a downward\r\ntendency.  He could not resist the arguments of his Radical friends and\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the important relevant facts and events which concerned the\r\nconnection after 1846 assisted these party movements towards belief in\r\nseparation.\r\n\r\nGrey, whose confidence in the beneficial results of free trade\r\nchallenged that of Cobden himself, believed that with Protection there\r\nvanished an awkward enemy of the connection between Canada and\r\nBritain.[58]  But Grey was unmistakably doctrinaire on the point.\r\nElgin warned him, again and again, of \"the uneasy feeling which the\r\n{286} free-trade policy of the mother country ... has tended to produce\r\nin the colonial mind,\"[59] and that uneasiness passed gradually over to\r\nBritain.  It would be to trespass unduly beyond the limits prescribed\r\nin this essay to deal with the introduction of the Canadian tariff in\r\n1858 and 1859; yet the statements of Galt who introduced the budget in\r\nthe latter year strike the reader now, as they must have struck the\r\nBritish reader then, with a sense that the connection was practically\r\nat an end: \"The government of Canada cannot, through those feelings of\r\ndeference which they owe to the Imperial authorities, in any measure\r\nwaive or diminish the right of the people of Canada to decide for\r\nthemselves both as to the mode and extent to which taxation shall be\r\nimposed....  The Imperial government are not responsible for the debts\r\nand engagements of Canada.  They do not maintain its judicial,\r\neducational, or civil service.  They contribute nothing to the internal\r\ngovernment of the country; and the Provincial Legislature, acting\r\nthrough a ministry directly responsible to it, has to make provision\r\nfor all these wants.  They must necessarily claim and exercise the\r\nwidest latitude, as to the nature, and {287} the extent of the burdens,\r\nto be placed upon the industry of the people.\"[60]  There was almost\r\neverything to be said in favour of this enlightened selfishness; and\r\nyet a growing coolness on the part of British legislators was, under\r\nthe circumstances, very comprehensible.  It was all the more so,\r\nbecause the innovations in Canada influenced British diplomacy in its\r\nrelations with the United States; and between 1854, the date of Elgin's\r\nReciprocity Treaty, and 1867, British statesmen learned some of the\r\ncurious ramifications of their original gift of autonomy to Canada.  In\r\ndiplomacy as in economic relations, their appreciation of the value of\r\nthe connection did not increase.\r\n\r\nParallel with this disruptive tendency in the new economic policy,\r\nanother in military matters began to make itself felt.  As Canada\r\nreceived her successive grants of liberties, and ever new liberties,\r\nthe imperial authorities began to consider the advisability of\r\nwithdrawing imperial troops by degrees, and of leaving Canada to meet\r\nthe ordinary demands of her own defence.  Grey and Elgin had\r\ncorresponded largely on the point; and the result had been a very\r\ngeneral reduction of British troops {288} in Canada, the assumption\r\nbeing that Canada would look to her own protection.  To discover the\r\ncharacter of the change thus introduced, and its bearing on imperial\r\npolitics, it again becomes necessary to travel beyond the limit set,\r\nand to examine its results between 1860 and 1867.  In these years the\r\nmilitary situation developed new and alarming possibilities for Canada.\r\nThe re-organization of the Canadian tariff excited much ill-feeling in\r\nthe United States, for it seemed an infringement of the arrangements\r\nmade by Elgin in 1854.[61]  Then followed the _Trent_ episode, the\r\ndestruction created by the _Alabama_, the questionable policy both of\r\nEngland and of Canada in taking sides, no matter how informally, in the\r\nwar.  In addition, the Irish-American section of the population, which\r\nhad furnished its share, both of rank and file, and of leaders, to the\r\nwar, was in those years bitterly hostile to the British Empire, and\r\nplotted incessantly some secret stroke which should wound Britain\r\nthrough Canada.  The gravest danger threatening British peace and\r\nsupremacy at that time lay, not in Europe, but along the Canadian {289}\r\nfrontier, nor would it be fair to say that Britain alone, not Canada,\r\nhad helped to provoke the threatened American attack.  Under these\r\ncircumstances, partly because of the expense, but partly also through\r\nfactiousness and provincial shortsightedness, the Canadian assembly\r\nrejected a scheme for providing an adequate militia, and left a\r\nsituation quite impossible from the military point of view.  Instantly\r\na storm of criticism broke over the heads of the colonies, so bitter\r\nand unqualified that there are those who believe that to this day the\r\nmutual relations of Britain and Canada have never quite recovered their\r\nold sincerity.[62]  A member of the Canadian parliament, who was\r\ntravelling at the time in England, found the country in arms against\r\nhis province: \"You have no idea of the feeling that exists here about\r\nthe Militia Bill, and the defences of Canada generally.  No one will\r\nbelieve that there is not a want of loyalty among the Canadians, and\r\nwhenever I try to defend Canada, the answer is always the same, that\r\n'the English look for actions not assertions'; many hard and unjust\r\nthings are now said about the country, all of which add strength to the\r\nGoldwin Smith party, which, after {290} all, is not a very small one;\r\nand the Derbyites make no secret of what they would do if they were in\r\npower,--let Canada take her chance.\"[63]  Even Earl Grey was prepared,\r\nat that crisis, to submit to the British and Canadian parliaments a\r\nclear issue, calling on the latter to afford adequate support to the\r\nBritish forces left in British North America, or to permit the last of\r\nthem to leave a country heedless of its own safety.[64]  From that time\r\nforth, more especially after Lee, Jackson, Grant, and Sherman had\r\nrevealed the military possibilities of the American Republic, even\r\nmilitary men began to accept the strategic arguments against the\r\nretention of Canada as unanswerable, and joined the ranks of those who\r\ncalled for separation.  Richard Cartwright, who had opportunities for\r\ntesting British opinion, more especially among military officers, found\r\na universal agreement that Canada was indefensible, and that separation\r\nhad better take place, before rather than after war.[65]  So John\r\nBright and the leaders of the British army had at last found a point in\r\ndiplomacy and strategy on which they might agree.\r\n\r\n{291}\r\n\r\nA considerable portion of authoritative British opinion has now been\r\ntraversed; and beneath all its contradictions and varieties a deep\r\ngeneral tendency has been discovered.  That tendency made for the\r\nseparation of Canada from England and the Empire.  It is strange to see\r\nhow resolutely writers have evaded the conclusion, and yet, if the\r\nviews discussed above have been fairly stated, only four men of note\r\nand authority, Durham, Buller, Elgin, and Grey remained unaffected by\r\nthe growing pessimism of the time, and of these, the last seemed at the\r\nend to find it difficult to maintain the confidence of 1853 under the\r\ntrials of 1862.  Britain was, in fact, undergoing a great secular\r\nchange of policy.  She had been driven, step by step, from the old\r\nposition of supremacy and authority.  As in commerce the security of\r\nprotection had been abandoned for the still doubtful advantages of free\r\ntrade, so, in the colonies, the former cast-iron system of imperial\r\ncontrol had been abandoned for one of _laissez-faire_ and\r\nself-government.  It would have been impossible for British statesmen\r\nto follow any other course than that which they actually chose.\r\nSelf-government, and self-government to the last detail and corollary\r\nof the argument they must perforce concede.  But {292} in the stress of\r\ntheir imperial necessities, it was not strange that they should discern\r\nall the signs of disruption, rather than the gleams of hope; and men\r\nlike Disraeli who claimed at a later date that they had never despaired\r\nof the Empire, did so at the expense of their sincerity, and could do\r\nso only because the false remedies they prescribed were happily\r\nincapable of application.  Little Englandism, if that unfortunate term\r\nmay be used to describe an essential and inevitable phase of imperial\r\nexpansion, was the creed of all but one or two of the most capable and\r\ndaring statesmen of the mid-Victorian age.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, while they had exhausted the materials for their\r\nargument so far as these lay in Britain, they had all failed to regard\r\nthe one really important factor in the situation--the inclinations of\r\nthe Canadian people.  For the connection of Britain with Canada\r\ndepended less on what the ministers of the Crown thought of Canada than\r\non what the Canadians thought of their mother country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] In Fenwick (Scotland), the Improvement of Knowledge Society\r\ndiscussed Canadian affairs on 1 January, 1839, when James Taylor\r\nproposed the sentiment, \"The speedy success of the Canadian struggle\r\nfor emancipation from British thraldom.\"  The toast, according to the\r\nminute book, was enthusiastically honoured.\r\n\r\n[2] Elgin-Grey Correspondence: Elgin to Grey, 1 November, 1851.\r\n\r\n[3] Elgin-Grey Correspondence: Grey to Elgin, 11 May, 1849.\r\n\r\n[4] Allin and Jones, _Annexation, Preferential Trade, and Reciprocity_,\r\nChap.

It is the object\r\nof this chapter to trace the more important of these as they appeared\r\nin the institutions and public life of Canada, and in the modification\r\nof Canadian sentiment towards Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious and natural effect of Elgin's concessions was a\r\nrevolution in the programmes of the provincial parties, and in their\r\nrelations to each other and to government.  It may be remembered that\r\nall the governors of the period agreed in reprobating the factiousness\r\nand pettiness of Canadian party politics.  Even Elgin had been unable\r\nto see very much rationality in their methods.  There was, he held,\r\nlittle of public principle to divide {294} men, apart from the\r\nfundamental question of responsible government.[1]  But it is possible\r\nto underestimate the reality and importance of the party system as it\r\nexisted down to 1847.  To have admitted that men differed on the\r\nprinciple of responsible government, was to have admitted that party\r\nstrife had some justification; and all the other details--affections\r\nand antipathies, national, sectarian, and personal--were the\r\ncircumstances natural to party life as that life has everywhere come\r\ninto existence.  Burke himself sought no higher ground for the grouping\r\nof men into parties than that of family connection, and common\r\nfriendships and enmities.  No doubt the squalor and pettiness of early\r\nCanadian party life contrasted meanly with the glories of the\r\neighteenth century Whigs, and the struggles of Fox and Pitt.  But a\r\nnation must begin somewhere, and these trivial divisions received a\r\nkind of consecration when they centred round the discussion of colonial\r\nself-government.  After all, so long as autonomy was only partially\r\nconceded, and so long as men felt impelled to take opposite sides on\r\nthat subject, it was foolish to deny that there were Canadian parties,\r\nand that their differences were of some importance.\r\n\r\n{295}\r\n\r\nMoreover, before 1847 there were other good reasons for the existence\r\nof two distinct parties.  It was true, as Sydenham had said, that the\r\nBritish party names were not quite appropriate to the parties in Canada\r\nwho had adopted them.  Yet there were some links between British and\r\nCanadian parties.  The British and the Canadian Tories had, in 1840,\r\nmany views in common.  In a time of change both stood for a pronounced\r\ndistrust of democracy; both regarded the creation of responsible\r\ngovernment in Canada as disastrous to the connection; both were the\r\ndefenders of Church and State.  On the other hand, it was not\r\nunnatural, as Elgin came to see, to compare the party led by Baldwin\r\nand La Fontaine with the Reformers in England who looked to Lord John\r\nRussell as their true leader.  Until the political traditions, which\r\nmost of the recent immigrants had brought with them from Britain, had\r\ndisappeared or been transformed into a new Canadian tradition, and so\r\nlong as certain grave constitutional defects which cried for remedy\r\nremained unaltered, Canadian Tories and Reformers must exist, and\r\ngovernment, as Metcalfe discovered, was impossible, unless it\r\nrecognized in these provincial divisions the motive power of local\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\n{296}\r\n\r\nBut between 1847 and 1854 the foundations of these earlier parties had\r\nbeen, not so much undermined, as entirely removed.  \"The continuance of\r\nagitation on these intensely exciting questions,\" wrote Elgin in his\r\nlatest despatch from Canada, \"was greatly to be deprecated, and their\r\nsettlement, on terms which command the general acquiescence of those\r\nwho are most deeply interested, can hardly fail to be attended with\r\nresults in a high degree beneficial.\"[2]  Elgin had removed the reason\r\nfor existence of both parties by settling the issues which divided\r\nthem.  At the same time, the growth of a political life different from\r\nthat of Britain, had, year by year, made the British names more\r\ninappropriate.  John A. Macdonald, the leader of those who had once\r\ncalled themselves Tories, was confessing the change when he wrote, in\r\n1860, \"While I have always been a member of what is called the\r\nConservative party, I could never have been called a Tory, although\r\nthere is no man who more respects what is called old-fogey Toryism than\r\nI do, so long as it is based upon principle.\"[3]  The fierce battles\r\nover constitutional theories, {297} which a series of British governors\r\nand governments had so long deprecated, had at last been eliminated by\r\nthe natural development of Canadian political life.\r\n\r\nThe same natural development provided a substitute for the older party\r\nsystem.  Elgin, as has been seen, belonged to the group of Peelites,\r\nwho, during the lifetime of their leader and long after it, endeavoured\r\nto solve the new administrative problems of the nineteenth century\r\nwithout too strict an adherence to party programmes and lines of\r\ndivision.  Curiously enough, he was the chief agent in stimulating a\r\nsimilar political movement in Canada.  There was, however, this\r\ndifference, that while in Peel's case, and still more in that of his\r\nfollowers, the British party tradition proved overwhelmingly powerful,\r\nin Canada, where tradition was weaker, and the need for sound\r\nadministration far more vital, the movement became dominant in the form\r\nof Liberal-conservatism.  In other words, in place of small violently\r\nantagonistic parties, moderate men inclined to come together to carry\r\nout a broad, non-controversial, national programme.\r\n\r\nThere are few more remarkable developments in Canada between 1840 and\r\n1867 than this tendency {298} towards government by a single party.  It\r\nwas Sydenham's shrewd insight into the Canadian political situation,\r\neven more than his desire to rule, which led him to govern Canada by a\r\ncoalition of moderate men.  His only mistake lay in trying to force on\r\nthe province what should have come by nature.  The Baldwin-La Fontaine\r\ncompact, which really dominated Canadian politics from 1841, was a\r\npartial experiment in government by an alliance of groups; and when the\r\ngreat exciting questions, Responsible Government and Church\r\nEstablishment, had been settled, and the end in view seemed simply to\r\nbe the carrying on of the Queen's government, Liberal-conservatism\r\nentered gradually into possession.  When Baldwin and La Fontaine made\r\nway for Hincks and Morin in 1851, the change was recognized as a step\r\ntowards the re-union of the moderates.  For, in the face of George\r\nBrown, and his advocacy of a more provocative radical programme,\r\nFrancis Hincks declared for some kind of coalition: \"I regret to say\r\nthere have been indications given by a section of the party to which I\r\nbelong, that it will be difficult indeed, unless they change their\r\npolicy, to preserve the Union.  I will tell these persons (the\r\nanti-state church reformers of Upper Canada) {299} that if the Union is\r\nnot preserved by them, as a necessary consequence, other combinations\r\nmust be formed by which the Union may be preserved.  _I am ready to\r\ngive my cordial support to any combination of parties by which the\r\nUnion shall be maintained_.\"[4]  Three years later, the party of\r\nmoderate reform which had co-operated with Elgin in creating a system\r\nof truly responsible government, and which had done so much to restore\r\nCanadian political equanimity, fell before a factious combination of\r\nhostile groups.  But the succeeding administration, nominally\r\nConservative, was actually Liberal-Conservative, and it remained in\r\npower chiefly because Francis Hincks, who had led the Reformers,\r\ndesired his followers to assist it, as Peel and his immediate disciples\r\nkept the British Whigs in office after 1846.  Robert Baldwin had been\r\nthe leader of opposition during Sydenham's rule, and before it; indeed,\r\nhe may be called the organizer of party division in the days before the\r\ngrant of responsible government.  Yet when the opponents of the compact\r\nof 1854 quoted his precedent of party division against Hincks'\r\nprinciple of union, Baldwin disowned his would-be supporters: \"However\r\ndisinclined myself to {300} adventure upon such combinations, they are\r\nunquestionably, in my opinion, under certain circumstances, not only\r\njustifiable, but expedient, and even necessary.  The government of the\r\ncountry _must_ be carried on.  It ought to be carried on with vigour.\r\nIf that can be done in no other way than by mutual concessions and a\r\ncoalition of parties, they become necessary.\"[5]  In consequence, the\r\nautumn of 1854 witnessed the remarkable spectacle of a Tory government,\r\nheaded by Sir Allan MacNab, carrying a bill to end the Clergy Reserve\r\ntroubles, in alliance with Francis Hincks and their late opponents.\r\nThe chief dissentients were the extreme radicals, who were now\r\nnicknamed the Clear-Grits.[6]\r\n\r\nAfter 1854, and for ten years, the political history of Canada is a\r\n_reductio ad absurdum_ of the older party system.  Government succeeded\r\ngovernment, only to fall a prey to its own lack of a sufficient\r\nmajority, and the unprincipled use by its various opponents of casual\r\ncombinations and {301} alliances.  Apart from a little group of\r\nRadicals, British and French, who advocated reforms with an absence of\r\nmoderation which made them impossible as ministers of state, there were\r\nnot sufficient differences to justify two parties, and hardly\r\nsufficient programme even for one.  The old Tories disappeared from\r\npower with their leader, Sir Allan MacNab, in 1856.  The Baldwin-Hincks\r\nreformers had distributed themselves through all the parties--Canadian\r\nPeelites they may be called.  The great majority of the representatives\r\nof the French followed moderate counsels, and were usually sought as\r\nallies by whatever government held office.  The broader principles of\r\nparty warfare were proclaimed only by the Clear-Grits of Upper Canada\r\nand the _Rouges_ of Lower Canada.  The latter group was distinct enough\r\nin its views to be impossible as allies for any but like-minded\r\nextremists: \"Le parti rouge,\" says _La Minerve_, \"s'est formé à\r\nMontreal sous les auspices de M. Papineau, en haine des institutions\r\nanglaises, de notre constitution déclarée vicieuse, et surtout du\r\ngouvernement responsable regardé comme une duperie, avec des idées\r\nd'innovation en religion et en politique, accompagnées d'une haine\r\nprofond pour le clergé, et avec l'intention {302} bien formelle, et\r\nbien prononcée d'annexer le Canada aux Etats-Unis.\"[7]\r\n\r\nAs for the original Clear-Grits, their distinguishing features were the\r\nadvocacy of reforming ideas in so extreme a form as to make them\r\nuseless for practical purposes, an anti-clerical or extreme Protestant\r\noutlook in religion, and a moral superiority, partly real, but more\r\nlargely the Pharisaism so inevitably connected with all forms of\r\nradical propaganda.  They proved their futility in 1858, when George\r\nBrown and A. A. Dorion formed their two-days' administration, and\r\nextinguished the credit of their parties, and themselves, as\r\npoliticians capable of existence apart from moderate allies.  Until\r\nCanadian politics could have their scope enlarged, and the issues at\r\nstake made more vital, and therefore more controversial, it was obvious\r\nthat the grant of responsible government had rendered the existing\r\nparty system useless.\r\n\r\nThe significant moment in this period of Canadian history came in 1864,\r\nwhen all the responsible politicians in the country, and more\r\nespecially the two great personal enemies, John A. Macdonald and George\r\nBrown, came together to carry out a scheme of confederation, which was\r\ntoo great to {303} be the object of petty party strife, and which\r\nrequired the support of all parties to make it successful.  Both\r\npolitical parties, as George Brown confessed, had tried to govern the\r\ncountry, and each in turn had failed from lack of steady adequate\r\nsupport.  A general election was unlikely to effect any improvement in\r\nthe situation, and the one hope seemed to lie in a frank combination\r\nbetween opponents to solve the constitutional difficulties which\r\nthreatened to ruin the province.  \"After much discussion on both\r\nsides,\" ran the official declaration, \"it was found that a compromise\r\nmight probably be had in the adoption either of the federal principle\r\nfor the British North American provinces, as the larger question, or\r\nfor Canada alone, with provisions for the admission of the Maritime\r\nProvinces and the North-Western Territory, when they should express the\r\ndesire\": and to secure the most perfect unanimity the ministers, Sir E.\r\nP. Taché and Mr. Macdonald, \"thereon stated that, after the\r\nprorogation, they would be prepared to place three seats in the Cabinet\r\nat the disposal of Mr. Brown.\"[8]\r\n\r\nIt is not within the scope of this essay to discuss {304} developments\r\nafter Confederation, yet it is an interesting speculation whether, up\r\nto a date quite recent, the grant of responsible government did not\r\ncontinue to make a two-party system on the British basis unnatural to\r\nCanada.  Between 1847 and 1867, the destruction of the dual system, and\r\nthe creation of government by coalition, were certainly the dominant\r\nfacts in Canadian politics, and both were the products of the gift of\r\nautonomy.  Since 1867, it is possible to contend that, while two sets\r\nof politicians offer themselves as alternative governments to the\r\nelectors, their differentiation has reference rather to the holding of\r\noffice than to a real distinction in programme.  Alike in trade,\r\nimperial policy, and domestic progress, the inclination has been\r\ntowards compromise, and either side inclines, or is forced, to steal\r\nthe programme of the other.  Responsible government was the last issue\r\nwhich arrayed men in parties, neither of which could quite accept a\r\ncompromise with the other.  It remains to be seen whether questions of\r\nfreer trade, imperial organization, and provincial rights, will once\r\nmore create parties with something deeper in their differences than\r\nmere rival claims to hold office.\r\n\r\nIf the creation of a Liberal-Conservative party {305} was a direct\r\nresult of the grant of autonomy, so also was the policy which led to\r\nConfederation.  It is no part of the present volume to trace the growth\r\nof the idea of Confederation, or to determine who the actual fathers of\r\nConfederation were.  The connection between Autonomy and Confederation\r\nin the province of Canada was that the former made the latter\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\nEarlier chapters have dealt with the French Canadian problem, and the\r\ndifficulty of combining French _nationalité_ with the Anglo-Saxon\r\nelements of the West.  In one sense, Elgin's regime saw nationalism\r\nlose all its awkward features.  Papineau's return to public life in\r\n1848, and the revolutionary stir of that year had left Lower Canada\r\nuntouched, save in the negligible section represented by the _Rouges_.\r\nThe inclusion of La Fontaine and his friends in the ministry had proved\r\nthe _bona fides_ of the governor, and the French, being, as Elgin said,\r\n\"quiet sort of people,\" stood fast by their friend.  \"Candour compels\r\nme to state,\" he wrote after a year of annexationist agitation, \"that\r\nthe conduct of the Anglo-Saxon portion of our M.P.Ps contrasts most\r\nunfavourably with that of the Gallican....  The French have been\r\nrescued from the false position into which they {306} have been driven,\r\nand in which they must perforce have remained, so long as they believed\r\nthat it was the object of the British government, as avowed by Lord\r\nSydenham and others, to break them down, and to ensure to the British\r\nrace, not by trusting to the natural course of events, but by dint of\r\nmanagement and state craft, predominance in the province.\"[9]\r\n\r\nBut while French nationalism had assumed a perfectly normal phase, the\r\noperations of autonomy after 1847 made steadily towards the creation of\r\na new nationalist difficulty.  That difficulty had two phases.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, while the Union of Upper and Lower Canada had been\r\nbased on the assumption that from it a single nationality with common\r\nideals and objects would emerge, experience proved that both the French\r\nand the British sections remained aggressively true to their own ways;\r\nand the independence bred by self-government only quickened the sense\r\nof racial distinction.  Now there were questions, such as that of the\r\nClergy Reserves, which chiefly concerned the British section; and\r\nothers, like the settlement of the seigniorial tenure, of purely\r\nFrench-Canadian {307} character.  Others again, chief among them the\r\nproblem of separate schools, in Lower Canada for Protestants, in Upper\r\nCanada for Catholics, seemed to set the two sections in direct\r\nopposition.  Under the circumstances, a series of conventions was\r\ncreated to meet a situation very involved and dangerous.  The happy\r\naccident of the dual leadership of La Fontaine and Baldwin furnished a\r\nprecedent for successive ministries, each of which took its name from a\r\nsimilar partnership of French and English.  Further, although the\r\nprinciple never received official sanction, it became usual to expect\r\nthat, in questions affecting the French, a majority from Lower Canada\r\nshould be obtained, and in English matters, one from Upper Canada.  It\r\nwas also the custom to expect a government to prove its stability by\r\nmaintaining a majority from both Upper and Lower Canada.  Nothing, for\r\nexample, so strengthened Elgin's hands in the Rebellion Losses fight as\r\nthe fact that the majority which passed the bill was one in both\r\nsections of the Assembly.  Yet nearly all cabinet ministers, and all\r\nthe governors-general, strongly opposed the acknowledgment of \"the\r\ndouble majority\" as an accepted constitutional principle.  \"I have told\r\nColonel Taché,\" wrote Head, in 1856, \"that I {308} expect the\r\ngovernment formed by him to disavow the principle of a double\r\nmajority\";[10] and both Baldwin, and, after him, John A. Macdonald\r\nrefused to countenance the practice.  Unfortunately, while the idea was\r\na constitutional anomaly, threatening all manner of complications to\r\nthe government of Canada, there were occasions when it had to receive a\r\npartial sanction from use.  When the Tories were sustained by a\r\nmajority of 4 in 1856, government suffered reconstruction because there\r\nhad been a minority of votes from Upper Canada.  As the new Tory leader\r\nexplained, \"I did not, and I do not think that the double majority\r\nsystem should be adopted as a rule.  I feel that so long as we are one\r\nprovince and one Parliament, the fact of a measure being carried by a\r\nworking majority is sufficient evidence that the Government of the day\r\nis in power to conduct the affairs of the country.  But I could not\r\ndisguise from myself that it (the recent vote) was not a vote on a\r\nmeasure, but a distinct vote of confidence, or want of confidence; and\r\nthere having been a vote against us from Upper Canada, expressing a\r\nwant of confidence in the government, I felt that it was a sufficient\r\nindication that the measures of the government {309} would be met with\r\nthe opposition of those honorable gentlemen who had by their solemn\r\nvote withdrawn their confidence from the government.\"[11]  The practice\r\ncontinued in this state of discredit varied by occasional forced use,\r\nuntil a government--that of J. S. Macdonald and Sicotte--which had\r\ndefinitely made the double majority one of the planks in its platform,\r\nfound that its principal measure, the Separate Schools Act of R. W.\r\nScott, had to be carried by a French majority, although the matter was\r\none of deep concern to Upper Canada.  It was becoming obvious that\r\nlocal interests must receive some securer protection than could be\r\nafforded by what was after all an evasion of constitutional practice.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile complications were arising from another movement, the\r\nagitation for a revision of parliamentary representation.  The twelfth\r\nsection of the Union Act had enacted that \"the parts of the said\r\nProvince which now constitute the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada\r\nrespectively, shall be represented by an equal number of\r\nrepresentatives.\"  At the time of Union the balance of population had\r\ninclined decisively towards {310} Lower Canada; indeed that part of the\r\nprovince might fairly claim to have a constitutional grievance.  But\r\nbetween 1830 and 1860 the balance had altered.  In Lower Canada a\r\npopulation, which in 1831 had been 511,922, had increased by 1844 to\r\nalmost 700,000; while in Upper Canada the numbers had increased from\r\n334,681 to well over 700,000 in 1848;[12] and each year saw the west\r\nincrease in comparison with the east, until George Brown, speaking no\r\ndoubt with forensic rather than scientific ends in view, estimated that\r\nin 1857 Upper Canada possessed a population of over 1,400,000, as\r\nagainst a bare 1,100,000 in Lower Canada.[13]  These changes produced a\r\nmost interesting complication.  The representation after 1840 stood\r\nguaranteed by a solemn act--the more solemn because it had been the\r\nresult of a bargain between Sydenham and the provincial authorities in\r\nUpper and Lower Canada.  It had the appearance rather of a treaty than\r\nof an ordinary Act of Parliament.  On the other hand, since\r\nself-government had been secured, and since self-government seemed to\r\ninvolve the principle of representation in proportion {311} to the\r\nnumbers of the population, it was, according to the Upper Canadian\r\npoliticians, absurd to give to 1,100,000 the same representation as to\r\n1,400,000.  So George Brown, speaking from his place in Parliament, and\r\nusing, at the same time, his extraordinary and unequalled influence as\r\neditor of _The Globe_, flung himself into the fray, seeking, as his\r\nmotion of 1857 ran, \"that the representation of the people in\r\nParliament should be based upon population, without regard to a\r\nseparating line between Upper and Lower Canada.\"[14]  His thesis was\r\ntoo cogent, and appealed too powerfully to all classes of the Upper\r\nCanada community, to be anything but irresistible.  Even Macdonald,\r\nwhose political existence depended on his alliance with the French,\r\nknew that his rival had made many converts among the British\r\nConservatives.  \"It is an open question,\" he wrote of representation by\r\npopulation, in 1861, \"and you know two of my colleagues voted in its\r\nfavour.\"[15]\r\n\r\nYet nothing was better calculated to rouse into wild agitation the\r\nquiescent feeling of French nationalism.  The attempt of Durham and his\r\nsuccessors to end, by natural operation, the separate {312} existence\r\nof French nationality was now being renewed with far greater vigour,\r\nand with all the weight of a normal constitutional reform.  If George\r\nBrown was hateful to the French electorate because of his Protestant\r\nand anti-clerical agitation, he was even more odious as the statesman\r\nwho threatened, in the name of Canadian autonomy, the existence of old\r\nFrench tradition, custom, and right.  It was in answer to this twofold\r\ndifficulty that Canadian statesmen definitely thought of Confederation.\r\nThere were many roads leading to that event--the desire of Britain for\r\na more compact and defensible colony; the movement in the maritime\r\nprovinces for a local federation; the dream, or vague aspiration,\r\ncherished by a few Canadians, of a vaster dominion, and one free from\r\npetty local divisions and strifes.  But it was no dream or imperial\r\nideal which forced Canadian statesmen into action; it was simply the\r\ndesire, on the one hand, to give to the progressive west the increased\r\nweight it claimed as due to its numbers; and on the other, to safeguard\r\nthe ancient ways and rights of the French community.  From this point\r\nof view, it was George Brown, the man who preached representation by\r\npopulation in season and out of season, who actually forced {313}\r\nCanadian statesmen to have resort to a measure, the details of which he\r\nhimself did not at first approve; and the argument used to drive the\r\npoint home was not imperial, but a bitter criticism of existing\r\nconditions.  After the great Reform convention of 1859, Brown moved in\r\nParliament \"that the existing legislative union between Upper and Lower\r\nCanada has failed to realize the anticipations of its promoters: has\r\nresulted in a heavy debt, burdensome taxation, great political abuses,\r\nand universal dissatisfaction; and it is the matured conviction of this\r\nAssembly, from the antagonisms developed through difference of origin,\r\nlocal interests, and other causes, that the union in its present form\r\ncan be no longer continued with advantage to the people.\"[16]  In 1864\r\na distracted province found itself at the end of its resources.  Its\r\nfutile efforts at the game of political party had resulted in the\r\ndefeat of four ministries within three years; its attempt to balance\r\nmajorities in Upper and Lower Canada had hopelessly broken down; and\r\nthe moment in which the stronger British west obtained the increased\r\nrepresentation it sought, the French feeling for nationality would\r\nprobably once more produce rebellion.\r\n\r\n{314}\r\n\r\nSo Confederation came--to satisfy George Brown, because in the Dominion\r\nAssembly his province would receive adequate representation--to\r\nsatisfy, on the other hand, a loyal Frenchman like Joseph Cauchon,\r\nbecause, as he said, \"La confédération des deux Canadas, ou de toutes\r\nles provinces, en nous donnant une constitution locale, qui sauverait,\r\ncependant, les priviléges, les droits acquis et les institutions des\r\nminorités, nous offrirait certainement une mesure de protection, comme\r\nCatholiques et comme Français, autrement grand que l'Union actuelle,\r\npuisque de minorité nous deviendrons et resterons, à toujours, la\r\nmajorité nationale et la majorité religieuse.\"[17]  That was the\r\nsecond, and perhaps the greatest of all the results of self-government.\r\n\r\nBefore passing to inquire into the influence of autonomy on Canadian\r\nloyalty, it may prove interesting to note the political manners and\r\nmorals of the statesmen who worked the system in its earlier stages.\r\nIn passing judgment, however, one must bear in mind the newness of the\r\ncountry and the novelty of the experiment; the fact that a democratic\r\nconstitution far more daring than {315} Britain allowed herself at\r\nhome, was being tested; and the severity of the struggle for existence,\r\nwhich left Canadians little time and money to devote to disinterested\r\nservice of their country.  In view of all these facts, and in spite of\r\nsome ugly defects, the verdict must be on the whole favourable to the\r\ncolony.\r\n\r\nOf direct malversation, or actual sordid dishonesty, there was, thanks\r\nprobably to a vigorous opposition, far less than might have been\r\nexpected.  The _cause célèbre_ was that of Francis Hincks, premier from\r\n1851 to 1854, who was accused, among other things, of having profited\r\nthrough buying shares in concerns with which government had dealings--a\r\nfault not unknown in Britain; of having induced government to improve\r\nthe facilities of regions in which he had holdings, and generally of\r\nhaving used his position as minister to make great private gains.  A\r\nmost minute inquiry cleared him on all scores, but the committee of the\r\nLegislative Council, without entering further into the questions,\r\nmentioned as points worthy of consideration by Parliament, \"whether it\r\nis beneficial to the due administration of the affairs of this country\r\nfor its ministers to purchase lands sold at public competition, and\r\nMunicipal Debentures, also {316} offered in open market or otherwise;\r\nwhether the public interests require an expression of the opinions of\r\nthe Two Houses of Parliament in that respect; and whether it would be\r\nadvisable to increase the salaries of the Members of the Executive\r\nCouncil to such a figure, as would relieve them from the necessity of\r\nengaging in private dealings, to enable them to support their families\r\nand maintain the dignity of their position, without resorting to any\r\nkind of business transactions while in the service of the crown.\"[18]\r\nCanada was passing through an ordeal, which, sooner or later, Britain\r\ntoo must face.  Her answer, in this case, to the dilemma between\r\nservice of the community and self-aggrandisement was not unworthy of\r\nthe mother country.\r\n\r\nStill, in spite of the acquittal of Hincks, there were cases of\r\ncomplicated corruption, and a multitude of little squalid sins.  Men\r\nlike Sir Allan MacNab, who had been bred in a system of preferments and\r\npetty political gains, found it difficult to avoid small jobbery.  \"He\r\nhas such an infernal lot of hangers on to provide for,\" wrote one\r\nminister to another, concerning the gallant knight, \"that he finds it\r\ndifficult to do the {317} needful for them all.\"[19]  It is clear, too,\r\nthat when John A. Macdonald succeeded MacNab as Tory leader, purity did\r\nnot increase.  It was no doubt easy for George Brown to criticize\r\nMacdonald's methods from a position of untempted rectitude, and no\r\ndoubt also Brown had personal reasons for criticism; but he was\r\nspeaking well within the truth, when he attacked the Tory government of\r\n1858, not only for grave corruption in the late general election, but\r\nfor other weightier offences.  It was elicited, he said, by the Public\r\nAccounts Committee that £500,000 of provincial debentures had been sold\r\nin England by government at 99¼, when the quotation of the Stock\r\nExchange was 105 @ 107, by which the province was wronged to the extent\r\nof £50,000.  It was elicited that a member of Parliament, supporting\r\nthe government, sold to the government £20,000 of Hamilton debentures\r\nat 97¼ which were worth only 80 in the market....  It was elicited that\r\nlarge sums were habitually drawn from the public chest, and lent to\r\nrailway companies, or spent on services for which no previous sanction\r\nof Parliament had been obtained.[20]  It is, perhaps, the gravest\r\ncharge {318} against Macdonald that, at the entrance of Canada into the\r\nregion of modern finance and speculation, he never understood that\r\nincorrupt administration was the greatest gift a man could give to the\r\nfuture of his country.\r\n\r\nIn a young and not yet civilized community it was natural that the\r\nearly days of self-government should witness some corruption among the\r\nvoters, the more so because, at election times \"there were no less than\r\nfour days, the nomination, two days' polling, and declaration day, on\r\nall of which, by a sort of unwritten law, the candidates in many\r\nconstituencies were compelled to keep open house for their supporters,\"\r\nwhile direct money bribes were often resorted to, especially on the\r\nsecond day's polling in a close contest.[21]\r\n\r\nApart from jobbery and frank corruption, Canadian politicians\r\ncondescended at times to ignoble trickery, and to evasions of the truth\r\nwhich came perilously near breaches of honour.  The most notorious\r\nbreach of the constitutional decencies was the celebrated episode\r\nnicknamed the \"Double Shuffle.\"  Whatever apologists may say, John A.\r\nMacdonald sinned in the very first essentials of political fair-play.\r\nHe had already {319} led George Brown into a trap by forcing government\r\ninto his hands.  When Brown, too late to save his reputation,\r\ndiscovered the sheer futility of his attempt to make and keep together\r\na government, and when it once more fell to the Conservatives to take\r\noffice, Macdonald saved himself and his colleagues the trouble of\r\nstanding for re-election by a most shameful constitutional quibble.\r\nAccording to a recent act, if a member of Legislative Council or\r\nAssembly \"shall resign his office, and within one month after his\r\nresignation, accept any other of the said offices (enumerated above),\r\nhe shall not vacate his seat in the said Assembly or Council.\"[22]  It\r\nwas a simple, and a disgraceful thing, for the ministers, once more in\r\npower, to accept offices other than those which they had held before\r\nresignation, and then, at once, to pass on to the reacceptance of the\r\nold appropriate positions.  They saved their seats at the expense of\r\ntheir honour.  In spite of Macdonald's availability, there was too much\r\nof the village Machiavelli about his political tactics to please the\r\neducated and honest judgment.\r\n\r\nIt was very natural too that, in these early struggles towards\r\nindependence and national {320} self-consciousness, the crudities\r\ninseparable from early colonial existence should be painfully apparent.\r\nIn Canada at least, vice could not boast that it had lost half its evil\r\nby losing all its grossness.  According to Sir Richard Cartwright, the\r\nprolonged absence from domestic associations, led to a considerable\r\namount of dissipation among members of parliament.  The minister who\r\ndominated Canadian politics for so many years before and after\r\nConfederation set an unfortunate example to his flock; and many of the\r\ndebates read as though they drew their heat, if not their light, from\r\nmaterial rather than intellectual sources.  Apart from offences against\r\nsobriety and the decalogue, there can be no doubt that something of the\r\nearly ferocity of politics still continued, and the disgrace of the\r\nMontreal riots which followed Elgin's sanction of the Rebellion Losses\r\nbill was rendered tenfold more disgraceful by the participation in them\r\nof gentlemen and politicians of position.  Half the success of\r\ndemocratic institutions lies in the capacity of the legislators for\r\nsome public dignity, and a certain chivalrous good nature towards each\r\nother.  But that is perhaps too high a standard to set for the first\r\ncolonial Assembly which had exercised full {321} powers of\r\nself-government since 1776.  After all, there were great stretches of\r\nhonesty and high purpose to counterbalance the squalid jobs and tricks.\r\nIf Macdonald sinned in one direction, Alexander Mackenzie had already\r\nbegun his course of almost too austere rectitude in another.\r\nOpposition kept a keen eye on governmental misdoings, and George Brown,\r\nimpulsive, imprudent, often lacking in sane statesmanship, and, once or\r\ntwice, in nice honour, still raised himself, the readers of his\r\nnewspaper, and the Assembly which he often led in morals, if not in\r\npolitics, to a plane not far below that of the imperial Parliament.\r\nBut the highest level of feeling and statesmanship reached by Canadian\r\npoliticians before 1867 was attained in those days of difficulty in\r\n1864, when the whole future of Canada was at stake, and when none but\r\nCanadians could guide their country into safety.  There were many\r\nobstacles in the way of united action between the leaders on both\r\nsides; the attempt to create a federal constitution was no light task\r\neven for statesmen of genius; and the adaptation of means to end, of\r\npublic utilities to local jealousies, demanded temper, honesty, breadth\r\nof view.  George Brown, who with all his impracticability and lack of\r\nrestraint, behaved with {322} notable public spirit at this time, spoke\r\nfor the community when he said, \"The whole feeling in my mind is one of\r\njoy and thankfulness that there were found men of position and\r\ninfluence in Canada, who, at a moment of serious crisis, had nerve and\r\npatriotism enough to cast aside political partizanship, to banish\r\npersonal considerations, and unite for the accomplishment of a measure\r\nso fraught with advantage to their common country.\"[23]  In the debate\r\nfrom which these words are taken, Canadian statesmen excelled\r\nthemselves, and it is not too much to say that whether in attack or\r\ndefence, the speakers exhibited a capacity and a public spirit not\r\nunworthy of the imperial Parliament at its best.[24]\r\n\r\nIt would, however, be a mistake to exhibit the Canadian Assembly of\r\nearly Victorian days as characterized for long by so sublime and\r\nMiltonic a spirit as is suggested by the Confederation debates.  After\r\nall, they were mainly provincial lawyers and shrewd uncultured business\r\nmen who guided the destinies of Canada, guilty of many lapses from\r\ndignity in their public behaviour, and exhibiting {323} not\r\ninfrequently a democratic vulgarity learned from the neighbouring\r\nrepublic.  That was a less elevated, but altogether living and real\r\npicture of the Canadian politician, which Sir John Macdonald's\r\nbiographer gave of his hero, and the great opposition leader, as they\r\nreturned, while on an imperial mission, from a day at the Derby:\r\n\"Coming home, we had lots of fun: even George Brown, a covenanting old\r\nchap, caught its spirit.  I bought him a pea-shooter and a bag of peas,\r\nand the old fellow actually took aim at people on the tops of busses,\r\nand shot lots of peas on the way home.\"[25]\r\n\r\nIt now becomes necessary to answer the question which, for twenty\r\nyears, English politicians had been putting to those who argued in\r\nfavour of Canadian self-government.  Given a system of local\r\ngovernment, really autonomous, what will become of the connection with\r\nGreat Britain?  So far as the issue is one purely constitutional and\r\nlegal, it may be answered very shortly.  Responsible government in\r\nCanada seriously diminished the formal bonds which united that province\r\nto the mother country.  For long the pessimists in Britain had been\r\nproclaiming that the diminution of the governor-general's authority and\r\n{324} responsibility would end the connection.  After the retirement of\r\nLord Elgin, that diminution had taken place.  It is a revelation of\r\nconstitutional change to pass from the full, interesting, and\r\nmany-sided despatches and letters of Sydenham, Bagot, and Elgin, to the\r\nperfunctory reports of Head and Monck.  Elgin had contended that a\r\ngovernor might hope to establish a moral influence, which would\r\ncompensate for the loss of power, consequent on the surrender of\r\npatronage to an executive responsible to the local parliament;[26] but\r\nit was not certain that either Head or Monck possessed this indirect\r\ncontrol.  In 1858 Sir Edmund Head acted with great apparent\r\nindependence, when he refused to allow George Brown and his new\r\nadministration the privilege of a dissolution; and the columns of _The\r\nGlobe_ resounded with denunciations which recalled the days of Metcalfe\r\nand tyranny.  But, even if Head were independent, it was not with an\r\nauthority useful to the dignity of his position; and the whole affair\r\nhas a suspicious resemblance to one of John A. Macdonald's tricks.  The\r\nvoice is Macdonald's voice, if the hands are the hands of Head.  Under\r\nMonck, the most conspicuous assertion of independence was the {325}\r\ngovernor's selection of J. S. Macdonald to lead the ministry of 1862,\r\ninstead of Foley, the more natural alternative for premier.\r\nNevertheless Monck's despatches, concerned as they are with diplomatic\r\nand military details, present a striking contrast to those of Sydenham\r\nand Elgin, who proved how active was the part they played in the life\r\nof the community by the vividness of their sketches of Canadian\r\npolitics and society.  So sparing, indeed, was Monck in his\r\ninformation, that Newcastle had to reprove him, in 1863, for sending so\r\nlittle news that the Colonial Office could have furnished no\r\ninformation on Canada to the Houses of Parliament had they called for\r\npapers.[27]  During the confederation negotiations, the governor made\r\nan admirable referee, or impartial centre, round whom the diverse\r\ninterests might group themselves: but no one could say that events were\r\nshaped or changed by his action.  The warmest language used concerning\r\nHer Majesty's representative in Canada may be found in the speech of\r\nMacdonald in the confederation debate: \"We place no restriction on Her\r\nMajesty's prerogative in the selection of her representative.  The\r\nSovereign has unrestricted freedom of choice.  Whether in making {326}\r\nher selection she may send us one of her own family, a Royal Prince, as\r\na Viceroy to rule us, or one of the great statesmen of England to\r\nrepresent her, we know not....  But we may be permitted to hope that\r\nwhen the union takes place, and we become the great country which\r\nBritish North America is certain to be, it will be an object worthy the\r\nambition of the statesmen of England to be charged with presiding over\r\nour destinies.\"[28]\r\n\r\nApart from the viceregal operations of the governor, the direct action\r\nof the Crown was called for by the province in one notable but\r\nunfortunate incident, the choice of a new capital.  Torn asunder by the\r\nstrife of French and English, Canada was unable, or at least unwilling,\r\nto commit herself to the choice of a definitive capital, after Montreal\r\nhad been rendered impossible by the turbulence of its mobs.  So the\r\nQueen's personal initiative was invited.  But the awkwardness of the\r\nstep was revealed in 1858, when a division in the House practically\r\nflung her decision contemptuously aside--happily only for the moment,\r\nand informally.  George Brown was absolutely right when he said: \"I\r\nyield to no man for a single {327} moment in loyalty to the Crown of\r\nEngland, and in humble respect and admiration of Her Majesty.  But what\r\nhas this purely Canadian question to do with loyalty?  It is a most\r\ndangerous and ungracious thing to couple the name of Her Majesty with\r\nan affair so entirely local, and one as to which the sectional feelings\r\nof the people are so excited.\"[29]  It had become apparent, long before\r\n1867, that while the loyalty of the province to the Sovereign, and the\r\npersonal influence of her representative were bonds of union, real, if\r\nhard to describe in set terms, the headship over the Canadian people\r\nwas assumed to be official, ornamental, and symbolical, rather than\r\nutilitarian.\r\n\r\nIn other directions, the formal and legal elements of the connection\r\nwere loosening---more especially in the departments of commerce and\r\ndefence.[30]  The careers of men like Buchanan and Galt, through whom\r\nthe Canadian tariff received a complete revision, illustrate how little\r\nthe former links to Britain were allowed to remain in trade relations.\r\nThere was a day when, as Chatham himself would have contended, the\r\nregulation of trade was an indefeasible right of the Crown.  That\r\ncontention {328} received a rude check not only in the elaboration of a\r\nCanadian tariff in 1859, but in the claims made by the minister of\r\nfinance: \"It is therefore the duty of the present government,\r\ndistinctly to affirm the right of the Canadian Legislature to adjust\r\nthe taxation of the people in the way they judge best, even if it\r\nshould meet the disapproval of the Imperial ministry.  Her Majesty\r\ncannot be advised to disallow such acts, unless her advisers are\r\nprepared to assume the administration of the affairs of the colony,\r\nirrespective of the views of the inhabitants.\"[31]  Similarly, the\r\nadverse vote on the militia proposals of 1862, which so exercised\r\nopinion in Britain, was but another result of the spirit of\r\nself-government operating naturally in the province.  It was not that\r\nCanadians desired consciously to check the military plans of the\r\nempire.  It was only that the grant of autonomy had permitted\r\nprovincial rather than imperial counsels to prevail, and that a new\r\nlaxity, or even slipshodness, had begun to appear in Canadian military\r\naffairs, weakening the formal military connection between Britain and\r\n{329} Canada.  Canadian defence, from being part of imperial policy,\r\nhad become a detail in the strife of domestic politics.  \"There can be\r\nno doubt,\" Monck reported, \"that the proposed militia arrangements were\r\nof a magnitude far beyond anything which had, up to that time, been\r\nproposed, and this circumstance caused many members, especially from\r\nLower Canada, to vote against it; but I think there was also, on the\r\npart of a portion of the general supporters of government, an intention\r\nto intimate by their vote the withdrawal of their confidence from the\r\nadministration.\"[32]\r\n\r\nEven before 1867, then, it had become apparent that the imperial system\r\nadministered on Home Rule principles was something entirely different\r\nfrom a federation like that of the United States, with carefully\r\ndefined State and Federal rights.  All the presumption, in the new\r\nBritish state, was in favour of the so-called dependency, and the\r\nBritish Tories were correct, when they prophesied a steady\r\nretrogression in the legal rights possessed by the mother country.  But\r\nthe element which they had ignored was that of opinion.  Public feeling\r\nrather than constitutional law was to be the new foundation of empire.\r\nHow did the {330} development of Canadian political independence affect\r\npublic sentiment towards Britain?\r\n\r\nThe new regime began under gloomy auspices.  In 1849 Lord Elgin gave\r\nthe most decisive proof of his allegiance to Canadian autonomy; and in\r\n1849 a violent agitation for annexation to the United States began.[33]\r\nMany forces assisted in the creation of the movement, and many groups,\r\nof the most diverse elements, combined to constitute the party of\r\nannexation.  There was real commercial distress, in part the result of\r\nthe commercial revolution in Britain, and Montreal more especially felt\r\nthe strain acutely.  \"Property,\" wrote Elgin to Grey in 1849,[34] \"in\r\nmost of the Canadian towns, and more especially in the Capital, has\r\nfallen 50 per cent. in value within the last three years.\r\nThree-fourths of the commercial men are bankrupt.  Owing to free trade\r\na large proportion of the exportable produce of Canada is obliged to\r\nseek a market in the States.  It pays a duty of 20 per cent. on the\r\nfrontier.  If free navigation, and reciprocal trade with the Union be\r\nnot secured for us, the worst, I fear, will come, {331} and at no\r\ndistant day.\"  Now, for that distress there seemed to be one natural\r\nremedy.  Across the border were prosperity and markets.  A change in\r\nallegiance would open the doors, and bring trade and wealth flowing\r\ninto the bankrupt province.  Consequently many of the notable names\r\namong the Montreal business men may be found attached to annexation\r\nproclamations.\r\n\r\nAgain, in spite of the great change in French opinion wrought by\r\nElgin's acceptance of French ministers, there was a little band of\r\nFrench extremists, the _Rouges_, entirely disaffected towards England.\r\nAt their head, at first, was Papineau.  Papineau's predilections,\r\naccording to one who knew him well, were avowedly democratic and\r\nrepublican,[35] and his years in Europe, at the time when revolution\r\nwas in the air, had not served to moderate his opinions.  The election\r\naddress with which he once more entered public life, at the end of\r\n1847, betrays everywhere hatred of the British government, a decided\r\ninclination for things American, and a strong dash of European\r\nrevolutionary sentiment, revealed in declamations over _patriotes_ and\r\n_oppresseurs_.[36]  Round him gathered a little band {332} of\r\nanti-clericals and ultra-radicals, as strongly drawn to the United\r\nStates as they were repelled by Britain.  Even after Papineau had\r\nreduced himself to public insignificance, the group remained, and in\r\n1865 Cartier, the true representative of French-Canadian feeling, spoke\r\nof the _Institut Canadien_ of Montreal as an advocate, not of\r\nconfederation, but of annexation.[37]\r\n\r\nAfter the years of famine in Ireland, there was more than a possibility\r\nthat, in Canada, as in the United States, the main body of Irish\r\nimmigrants would be hostile to Britain, and Elgin watched with anxious\r\neyes for symptoms of a rising, sympathetic with that in Ireland, and\r\nfostered by Irish-American hatred of England.  Throughout the province\r\nthe Irish community was large and often organized--in 1866 D'Arcy M'Gee\r\ncounted thirty counties in which the Irish-Catholic votes ranged from a\r\nthird to a fifth of the whole constituency.[38]  Now while, {333} in\r\n1866, M'Gee spoke with boldness of the loyalty of his countrymen, it is\r\nundoubtedly true that, in 1848 and 1849, there were hostile spirits,\r\nand an army of Irish patriots across the border, only too willing to\r\nprecipitate hostilities.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, there were Americans in the province who still thought\r\ntheir former country the perfect state, and who did not hesitate to use\r\nBritish liberty to promote republican ends; there were radicals and\r\ngrumblers of half a hundred shades and colours, who connected their\r\nsufferings with the errors of British rule, and who spoke loosely of\r\nannexation as a kind of general remedy for all their public ills.  For\r\nit cannot be too distinctly asserted that, from that day to this, there\r\nhas always been a section of discontented triflers to whom annexation,\r\na word often on their lips, means nothing more than their fashion of\r\ndamning a government too strong for them to assail by rational\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nThe annexation cry found echoes throughout the province, both in the\r\npress and on the platform, and it continued to reassert its existence\r\nlong after the outburst of 1849 had ended.  Cartwright declares that,\r\neven after 1856, he discovered in Western Ontario a sentiment both\r\nstrong and {334} widespread in favour of union with the United States.\r\nBut the actual movement, which at first seemed to have a real threat\r\nimplicit in it, came to a head in 1849, and found its chief supporters\r\nwithin the city of Montreal.  \"You find in this city,\" wrote Elgin in\r\nSeptember, 1849, \"the most anti-British specimens of each class of\r\nwhich our community consists.  The Montreal French are the most\r\nYankeefied French in the province; the British, though furiously\r\nanti-Gallican, are with some exceptions the least loyal; and the\r\ncommercial men the most zealous annexationists which Canada\r\nfurnishes.\"[39]\r\n\r\nTwo circumstances, apparently unconnected with annexationism,\r\nintensified that movement, the _laissez faire_ attitude of British\r\npoliticians towards their colonies, and the behaviour of the defeated\r\nTory party in Canada.  Of the first enough has already been said; but\r\nit is interesting to note that _The Independent_, which was the organ\r\nof the annexationists, justified its views by references to \"English\r\nstatesmen and writers of eminence,\" and that the Second Annexation\r\nManifesto quoted largely from British papers.[40]  The second fact\r\n{335} demands some examination.  The Tories had been from the first the\r\nparty of the connection, and had been recognized as such in Britain.\r\nBut the loss of their supremacy had put too severe a strain on their\r\nloyalty, and it has already been seen that when Elgin, obeying\r\nconstitutional usage, recognized the French as citizens, equally\r\nentitled to office with the Tories, and passed the Rebellion Losses\r\nBill in accordance with La Fontaine's wishes, the Tory sense of decency\r\ngave way.  Many of them, not content with abusing the governor-general,\r\nand petitioning for his recall, actually declared themselves in favour\r\nof independence, or joined the ranks of the annexation party.  In an\r\nextraordinary issue of the _Montreal Gazette_, a recognized Tory\r\njournal, the editor, after speaking of Elgin as the last governor of\r\nCanada, proclaimed that \"the end has begun.  Anglo-Saxons!  You must\r\nlive for the future.  Your blood and race will now be supreme, if true\r\nto yourselves.  You will be English at the expense of not being\r\nBritish.\"[41]  But other journals and politicians were not content with\r\nthe half-way house of independence, and the majority of those who\r\nsigned the first annexation manifesto belonged to the Tory party.[42]\r\nJohn {336} A. Macdonald, who was shrewd and cool-headed enough to\r\nrefuse to sign the manifesto, admitted that \"our fellows lost their\r\nheads\"; but he cannot be allowed to claim credit for having advocated\r\nthe formation of another organization, the British-American League, as\r\na safety-valve for Tory feeling.[43]  Unfortunately for his accuracy,\r\nthe League was formed in the spring of 1849; it held its first\r\nconvention in July; and the manifesto did not appear till late autumn.\r\nStill, it is true that the meetings of the League provided some\r\noccupation for minds which, in their irritable condition, might have\r\ndone more foolish things, and Mr. Holland MacDonald described the\r\nfeelings of the wiser of his fellow-leaguers when he said at Kingston:\r\n\"I maintain that there is not an individual in this Assembly, at this\r\nmoment, prepared to go for annexation, although some may be suspected\r\nof having leanings that way.\"[44]  It was a violent but passing fit of\r\npetulance which for the moment obscured Tory loyalty.  When it had\r\nended, chiefly because Elgin acted not only with prudence, but with\r\ngreat insight, in pressing for a reciprocity treaty with the United\r\nStates, the British American {337} League and the Annexation Manifesto\r\nvanished into the limbo of broken causes and political indiscretions.\r\n\r\nThe truth was that every great respectable section of the Canadian\r\npeople was almost wholly sound in its allegiance.  Regarded even\r\nracially, it is hard to find any important group which was not\r\nsubstantially loyal.  The Celtic and Gallic sections of the populace\r\nmight have been expected to furnish recruits for annexation; and\r\ndisaffection undoubtedly existed among the Canadian Irish.  Yet Elgin\r\nwas much more troubled over possible Irish disaffection in 1848 than he\r\nwas in 1849; the Orange societies round Toronto seem to have refused to\r\nfollow their fellow Tories into an alliance with annexationists; and,\r\nas has been already seen, D'Arcy M'Gee was able, in 1866, to speak of\r\nthe Irish community as wholly loyal.\r\n\r\nThe great mass of the French-Canadians stood by the governor and\r\nBritain.  Whatever influence the French priesthood possessed was\r\nexerted on the side of the connection; from Durham to Monck there is\r\nunanimity concerning the consistent loyalty of the Catholic Church in\r\nCanada.  Apart from the church, the French-Canadians, when once their\r\njust rights had been conceded, {338} furnished a stable, conservative,\r\nand loyal body of citizens.  Doubtless they had their points of\r\ndivergence from the ideals of the Anglo-Saxon west.  It was they who\r\nensured the defeat of the militia proposals of 1862, and there were\r\nalways sufficient _Rouges_ to raise a cry of nationality or annexation.\r\nBut the national leaders, La Fontaine and Cartier, were absolutely true\r\nto the empire, and journalists like Cauchon flung their influence on\r\nthe same side, even if they hinted at \"jours qui doivent nécessairement\r\nvenir, que nous le voulions ou que nous ne le voulions pas\"--to wit, of\r\nindependence.[45]\r\n\r\nOf the English and Scottish elements in the population it is hardly\r\nnecessary to say that their loyalty had increased rather than\r\ndiminished since they had crossed the Atlantic; but at least one\r\ninstance of Highland loyalty may be given.  It was when Elgin had been\r\ninsulted, and when the annexation cause was at its height.  Loyal\r\naddresses had begun to pour in, but there was one whose words still\r\nring with a certain martial loyalty, and which Elgin answered with\r\ngenuine emotion.  The Highlanders of Glengarry county, after assuring\r\n{339} their governor of their personal allegiance to him, passed to\r\nmore general sentiments: \"Our highest aspirations for Canada are that\r\nshe may continue to flourish under the kindly protection of the British\r\nflag, enjoying the full privilege of that constitution, under which the\r\nparent land has risen to so lofty an eminence; with this, United Canada\r\nhas nothing to covet in other lands; with less than this, no true\r\nBriton would rest satisfied.\"[46]\r\n\r\nAs all the distinctive elements in the population remained true to\r\nBritain, so too did all the statesmen of eminence.  It would be easy to\r\nprove the fact by a political census of Upper and Lower Canada; but let\r\nthree representative men stand for those groups which they led--Robert\r\nBaldwin for the constitutional reformers, George Brown for the\r\nClear-Grits and progressives, John A. Macdonald for the conservatives.\r\nRobert Baldwin was the man whom Elgin counted worth two regiments to\r\nthe connection, and who had expressed dismay at Lord John Russell's\r\ntreason to the Empire.  When the annexation troubles came on, he made\r\nit perfectly clear to one of his followers, who had trifled with\r\nannexation, that he must change his views, or remain outside the\r\nBaldwin connection.  {340} \"I felt it right to write to Mr. Perry,\r\nexpressing my decided opinions in respect of the annexation question,\r\nand that I could look upon those only who are in favour of the\r\ncontinuance of the connection with the mother country as political\r\nfriends; those who are against it as political opponents....  I believe\r\nthat our party are hostile to annexation.  I am at all events hostile\r\nto it myself, and if I and my party differ upon it, it is necessary we\r\nshould part company.  It is not a question upon which a compromise is\r\npossible.\"[47]\r\n\r\nLoyalty so strong as this seems natural in a Whig like Baldwin, but one\r\nassociates agitation and radicalism with other views.  The progressive,\r\nwhen he is not engaged in decrying his own state, often exhibits a\r\nphilosophic indifference to all national prejudice--he is a\r\ncosmopolitan whose charity begins away from home.  There were those\r\namong the Canadian Radicals who were as bad friends to Britain as they\r\nwere good friends to the United States, but the Clear-Grit party up to\r\nconfederation was true to Britain, largely because their leader, after\r\n1850, was George Brown, and because Brown was the loyalest Scot in\r\nCanada.  Brown was in a sense the most remarkable figure of the time in\r\n{341} his province.  Fierce in his opinions, a vehement speaker, an\r\nagitator whose best qualities unfitted him for the steadier work of\r\ngovernment, he committed just those mistakes which make the true\r\nagitator's public life something of a tragedy, or at least a\r\ndisappointment.  But Brown's work was done out of office.  His\r\npassionate advocacy of the policy of Abraham Lincoln and the abolition\r\nof slavery kept relations with the United States calm through a\r\ndiplomatic crisis.  He it was who made confederation not possible, but\r\nnecessary, by his agitation for a sounder representation.  His work as\r\nopposition leader, and as the greatest editor known to Canadian\r\njournalism, saved Canadian politics from becoming the nest of jobs and\r\ncorruption which--with all allowance for his good qualities--John A.\r\nMacdonald would have made them.  Never before, and certainly never\r\nsince his day, has any Canadian influenced the community as Brown did\r\nthrough _The Globe_.  \"There were probably many thousand voters in\r\nOntario,\" says Cartwright,[48] \"especially among the Scotch settlers,\r\nwho hardly read anything except their _Globe_ and their Bible, and\r\nwhose whole political creed was practically dictated to them {342} by\r\nthe former.\"  Now that influence was exerted, from first to last, in\r\nfavour of Britain.  In his maiden speech in parliament Brown protested\r\nagainst a reduction of the governor's salary, and on the highest\r\nground: \"The appointment of that high authority is the only power which\r\nGreat Britain still retains.  Frankly and generously she has one by one\r\nsurrendered all the rights which were once held necessary to the\r\ncondition of a colony--the patronage of the Crown, the right over the\r\npublic domain, the civil list, the customs, the post office have all\r\nbeen relinquished ... she guards our coasts, she maintains our troops,\r\nshe builds our forts, she spends hundreds of thousands among us yearly;\r\nand yet the paltry payment to her representative is made a topic of\r\ngrumbling and popular agitation.\"[49]  In the same spirit he fought\r\nannexation, and killed it, among his followers; and, when confederation\r\ncame, he helped to make the new dominion not only Canadian, but\r\nBritish.  In that age when British faith in the Empire was on the wane,\r\nit was not English statesmanship which tried to inspire Canadian\r\nloyalty, but the loyalty of men like Brown which called to England to\r\nbe of better heart.  \"I am much concerned {343} to observe,\" he wrote\r\nto Macdonald in 1864, \"that there is a manifest desire in almost every\r\nquarter that ere long, the British American colonies should shift for\r\nthemselves, and in some quarters, evident regret that we did not\r\ndeclare at once for independence.  I am very sorry to observe this, but\r\nit arises, I hope, from the fear of invasion of Canada by the United\r\nStates, and will soon pass away with the cause that excites it.\"[50]\r\n\r\nOf Sir John Macdonald's loyalty it would be a work of supererogation to\r\nspeak.  His first political address proclaimed the need in Canada of a\r\npermanent connection with the mother country,[51] and his most famous\r\nutterance declared his intention of dying a British subject.  But\r\nMacdonald's patriotism struck a note all its own, and one due mainly to\r\nthe influence of Canadian autonomy working on a susceptible\r\nimagination.  He was British, but always from the standpoint of Canada.\r\nHe had no desire to exalt the Empire through the diminution of Canadian\r\nrights.  For the old British Tory, British supremacy had necessarily\r\ninvolved colonial dependence; for Macdonald, the Canadian Conservative,\r\nthe glory of the Empire lay in the {344} fullest autonomous development\r\nof each part.  \"The colonies,\" he said in one of his highest flights,\r\n\"are now in a transition stage.  Gradually a different colonial system\r\nis being developed--and it will become, year by year, less a case of\r\ndependence on our part, and of over-ruling protection on the part of\r\nthe Mother Country, and more a case of healthy and cordial alliance.\r\nInstead of looking upon us as a merely dependent colony, England will\r\nhave in us a friendly nation--a subordinate but still a powerful\r\npeople--to stand by her in North America in peace or in war.  The\r\npeople of Australia will be such another subordinate nation.  And\r\nEngland will have this advantage, if her colonies progress under the\r\nnew colonial system, as I believe they will, that though at war with\r\nall the rest of the world, she will be able to look to the subordinate\r\nnations in alliance with her, and owning allegiance to the same\r\nSovereign, who will assist in enabling her again to meet the whole\r\nworld in arms, as she has done before.\"[52]\r\n\r\n\r\nThese words serve as a fitting close to the argument and story of\r\nCanadian autonomy.  A review of the years in which it attained its full\r\nstrength {345} gives the student of history but a poor impression of\r\npolitical foresight.  British and Canadian Tories had predicted\r\ndissolution of the Empire, should self-government be granted, and they\r\ndescribed the probable stages of dissolution.  But all the events they\r\nhad predicted had happened, and the Empire still stood, and stood more\r\nfirmly united than before.  British progressives had advocated the\r\ngrant, while they had denied that autonomy need mean more than a very\r\nlimited and circumscribed independence.  But the floods had spread and\r\noverwhelmed their trivial limitations, and the Liberals found\r\nthemselves triumphant in spite of their fears, and the restrictions\r\nwhich these fears had recommended.  Canadian history from 1839 to 1867\r\nfurnishes certain simple and direct political lessons: that communities\r\nof the British stock can be governed only according to the strictest\r\nprinciples of autonomy; that autonomy, once granted, may not be\r\nlimited, guided, or recalled; that, in the grant, all distinctions\r\nbetween internal and imperial, domestic and diplomatic, civil authority\r\nand military authority, made to save the face of British supremacy,\r\nwill speedily disappear; and that, up to the present time, the measure\r\nof local independence has also been the measure of local loyalty {346}\r\nto the mother country.  It may well be that, as traditions grow\r\nshadowy, as the old stock is imperceptibly changed into a new\r\nnationality, and as, among men of the new nationality, the pride in\r\nbeing British is no longer a natural incident of life, the autonomy of\r\nthe future may prove disruptive, not cohesive.  Nothing, however, is so\r\nfutile as prophecy, unless it be pessimism.  The precedents of\r\nthree-quarters of a century do not lend themselves to support counsels\r\nof despair.  The Canadian community has, after its own fashion, stood\r\nby the mother country in war; it may be that, in the future, the\r\nattempt to seek peace and ensue it will prove a more lasting, as it\r\nmust certainly be a loftier, reason for continued union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Elgin-Grey Correspondence: Elgin to Grey, 26 April, 1847.\r\n\r\n[2] He was reporting (18 December, 1854) the passing of acts dealing\r\nwith the Clergy Reserves, and Seigniorial Tenure.\r\n\r\n[3] Pope, _Life of Sir John Macdonald_, i. p. 151.\r\n\r\n[4] _Life and Speeches of the Hon.
