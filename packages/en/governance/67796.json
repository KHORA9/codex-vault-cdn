WATSON\r\n\r\n\r\n_Down in Georgia_\r\n\r\nCLARK HOWELL’S DEFENSE OF THE CORPORATIONS\r\n\r\nA national magazine can do no better work than to take a hand in a local\r\nfight, when the issues involved are national.\r\n\r\nAs explained in previous articles, the state of Georgia has been\r\ncompletely conquered by a Wall Street combination. Morgan, Belmont and\r\nRyan are our masters. They rule Georgia through the Democratic party\r\njust as they rule New Jersey through the Republican party, and New York\r\nthrough both the old parties.\r\n\r\nIn New York, the tools of this Wall Street combination are such men as\r\nMurphy, Pat McCarren, Judge Parker, and Bill Sheehan. In Georgia the\r\ntools are such men as Hamp McWhorter, Joe Terrell, Clark Howell.\r\n\r\nThese men call themselves Democrats, but they work for Morgan the\r\nRepublican as earnestly as they work for Belmont the Democrat. The Wall\r\nStreet Railroad Kings rule and rob our state, and they do it by means of\r\nthe men who control the machinery of the Democratic party.\r\n\r\nHoke Smith is leading a great revolt against this Wall Street domination,\r\nand he is doing it superbly. He is going to win, because the people know\r\nhe is right. He is going to win, because the people know that they are\r\nbeing foully mistreated by the railroads. He is going to win because the\r\npeople can no longer be driven by the party lash. He is going to win\r\nbecause the people have at last determined to vote for _what they want_.\r\n\r\nIn the January number of this magazine, I specified the wrongs which the\r\npeople of Georgia suffer at the hands of the railroads. Mr. Clark Howell,\r\nthe Corporation Candidate for Governor, tried to answer me, and probably\r\nflatters himself that he did so.\r\n\r\nLet us see.\r\n\r\nI made the statement that the railroads had violated our Constitution by\r\n“a joint ownership of competing lines, thus establishing the monopoly\r\nwhich the Constitution forbids.”\r\n\r\nThat is a serious charge. If it be true that the railroads have trampled\r\nthe Constitution under foot and established a monopoly in defiance\r\nof law, that fact alone should damn them. No man, no set of men, no\r\ncorporation, no combination of corporations, should be allowed _to make\r\nlaw for themselves_ in Georgia. We should compel all persons, natural and\r\nartificial, to respect and obey our laws.\r\n\r\nDoes Clark Howell deny the accusation brought by me against the railroads?\r\n\r\nDoes he deny that the Morgan-Ryan-Belmont interests work together in\r\nbeautiful harmony in Georgia?\r\n\r\nBy no means. On the contrary, he parries the blow by saying that if any\r\nunlawful combination exists, Hoke Smith was the lawyer who represented\r\nthe law-breakers in court.\r\n\r\nThat’s a pretty defense for the railroads, isn’t it?\r\n\r\nAccording to that kind of logic we must not enforce the law against\r\npeople who steal because Hoke Smith, as a lawyer, has actually defended\r\nthieves. Logic of that sort would compel me to antagonize the law against\r\nmurder because as a lawyer, I defended dozens of men charged with that\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nHoke Smith’s position as a candidate for governor is one thing; his\r\nposition as attorney in law cases is another; and there is no use trying\r\nto fool the people about it. If the railroads have made an illegal\r\ncombination we must smash it, no matter who the lawyers were that\r\nrepresented the railroads at that time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy editorial states that the railroads treated our Railroad Commission\r\nwith contempt by refusing to obey its rules, its decisions, its orders.\r\n\r\nAs an example, I cited the case of the town of Flovilla, Georgia, where\r\nthe railroads had for two years refused to provide the accommodations for\r\npassengers on their way to the Indian Spring.\r\n\r\nMr. Howell jumped on this statement with the triumphant crow of a bantam\r\nrooster.\r\n\r\nHe had caught me telling what was not true. No wonder the little rooster\r\ncrowed. Not many men have upset statements made by me.\r\n\r\nLike many another little rooster, Clark crowed too soon.\r\n\r\nListen:\r\n\r\nClark says: “The truth of the matter is, the Railroad Commission _ordered\r\nthe building of a new depot at_ Flovilla, and the records of the\r\ncommission show that THE ORDER WAS COMPLIED WITH.”\r\n\r\nIf the records of the commission show that, _Somebody_ has fooled the\r\nCommission cruelly, for _there has been no new depot built at Flovilla_!\r\n\r\nCrow again, little rooster.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1904 the railroad made an addition _to its freight room_, at Flovilla,\r\nand stopped.\r\n\r\nHon. Pope Brown, Chairman of the Railroad Commission, had his talk with\r\nme after we came back from the New Orleans Cotton Convention. I think\r\nit was in the last week in January, 1905. It was not later than Feb.,\r\n1905. At that time the railroads had done nothing for _the passengers_\r\nat Flovilla. For a number of years the people of the community had been\r\nclamoring for decent accommodations without success. The Mayor had tried,\r\nand failed. The Railroad Commission had issued orders, and had been\r\ntreated with contempt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Crow again, little rooster.”]\r\n\r\nThen what happened?\r\n\r\nThe thunder of the Anti-Corporation Campaign began to rumble. Hoke\r\nSmith’s stern voice began to be heard calling the Railroads to judgment.\r\nThe Corporation law-breakers and Commission-Scorners began to tremble in\r\ntheir boots.\r\n\r\nAnd _in the Spring of 1905_, AFTER BROWN’S TALK WITH ME, the railroad\r\nmen got a move on and ran down to Flovilla, built a little shed for\r\npassengers _near the old depot_ and put some water-closets in the old\r\ndepot.\r\n\r\n_Crow again, little rooster._\r\n\r\n                       EX-CHAIRMAN BROWN’S LETTER\r\n\r\n                                   HAWKINSVILLE, Ga., Jan. 5, 1906.\r\n\r\n    _Hon. Thomas E. Watson, Thomson, Ga._\r\n\r\n    DEAR TOM—Yours of the 3rd inst., just received. I have been\r\n    very busy of late winding up business of the old year and\r\n    arranging for the new year. You know this is about the busiest\r\n    time for the farmer. Therefore I have not read the papers\r\n    closely and have not seen the denial of Mr. Howell concerning\r\n    the improvements at Flovilla ordered some time ago by the\r\n    Railroad Commission. I do not recall exactly what I said to\r\n    you in regard to this matter, but I will give you the facts\r\n    according to my best recollection:\r\n\r\n    While Judge Atkinson was Chairman, the Commission, on its\r\n    own motion, seeing the necessity of improved facilities at\r\n    Flovilla, ordered that a pavilion be built like the one at\r\n    Warm Springs, if my memory serves me correctly; also that\r\n    water-closets be put in, and other improvements be made in\r\n    connection with the passenger station. It was a considerable\r\n    length of time before any attention was paid to this order at\r\n    all. After so long a time, and continual nagging on the part\r\n    of the Commission, which no doubt the records will show, the\r\n    railroad put up a little shed there, which is but a make-shift,\r\n    and called it a pavilion. Upon one pretext and another they\r\n    delayed putting in the closets, and if they have been put in at\r\n    all I do not know it.\r\n\r\n    In speaking about this matter on one occasion to a\r\n    representative of the Southern Railway, whom I happened to\r\n    meet on the train, I suggested to him that these improvements\r\n    ought to be made. His reply was, that the railroads did not\r\n    feel disposed to do anything for Butts County for the reason\r\n    that the juries were too ready to give verdicts against the\r\n    railroads. My reply to him was, that if the railroads would do\r\n    their duty by the people, the people would in turn be willing\r\n    to do justice to the railroads.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Dozier, the Banker at Flovilla, and Mr. Duke, a lawyer\r\n    representing the Southern Railway at Flovilla, and others\r\n    there, will corroborate what I have said. In my report to the\r\n    Railroad Commission about the condition of depots in the state\r\n    I called attention to several instances where the railroads had\r\n    refused to comply with the orders of the Railroad Commission,\r\n    and there has never been any denial made by the railroad people.\r\n\r\n    At Pitts, Ga., there was a little pigeon house built and\r\n    located, contrary to the orders of the Railroad Commission.\r\n    The records of the Railroad Commission will show this to be a\r\n    fact. Also it will be found by the records that while Judge\r\n    Atkinson was Chairman an order was made requiring the roads to\r\n    stop their passenger coaches at the station for the convenience\r\n    of passengers, rather than to have them stop one hundred or two\r\n    hundred feet away from the depots. This order has also been\r\n    absolutely ignored by all the railroads that have come under\r\n    my observation.\r\n\r\n    There has not been an order regulating freight rates issued by\r\n    the Railroad Commission in some time, unless it was absolutely\r\n    satisfactory to the railroads, where the railroads have\r\n    complied with it.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Ed. Baxter, who is Chief Counsel, as I understand, for\r\n    all the Southern Railways served notice upon the Railroad\r\n    Commission in the City of Atlanta before the Federal Court in\r\n    the following language as near as I can remember:\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: “Poor little rooster—crowed too quick.”]\r\n\r\n    “The Railroad Commission may well understand that they have\r\n    reached the length of their tether; henceforth we will put\r\n    ourselves under the ægis of the Federal Courts.”\r\n\r\n    In other words, whenever the Georgia Railroad Commission,\r\n    or any other State Commission, or Inter-State Commission,\r\n    undertakes to put in a rate that is not satisfactory to the\r\n    railroads, then they would appeal to the Federal Courts. Again,\r\n    and in its last analysis, the meaning is plain enough to any\r\n    man who wants to understand it, that the railroads have taken\r\n    this position, as is evidenced by their opposition to the bill\r\n    now before Congress and advocated by President Roosevelt:\r\n\r\n    “We propose to make rates without any interference from State\r\n    or Federal authority; we propose to fight any law, or any\r\n    authority to take this right away from us.”\r\n\r\n    And that, it seems to me, is the great issue overshadowing all\r\n    other issues of the present time in this state and every other\r\n    state in the Union, as to whether or not the railroads shall be\r\n    allowed to make rates without any interference from any State\r\n    or Federal authority. Whenever we give them that power they are\r\n    absolutely masters of the situation, and they know it. They can\r\n    bribe legislatures, judges and jurors, and levy tribute upon\r\n    the people themselves to pay for this corruption.\r\n\r\n    Now, the circumstances leading up to our meeting with Mr. Ed.\r\n    Baxter in the Federal Courts, are interesting and amusing. In a\r\n    few days I will give you the details in another letter. I hope\r\n    that I have not already trespassed upon your patience.\r\n\r\n    Hoping that you are entirely restored to health, with kind\r\n    regards to each member of your family, and best wishes for\r\n    yourself, I am\r\n\r\n                           Your friend,\r\n\r\n                                                        POPE BROWN.\r\n\r\nIn the letter just quoted, Hon. Pope Brown repeats the statement that\r\nthe railroads _did_ treat with contempt the order of the Commission;\r\nand he relates a conversation he had with one of the representatives of\r\nthe Southern Railroad, in which that official gave, as a reason for not\r\nmaking the required improvements at Flovilla, that _the people of that\r\ncounty had given verdicts against the Railroad_.\r\n\r\nYet the railroad candidate for Governor has deliberately tried to deceive\r\nthe people of Georgia into believing that when the Railroad Commission\r\nordered a new depot for Flovilla, the railroads promptly obeyed the order\r\nand built a new depot right away.\r\n\r\nPoor little rooster—crowed too quick.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn my article, it was stated that the Flovilla case was but one out of\r\nmany that could be mentioned. Since Clark Howell undertakes to prove\r\nto the people of Georgia that the railroads are good, law-abiding\r\ncitizens, I will mention some other instances in which they violate the\r\nlaw every day of their lives, persistently, deliberately, insolently,\r\ncontemptuously.\r\n\r\nThe law requires them to post bulletins of delayed trains _at every\r\nstation in advance of the delayed train_, in order that passengers may\r\nbe put upon notice. This law is of great consequence to the traveler.\r\nIf the train is one, two, or three hours late, and the traveler can\r\nlearn that fact upon his arrival at the depot, he can dispose of himself\r\nto the best advantage during the interval. But suppose the train is\r\nthree hours late and the passenger does not know it? Suppose he asks\r\nthe agent, and gets his head bit off with a sharp, curt, offensive,\r\nindefinite answer? He then hangs around in the waiting room; he is afraid\r\nto leave the depot for fear the train will come while he is away; yet he\r\nmay have to sit there, anxious and suffering, for three mortal hours;\r\nwhen, if the bulletin had been posted, he could have escaped some of the\r\ninconveniences of the situation.\r\n\r\nThe law puts a penalty of twenty dollars upon the railroad for each\r\nviolation of this rule; and there isn’t a day when hundreds of violations\r\nof it do not occur in Georgia. Not ten per cent of the agents of the\r\nrailroads obey this law. Ninety per cent of them constantly violate it.\r\n_Ask any drummer who travels through the state!_ Talk about obedience to\r\nthe little one-hoss Railroad Commission? Why, here is a statute of the\r\nCode of Georgia, passed by the sovereign Legislature and signed by the\r\nGovernor, and the railroads treat it as a dirty piece of waste paper.\r\n\r\nIn his letter, ex-Chairman Brown says that the railroads have never\r\nput into operation an order of the Commission as to freight rates,\r\nunless that order was absolutely satisfactory to themselves. He gives\r\nan instance, at Pitts, Georgia, where the railroads went directly to\r\nthe contrary of the orders of the Commission. While Judge Atkinson was\r\nChairman of the Commission, an order was passed requiring trains to quit\r\nstopping one or two hundred feet away from the depot, and to stop at the\r\nstation, for the convenience of passengers.\r\n\r\nEx-Chairman Brown says that this order “_has been absolutely ignored by\r\nall the roads_ that have come under my observation.”\r\n\r\nIn Chairman Brown’s official report, he calls attention to instance after\r\ninstance where the railroads had ignored the rules, the decisions, the\r\norders of the Commission.\r\n\r\n_I challenge Clark Howell to deny the truth of that report._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat Georgian doesn’t remember with indignant shame the threat of the\r\nSouthern Railroad, voiced by its lawyer, Mr. Ed. Baxter, when he “served\r\nnotice” on the Railroad Commission that the Railroads were tired of being\r\npestered by our little one-hoss Commission?\r\n\r\nSaid Mr. Baxter: “The Railroad Commission _may well understand_ that\r\nthey have reached the length of their tether; _henceforth we will put\r\nourselves under the ægis of the Federal Court_.”\r\n\r\nThat was nice, dutiful language, wasn’t it?\r\n\r\nThat sounds like obedience to the Railroad Commission, doesn’t it?\r\n\r\nHere were these Wall Street law-breakers, who had for two years been\r\ndefying the Commission on the Flovilla matter, who had ignored their\r\nrulings on the stoppage of passenger trains, who had continually refused\r\nto obey the law requiring them to post bulletins of delayed trains,\r\nwho, at Pitts, had acted contrary to the orders of the Commission, and\r\nwho had never accepted a freight rate decision which was not just what\r\nthey wanted—and their lawyer had the insolence to serve notice on the\r\nCommission that if it bothered his Wall Street clients further, he\r\nwould turn his back upon it and seek that unfailing haven of Corporate\r\nrascality, the Federal Courts!\r\n\r\nCROW ONCE MORE, LITTLE ROOSTER!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Some editors make editorial music that way.”]\r\n\r\nAs to the illegal charges made by the roads, in the manner explained by\r\nme in the 3rd specification of my article, I stand my ground, and I say\r\nthat the Supreme Court has never declared that such a discrimination\r\nagainst a town on the main line was legal. On the contrary, it was held\r\nto be illegal.\r\n\r\nAs to specification number 4, that the Corporations rob the people of the\r\nstate by compelling them to pay dividends upon fictitious capitalization,\r\nwho can deny it?\r\n\r\nEvery privately owned railroad in this state has had all the water\r\npoured into it that it would hold. The fixed charges are based upon this\r\nfraudulent capitalization. The people pay dividends upon it. The freight\r\nand passenger rates are kept up, and accommodations kept down, and labor\r\nsqueezed, and safety appliances neglected, and bridges allowed to stand\r\ntill they fall beneath a load of screaming, bleeding, dying passengers,\r\nbecause the Wall Street rascals who watered the stock demand dividends\r\nupon the millions which they created out of ink and paper.\r\n\r\nClark Howell dares to say that the Central is capitalized for less now\r\nthan before the war.\r\n\r\nFor shame! For shame!\r\n\r\nOne must be awfully hard up for an office before he can bring himself to\r\nmake a statement like that for a railroad.\r\n\r\nThe Capital stock of the Central was $7,500,000 before the war; and\r\nGeneral Toombs declared that half of it was water. The Capital stock of\r\nthe Central proper is perhaps 75,000 shares, as it was before the war. It\r\nmay be even less. But that’s a matter of no consequence whatever.\r\n\r\nThe really important question is, _How much capitalization does the\r\nCentral carry upon which it has to pay revenue?_\r\n\r\nEverybody remembers how Pat Calhoun got control of the Central, and\r\neverybody knows how thick Clark Howell was with Pat. Wanted to put him in\r\nthe Senate, you know.\r\n\r\nWell, Pat and his Wall Street friends slapped a debt of _sixteen million\r\ndollars_ on the Central during the gay time they had control of it.\r\n\r\nThen the road was wrecked in the most approved Wall Street manner, and\r\nmany a genuine widow and real orphan wept bitterly in their grief, for\r\nthey had gone to bed in comfort and woke to poverty.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the nastiest, cruelest, completest pieces of Wall Street\r\nrascality that was ever worked upon an unsuspecting people, _and Clark\r\nHowell could tell some queer things about it, if he would_.\r\n\r\nThe Central fell into the Federal Courts, was put through the form of\r\na sale, and that international scoundrel, J. Pierpont Morgan, appeared\r\non the scene as “reorganizer.” When the Central had been properly\r\nMorganized, it was laden with fictitious capital to the tune of\r\n$55,000,000; and _upon this fictitious capital the people of Georgia are\r\nmade to pay revenue_.\r\n\r\nWhen Clark Howell stated that the Central was capitalized for less\r\nthan before the war, he did not, perhaps, tell a falsehood in a strict\r\ntechnical sense; but, in the impression which he knew his language would\r\nmake, and which he intended it to make, he was as far from the truth\r\nas when he pictured the railroads trotting down to Flovilla, promptly\r\nand dutifully to build that town a nice, new depot—“one of the most\r\nattractive and best equipped depots.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs to the $10,000 campaign fund furnished by the railroads to elect\r\nTerrell, Mr. Howell says “it’s denied by everybody involved.” Ah, indeed?\r\nWhen did “everybody involved” deny it? Who are the “everybody involved”?\r\n\r\nWill Joe Terrell go before a notary and make oath that the railroads did\r\nnot contribute $10,000, or other large sum, to his campaign fund?\r\n\r\nJoe may not be _everybody_ “involved,” but he certainly is _involved_.\r\n\r\nIf he can make an affidavit of that sort, let him do it. His own honor\r\nand the honor of the state demand it. Let Joe swear it was not done, and\r\nI will publish his denial prominently in this magazine.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, however, I want him to explain to the people of Georgia\r\nwhy he, their Chief Magistrate, offered a seat on our Supreme Bench to\r\nthat notorious railroad lobbyist and corruptionist, Hamp McWhorter.\r\nI would like to have this explanation attached as exhibit A, to the\r\naffidavit denying the railroad Campaign fund.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe other specifications in my article Mr. Howell meets with merely a\r\ngeneral denial. Of course, there’s nothing to discuss where a general\r\ndenial is made to a specific statement.\r\n\r\nSo far from the record of the Legislature showing that the railroads do\r\nnot dominate it, those records prove that very thing.\r\n\r\nCan you pass the Anti-Free Pass bill?\r\n\r\nNo. The railroads oppose it. It is the cheapest, most effective method of\r\nbribery, and they mean to keep it. They will keep it.\r\n\r\nCan you pass a law compelling the railroads to equip all passenger\r\nstations with water-closets; and to keep the waiting rooms open at night?\r\n\r\nNo. It would cost too much. They couldn’t do that, and pay dividends on\r\nwatered stock also.\r\n\r\nIf they had to spend money providing accommodations for passengers, such\r\n“lawyers” as Hamp McWhorter and Tom Felder might lose fat corporation\r\nfees.\r\n\r\nNo indeed; you couldn’t pass a bill requiring the railroads to treat our\r\nwives and daughters decently at the stations where they have to wait for\r\ntrains. It would cost too much.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYonder sits an elderly lady on a pile of cross-ties. She is sick. She\r\nhas been brought to the station to take an early train to the city where\r\na specialist can be consulted about her case. It is cold. A heavy fog\r\nalmost as bad as a drizzle of rain, hangs in the air. The door of the\r\nwaiting room is locked. There is no fire, no light, no shelter at the\r\nstation. The aged woman sits upon the cross-ties awaiting the coming of\r\nthe train—sick, cold and suffering.\r\n\r\nIs that _your_ mother, my son? No. But it might be. Just such a scene\r\nwas witnessed by a friend of mine some weeks ago; and the railroad\r\nwhich treats its customers in that beastly manner is one of these same\r\nWall Street gangs of thieves that rob the state of Georgia through the\r\nHamp McWhorters, the Joe Terrells, the Clark Howells who pose as the\r\nDemocratic Party.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGreat God! Are the people _never_ to wake up to the fact that the\r\nmachinery of the Democratic Party in Georgia belongs to a lot of Wall\r\nStreet rascals?\r\n\r\nDon’t they _know_ that the platform of the Democratic State Convention is\r\nnever handed out till Hamp McWhorter marks it “O. K.”?\r\n\r\nDon’t they _know_ that the majority of the daily papers belong to the\r\nrailroads and _are controlled by the railroads_?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Clark Howell closes his feeble editorial by making a side-thrust\r\nat this Magazine as “a subsidiary company to _Town Topics_.”\r\n\r\nAs to _that_, the answer is swift and to the point.\r\n\r\n_I am this Magazine._\r\n\r\nNot a line can go into it to which I object. Not a line can be kept out\r\nof it to which I put my approval. My contract gives the control of the\r\nMagazine to me completely. What more could anybody exact? That _Town\r\nTopics_ owns a majority of the stock is true. But _Town Topics_ has no\r\nmore rights over the Magazine itself than the _Atlanta Constitution_ has.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTom Lawson, or H. H. Rogers, or Judge Parker, or W. J. Bryan might buy\r\na majority of the stock. I could not prevent that. _But nobody can\r\ninterfere with my control of the Magazine._\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that Mr. Clark Howell envies me my independence. It is\r\nextremely doubtful whether he can say for himself and his paper what I\r\nhave said for myself and the magazine.\r\n\r\nI shouldn’t wonder if he held his place upon the condition that his paper\r\nmust be _railroad_. He wouldn’t dare to have an opinion unfavorable\r\nto _railroad_. When he sits down to write editorials, I compare him\r\nin my own mind to the little girl going to the piano to practice her\r\nmusic-lesson. She is a good little girl, and she follows the notes. She\r\nimprovises no music. She puts out her trained fingers and she touches,\r\none by one, with painful fidelity, the notes written down on the score.\r\nShe couldn’t think of striking any note which was _not_ written down on\r\nthe score. Dear little thing!\r\n\r\nDay after day, month after month, year after year, the trained fingers\r\nstrike the notes indicated in the lesson. If by chance she hits a chord\r\nnot on the book, there’s a rap and a sharp word of reproof from the\r\nauthority which presides over the “practice.”\r\n\r\n“_What’s that?_” comes the cry of the teacher or parent, and the little\r\ngirl, frightened at the false note, hurriedly gets back to the written\r\nscore.\r\n\r\nDear little thing. That’s the way to learn to play by note.\r\n\r\nSome editors make editorial music that way, and the scores are written in\r\nWall Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pinkerton’s Report to Ye Bankers_\r\n\r\nAccordingly to the report made by the Pinkerton Detective Agency to the\r\nAmerican Bankers’ Association, at its last meeting, there were arrested\r\nand prosecuted _during the ten years preceding September, 1905_, five\r\nhundred and fifty-four citizens who had committed crimes against these\r\nbanks. Some of these erring citizens had committed forgery, others\r\nburglary, eleven were classified as robbers, and fourteen were called\r\nsneak thieves. These last named probably stole the cashier’s umbrella, or\r\ngot away with the president’s gold-headed cane.\r\n\r\n_The Law_ came down, hard and heavy, upon the citizens who had sinned\r\nagainst the banks, and the transgressors were given sentences aggregating\r\ntwo thousand and one hundred years in prisons, chain-gangs and\r\npenitentiaries.\r\n\r\nThink of it—2,100 YEARS!\r\n\r\nThe sum total of the money which the banks lost by the operations of all\r\nthese criminals, during the entire period of ten years, appears to have\r\nbeen _less than one hundred thousand dollars_.\r\n\r\nYet the law-breakers who caused the loss must vindicate the law by a\r\npenal servitude of more than two thousand years.\r\n\r\nThere’s JUSTICE for you.\r\n\r\nDuring that period of ten years how many banks have gone to smash? How\r\nmany presidents and cashiers have looted the funds committed to their\r\ncare?\r\n\r\nHow many millions of dollars have the common people lost by the rascality\r\nof dishonest bank officers? How many times have we seen frantic crowds of\r\nmen and women gather about the door of some busted bank—men sick at heart\r\nbecause of sudden ruin, women screaming in terror because robbed of every\r\ndollar they had on earth?\r\n\r\nYet when an infamous scoundrel like John R. Walsh of Chicago converts to\r\nhis use the millions of money held in his banks, Leslie Shaw, Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, hastens into print to say that it was all right; Mr.\r\nWalsh had done no more “than other bankers do.”\r\n\r\nThere was a Savings Bank in the holy town of Boston, Mass. It gave itself\r\nthe comfortable name of the _Provident_ Savings Bank. Trusting common\r\npeople put $200,000 of their money into it. Thieves on the inside stole\r\nthe money. At one swoop, this particular bank robbed the people of twice\r\nas much as the whole of rascaldom had got from the Associated banks _in\r\nten years_!\r\n\r\nFrank Bigelow robbed the First National Bank of Milwaukee, of $1,450,000.\r\n\r\n_He was President of the American Bankers’ Association._\r\n\r\nHe not only looted the bank, but falsified its books. He did not commit\r\nthe crime upon impulse or sudden temptation. He did it deliberately,\r\nsystematically, colluding with his cashier to plunder the fools who had\r\ntrusted him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The banker who stole $1,400,000; and a man who stole a\r\nturkey and a duck.]\r\n\r\n_The Law_ went through the form of giving this million dollar thief _a\r\nsentence of seven years_. His penalty is a sham; his “punishment” a\r\nmockery. He will be “detained” in comfortable quarters a few months; his\r\nhealth will then “fail”; he will then be pardoned, and will be ready to\r\nsteal trust funds again.\r\n\r\nSo it is all along the line.\r\n\r\nWoe to the hungry tramp who steals bread to eat. Woe to the ragged woman\r\nwho snatches food for her starving children.\r\n\r\nWoe to the bad men who steal _during ten years_, one hundred thousand\r\ndollars from the Members of the American Bankers’ Association. These\r\nfive or six hundred bad men will be sentenced, in the aggregate, to a\r\npenal servitude of over two thousand years.\r\n\r\nBut let the President of the Bankers’ Association steal one million and\r\nfour hundred thousand dollars from the men and women who trusted him\r\nwith their money, and the highly-connected thief gets off with a nominal\r\npunishment and a seven-year term which will never be enforced.\r\n\r\nDuring the last twelve months, dishonest bank officers have stolen _more\r\nthan twelve million dollars_ from the depositors.\r\n\r\nHow many of these rascals have been tried and convicted?\r\n\r\nLess than half a dozen.\r\n\r\nYes; Frank Bigelow, sometime President of the American Bankers’\r\nAssociation, laid careful plans, in collusion with his cashier, and\r\n_stole fourteen hundred thousand_ dollars of _Trust funds_.\r\n\r\nNominal sentence, seven years.\r\n\r\nJohn Shannon, of Ohio, at about the same time, _stole a turkey and a\r\nduck_; and John Shannon is now serving out in the Ohio penitentiary _a\r\npenal sentence of five years_!\r\n\r\nJohn Shannon, my jo, John!\r\n\r\nWhy _didn’t_ you wear a silk hat, and steal a million dollars _from the\r\ninside_ of a bank?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wayland’s Mistake_\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting and powerful men of this generation is J. A.\r\nWayland.\r\n\r\nHe is a pioneer Socialist.\r\n\r\nHe is a hard worker, a hard hitter, and a man who never quits.\r\n\r\nFor the last fifteen years he has been a wonder of the world, to me.\r\nHenry Gronlund was not more unselfish, John P. Altgeld was not more\r\nintense, and Arthur Brisbane is not more effectively equipped.\r\n\r\nWhen I first knew of Wayland, he had come down to Tennessee to put his\r\nbeautiful dream into operation. He had founded a Colony on the basis of\r\nUniversal Brotherhood. He meant to demonstrate to mankind the ease with\r\nwhich we could make angels out of one another, if we would only set about\r\nit in the right way.\r\n\r\nAs I remember, the name of Wayland’s Happy Land was _Ruskin_—the name of\r\nan English dreamer who wrote many beautiful things and lived one of the\r\nsaddest lives imaginable.\r\n\r\nThe vital spark in the Ruskin colony was Wayland’s paper. He called it\r\n“The Coming Nation.” The circulation of this paper grew to be enormous,\r\nand the soul of the paper was Wayland.\r\n\r\nBut some of the angels who had drifted into the colony became jealous of\r\nWayland, and they made the point that the paper should not continue to\r\nbe the property of Wayland—the man who had made it—but should become the\r\ncommon property of everybody who had drifted into the colony.\r\n\r\nIf my memory serves me right, Wayland yielded to his angel-brothers, and\r\nturned his magnificent property over to the Toms, Dicks, and Harrys who\r\nhad come into Ruskin from the four corners and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the angels found fault with Wayland about something else and\r\nthen something else; and then some other thing: until the great-hearted,\r\ngreat-minded man threw up his hands in despair.\r\n\r\nHe surrendered everything to the Colony—paper, shops, farms and all—and\r\nwent away from there, never to return.\r\n\r\nWhat became of the Colony? The smart fellows who knew so much more\r\nthan Wayland ran the whole thing into the ground. The brethren had\r\nhardly kicked Wayland out before they began to kick each other out. The\r\nmaster-hand and the master-mind being absent, the small men quarreled\r\namong themselves, and chaos ensued. The Ruskin Colony went to pieces, and\r\none of the remnants strayed into South Georgia. There it lived a brief,\r\ntroubled life, and there it died an unlamented death.\r\n\r\nWhat became of the magnificent paper, “The Coming Nation?”\r\n\r\nWayland’s genius had made it; by every law of common sense and common\r\njustice it belonged to Wayland.\r\n\r\nHis brethren did not think so. The paper was as much theirs as his. They\r\ntook it away from him. Then they didn’t know what to do with it. And it\r\ndied.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith a pluck which nothing could daunt, Wayland opened out in Girard,\r\nKansas, and modestly commenced another paper. This time he called it\r\nthe “_Appeal to Reason_,” but in spirit and purpose it was “_The Coming\r\nNation_” risen from its grave. Patiently, persistently, fearlessly,\r\nWayland hammered away at Girard until he built up a monster circulation,\r\nand again was the owner of an extremely valuable property—the product of\r\n_him_, the said Wayland. No other man could have made _that_ paper. No\r\nother man could any more be Wayland, and do what Wayland does, than any\r\nother man could be Edison, and do what Edison does.\r\n\r\nBy every sane and just rule, the _Appeal to Reason_ was Wayland’s\r\nproperty. He had gone into a desert, with a handful of type and a bottle\r\nof ink, and by the force of _his_ genius had brought forth a finished\r\nproduct—a successful newspaper.\r\n\r\nWhat happened to him then is only a matter of rumor. Conjectures can also\r\nbe made from some indignant, sorrowful sentences which he published over\r\nhis own signature.\r\n\r\nBut it seems clear that his Ruskin experience was repeated. His\r\nangel-brothers made him take his own medicine in heroic doses. The men\r\nwho had not created the paper, claimed an equal share in it—or something\r\nof that sort; and there were the usual points made against Wayland which\r\nthe small would-be leaders make against _the leader_.\r\n\r\nRumor had it that Wayland went through a Gethsemane of peculiar\r\nbitterness, but just how it all was, the outside world was not given to\r\nknow. The great soldier in the cause of humanity covered the wounds his\r\nown men had made, and was too proud to complain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut Wayland is now making a mistake.\r\n\r\nHe is offering land prizes for the largest number of subscribers. He\r\nproposes that, as a premium, in a certain competition on subscriptions,\r\nhe will convey, by deed, a farm in Florida to the fortunate Socialist who\r\ngets the greatest number of subscribers to the _Appeal to Reason_! I can\r\nhardly believe what I see in Wayland’s own paper.\r\n\r\nWhat! Is it possible that Wayland has wickedly gone and bought a quantity\r\nof land?\r\n\r\nIs it possible that he has “robbed” some honest citizen of his real\r\nestate?\r\n\r\nAnd can it be true that other Socialists not only want to share in this\r\n“robbery,” but want it so bad they will compete for it?\r\n\r\nDear me! I didn’t know that Socialism was like that. If it is, I believe\r\nI’ll take some stock in it myself.\r\n\r\nMy impression has been that the Socialists were opposed to private\r\nownership of land. I have had forcible reminders of that fact in letters\r\nwhich came hot from the enraged writers. Private ownership is “robbery”;\r\nthat’s the way they write to me. Did I not see a Socialist orator wave\r\nhis small, white hand gracefully at all the stores, factories and\r\ndwellings in St. Louis, in the summer of 1904, and did I not hear him say\r\nin his musical voice to the assembled laborers: “_All that is yours; go\r\nand take it!_” Then, with a silk handkerchief he, with courtly gesture,\r\nwiped the moisture from his marble brow, and continued: “_Don’t take a\r\npart of it, take it all. Don’t be satisfied with a loaf, take the whole\r\nbakery._”\r\n\r\nThen he froze me and Joe Folk with a glare of merciless severity, and\r\ncontinued, “These men”—indicating me and poor Joe, with a supercilious\r\ngesture—“_these men_ talk to you about shorter hours of labor, and the\r\nEight Hour day. _I don’t want any Eight Hour day_: what _I want_ is _to\r\nlive in the best possible manner on the least possible work_.”\r\n\r\nAnd now Wayland is going to spoil all this. He is going to quicken the\r\nappetite of Socialists for private property. Instead of feeding a million\r\nmen on the definite expectation of getting a slice of the Astor Estate,\r\nat some indefinite time, he is going to reverse the process and feed as\r\nmany as qualify, on a definite slice of Florida land _right now_.\r\n\r\nI make this prediction: As fast as Wayland makes home-owners out of his\r\nfollowers he will lose crusaders.\r\n\r\n_Beware Capua_, friend Wayland!\r\n\r\nA zealous Socialist, who owns nothing, but who is spurred on by that\r\nGod-given desire for private property, will eagerly compete for Wayland’s\r\nprize and will win it. He will pocket the deed, and move to his land. He\r\nwill find, perhaps, that it does not quite come up to representation; but\r\nit is too late to back out. He settles on his seventy acre tract. If it\r\nhas no house, he builds. If he has one already, he does all that he can\r\nto make it more attractive. _It is his._ When the storm beats without, he\r\nsnuggles close to his fireside, and thanks God that this is _his_ shelter\r\nfrom the wild night. His wife will lay her loving touches here and there,\r\nand the house will take on a look which reflects the individuality of the\r\nowners. Flowers in the front yard, vines clinging about the porch, bright\r\npictures on the wall, ferns and grasses in the vase over the mantel, a\r\nclimbing rose, perhaps, to race for the cone of the house and to throw\r\nout its crimson colors from the roof. Toil which one loves will be freely\r\nspent on garden and field, for the toiler is working for those he loves\r\nbest. In a few years, under the care of home-owners, the neighbors will\r\nsay, “_It doesn’t look like the same place._”\r\n\r\nAnd it _isn’t_ the same place. The owners have transformed it. They have\r\nput elements of value and beauty there which nature did not supply. They\r\nhave so directed their labor, their judgment, their good taste, their\r\ntender interests, that the _home_ which they have created is as different\r\nfrom the wild land, as the noble watch-dog at the door differs from the\r\ngray wolf of the wilderness.\r\n\r\nDo you suppose that this man and his wife and his children can ever be\r\nmade to believe that they have “robbed” some body of that land, and that\r\nit is wrong for them to hold it as _private property_?\r\n\r\n_Never in the world!_\r\n\r\nWayland has made a confession as well as a blunder.\r\n\r\nBy offering such a prize, he knows he is appealing to one of the\r\nstrongest human passions—the passion for home-owning.\r\n\r\nEvery full-sexed girl instinctively feels that her destiny is\r\nMotherhood—and she plays with dolls, nurses them, kisses them, hugs them\r\nto her little bosom, calls them pet names, fondly dresses them in every\r\nbeautiful way that her infant fancy can suggest, and rocks them to sleep\r\nin the tiny cradle. _That is the God-given instinct of Motherhood._\r\n\r\nEvery full-sexed man, on the other hand, is born with a craving for _his\r\nmate_, and next to that, _a home to put her in_.\r\n\r\n_Individualism_, crying aloud to me and to you, says “_choose your mate\r\nand make her yours_.” The idea of promiscuous mating is abhorrent.\r\nCollective mating would be hideous. You want individual mating. You want\r\nto separate _your_ mate from every other woman and from every other\r\nman—and if another man invades your individual rights, _you slay him like\r\na dog_.\r\n\r\nThere’s the natural feeling, the natural passion, the natural\r\nindividuality—and everybody knows it.\r\n\r\nThis craving for individual mating with women, bases itself firmly on\r\nthe _individual home_. Give me _my_ mate, and let me take her to _my_\r\nhome:—and you have consistency, you have nature, you have a foundation\r\nfor home-life and all that flows from it—a foundation firm as the\r\neverlasting hills.\r\n\r\nBut _the two_ go together. They are parts of the same system. Surrender\r\none, and you endanger the other.\r\n\r\nIf you are a Collectivist—your logic _will never stop at Collectivism in\r\nproperty only_.\r\n\r\nIf you believe in the one wife, believe also in the _home_, which shall\r\nbe yours _individually_, just as your wife is yours, _individually_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Calhoun for Public Ownership_\r\n\r\nThrough the never-failing courtesy of Senator Clay, of Georgia, it was\r\nrecently my good fortune to come into possession of two bulky volumes\r\nissued by the Government, and entitled, “Annual Report of the American\r\nHistorical Association.” The second volume of this report contains the\r\nPrivate Correspondence of John C. Calhoun, and a most interesting\r\ncollection of letters it is.\r\n\r\nGlancing through these letters hurriedly, I came upon one which Mr.\r\nCalhoun wrote to William C. Dawson, of Georgia, in 1835, wherein he\r\ndeclares himself strongly in favor of state-built railroads.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that at that time there was a surplus of revenues\r\nin the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThis surplus was not given away in premiums to bond-holders as Mr.\r\nCleveland gave sixty million dollars a few years ago.\r\n\r\nIt was not deposited with the National Banks to be used in their business\r\nas Mr. Roosevelt now disposes of $56,000,000 of the public funds.\r\n\r\nIn the days of Calhoun, governmental robbery of the taxpayer for the\r\nbenefit of the non-taxpayer had not been reduced to a science as it has\r\nsince been.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Calhoun’s day, it was believed that when the Government\r\nhad collected from the taxpayer a greater sum than was needed for\r\ngovernmental expenses, the excess should, as a matter of common honesty,\r\nbe returned to the taxpayer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John C. Calhoun]\r\n\r\nIt being impracticable, however, to restore the money in exact proportion\r\nto each individual taxpayer, the Government did the next best thing—it\r\ndivided the surplus pro rata, among the states.\r\n\r\nIn his letter to Dawson, Mr. Calhoun estimates the entire amount of the\r\nsurplus, extending over a series of years, at seventy or eighty million\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nThe share of Georgia and South Carolina, he estimates at $3,500,000.\r\n\r\nNow what does he advise shall be done with this money which has been\r\ndrawn from the taxpayers of the two states?\r\n\r\n_He advises that it be spent by Georgia and South Carolina in building\r\nrailroads to connect those two states with the lines leading to the West\r\nand Southwest._\r\n\r\nSpent in that manner, the surplus taxes of the two states would be so\r\ninvested as to benefit all the people of Georgia and South Carolina.\r\n\r\nIt wouldn’t go to fatten a handful of greedy, millionaire bond-holders.\r\n\r\nIt wouldn’t go to a few pet National banks to be loaned out as private\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nIt being public money, it would be used for a public purpose; and the\r\ngreat public roads which it would build would belong to and benefit all\r\nthe people of the two states which had paid the taxes into the Federal\r\nTreasury.\r\n\r\nSays Mr. Calhoun:\r\n\r\n“To make this great fund available for so important an object, the\r\nlegislatures of the states interested ought to move forthwith. I hope\r\nGeorgia will take the lead. The action of no other state could have half\r\nthe influence.”\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun, with marvelous foresight, sketched the system of railroads\r\nwhich has since been built. Just where he declared in 1835 that the\r\nrailroads ought to be, they are now to be found.\r\n\r\nHad his counsels been followed, those public highways would now be the\r\nproperty of the public. Folly, stupidity, sordid franchise-grabbing had\r\ntheir own way, however, and the magnificent system of highways which\r\nCalhoun laid out for the people belongs to the corporations.\r\n\r\n              _Judge Du Bose’s Letter and the Public Debt_\r\n\r\n                                    MONTGOMERY, ALA., JAN. 6, 1906.\r\n\r\n    Hon. Thos. E. Watson:\r\n\r\n    Dear Sir—It is not evidence of dissatisfaction with the common\r\n    infirmities of the human lot that discussion of the characters\r\n    of men in public office assumes the latitude of warning to\r\n    society. Servility of understanding reduces the individual\r\n    to prostitution of manhood. He can no longer be free, who is\r\n    dependent in mind and thought. The duty of the American citizen\r\n    is in the defence of his prerogative of “sovereign,” and upon\r\n    this principle only may reputation in a public officer become a\r\n    convertible term with character in public office.\r\n\r\n    In the year 1769 “Junius” wrote fifty-four letters to the\r\n    _Public Advertiser_, a daily journal of London. The publisher\r\n    was indicted. “Junius” continued to write. He wrote to Sir\r\n    William Draper; to the Duke of Grafton; to the Ministry; to\r\n    King George himself. Who “Junius” was, none knew. The few\r\n    declared his writing turbulent and revolutionary; worthless for\r\n    the occasion. He held to the record. With indignant invectives\r\n    he proved the government corruptions. With high disdain he\r\n    declared he asked for no authority, when he had law and reason\r\n    on his side, to speak the truth. With keen and pungent retort\r\n    he exposed the lapse of society in the evidences of iniquity in\r\n    social leaders.\r\n\r\n    I would not offend by flattering him “who would not flatter\r\n    Jove for his power to thunder.” But the beneficiary is ever a\r\n    debtor to his benefactor. I may write with confidence where\r\n    expression is due.\r\n\r\n    The modest caption, “Editorials by Thomas E. Watson,” has\r\n    already attained to a decisive expectancy in the public mind.\r\n    In brief time the words that monthly come to us under it will\r\n    shed a wider and widening light.\r\n\r\n    Revived iniquities which inspired “Junius” are come for\r\n    exposure. History repeats itself in facts and interpreters\r\n    of facts. “Junius” in immortal energy told the people of the\r\n    Gentlemen in the House of Commons, the Judges upon the Bench,\r\n    the Lords, and the Dukes, and the Ministry and the King; of\r\n    malfeasance in office and of decay in private virtue.\r\n\r\n    The theme then is the theme now. Patrick Henry caught the\r\n    spirit of “Junius”; the “Editorials by Thomas E. Watson” draw\r\n    upon the glorious past to shed light upon the living day.\r\n\r\n    Anxiously we await some words from you upon the most insidious\r\n    consumer of free institutions—_the bonded debt of the United\r\n    States_. Please answer these questions:\r\n\r\n    1. Is not the Government interest-bearing bond the true\r\n    foundation of the “trust”?\r\n\r\n    2. Can the “trust” be eliminated from commerce before the\r\n    government bonds are paid and extinguished?\r\n\r\n    3. As long as the bonds remain and money concentrates under\r\n    their influence and protection in New York, can money so\r\n    concentrated be redistributed from New York in the sources of\r\n    industry and commerce by any other process than by “trust”\r\n    industries process?\r\n\r\n    Let me illustrate: In the Birmingham (Ala.) manufacturing\r\n    district there are three great iron manufacturers, to wit: The\r\n    Tennessee Coal and Iron Company; The Sloss-Sheffield Company;\r\n    The Republic Company and the Alabama-Consolidated Company.\r\n\r\n    Continued effort is made to merge two or all of these powerful\r\n    forces. The Pontifex Maximus in the situation, the great bridge\r\n    over which the merger, if merger there is to be, must pass,\r\n    is a bank of issue—a national bank—willing and also able to\r\n    finance the movement in transit and after consummation.\r\n\r\n    Now, the willing and capable bank in the premises must possess\r\n    an adequate supply of non-taxable, interest-bearing Government\r\n    bonds, upon which, to their full face value, it may issue paper\r\n    money equal to the exigencies of the great merged corporations.\r\n    Without the bonds, upon which to issue the money, the bank\r\n    could not finance the merger.\r\n\r\n    If the iron manufactories be merged, the necessary sequence\r\n    must be the merging of the railroads that enter Birmingham. In\r\n    order to effect the merging of the railroads financing which\r\n    would duplicate the original example, here cited, must follow.\r\n\r\n    Commerce, founded on the public debt, is founded upon\r\n    Government mortgages upon universal private industry.\r\n\r\n    Must not that kind of commerce subvert free institutions?\r\n\r\n                             Yours truly,\r\n\r\n                                 (Signed) JOHN WITHERSPOON DU BOSE.\r\n\r\nThe writer of the letter on the public debt is the author of the “Life\r\nand Times of William L. Yancey,” a book which is a treasure-house of\r\nvaried and valuable information.\r\n\r\nThat this Magazine has made such a favorable impression upon so able and\r\nrepresentative a man, is of itself a great encouragement to us who are\r\ndevoting our lives to it.\r\n\r\nThe question asked by the distinguished Alabamian is a spear-thrust\r\ninto the very vitals of our vicious system of Class-Rule and Special\r\nPrivileges.\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander Hamilton set out to make our government as English as the\r\nConstitution would admit of, he laid the foundations of his work in the\r\nEnglish system of Protection, the English system of Finance, and the\r\nEnglish system of Funding the Public Debt.\r\n\r\nWith his Protective system he meant to favor one class of industries at\r\nthe expense of others: thus rallying to the support of the government\r\nthose who shaped its laws to fill their pockets with the money which\r\nbelonged to other people.\r\n\r\nWith his system of Finance, and his National Bank of issue, he meant\r\nto form a co-partnership between wealth and government. To the favored\r\nfew was to be delegated that tremendous power to create currency which\r\nhad always been a prerogative of the Crown until Barbara Villiers, the\r\nharlot, wheedled from the dissolute Charles II. that concession to the\r\nbankers.\r\n\r\nWith his system of Funding the Public Debt, Hamilton meant to mortgage\r\nthe Nation, in perpetuity, to the wealthy few, in order that they might\r\nalways hold their power over the masses, and their advantage over the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nWilliam Pitt is said to have remarked cynically, when he saw our\r\ngovernment copying the British system: “Their independence will not do\r\nthem much good if they adopt our system of finance.”\r\n\r\nWe all remember how bitterly Jefferson combated the Hamilton measures.\r\nWe can turn to his writings now, and read the scathing terms in which he\r\ndenounced them. We can also read his predictions of the evils which would\r\ncome upon us if we allowed Hamilton’s class-law system to develop.\r\n\r\n_Haven’t the evils come?_\r\n\r\nThe great historic renown won by the Democratic Party and its leaders was\r\ngained in combating this class-law system of Alexander Hamilton.\r\n\r\nDemocrats, and the Democratic Party, _always_ stood in battle array\r\nagainst the Protective System, contending that it was immoral, unjust,\r\noppressive, despoiling the many to enrich the few.\r\n\r\nDemocrats, and the Democratic Party, _always_ went up against the\r\nNational Banks to fight them, declaring that such an institution was of\r\ndeadly hostility to the spirit of republican government.\r\n\r\nDemocrats, and the Democratic Party, _always_ clamored against the\r\nFunding System, and demanded that the Public Debt be paid off.\r\n\r\nThose were the memorable, historic principles of Democrats in the years\r\npreceding the Civil War—in the years when the Democrats had a mission,\r\na creed; leaders who had convictions, champions, who loved ideas well\r\nenough to cherish them more dearly than office.\r\n\r\nWhat was President Jefferson’s proud boast?\r\n\r\nThat he had so cut down Government expenses that the Public Debt would\r\nsoon be a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nWhat was Jackson’s proud boast?\r\n\r\n_That he paid the Public Debt._\r\n\r\nThat was the golden era of American history.\r\n\r\nThe National Bank had been abolished.\r\n\r\nThe National Debt had been paid off.\r\n\r\nThe Protective principle had been stricken out of the Tariff, and that\r\ninfamous system had been reduced to a moderate revenue basis.\r\n\r\nThere was hardly a millionaire in the whole country.\r\n\r\nThere was hardly a pauper in the republic.\r\n\r\nThe individual citizen amounted to more, _as a man_, than he does\r\nnow. Wages were low, but the money commanded a larger amount of the\r\nnecessaries of life than the higher wages of today.\r\n\r\nStrikes and lockouts were unknown. “WE HAVE NO POOR,” was the\r\nmatter-of-fact statement made in Congress by Hugh S. Legaré of South\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\n“THERE ARE NO BEGGARS,” said the English visitor, Charles Dickens.\r\n\r\nIn the whole world there probably was not a people more contented,\r\nprogressive, and generally well-off than we were in the Forties.\r\n\r\n_Which were the naturally wealthy sections?_ The South and West.\r\n\r\n_Which was the naturally sterile section?_ The East.\r\n\r\nWhere is the bulk of all the immense wealth that has been produced since\r\nthe Civil War? _In the East._\r\n\r\nHow came it there? _Class-law took it from the sections where it was\r\nproduced_, and gave it to those who were more cunning and selfish in\r\nframing national statutes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “I see signs of life and hope in the awakening of the\r\npeople.”]\r\n\r\nThere is no fouler chapter in the history of crime than that which is\r\nto be written concerning the manipulation of our National Debt. How\r\nmany hundreds of millions have been made out of the government by the\r\nrascals who juggled with the bonds, it would stagger faith to state.\r\nThe starting point, where Belmont, Rothschild, Sherman and the Bank of\r\nEngland compelled Congress to depreciate the Greenback, the exchange of\r\nbonds at par for Greenbacks at their full face value, the change of the\r\nterms of the bond from lawful money to coin, and from coin to gold,\r\nthe huge commissions paid to favored bankers, the colossal deposits\r\nof public funds to be used in private speculations, the sudden and\r\nmysterious fortunes accumulated by Secretaries of the Treasury, like\r\nSherman, and by Senators, like Gorman, the stealthy mission of Ernest\r\nSeyd, the covert influence of the Haggard & Buell circulars—all these are\r\nbut high-points in a long journey of national shame, legalized robbery,\r\nruinous prostitution of the powers of government to gorge the few on the\r\nlife-blood of the many.\r\n\r\nWho does not know that our Public Debt could be paid off at any time if\r\nthe ruling class wanted it paid?\r\n\r\nWho does not realize the anomaly of the richest nation on earth bearing\r\na bonded debt as though it were a luxury?\r\n\r\nWho does not recognize the grim irony of wearing a bondholder’s chain as\r\nthough it were a string of pearls?\r\n\r\nWipe out the Public Debt and there would be no foundation for the\r\nNational Banks. One form of privilege having been abolished, the other\r\nwould follow. _And then others would follow!_ The bonds are the keystone\r\nto the arch. The Public Debt is the nucleus of the system by means of\r\nwhich Wealth runs the Government for its own benefit.\r\n\r\nWho wants the Government to economize? Not the Privileged. By no means.\r\nIf the Government were to economize there would be such a surplus in the\r\nTreasury that the Government, for very shame, _would have to pay itself\r\nout of debt_.\r\n\r\nThe Privileged are determined to keep the Government in debt, and hence\r\nthere will be no economy.\r\n\r\nThe fields of expenditure shall widen, widen, and be kept on widening.\r\nSalaries shall increase, and increase, and be kept on increasing. Offices\r\nshall be multiplied, and multiplied, and be kept on multiplying.\r\n\r\nThe Panama Canal can get all it wants; let the Philippines cost what they\r\nmay; give more to the Navy; give more to the Army; give more to Rivers\r\nand Harbors; give more to Pensions; give the Railroads four times as much\r\nas it is worth to carry the mails, and then give them a special subsidy\r\nto keep the contract; give $45,000 for carrying mail to the Island Tahiti\r\nwhen the “cussed foreigner” offered to do it for $3,500; give with so\r\nlavish a hand that even the South will get a pull at the sugar-teat, and\r\nshall join in the Hallelujah Chorus of “O, _ain’t_ it good!”\r\n\r\nA child ought to be able to see the profound policy which underlies the\r\nextravagance of the Federal Government.\r\n\r\nThe Tariff must _not_ be lowered; the Public Debt must _not_ be paid off;\r\nthe reign of the Trusts must _not_ be threatened:\r\n\r\n“STAND PAT!”\r\n\r\nThat’s the watchword of heartless Plutocracy which has erected its powers\r\nupon the three bed-rock measures of Alexander Hamilton.\r\n\r\n“STAND PAT!”—blares the bugle-note of Class-law leaders, for they know\r\nthat _a system_ depends upon all of its component parts. If there should\r\nbe a leak in the dike, _anywhere_, the angry ocean might come pouring in.\r\n\r\nWhere are the Democrats, and the Democratic Party?\r\n\r\nWhat soldiers are pitching their tents upon the historic fields of\r\nDemocracy?\r\n\r\nWhat lines of battle are forming under the time-honored banners of\r\nJefferson and Jackson?\r\n\r\nAlas! The mighty strain and struggle of the Democratic Party during these\r\ndegenerate days, has been to imitate every bad habit of the Republicans.\r\nDemocrats vote with the Republicans to continue the National banks, to\r\ncontinue the Public Debt, to continue the Protective system, to embark\r\nupon an imperial colonial system, to perpetuate the rule of the Trust, to\r\nmultiply objects and amounts of National extravagance.\r\n\r\nWhere do I see signs of life and hope?\r\n\r\nIn the rapid awakening of the people to the fact that _in the name\r\nof Party_ they are being stripped of everything that makes for the\r\nindependence and prosperity and happiness of the average citizen.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Talmage in Russia: Fourteen Years Ago_\r\n\r\nAfter the downfall of Beecher, Doctor Talmage became the most conspicuous\r\npreacher in the United States. His sermons and his writings had an\r\nimmense audience. “Talmage’s Sermon” was a standing headline, in American\r\nMonday morning newspapers, and they were widely known in Europe also.\r\nNo visitor to New York thought of returning home until he had attended\r\nservices at the Brooklyn Tabernacle and qualified himself to boast of\r\nthe fact that he had “heard Talmage.”\r\n\r\nThe fact that Doctor Talmage had been engaged to furnish articles to\r\nany periodical, was sufficient to boost its circulation into the tens\r\nof thousands. No Lyceum, no Chautauqua, no Lecture Course was complete\r\nwithout Talmage. Formal banquets, in quest of oratorical attractions,\r\nnever failed to urge the attendance of Doctor Talmage.\r\n\r\nSomehow the man became the fashion, the rage. He was the Caucasian Booker\r\nWashington. Everybody having agreed that he was a wonderful man, the ball\r\nkept on rolling by the law of inertia.\r\n\r\nNobody could tell you wherein he was great; nobody could quote anything\r\nremarkable from his writings or his sermons; nobody knew of anything\r\nphenomenal that he had done, or was supposed to be able to do. His\r\ncapacity for the benevolent assimilation of an indefinite number of\r\nvoluntary donations was strikingly like Booker Washington’s power in the\r\nsame direction; but beyond the fact that Talmage preached to a large\r\ncongregation, and wrote books which many people read, his greatness was\r\nhard to define.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHowever, Talmage had his day. He was the fashion. At home and abroad\r\nhe was a man whom it was the correct thing to treat with distinguished\r\nconsideration. Foreign potentates, princes and powers knew Talmage as a\r\nmighty man of the pen; likewise as a man of infinite capacity for talk;\r\nalso as a man who traveled with a photographic outfit. Consequently a man\r\nto be handled with care; “this side up,” as it were.\r\n\r\nHis progress through a foreign land, was not merely an incident; it was\r\nan event. He was greeted with dress-parade formalities. Foreign princes,\r\npotentates and powers _knew_ that Talmage would write a book about them\r\nwhen he got home; that the book would be read by hundreds of thousands;\r\nthat public opinion would be influenced by it; and that the photographs\r\nof the princes, etc., would appear in the book. Consequently the smiling\r\nfaces which were turned toward the Talmage Camera by the helpless\r\npotentates etc., were almost distressing in their laborious amiability.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs to Russia, Doctor Talmage seems to have gone there by imperial\r\ninvitation and prearrangement.\r\n\r\n“Stepping from the Moscow train on returning to St. Petersburg, an\r\ninvitation was put in my hand inviting me to the palace.... I had already\r\nseen the Crown Prince in his palace.... The royal carriage was waiting,\r\nand the two decorated representatives of the palace took me to a building\r\nwhere a suite of three rooms was appointed me, where I rested, lunched,\r\nexamined the flowers and walked under the trees.” Then the royal carriage\r\ncame again, took him through the magnificent and beautiful grounds to\r\nthe palace of the Czar. During his stay, officials crowded around him,\r\nlavished attentions upon him, stuffed his ears with glowing accounts of\r\nthe lovely conditions prevailing in Russia, and made Doctor Talmage feel\r\ngood generally.\r\n\r\nRussian autocracy laid itself out to capture Talmage, and it captured him\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\nFrom a picture on page 408 of his book, I infer that Russian enthusiasm\r\nbroke from every restraint, and that he was caught up in the arms of a\r\ndelirious populace, and borne triumphantly through the streets, on the\r\nshoulders of his worshipers. The picture represents Russian citizens\r\n(who bear a disconcerting resemblance to New York dandies), waving their\r\nhats wildly—(Derby hats)—and shows Doctor Talmage sitting gracefully\r\nupon the shoulders of two elegantly dressed enthusiasts; and the silk\r\nhat of the Doctor is held aloft in his eloquent right hand, while his\r\nleft is extended in what I take to be his favorite gesture. The picture\r\nrepresents all the Russians with their mouths shut. It also represents\r\nTalmage with his mouth shut—a fact which arouses a suspicion that the\r\npicture is spurious. Under _such_ circumstances, Talmage could no more\r\nhave kept his mouth shut than Bryan could.\r\n\r\nOther pictures show Doctor Talmage in the act of responding from his\r\ncarriage to a street ovation; also of rising to make a few remarks to\r\na grand gathering in a hall draped with the Stars and Stripes; also of\r\nmaking a speech on the arrival of a ship from the United States bringing\r\nbread to feed the Russian peasants.\r\n\r\nThere are, also, pictures showing Talmage seated on one side of a small\r\ntable and the Czar seated on the other; Talmage in the act of being\r\nreceived into the family circle of the Czar; Talmage standing erect in\r\nhis carriage, hat outstretched, in the act of returning the salutes\r\nof hat-waving crowds which pause and look pleasant, apparently, until\r\nTalmage’s picture man can draw his focus, spring his slide, and say,\r\n“That’ll do.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI state all this to show the readers how public opinion is sometimes made\r\nto order. The Russian autocracy knew that Talmage was the best possible\r\npress-agent they could use. He was intensely vain, easily flattered, a\r\nsnob to the core, a man whose very soul quivered with delight under the\r\nsmile of royalty.\r\n\r\nThere had been a great deal of abuse heaped upon Russia. The newspapers,\r\nmagazines, political pamphlets had been telling the civilized world a\r\nvast deal about the barbarities practiced by the Russian government.\r\nGeorge Kennan, the brave American traveler, had risked all the rigors of\r\nSiberia to see for himself how prisoners were treated there. His reports\r\nhad thrilled the hearts of millions with furious indignation against\r\nthe Czar, and with profound pity for the victims of imperial tyranny.\r\nTolstoy, Stepniak, Kropotkin and many others had been heard.\r\n\r\nRussian autocracy was in bad odor throughout the Christian world, and\r\nif such a man as Talmage could be enlisted for the defence, it would be\r\na fine thing to do. His voice would carry weight throughout Europe and\r\nthe United States. Therefore, it is reasonably certain that the Russian\r\ngovernment had an axe to grind when it made the Talmage visit an occasion\r\nfor a series of ovations.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the Russian government got from Talmage when he came\r\nto write his book of travels, a chapter of the most fulsome, least\r\ndiscriminating praise that you will ever read.\r\n\r\nRussia was all right, in every respect. Travelers were _never_ subjected\r\nto vexatious delays or examinations—for Talmage had not been delayed or\r\nvexed. He actually carried into Russia some books which criticised the\r\ngovernment, and the magnanimous officials made no objection. There was no\r\nreligious persecution in Russia! On the contrary, Jews and Gentiles, of\r\nall descriptions, could worship God in any manner that pleased them. The\r\nGovernment never interfered.\r\n\r\nIf a nobleman conspired against the life of the Czar, he was arrested,\r\nput into a carriage, blindfolded, driven about for many hours to make him\r\nbelieve that he was on his way to Siberia, and he was then set down, at\r\nhis own door, safe, unharmed, free!\r\n\r\nIf a poet wrote scurrilous verses about the Empress, he was brought into\r\nthe family circle of the Czar and asked to read the lines in the hearing\r\nof the lady. That was the worst.\r\n\r\nSiberia was described as a country of Italian softness of climate; and\r\nbanishment to the Siberian prisons, mines, etc., was altogether better\r\nfor criminals than ordinary jails.\r\n\r\nDoctor Talmage defended Russian autocracy, Russian police, Russian\r\nprisons, indignantly hurling back upon the slanderers of Russia their\r\nfoul accusations.\r\n\r\nListen to him—Talmage:\r\n\r\n“But how about the knout, the cruel Russian knout, that comes down on the\r\nbare back of agonized criminals? Why, Russia abolished the knout before\r\nit was abolished from our American navy.”\r\n\r\nThink of reading this stuff at a time when the ears of the world are yet\r\ntingling at the sound of the Cossack whips!\r\n\r\nThink of reading this _when we know_ that before Talmage’s book was\r\nwritten, and while it was being written, and ever since it was written,\r\nRussian peasants, by thousands, _have been flogged every year for\r\nnon-payment of taxes_!\r\n\r\n“The Emperor received me with much heartiness. And at the first glance,\r\nseeing him to be a splendid gentleman, with no airs of pretension and as\r\nartless as any man I ever saw, it seemed to me that we were old friends\r\nfrom the start.”\r\n\r\nDoctor Talmage did not visit the Russian prisons which he defended;\r\ndid not go to Siberia, which he compared to Italy; did not make any\r\ninvestigations of peasant-life; did not go among the working classes; did\r\nnot talk with Tolstoy, nor any man of the dissatisfied elements. In fact,\r\nTalmage declares, in effect, that nobody was dissatisfied.\r\n\r\nListen to Doctor Talmage, Page 422:\r\n\r\n“He who charges cruelty on the imperial family and _the nobility of\r\nRussia_, belies men and women as gracious and benignant as ever breathed\r\noxygen.”\r\n\r\nShades of von Plehve!\r\n\r\nWhen we read such lines as the above and recall how that gracious and\r\nbenignant nobility have drenched Russia with blood of peasants, Jews,\r\ncity workingmen, republican agitators—littering the streets with ghastly\r\nheaps of murdered men and women and children—we may well stand amazed at\r\nthe success with which the wool was pulled over the eyes of the Rev. T.\r\nDe Witt Talmage, D. D.\r\n\r\n“There are no kinder people on earth than the Russians, and to most of\r\nthem cruelty is an impossibility.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Dr. Talmage did not go to Siberia, which he compared to\r\nItaly.”]\r\n\r\nOf the Czar, Doctor Talmage says:\r\n\r\n“He’s doing the best things possible for the nation which he loved, and\r\nwhich as ardently loved him.... Things are going on marvelously well, and\r\nI do not believe that out of 500,000 Russians you will find _more than\r\none person_ who dislikes the Emperor, and so that Calumny of dread of\r\nassassination drops so flat it can fall no flatter.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “I prophecy for Nicholas the Second a long and happy\r\nreign.”—Dr. Talmage]\r\n\r\nAccording to Doctor Talmage the story that the Czar dreaded the assassin\r\nwas a base Calumny, and he, Talmage, flattened it out in his book “so\r\nflat it can fall no flatter.”\r\n\r\nI wonder what the present Czar would feel, think and say if he could\r\n_now_ read Talmage’s comfortable assurances on the subject of “dread of\r\nassassination.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile in Russia, Doctor Talmage saw the Rulers, and no others. He talked\r\nwith the governing class, and no others. He saw a ship from the United\r\nStates bringing bread to the Russian farmers, but it never occurred to\r\nhis mind that a drouth in one portion of the huge Russian Empire was no\r\ngood reason why the New World should have to save Russian peasants from\r\nstarvation.\r\n\r\nLooking only on the surface, seeing only what his “old friend” the Czar,\r\nwished him to see, he praised the Russian government in terms of the most\r\nunqualified eulogy.\r\n\r\nBefore the Talmage book was ready for the press, Prince Cantacuzene,\r\nthe Russian Minister Plenipotentiary at Washington, summoned Doctor\r\nTalmage to the deck of a Russian man-of-war, in Philadelphia harbor,\r\nand presented to the enraptured American “a complete gold-enameled tea\r\nservice accompanied by a message of love which I cannot now think of\r\nwithout deep emotion, since Emperor Alexander has disappeared from the\r\npalaces of earth to take his place, as I believe, in the palaces of\r\nheaven.”\r\n\r\nIn behalf of the Czar, the formalities of a trial on Judgment Day, were\r\nwaived, it would seem; and the Czar went direct from Peterhof to his\r\nmansion in the skies.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Alexander, it is well-known, was succeeded by his son\r\nNicholas, the reigning Czar.\r\n\r\nTalmage’s book was published in 1896. Here is what he predicted:\r\n\r\n“_I prophesy for Nicholas the Second a long and happy reign!_”\r\n\r\nThat was a very natural inspiration. Talmage had delved into Russian\r\naffairs and found conditions ideal. The government was mild, just,\r\nprogressive. The people were contented, and devoted to the Czar. There\r\nwas no cruelty in the administration, and no suffering among the\r\npeasants, excepting the locality affected by the drought. The bread had\r\nbeen sent to feed the peasants, and all would be well. The Knout had\r\nbeen abolished. The serf, freed, was happy. Religious toleration was in\r\npractice; the circulation of political literature unhampered.\r\n\r\nThere was not a cloud upon the horizon. George Kennan, Stepniak, Tolstoy,\r\nKropotkin had been slandering vilely the most humane Government of\r\nEurope—a Government which Talmage compared to ours, to our discomfiture\r\nin various respects.\r\n\r\nWith a Podsnapian wave of his hand, Talmage said to Europe, “_Let this\r\ninternational defamation of Russia cease._”\r\n\r\nWith that Royal welcome fresh in his memory, with those public ovations\r\nstill ringing in his ears, with that “complete gold-enameled tea service”\r\ngladdening his eye, with the “message of love” conveyed by the Prince\r\nCantacuzene still warming his heart, how could Doctor Talmage prophesy\r\notherwise?\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the occasion demanded prophecy, and there it stands\r\nrecorded, page 432:\r\n\r\n“_I prophesy for Nicholas the Second a long and happy reign!_”\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Prophet Whose Voice Was Not Heeded_\r\n\r\nAlmost in sight of where I live, there is a heap of stones that marks the\r\nspot where stood the hut in which George McDuffie was born.\r\n\r\nHis folks were “poor folks.” Concerning his ancestry nothing is known.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a boy somebody told me a story to this effect:\r\n\r\nLittle George McDuffie was at the cowpen where his mother was milking,\r\nand he had a calf by the ears holding it away from the cow. A traveler,\r\nin a buggy, drove up and stopped. Seeing the boy, and not realizing the\r\nabsorbing character of the boy’s job, the wayfaring man called out:\r\n\r\n“Come here, Bubbie, and hold my horse.”\r\n\r\nTo which the lad replied: “If you’ll come here and hold my calf, I’ll go\r\nthere and hold your horse.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the story, the traveler was so tickled by the boy’s\r\nreadiness of wit, that he took a fancy to him and secured him a position\r\nas clerk in a store in the city of Augusta.\r\n\r\nWell, George McDuffie wasn’t much of a clerk. He loved to read books\r\nbetter than to wait upon customers. It came to pass that his fondness for\r\nbooks attracted the attention of one of the Calhouns—_not_ John C., but\r\nhis brother, I believe—and Mr. Calhoun placed the boy at the celebrated\r\nschool of Dr. Waddell to be educated.\r\n\r\nThe balance is history. McDuffie became one of the greatest legal\r\nadvocates and political orators this country has ever known.\r\n\r\nLater in life he became involved in a newspaper controversy which drew\r\nhim into two duels. In one of these he received a wound which injured his\r\nspine and affected his brain.\r\n\r\nIn his melancholy decline, and not long before his death, McDuffie was\r\nmoved by a yearning to come back to Georgia and visit the spot where\r\nhis boyhood home had stood. He came from South Carolina by private\r\nconveyance, and spent the night with my grandfather. Next day he went on\r\ndown to the Sweet-water Creek neighborhood where the McDuffie hut had\r\nbeen. My father used to tell me that when they led the broken statesman\r\nto the spot, pointed out the remaining shade tree and the dismantled\r\nchimney, they drew away, leaving him alone with his memories. After\r\nawhile they returned to find Mr. McDuffie sitting upon the stones of the\r\nruined hearth, crying like a child.\r\n\r\nWhen the boy, George McDuffie, left the store in Augusta and went over\r\ninto South Carolina to go to school, he carried all of his earthly\r\npossessions in one little pine box.\r\n\r\nWhen he became a man he made much money, owned large estates and moved as\r\na peer among the proudest leaders of his day.\r\n\r\nBut he never parted with the little pine box. It was a souvenir of\r\nthe old days of youth and poverty. It was sacred in his eyes, and he\r\ntreasured it. When his mind was almost gone, he would put his arms about\r\nthe box, and tell again the story of how it had held all that he owned\r\nwhen he came into South Carolina—a poor boy, on his way to the great\r\nbattle-field of life.\r\n\r\nDid you know that to this almost forgotten statesman, George McDuffie,\r\nbelongs the distinction of having made the most powerful and most\r\nprophetic speech that was ever made in Congress against our damnable\r\nTariff System?\r\n\r\nWell, it does. Such men as Nelson Dingley and Joseph H. Walker were\r\ngood judges in such a matter, and they regarded McDuffie’s argument as\r\nthe strongest ever made against the New England scheme of enriching its\r\nCapitalists by plundering other sections. Dr. Goldwin Smith should also\r\nbe a competent judge, and you will find that McDuffie’s speech is the one\r\nhe quotes from in his “Political History of the United States.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: George McDuffie]\r\n\r\nMr. McDuffie’s great speech against the protective system is too long to\r\nbe reproduced here; but in the concluding paragraphs he predicted with\r\nsuch clearness of vision the reign of rotten business and rotten politics\r\nwhich now afflicts us that his words read like inspired prophecy:\r\n\r\n“Sir, when I consider that, by a single bill like the present, millions\r\nof dollars may be transferred annually from one part of the community to\r\nanother; when I consider the disguise of disinterested patriotism under\r\nwhich the basest and most profligate ambition may perpetrate such an act\r\nof injustice and political prostitution, I cannot hesitate, for a moment,\r\nto pronounce this system _the most stupendous instrument of corruption_\r\never placed in the hands of public functionaries.\r\n\r\n“IT BRINGS AMBITION AND AVARICE AND WEALTH INTO A COMBINATION WHICH IT IS\r\nFEARFUL TO CONTEMPLATE, BECAUSE IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST.\r\n\r\n“Do we not perceive, at this very moment, the extraordinary and\r\nmelancholy spectacle of less than one hundred thousand capitalists, by\r\nmeans of this unhallowed combination, exercising an absolute and despotic\r\ncontrol over the opinions of eight millions of free citizens and the\r\nfortunes and destinies of ten millions?\r\n\r\n“Sir, I will not anticipate or forbode evil. _I will not permit myself to\r\nbelieve that the Presidency of the United States will ever be bought and\r\nsold._ But I must say that there are certain quarters of this Union in\r\nwhich, if the candidate for the Presidency should come forward with this\r\nHarrisburg tariff in his hand, nothing could resist his pretensions if\r\nhis adversary were opposed to this _unjust system of oppression_.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Indeed, Sir, when I contemplate the extraordinary infatuation _which a\r\ncombination of capitalists and politicians_ have had the heart to diffuse\r\nover more than one-half of this Union—when I see the very victims who\r\nare about to be offered up to satiate the voracious appetite of this\r\ndevouring Moloch, paying their ardent and sincere devotions at his\r\nbloody shrine; I confess I have been tempted to doubt whether mankind was\r\nnot doomed, even in its most enlightened state to be the dupe of some\r\nform of imposture, and the victim of some form of tyranny.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: How American Capital Protects American Labor]\r\n\r\n“Sir, in casting my eyes over the history of human idolatry, I can find\r\nnothing, even in the _darkest_ ages of ignorance and superstition,\r\nwhich surpasses the infatuation by which _a confederated priesthood of\r\npoliticians and manufacturers_ have bound the great body of the people of\r\nthe farming States of this Union as if by a spell, TO THIS MIGHTY SCHEME\r\nOF FRAUD AND DELUSION.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBear in mind that this speech was made in 1824.\r\n\r\nThen look around you and see how prophetically Mr. McDuffie pictured the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThe Presidency is bought and sold. Congress is bought and sold. The\r\nconfederated priesthood of politicians and manufacturers do dominate an\r\ninfatuated people whom it deludes and plunders.\r\n\r\nThe Trusts are nothing in the world but the legitimate children of\r\nPrivilege and Protection.\r\n\r\nCampaign boodle-funds are nothing in the world but the sop which the\r\nCorrupt Combination of Capitalists pay to renew the lease which they hold\r\non the Government.\r\n\r\nAnd, as Mr. McDuffie said, the most astounding feature of the whole\r\ndiabolical system is the completeness with which the politicians and\r\nthe Privileged can dupe the victims of Protection into the belief that\r\n_Privilege_ benefits the unprivileged.\r\n\r\nWith the doors of immigration standing wide open vomiting into our\r\nindustrial world all the cheap white labor of the universe, our Protected\r\ncapitalists are still able to convince our wage-earners that American\r\ncapital protects American labor from the competition of foreign “pauper”\r\nlabor!\r\n\r\nHaving ground down the price of factory labor to such a low point that\r\nthey can undersell foreigners in the foreign market, our Privileged and\r\nProtected Capitalists can nevertheless convince American laborers that\r\nthe motive for high tariffs is to enable the Capitalist to pay big wages!\r\n\r\nAnd they swallowed it—the wage-earners swallow it, meekly, blindly,\r\ntrustfully.\r\n\r\nThe record of a Century teaches them nothing.\r\n\r\nThe evidences of their own senses are ignored.\r\n\r\nThe very factory hands who at Fall River lived off the soup of the\r\nSalvation Army devoutly believed that if it hadn’t been for the\r\nProtective system they wouldn’t even have got the soup.\r\n\r\nThe factory girl who is paid five dollars per week, and who, when she\r\ncomplains that she cannot live on the wage, is sardonically advised to\r\nget a gentleman friend, actually believes that were it not for Privilege\r\nand Protection she would not get the five dollars.\r\n\r\nGod in heaven! No wonder that George McDuffie expressed his doubt as to\r\nwhether the masses could ever be enlightened. No wonder his prophetic\r\nspeech vibrated with an undertone of despair.\r\n\r\nLess than one-tenth of the laborers of this country own their homes; yet\r\n_they_ have been Protected for a hundred years.\r\n\r\nLess than a quarter million men own practically the entire wealth of the\r\nwhole United States; yet Privilege and Protection are _not_ for their\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\nYou go to the millions of Unprivileged and Unprotected citizens and you\r\npoint out to them how they are plundered by being made to pay twice as\r\nmuch as they should on every article which they buy.\r\n\r\nThey understand it; they admit the fact; but the corrupt politician has\r\ntaught them what to say.\r\n\r\nThis is the lesson:\r\n\r\n“Yes; we pay twice as much as the goods are worth, but it is patriotic\r\nand humane, because we thereby enable millions of American wage-earners\r\nto get big wages.”\r\n\r\nFine, isn’t it?\r\n\r\nIf the man who repeats that little lesson, and believes it, would go\r\ninto the districts where Protection is and where the system has been at\r\nwork longest he will find himself in precisely the places where wages\r\nare lowest, where Capitalists are harshest, where squalor and vice are\r\nrankest, and where the maddened victims of our soulless wage-system are\r\nnursing in their hearts the passions of hell.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Highest Office_\r\n\r\nLet seasons come and go, let the sunlight and shadows fall where God’s\r\npleasure puts them—do your duty as conscience and reason reveal it to\r\nyou. Let no other man measure your work or your responsibilities; let no\r\nartful sophistry, in favor of the expedient, veil from your steadfast\r\neyes the summits of Right. Let parties rise and fall; let time-servers\r\nflop and flounder, let the heedless praise of the hour lay its withering\r\ngarlands at the feet of him who will purchase them by bending to every\r\npassing breeze, every popular whim, every local prejudice.\r\n\r\nDo thou look higher if joy and strength and peace and pride are to be\r\nthine. In this brief life (hardly worth the living) know this one thing:\r\nthat a man’s honor should be just as dear to him as a woman’s virtue is\r\nto her. Did the Roman girls not go gladly to the lions, to the bloody\r\ndeath in the arena, rather than to recant their Christian faith, or to\r\naccept a lawless lover? Did not the Armenian woman, a few years ago, leap\r\nto death over the precipice, rather than to apostatize or to be violated?\r\nIsn’t the ground still wet with the life-drops of poor Else Kroegler,\r\nwho let her white throat be gashed, and gashed, and gashed, by the black\r\ndevil who assailed her, till her life was gone, rather than to live\r\ndishonored? And shall a man be less heroic than a woman? Is there nothing\r\nwithin us that cannot be bought? Is there no Holy of Holies of conviction\r\nand principle, into which the corruptor shall not enter? Is there nothing\r\nthat we hold sacred as the citadel of proud, fearless, upright manhood?\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time a barbarous peasant worked his way upward and onward,\r\nuntil he wore the imperial purple of Rome; and he said: “I have gained\r\nall the honors and none of them have value.” Did not Cæsar, himself, grow\r\nsick at heart of the eminence he had wickedly won, and say that he had\r\nlived long enough?\r\n\r\nIf we must bow to what is wrong, flatter what we despise, preach what\r\nwe disbelieve, and deny what we feel to be true, is success thus won\r\nanything but a gilded dishonor?\r\n\r\nTo be a man, such a man as you know God would have you be—manly,\r\ntruthful, honest—scorning meanness, hating lies, loathing deceit,\r\nmeeting the plain duties of life, and shirking none of its plain\r\nresponsibilities—is not that the highest office you can fill?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Editorial Comment_\r\n\r\nThe Washington Post is generally accurate in its statements of facts, but\r\nit erred in saying that one of the legal grounds for divorce in Georgia\r\nis insanity occurring _after_ the marriage. Our statute book is not\r\ndisgraced by a provision of that kind.\r\n\r\nInsanity is a misfortune for which, as a rule, the victim is not to\r\nblame. Besides, it is a disease which is often cured, or a terrible\r\nvisitation which sometimes passes away as suddenly as it came.\r\n\r\nSuppose the Legislature deprives the afflicted wife of possibly her\r\nonly protector by granting the husband a divorce; suppose the wife then\r\nregains her sanity—would not the situation be horrible?\r\n\r\nWhen I reflect upon the shameful things the Wall Street millionaires\r\nhave led our Legislature to do, I am by no means certain that some Ryan\r\nor Morgan, tired of his old wife, might secure from the Hamp McWhorter\r\nmachine a legislative license to go and buy a fresh one—but such a deal\r\nhas not, as yet, been consummated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCongress is beginning to catch on to the enormous frauds in the weighing\r\nof the mails. In the first issue of this Magazine, I called attention to\r\nthe notorious fact that certain Congressmen, who belong to the railroads,\r\nwere in the habit of lending to their bosses the frank whose mark on mail\r\nmatter entitles it to go through the mails without payment of postage.\r\n\r\nFor example: Suppose the Southern Railroad wants the use of the frank of\r\nthe Honorable Leonidas F. Livingston, whom “the Democratic Party” of the\r\nAtlanta, Ga., District sends to Congress. In that case, the Honorable\r\nLeonidas will lend his bosses his rubber stamp which, being inked and\r\npressed upon a sack of mail matter, leaves thereon this inscription:\r\n\r\n                        _L. F. Livingston, M. C._\r\n\r\nThis inscription being placed upon the sack, the postal authorities are\r\ncompelled by law to carry the sack to any part of the United States free\r\nof charge. The magic letters “M. C.” which stand, of course, for “Member\r\nof Congress,” are as good as gold in the postal service. Now why does the\r\nSouthern Railroad want to use the frank of the Honorable Leonidas?\r\n\r\nFor this reason:\r\n\r\nThe Government pays the railroads for carrying the mails, at so much per\r\npound; to get at the “average” for the whole year, the Government weighs\r\nthe mail for ninety days; therefore it is hugely to the advantage of the\r\nrailroads to make the “average” as high as possible; and consequently the\r\nrailroads themselves crowd into the mails, _during those ninety days_,\r\nevery God-blessed piece of old junk they can lay their hands on.\r\n\r\nSee?\r\n\r\nBut if the railroads had to pay postage on that old junk, their profits\r\nwould be cut down to just that extent. They would have to pay thousands\r\nof dollars to the Government, in postage, during the ninety days.\r\n\r\nBy getting from the Honorable Leonidas the use of his frank, the railroad\r\ncan escape payment of postage on the old junk. By the collusion of the\r\nHonorable Leonidas, the Southern Railroad is not only enabled to swindle\r\nthe Government in the creation of a fraudulent “average,” but _they even\r\nunload on the Government the expense of carrying the bogus mail which\r\nconstitutes the swindle_.\r\n\r\nIn the first number of this Magazine, I gave Livingston’s name as that of\r\none of the rascals who help the railroad swindle the people.\r\n\r\n_I give it again._\r\n\r\nThe Honorable Leonidas is one of the unscrupulous knaves who covers the\r\nmultitude of his individual sins with the generous, rubber-coat mantle of\r\n“the Democratic Party.”\r\n\r\nThe time is rapidly approaching in this country when a scoundrel will\r\nbe treated as a scoundrel, regardless of his being a member of the\r\nDemocratic Party or the Republican Party. Thieves and corporation\r\ndoodles will not forever escape detection and infamy by crying out “I am\r\na Democrat,” or “I am a Republican.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe gaping world is told that the Princess Ena, of the Royal House of\r\nGreat Britain, is about to marry Alfonso, the decadent lad who is King\r\nof Spain. The Royal House of Great Britain holds the throne upon the\r\nParliamentary Condition that it shall be Protestant. The Act which\r\nrecognized the Hanoverian succession reads: “The Princess Sophia and the\r\nheirs of her body _being Protestants_.”\r\n\r\nBut the crown of Spain would not be allowed to rest upon the head of a\r\nheretic. No, indeed! The King and Queen of Spain must be Catholics.\r\n\r\nBut King Alfonso wants the fair Princess Ena, and the ambitious Ena wants\r\nto become Queen of Spain.\r\n\r\nIs there any way out? Oh, yes. The Princess Ena, of the Royal House whose\r\nProtestant faith is a matter of Parliamentary measure, being determined\r\nto marry a King whose crown depends upon his being a rigid Catholic,\r\nhappily solves the problem by “turning” Catholic.\r\n\r\nVery well. If to Henry of Navarre “Paris was well worth a mass,” why\r\nshouldn’t the throne of Spain be worth as much to the fair Princess Ena?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd, by the way, the Princess Ena has had some illustrious examples set\r\nher in the matter of changing one’s creed.\r\n\r\nDid not unhappy little Anna Gould “turn” Catholic to ease the conscience\r\nof her precious Castellane?\r\n\r\nAnd did not the daughter of the American “house” of Mackay “turn”\r\nCatholic when she became an Italian princess?\r\n\r\nHuman motives are pretty much the same everywhere, and to many people\r\nreligion is a mere matter of respectable conformity to the manners and\r\ncustoms of those who make up the environment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJohn D. Rockefeller is running about from one hiding place to another,\r\nto keep from being found by the officers of the law. How silly. Why does\r\nhe not come into court with a shattered memory and a pack of perjuries\r\nlike some of the other high-rolling rascals who have been before the\r\ncourts recently?\r\n\r\nAs to one-third of the things which might land him in the penitentiary,\r\nif he admitted them, he can say, “I decline to answer on advice of\r\ncounsel.”\r\n\r\nTo another third he can say that he does not remember.\r\n\r\nTo the remaining third, he can make perjured replies.\r\n\r\nThen old John will be in line with Rogers, McCall, McCurdy, Depew and\r\nsome others who have recently figured in the New York legal proceedings.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile Rockefeller is hiding out like a common criminal, would it not be\r\nappropriate for one of his high-priced preachers to come forth in another\r\nsermon, or interview, or signed article, explaining to us common mortals,\r\nwhat a good and pious, and benevolent man old John D. is?\r\n\r\nThe Recording Angel must have a busy time trying to keep straight the\r\naccounts of some of our high-priced city preachers.\r\n\r\nThere was Bishop Potter, for instance, who choked off the Reverend Mr.\r\nChew when that subordinate divine wanted to give us a piece of his mind\r\nconcerning Life Insurance rottenness in New York. The high-priced Bishop\r\nput himself in the attitude of warding off attack from the robbers of\r\nwidows and orphans.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States expressly declares that no money\r\nshall be taken from the Treasury without an appropriation by Congress.\r\n\r\nTherefore, when Lyman Gage and Leslie Shaw, Secretaries of the Treasury,\r\ntook $15,000,000 out of the Treasury and placed it in the Standard Oil\r\nBank in New York City they violated the supreme law of the land. The\r\n$56,000,000 which Mr. Roosevelt’s administration has been allowing the\r\nNational Banks to hold and to use is held and used in violation of the\r\nConstitution. What do our big men care for the law? Nothing. The law is\r\nfor the small and the weak.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was not _your_ mother or sister or wife, _but it might have been_, and\r\ntherefore the thing that happened to her should stir your blood.\r\n\r\nA lady who is every bit as good, so far as anybody knows or says, as Mrs.\r\nRoosevelt, went to the White House to see the President on business. She\r\nwanted to plead for her husband, who had been arbitrarily thrown out of\r\na good office at the instance of a very contemptible cur named Hull, who\r\nhappened to be a Congressman, and chairman of the House Committee on\r\nMilitary Affairs.\r\n\r\nA swell-head White House official named Barnes, told the lady that the\r\nPresident was engaged and could not see her.\r\n\r\nShe remarked that she would wait until the President was disengaged—that\r\nshe meant to stay until she _did_ see him.\r\n\r\nIn other words, she placed herself in the position of “the importunate\r\nwidow.” She was desperately in earnest; her husband had been foully\r\nwronged; it was a matter of vital importance to her; and her wifely heart\r\nmade her brave the rebuff of asinine Barnes.\r\n\r\nMr. Roosevelt had recently returned to the White House from a “progress”\r\nthrough the Southern provinces, during which progress he had exhibited\r\nhimself to his admiring constituents as the most affable, approachable,\r\ngenial and generous of men. What was more natural than for Mrs. Morris to\r\nthink that a little persistence on her part would bring the gallant Teddy\r\nto the front, beaming with that glorified grin and extending that cordial\r\nhand which had so recently enraptured the people of the South?\r\n\r\nStage-play, however, is one thing and “business” is another. Teddy is\r\na genial democrat when playing to the grand-stand, and a bumptious\r\nautocrat in some of his White House moods.\r\n\r\nTo cut the long story short, the lady was ordered out of the White House,\r\nand when she kept her seat she was seized upon by three white men and one\r\nnegro and forcibly dragged out. Her silk dress was torn, her ornaments\r\nscattered, her flesh bruised. The white men pulled her by the arms and\r\nshoulders, the negro held her by the legs; she was dragged through the\r\nmud to a cab, thrown into it like a common criminal and driven off to a\r\ncriminal’s resort, the House of Detention.\r\n\r\nA more shocking outrage has never been committed at the White House. It\r\nwas indecent, it was brutal, it was despotic, it was violative of all\r\ndemocratic usage and of every human consideration. The poor lady was so\r\nterribly frightened, so rudely handled, subjected to such a public and\r\nunprovoked humiliation that she was thrown into a fever and confined to\r\nher bed for many days.\r\n\r\nNo—I have already stated that it was not _your_ sister, or _your_ mother\r\nor _your_ wife whose legs were held by Roosevelt’s nigger while his three\r\nwhite ruffians dragged her, screaming, through the mud, and flung her,\r\nbruised and frantic, into a cab to be driven off as criminals are driven.\r\n\r\n_But it might have been._\r\n\r\nAnd when you consider the incident from that point of view you will\r\nadmire the courage with which Senator Ben Tillman denounced the outrage,\r\nwhile you regard with utter scorn the cowardly attitude of the great\r\nmajority in both branches of Congress who were afraid to say what they\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nMr. Roosevelt was not originally responsible for the outrage, but\r\nhe chose to become so by his refusal to express any regrets at the\r\noccurrence, and by his failure to rebuke the brutes who were guilty of\r\nsuch needless violence to a respectable visitor at a public office which\r\nbelonged as much to her as to anybody else on this earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Maximum and Minimum Benefits, at Least_\r\n\r\n    _There is talk of congress adopting the maximum and minimum\r\n    tariff plan.

He\r\nshuffled out, hands in pockets, and Polly Ann eased back in her chair\r\nbehind the railed-in desk that overlooked the long rows of pallid,\r\nexpressionless faces bowed over the spindles that whirred monotonously\r\nthrough the dull roar of machinery. Polly was used to the noise; its\r\nabsence, during the brief Sunday rests, made her nerves ache dimly as\r\nif their rightful functions had been forcibly suspended, for she had\r\ngrown up within the mills. Her mother had been first to succumb to the\r\ninsidious fever which sooner or later fastens upon the unsound, poorly\r\nnourished slaves of the great White Despot known to the world as the\r\nSouthern Cotton Mill industry. Polly’s young sister had followed their\r\nmother to her quiet rest within a year, after which the overburdened,\r\ninadequate father “aimed” to return to the upland, clayey farm which he\r\nhad so hopefully abandoned two years before; but before he could save\r\nenough money to cover his debts he added to his burdens by marrying a\r\nfactory widow with four pallid, old-young children. Polly lived with\r\nthem until they moved to Atlanta in hopes of financial betterment, then\r\nshe assumed the brunt of home-making for her two undisciplined brothers.\r\nMeanwhile, her industry had increased as her thin, deft fingers became\r\nmore and more proficient. Her interest in her fellow-slaves broadened\r\ninto a mute, protective supervision which the keen-witted boss recognized\r\nand rewarded by placing her in a position of trust which, humble though\r\nit was, relieved her of the bitter grind of mill labor.\r\n\r\nSpring was in the air. It looked in at the dim windows and drifted\r\nthrough the open doors where the sunlight drenched the worn, splintered\r\nfloor with fine gold. Polly recognized something familiar—the sweet,\r\nfar-reaching scent of wild azaleas that grew thick and tall along the\r\ndistant Chattahoochee hill; she closed her eyes and let her fancy drift\r\nback to the green pastures and still waters of the old haunts of her\r\nheart’s desire, until her revery was shattered by a human appeal.\r\n\r\nIt was a sunny young voice that recalled Polly to tangible things, and\r\nit belonged to a very young girl of the “cracker” type, with a face\r\nof spring-like innocence, who introduced herself as “Mis’ Lomux, from\r\nLumpkin,” with a smile of such irresistible sweetness that Polly’s thin,\r\nsallow face lighted with answering pleasure.\r\n\r\n“You-all’s got a job fer me this time, ain’t you?” the stranger asked\r\nanxiously. “I was here last Chuesday, an’ the boss said he ’lowed he’d\r\nhave a place fer me by today. I aimed to git here right soon this mornin’\r\nso’s to start work on time, but the chillun give out in spite of all I\r\ncould do, an’ I was jest obleeged to stop along with ’em at a house\r\nwhere the folks promised to keep ’em till they got rested.”\r\n\r\n“The boss is right busy now,” said Polly in very kind voice. “I don’t\r\nmuch believe he needs any more hands, ’cause he tuk in a new batch\r\nSaturday, but you can wait an’ see what he says. Set down an’ rest\r\nyourself till he comes along.”\r\n\r\n“He surely will give me _somethin’_ to do,” Mis’ Lomux said hopefully,\r\n“’cause he done promised he would.”\r\n\r\n“Well, mebbe he will, then. Did you ever work in a mill afore?”\r\n\r\n“No’m, but I can learn real fast. They say ’tain’t hard.”\r\n\r\n“No, ’tain’t to say hard, but it’s turrible wearin’,” Polly answered.\r\n“You don’t look real stout, nuther.”\r\n\r\n“That’s one reason why I come,” Mis’ Lomux admitted frankly, “though I’m\r\nstout a’ plenty to putter all day without restin’ any bit. Last fall I\r\nwas tuk with a spell o’ fever an’ sence then I jest ain’t been able to do\r\nlike I uster. Plowin’ an’ sech-like beats me plum out in no time. I tried\r\nmy best to take Tobe’s place after he left, but I jest couldn’t make out\r\nno way.”\r\n\r\n“Who’s Tobe?” Polly interrupted with deepening interest. “Your brother?”\r\n\r\n“No’m, he’s my husband.”\r\n\r\n“Your husband!” Polly echoed surprisedly. “You look dreadful young to be\r\nmarried. How long _have_ you been married?”\r\n\r\n“Be ten weeks on Sunday,” the bride replied unenthusiastically.\r\n\r\n“An’ he’s left you a’ready!”\r\n\r\n“Yes’m.” Mis’ Lomux nodded her blond head solemnly. “He done broke his\r\npromise an’—an’ I don’t aim to live with him no more, ever.”\r\n\r\nPolly Ann searched the flower-like face with something akin to pity. “You\r\nain’t a’ carin,’ are you?” she asked in a whisper.\r\n\r\nMis’ Lomux’s denial was emphatic, but unconvincing. “I ’lowed all\r\nhusbands was like pa,” she admitted sadly, “an’ that’s why I married Tobe\r\nso quick after he axed me. You see when pa died that throwed me an’ the\r\nchillun onto the county, with me not able to do fer ’em like I would\r\na’ been if I hadn’t had the fever. What to do I didn’t know ’cause the\r\nchillun couldn’t work by their selves to do any good. When Tobe Lomux\r\nsent me word that he’d tak the hull lot of us if I’d have him, I was\r\nglad enough to marry him on that account, no matter what come. Not that\r\nI got ary thing agin Tobe—no one ain’t fer that matter,” she interrupted\r\nherself to say extenuatingly, “for he’s a real steady, honest person.\r\nTobe’s high-tempered, though. Fust thing I knowed his folks come meddlin’\r\nround talkin’ about him havin’ to do fer a’ passel o’ lazy chilluns an’\r\nsech-like an’ it warn’t no time fore Tobe had put the chilluns to work\r\nlike a gang o’ niggers. Me! Why, I jest couldn’t stand that not fer a\r\nminit! I up an’ told Tobe to hire his own niggers or quit us, ’cause\r\nthem pore chillun warn’t goin’ to be nobody’s slaves. An’ he went”; she\r\nfinished, growing very white and cold.\r\n\r\n“He warn’t much or he wouldn’t a’ acted that way,” was Polly’s stern\r\nverdict.\r\n\r\nThe bride winced. “I aim to show ’im we can git on without him an’ his\r\nuppidy folks,” she retorted, with a flame of delicate color. “That’s why\r\nI come here, jest to make a livin’ fer us all till I can stouten up agin\r\ncrap-making time next spring. By that time the two little boys’ll be big\r\nenough to help with the plowin’. Boys grows a heap in a year.”\r\n\r\n“Did you say you brung the chillun along with you?” Polly wanted to know.\r\n\r\n“Yes’m, we all set out together yesterday mornin’. Tain’t to say so\r\ndreadful fur—jest eighteen miles—but they ain’t used to travelin’ steady,\r\nan’ they give plum out early this mornin’, so I left ’em along with some\r\nfolks while I come on ahead to git work.”\r\n\r\nPolly Ann’s interest was of a keenly personal order, which admitted of\r\nvast concessions in favor of the second applicant for the already crowded\r\nranks of mill laborers. She had turned the first comer away almost at\r\nsight, but Mis’ Lomux was different—her plaintive needs appealed to\r\nPolly Ann’s warm, starved little heart in a fashion quite unknown to her\r\nsince her mother and sister had passed beyond her faithful care.\r\n\r\n“Where’s your things?” Polly asked after a museful pause.\r\n\r\n“We’re totin’ all we’ve got,” Mis’ Lomux answered frankly. “Pa didn’t\r\nhave much of anythin’ when he died an’ I sold what little there was to\r\ngit the chillun fit close to come down here in.”\r\n\r\nPolly rose and stepped from the little platform with an air of decision.\r\n“You set there while I go hunt the boss,” said she.\r\n\r\nSo Mis’ Lomux waited hopefully until Polly returned from the fore part of\r\nthe great building to say that there would be a vacancy in the spindle\r\ndepartment the very next day. “You’d better fetch the chillun right\r\nalong,” Polly advised, “’cause you’ll have to be ready to go to work at\r\nseven o’clock tomorrow mornin’. There’s a’ empty shack at the end of\r\nFactory Row that you can rent real cheap. I’ll see about rentin’ it while\r\nyou’re gone.”\r\n\r\nPolly saw them pass the mills late that afternoon, a dusty, tired band of\r\nwayfarers, each carrying small, queer-shaped bundles which contained the\r\nsum of their meager possessions, and felt herself glow with satisfaction\r\nas she thought of what she had contrived to put into the rough little\r\nshack, in the way of household furnishings. She went over after work\r\nhours to assist with the setting to rights.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the first week Mis’ Lomux and the two little boys, who were\r\nto help with the next year’s crop, had obtained steady employment in the\r\nmills. Their bright faces gleamed out among the listless, pallid, faded\r\nfaces of the “old hands,” with primrose freshness that attracted Polly\r\nAnn’s eyes many, many times during the long noisy day; but soon their\r\nmorning glow waned and the difference grew less and less marked except\r\nfor Mis’ Lomux’s illuminating smile which never dimmed or wavered, early\r\nor late, while the little loved faces turned towards hers. The delicately\r\nrounded girlish figure grew thin, and Mis’ Lomux drooped more and more\r\njust as Polly’s mother and sister had drooped before doom overtook them,\r\nyet never a word escaped her patient lips. There was, indeed, no time\r\nfor self-pity, for all her thoughts were centered upon the children whom\r\nshe sheltered from every harsh word and look with a maternal zeal that\r\nnever failed of its loving purpose, in spite of the children’s wilfulness\r\napparent to every one but Mary Lomux. Polly realized shrewdly how it had\r\nbeen with Tobe, whose judgment had lacked the softening influence of\r\nlove, for although the children were of naturally lovable disposition,\r\nMary had undeniably spoiled them from a man’s view-point.\r\n\r\nEvery Sunday morning Mis’ Lomux piloted her little flock away to the\r\nhills which seemed to beckon her far beyond the noise and smoke and\r\ngrime of Factory Row to the place of her heart’s desire. Polly Ann often\r\naccompanied her friend because the occasion afforded opportunity to add\r\nto the meager lunches in a manner that lapped over several succeeding\r\nmeals. On such occasions the girls talked continually of the tranquil,\r\nhumble joys of home, while the children lay in the grass, too tired to\r\nplay or chatter. Mary comforted their weariness with a promise of a\r\nspeedy reprieve.\r\n\r\n“We’re goin’ home in the spring, sure,” she would say with illuminating\r\nsmiles, “an’ when you’ve been there a day or two you’ll plum fergit about\r\never feelin’ puny or tired. Jest keep lookin’ t’wards home.”\r\n\r\nBut the event seemed to recede. Summer’s golden glory paled before\r\nautumn’s riper loveliness, and the air grew pungent with harvest\r\nfragrance that made Mis’ Lomux’s heart sick with longing. Polly noticed\r\nthat her friend was losing ground daily, but there was no help for her at\r\nthe mills, and Mary would not hear of returning to the fallow farm before\r\nthe growing season began.\r\n\r\n“I jest couldn’t bear to let the chilluns go to the poor farm,” she said\r\nyearningly. “Folks’d always have that to throw up to ’em when they growed\r\nup. An’ there’s them Lomuxes! They’d talk wuss’n anybody.”\r\n\r\nDuring the late autumn one of the boys met with an accident which kept\r\nMary from work for several days and drained her slender savings to the\r\nlast nickle. Then winter came with its chill continuous rains, when the\r\nmills, always dull and somber, grew doubly gloomy. Doors and windows\r\nwere kept closed and the prisoned air grew more and more poisonous as\r\nthe workers exhaled it over and over. Mary protected her boys as well as\r\npossible. She had made herself so well-liked by her fellow-workers that\r\nno one interfered with her many little devices for the children’s comfort\r\nand no one manifested the ill-will which is so generally exhibited\r\ntowards favorites; for it was impossible to be harsh toward the brave\r\nlittle woman who fought so desperately against losing odds. Toward spring\r\nMis’ Lomux was obliged occasionally to take a day off on account of\r\nblinding headaches.\r\n\r\n“’Tain’t nothin’ at all,” she invariably protested, in answer to Polly’s\r\nanxious questions. “Folks that’s had the fever ginerally feel this way\r\nevery year about the same time. When the weather gits warmer I’ll be\r\nstout as ever.”\r\n\r\nBut Polly knew better. She had seen that look of deadly weariness too\r\noften to be deceived.\r\n\r\n“Ain’t you never heard from Tobe?” Polly asked one evening when she sat\r\non the steps of Mary’s shack watching her friend’s strenuous attempts to\r\nhold herself erect while she patched a pair of faded little trousers.\r\n\r\nMary bowed her head very low as she answered, “No.”\r\n\r\n“Where’s he at?”\r\n\r\n“In Atlanta, workin’ in the engine shops, an’ doin’ well; his maw told\r\nBilly Sanders a while back.”\r\n\r\n“An’ he knows you’re down here slavin’ like a nigger for all them\r\nchillun?”\r\n\r\n“I reckon he does, ’cause his maw writes to him.”\r\n\r\n“Then all I’ve got to say is that he must be a turrible no-count feller\r\nto let his wife—”\r\n\r\n“’Tain’t his fault,” Mary flung back, lifting her deathly pale face for\r\na moment. “It’s them Lomuxes that made all the trouble to start with. If\r\nhis maw hadn’t found fault with the chillun he never would a’ done what\r\nhe did.”\r\n\r\n“If you knowed that, what made you send him off?” Polly wanted to know.\r\n\r\n“I jest couldn’t stand the thought of Tom bein’ teched by nobody. None\r\nof them chillun ever had a hand laid onto ’em afore, an’ I couldn’t bear\r\nthat they should—ever!”\r\n\r\n“Well, ’tain’t none of my business, of course,” said Polly drily, “but I\r\n_will_ say that if Tobe was half a man even, he’d do his part now that\r\nyou need him so bad.”\r\n\r\n“He couldn’t—not after what I said,” Mary protested mournfully. “I\r\ntold him never to come back no more till Kingdom-come, an’ he said he\r\nwouldn’t—not if I begged him on my dyin’ bed!”\r\n\r\n“My land, what a mean sperited feller he must be!” Polly exclaimed\r\ncontemptuously. “I wonder the Lord didn’t punish him for sech talk. In my\r\nopinion, Mary, you’re a heap better off without him than you’d be with\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nMary’s head drooped very low over her work, but in spite of that Polly\r\nsaw the tears that fell on the little patched garments. There was a long\r\nsilence during which Polly hated Tobe Lomux as heartily as she pitied\r\nMary. Then she delivered herself of a bit of advice that had burned\r\nwithin her heart for weeks. “If I was you, Mary, I’d give up an’ let the\r\ncounty take care of me—jest for a little spell. You ain’t able to work\r\nanother day, an’ to tell you the truth I don’t believe you’ll be let work\r\nmuch longer, ’cause the boss has noticed how bad you look. I’ll git the\r\ncircuit-rider to speak a good word for you at the poor farm so’s they’ll\r\ngive you a little shack off to yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Oh Polly, I couldn’t go—I couldn’t!” Mary cried chokingly. “For myself\r\nit wouldn’t matter _what_ come, but the chillun—they would always be\r\nlooked down on fer livin’ at a poor farm.”\r\n\r\n“What’s to become of ’em if anything bad was to happen to you, I’d like\r\nto know?” asked practical Polly. “You’ve done for ’em an’ humored ’em\r\ntill they’re sorter spoiled. They couldn’t git along with strangers. The\r\npoor farm’s the only thing, Mary. I don’t doubt but that you’ll be stout\r\nenough by next spring to go back to the farm an’ make a crop, but you\r\nwon’t if you stay here.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll rest up a bit,” said Mary dejectedly. “We can git along on what the\r\nboys makes for a few days an’ by that time I’ll be stout enough to go\r\nback to work.”\r\n\r\nBut in that surmise Mary was mistaken. On the fourth day when she resumed\r\nher place at the reels, outraged nature succumbed completely to the long\r\nstrain, and she dropped in a dead faint among her whirling spools. That\r\nhappened the day before Polly was to go on a long advertised excursion\r\nto Atlanta, and, although Mary was quite ill on the eventful morning,\r\nPolly did not offer to stay with her friend but hurried through her\r\ngala preparations in great excitement. She looked thinner and paler and\r\nsmaller than ever in her unaccustomed finery.\r\n\r\n“I’ll fetch you a little somethin’ from Atlanta, if I git time to go to\r\nthe stores,” Polly promised, while she waited on Mary’s porch for the\r\nhack to gather up its fluttering load along Factory Row.\r\n\r\nPolly left the crowded train at Atlanta and hurried off in search of the\r\nengine shops. She had little difficulty in locating Tobe Lomux, whose\r\nindustry had made him quite a favorite there. He was a sturdy, well-built\r\nyoung fellow with a good, honest face and a firm undimpled chin that\r\nbespoke a will of iron. He looked at little frail, anxious Polly as if\r\nshe were something too insignificant for serious notice.\r\n\r\n“I’m a friend of Mary Lomux’s,” Polly began with a furiously beating\r\nheart, for her hopes had dwindled discouragingly during her long, worried\r\nride, “an’ I’ve come to find out if you aim to leave her die without\r\ndoin’ a thing to prevent it.”\r\n\r\n“Mary—die!” Tobe’s head went back with a wrench that sent the blood\r\nbounding to his face. “What’s that about Mary?” he asked gruffly.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you know that she’s killin’ herself at the cotton mills down at\r\nGainesville, workin’ for them chillun? Ain’t nobody wrote an’ told you\r\nthat, Tobe Lomux?”\r\n\r\nTobe ignored the question. “Did Mary send you to me?” he asked in a voice\r\nthat Polly misinterpreted.\r\n\r\n“No, she didn’t. She’s got too much grit for that even if she is too sick\r\nto hold up her head. I didn’t have much hopes of gittin’ any satisfaction\r\nfrom you, judgin’ by the way you’ve acted, but I thought I’d try jest\r\nonct. What I want to know, Tobe Lomux, is if you’re goin’ to let her\r\ndie—or not?”\r\n\r\n“Me! Why, good Lord, what can I do? If Mary wanted me I’d—I’d—Well, she\r\ndon’t, that’s all.”\r\n\r\n“Mary didn’t send for you,” Polly broke in eagerly, “but if you’re\r\nany sort of a man you’ll drop that spike an’ take the fust train to\r\nGainesville. That’s what you’d do, if——”\r\n\r\nThe tool dropped from Tobe’s grimy hand, and his head and shoulders went\r\nback defiantly. “I’m goin’ right back along with you,” he said, jerking\r\noff his leather apron and shaking down his sleeves. “Wait till I draw my\r\npay. We can talk on the train.”\r\n\r\nPolly remembered that homeward ride to her dying day, for it was the\r\nfirst time in her defrauded life that she had been brought face to face\r\nwith a great passion whose very crudeness added to its strength. Tobe had\r\nheld himself with grim, fearful ardor to his labor, while his stubborn\r\naching heart yearned for one word of reconciliation from Mary. His\r\nmother had written strange, slighting things relating to the blighting\r\nfactory life that Tobe abhorred, and he had waited and Mary had suffered\r\nin silence. Before the train reached Gainesville Tobe’s busy brain had\r\nevolved a plan which he confided to Polly while they stood on the station\r\nplatform waiting for the country stage which was to take Tobe up to\r\nLumpkin that very afternoon.\r\n\r\n“I’ll be down by noon tomorrer, sure,” was his parting promise.\r\n\r\nPolly paid a brief visit to Mary’s shack when she reached Factory Row,\r\nfearing to stay long lest her secret should escape her eager lips. She\r\nwas tired, she explained so tersely that the sick girl felt hurt and\r\nneglected. The following day Polly appeared at sunrise.\r\n\r\n“I don’t aim to work today,” she announced, “so I may as well set with\r\nyou, Mary. You jest lemme fix you up on the porch where you can git the\r\nair while I red up the house a bit.”\r\n\r\nMary was too listless to object, so she dragged herself out to the narrow\r\nporch where the warm spring sunshine drenched the rough boards with a\r\ngolden flood, upon which the blossomed torches of the cypress vine made\r\nsmall, dancing shadows.\r\n\r\n“Ain’t it a turrible pretty day!” Polly exclaimed glowingly. “Makes me\r\nthink of way up in Lumpkin, don’t it you?”\r\n\r\n“I jest can’t bear to think of it at all!” Mary wailed, with a yearning\r\nglance toward the far, golden hills.\r\n\r\n“I’ll bet the honeysuckles is jest thick all over them river hills by\r\nnow. Don’t you rec’lect how blue the bottoms looked along about this time\r\nwhen the dog vi’lets is out full?”\r\n\r\n“It’s time to lay off the cotton fields,” Mary murmured. “Polly, if\r\nanything should happen to me, you’ll see that the chillun keeps together\r\nat the poor farm, won’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Shucks, you’re goin’ to get well—that’s what’s goin’ to happen to you,\r\nMary Lomux. Now lie still and rest while I straighten up the house.”\r\n\r\nMary lay quite still for a long, long while, looking toward home with\r\na great wistfulness in her weary eyes and a dark fear in her heart. By\r\nand by a wagon turned across the bare, sun-baked flat that separated\r\nMary’s shack from the factory grounds and stopped at the head of\r\nFactory Row. It was spotlessly new, even to the snowy bow-sheet, and\r\nthe household furnishings visible through the shirred opening were new,\r\nalso. Mary saw the driver spring down lightly and throw the reins over\r\na broken gatepost. Then Tobe stumbled up the steps, dully ashamed of\r\nhis unconquerable emotion, for he came of a race who count it unmanly\r\nto betray any outward sign of feeling. But it was impossible for him to\r\nspeak calmly.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t have no idee you was sick, Mary,” said he shakingly. “I’m real\r\nglad Polly come an’ told me about it. I thought I’d drop in an’ see how\r\nyou’s comin’ on, jest to be neighborly,” he added in a voice that seemed\r\nto come from a great distance.\r\n\r\nMary struggled up with a smothered cry, but fell back weakly among the\r\npillows and cried instead of answering, while Polly stared helpless from\r\nthe doorway and Tobe wrestled with his heart’s desire to take the poor\r\nlittle woman in his arms and comfort her in love’s own way. And while\r\nthey waited a thin little voice came from the pillows.\r\n\r\n“I ain’t a bit sick,” it said, “jest that flustered I can’t help but cry.\r\nDon’t mind me—Tobe. I’m real—glad to see you.”\r\n\r\n“Mary,” Tobe rose from the chair into which he had dropped and stooped\r\nover the little trembling figure until his big, firm, strong hands rested\r\non her shoulders. “Mary, do you reckon you could make out to go on up to\r\nLumpkin with me? I’d love, the best kind to raise a crop this year.”\r\n\r\nA cry of inarticulate joy struggled up from the pillows and after a\r\nmoment a little tear-wet, lovely radiant face looked up at Tobe. “Do you\r\nmean—Oh, Tobe, would you take the _chillun_ too?” Mary faltered.\r\n\r\n“Sure thing, an’ be only too glad. Land, how I’ve missed them young\r\n’uns!” cried Tobe, every fiber of his being aglow.\r\n\r\nMary’s joy brimmed over. “Oh Polly, did you hear that!” she called in\r\nsheer ecstacy. “I couldn’t be happier—no, not if I was in heaven.”\r\n\r\nThe young man lifted his head and looked straight at Polly with wet,\r\nshining eyes. “Say, you’ve got to go long with us,” he said unsteadily,\r\n“’cause I ain’t goin’ to leave Mary do a lick of work till she gits plum\r\nstrong agin, no matter what comes. Git ready, will you, Polly?”\r\n\r\n“Me! My land, how pleased I’d be. Why, it’d be like gittin’ to\r\nheaven—mighty nigh,” said Polly growing hot and cold by turns. “Now that\r\nthe boys is both goin’ down to live with pa, too. Seem like things is\r\nturnin’ out too good to be true.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t it! Tobe, can we go soon?” Mary asked breathlessly.\r\n\r\n“Soon as you’n Polly can fix what you want to take along,” Tobe answered\r\neagerly. “I’ll go over an’ fetch the chillun from the factory while you\r\nall git ready. We’d oughter git home by dark.”\r\n\r\nThen he rose and strode buoyantly across the sun-baked hill to the\r\nfactory door and Mary rose, too, tremblingly, but without hesitation,\r\nwhile Polly held herself in readiness to support her frail figure should\r\nher strength desert her. But there was no further need of anxiety, for\r\nMary had tasted the elixir of life during that brief, transfiguring hour\r\nwhen love had put to rout the dreariness of hope deferred and filled her\r\nheart with joy unspeakable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nBobby Jonks; His Hand and Pen\r\n\r\nMan is an animal, but you can easily detect him from the rest of them\r\nwhen he has his hat on.

The difference between a biped and a\r\nquadruped is two legs. A three-legged stool is a tripod, and is mostly\r\nused by country editors.

A\r\nwoman may be as handsome as a circus horse but she is never satisfied\r\nto let another woman be handsome, too. It’s different altogether with a\r\nhog—he is perfectly contented to let everybody else be hogs if they want\r\nto. Oh, why should the spirit of mortal be proud?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Assessment Insurance_\r\n\r\nA HOMILY ON THE ROYAL ARCANUM\r\n\r\nBY MICHAEL MORONEY\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no real or true life insurance but the straight old line regular\r\nlife, where the policy is payable only at death. Term life insurance,\r\nso called, is simply banking for the benefit of the company which takes\r\nthe risk. In regular life insurance the insured has a certain expectancy\r\nat the time of taking out the policy. Payment for the amount he is to\r\nreceive at death is spread out over his expectancy, less four per centum\r\ninterest compounded, and he pays it in annual, semi-annual, or quarterly\r\ninstallments, as may be agreed upon. If he lives out his expectancy, he\r\nwill have paid in all he is to receive at death, either directly, or\r\nby the interest carried on his premiums. Of course there is a certain\r\namount of loading in the premiums he pays, but for the purposes of our\r\nillustration, that need not be considered. In this plan, the policy\r\nholder is really insuring himself, and when he dies his beneficiary, or\r\nestate, simply receives back the money he has paid in. The fact that\r\nthere are so many life insurance companies and that they have become so\r\nwealthy and powerful, illustrates the power of interest, especially when\r\nit is compounded.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Arcanum professes to give life insurance at actual cost, which\r\nit does not and never did. It was organized from the top down. Fifteen\r\npersons met in Boston on June 23, 1877, and constituted themselves\r\nthe Supreme Council. Twelve of them became officers, and three were\r\nincorporators simply. This body reserved to itself all the power of\r\nlegislation and of receiving and paying out the moneys of the order.\r\nProvisions were made for the organization of subordinate and grand\r\ncouncils of the order, but they were simply wards of the Supreme Council.\r\nMembers were received on medical examinations from 21 to 55 years of age\r\nand paid for $3,000 insurance, one dollar at 21 years, and up to four\r\ndollars at 55 years. The rise from year to year was from 4 to 20 cents.\r\nThe assessments were to be paid when called for, after the death of a\r\nmember. The order grew and prospered from year to year until 1898, when\r\nthe management thought it saw the necessity of increasing the rates. It\r\nmade 21 at the rate of $1.76 and 54 rate of $7.00. The rise each year was\r\nfrom 6 to 44 cents. At this time the order had 195,105 members, and the\r\nloss in membership in the order in the next six months was about 10,000.\r\n\r\nHowever the order continued to prosper until after the annual meeting of\r\nthe Supreme Council in 1905, when it adopted a new table of rates, which\r\nbegan at $1.89 at 21 and rose to $16.08 at 65, but from Oct. 1, 1905, all\r\nthe members were to be assessed at attained ages, whereas before that\r\nall had been assessed at entrance ages. In other words, on Oct. 1, 1905,\r\neach old member was required to reënter the order as a new member, and\r\npay at attained ages. New members after that date were to pay at entrance\r\nages, but all were to pay $16.08 per month on $3,000 when they reached\r\n65 years. At the time of the making of this new rate the order had over\r\n300,000 members. Since then it has lost 50,000 members, and a majority\r\nof its members are opposed to the new rates.\r\n\r\nThere was no occasion for the new rates, as, under the laws of the order,\r\nadditional assessments could have been made, at any time, to provide\r\nfor excessive mortality, and the order could have been worked out on\r\nadditional assessments until it failed, as it is bound to do.\r\n\r\nAn organization within the order has been formed to contest the new\r\nrates, and this has brought a suit in the Supreme Judicial Court of\r\nMassachusetts to have them declared invalid. The protestants claim that\r\nwhen each member entered the order he made a contract to pay assessments\r\nat age entrance, and that while the Supreme Council may call extra\r\nassessments, as mortality may require, it cannot increase the rates,\r\nor compel members to pay at attained ages. Also that the new rates are\r\nunreasonable and will create a surplus of $3,700,000 every year, which\r\nis contrary to the laws of the order and of the State of Massachusetts.\r\nThe Supreme Council claims that each member when he entered the order\r\nsurrendered all his rights to protest or object to any action of that\r\nbody and agreed in advance to approve any action which it might take in\r\nregard to rates.\r\n\r\nAll of the old life insurance policies of every kind and character are\r\nbased on contract, and it was supposed that the rates at entrance in a\r\nfraternal order constituted a contract between the member and the supreme\r\nbody of the order. Many of the courts of the several states have so\r\nheld, but it was for the Supreme Council of the Royal Arcanum to defy\r\nreason and common sense and to claim that they were the autocrats of the\r\norder. All insurance should be like a deposit in a savings bank, that can\r\nhardly be lost. The Royal Arcanum, however, has depended upon lapses.\r\nThirty-five is the age usually taken for illustration in insurance. At\r\nthat age the average of lapses per 1,000 lives is 37 per cent plus. In\r\nMay, 1905, there were 305,083 members in the order. That would mean that\r\nout of 305,083 members if all were of the age of 36, in any year, 111,000\r\nwould lapse. The average policy in the Royal Arcanum is $2,231.67 and\r\nout of that there would be lost by lapse, $826.70. If all the members\r\nwere 36 years of age, on the whole $680,848,000 insurance in force there\r\nwould be lost by lapse, at thirty-six years, $251,923,760 annually. Now\r\nin honest insurance there should be no lapses or forfeitures and in the\r\ninsurance of the future there will be nothing of the kind. But on this\r\nplan, no matter how long one has paid, or how much he has paid in, if he\r\nstops paying, he loses all. Misfortune or accident may compel him to stop\r\npaying, but no matter what may be the cause, he loses, and other persons\r\ndying quickly have had the benefit of the money he has paid in. A member\r\nwho entered in 1879 at the age of 36 will have paid in on September 1,\r\n1905, about $800, or $30.72 per year. A person insured at the sum of\r\n$3,000 would have to live to the age of 133 to pay that sum out at the\r\nrate for the first 26 years. But assume the insured has paid $800 to\r\nOctober 1, 1905, and remains in the order. He pays $97.20 the first year\r\nof the new rates, $103.68 the second year and $192.96 the third year\r\nand the same sum each year thereafter. His expectancy is 12.81 years at\r\n63. If he lives out his expectancy, he will have paid into the order,\r\n$3,277.12, or $277.12 more than he will receive. But suppose he should\r\nlive till 85 years of age, he will by that age pay in $5,205.72, or about\r\n$2,205.75 more than he can draw out.\r\n\r\nWill any man join an order of that kind where he shall forfeit all by\r\nthe failure to make a single payment? So long as he can get into a\r\ncompany which will give him paid-up insurance, extended insurance, or a\r\ncash-surrender value, he will not.\r\n\r\nEvery man insured in a fraternal association is in the condition of\r\nDamocles. The sword suspended over his head is likely to drop at any\r\ntime. The moment confidence is lost the whole matter dissolves like a\r\nrope of sand, and the insurance is gone. Suppose the Royal Arcanum had\r\nceased to do business on June 1, 1905, $680,648,000 of its insurance\r\nwould have terminated at that time, which would have been a loss of\r\nabout $2,231.67 to each member. That is, 305,083 persons would have lost\r\n$2,231.67 insurance each. These same persons and their predecessors had\r\npaid in $97,004,175.82 of which $94,790,627.86 had been paid out on death\r\nlosses. Since the new rates have been published the order has lost 50,000\r\nmembers carrying $111,583,500 insurance. Of the sum paid in, $36,090,650\r\nhas been paid in by men who have dropped out and the balance of loss is\r\nto be paid by the survivors. Thus it is ever with assessment companies.\r\nThey must and will fail as soon as it is demonstrated that the adopted\r\nrates will not carry any organization for a generation. The new rates of\r\nthe Royal Arcanum have simply demonstrated the utter worthlessness of\r\nassessment companies, and the value of regular life insurance where each\r\npolicy holder contributes a fund to pay his own policy.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Arcanum is no better than a suicide club, for it is only the\r\nsuicides and the weaklings who can have any benefit of the order. The\r\nnew rates require the members to pay greater sums in premiums than in\r\nold line companies, and at the same time the company insists upon the\r\nold and exploded system of forfeitures, refuses any paid up or extended\r\ninsurance, and any cash-surrender values. Who will sit down to a feast\r\nof this character? No one but an old member who has paid in too much to\r\nstop, and no new man will join the order. The whole scheme of the new\r\nrates was to drive the old members out so that the order would not be\r\ncompelled to pay their death losses. The order is an autocracy. There\r\nare twelve life members in the Supreme Council who represent no one\r\nbut themselves. Three of these are original charterers and nine are\r\nSupreme Past Regents. There are twenty-nine officers, who as such are\r\nmembers of the Supreme Council. These thirty-eight by the aid of twenty\r\nrepresentatives can control the Supreme Council, and there is added a\r\nnew life member every two years in a new Supreme Past Regent. No one\r\nshould be a member of the Supreme Council but some one who represents a\r\nconstituency. Yet John Haskell Butler, of 244 Washington Street, Boston,\r\nMass., controls the entire Supreme body. In this he is ably supported\r\nby W. O. Robson, Supreme Secretary. How these two gentlemen of eminent\r\ntalent could be imposed on in the adoption of the new rate, which in\r\nthe case of the old member who entered at thirty-six years, compels him\r\nto pay a surcharge of $64.18 per annum more than necessary to carry his\r\nrisk, or in his expectancy a total of $1,226.98 more than he should pay,\r\nor 70 per centum more than his equitable share, is more than we can\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nThe average of the surcharge on all the old members is 67 per centum,\r\nand is 27 per centum higher than the new members pay. Naturally, if the\r\nmembership could be held together, these new rates would create and pile\r\nup a surplus, or excess, of $3,700,000 per year over any sum that the\r\nlaws of Massachusetts permit the society to hold, which at the present\r\ntime is about $30,000,000.\r\n\r\nHowever, the society has never attempted to create any surplus or reserve\r\nover and above about $2,000,000, nearly equal to the proceeds of three\r\nassessments. What kind of financing is this which at one fell stroke\r\nburdens the members with paying sums which will produce $3,700,000 per\r\nyear after paying over all mortuary calls? Heretofore the order has\r\npreached for twenty-eight years that the surplus remains in the pockets\r\nof its members and shall so remain. Now it is to be created and placed in\r\nthe control of Mr. Butler and his one hundred and fourteen associates who\r\nare souls with a single thought. And what for? What kind of actuaries did\r\nthe Supreme Council employ to make these new rates that such a result is\r\nbrought about and that the policy of twenty-eight years is reversed at a\r\nsingle session, without any notice to the members? The members of the\r\nRoyal Arcanum, the men who pay the money disbursed by Mr. Butler and his\r\nassociates, have no voice in proposing any new legislation for the order,\r\nnor in approving or rejecting any enacted by the Supreme Council. They\r\nmust pay whatever the one hundred and fifteen guardians ask of them or\r\nget out of the order.\r\n\r\nThe $3,700,000 surplus exacted the first year, under the new rates,\r\nis not to be used for paid-up or extended insurance or cash-surrender\r\nvalues, but is simply to be kept on hand as a reserve. The reserve, which\r\nhas heretofore been carried in the pockets of the members, is now to be\r\ntransferred to the pockets of the Supreme Council. Why are the members\r\nof the order, who have carried their insurance at great sacrifices, to\r\nhave an additional burden placed on them? Why must this great reserve be\r\ncreated unless for the same reasons it was created in the three great\r\ncompanies in New York City? What is the object of creating a reserve\r\nwhen there is no paid-up or extended insurance and no cash-surrender to\r\nbe made, and when assessments are required to be called for as needed\r\nto pay death losses? Why should any assessment company have a reserve\r\nbeyond a few assessments ahead? What kind of actuaries did the Supreme\r\nCouncil have to make tables to produce such results? What fit guardians\r\nof 250,000 people are the one hundred and fifteen members of the Supreme\r\nCouncil who would adopt a table of rates producing such results? The\r\ncontrol of the funds must have driven these one hundred and fifteen\r\npeople mad to have produced tables which will so work. Would it not have\r\nbeen better to have called extra assessments from time to time under the\r\nauthority of the laws of the order and of the State of Massachusetts,\r\nuntil the order was compelled to fail, than to have adopted the new\r\nrates, which are more expensive than old-line insurance and which if\r\napproved in the legal contest now pending will insure the failure of the\r\norder at once?\r\n\r\nThe only true assessment insurance is to pay the death losses as they\r\noccur, by assessments, and which must include a fund for management and\r\ncontrol. When the assessments become too great the company dissolves and\r\nthat is the end of it. All those who have not died during its existence,\r\nor who have lapsed in the same time, have lost their bets, and those who\r\nhave died have won.\r\n\r\nI am not able to give the number who have been members of the order since\r\nits origin. It could not have been more than 400,000. Of this number\r\n35,000, or one-twelfth, have died. Over 33 per cent., or 133,333, have\r\nlapsed, and if the institution fails, as it certainly will, 367,000 have\r\nlost every dollar they have put in, in order that 35,000, or one in\r\ntwelve, might draw prizes.\r\n\r\nSuch institutions are contrary to public policy and should be suppressed.\r\nEach state insurance department should require such statistics as will\r\nshow all the facts any one might wish to know.\r\n\r\nIf I had the exact statistics, I am satisfied the proportion of those who\r\npay in and lose would be much higher than I gave it.\r\n\r\nThe laws of political economy must be evolved just as we evolve those of\r\nnature, and they are as certain when we know them, but any institution\r\nwhich requires a party to live beyond his expectancy in order to pay\r\nin the amount of his benefit certificate is a fraud. At 21 a man’s\r\nexpectancy is 45 years. Now a man at 21 who entered the order June 23,\r\n1874, would have paid in to December 31, 1905, $404. It would take him\r\nover 166 years to pay in the $3,000 at the same rate. As he can never do\r\nthat, his death loss must be paid by some one else, and consequently his\r\ninsurance by others is a fraud and a gambling transaction.\r\n\r\nAs eleven persons must contribute to pay the loss of the twelve and then\r\nlose everything themselves, the whole scheme is an imposition contrary\r\nto the interest of society. Eleven men contribute and lose $250 each\r\nthat one man’s beneficiary may gain $3,000, and these eleven men lose\r\nevery dollar they put in. After twenty-eight years of preaching to the\r\npublic that they had found the El Dorado of Insurance, that they were\r\nfurnishing insurance at cost and that the members carried the reserve in\r\ntheir pockets, Messrs. Butler, Robson & Company now come to the front and\r\nadmit that all this time their scheme has been a fake and a failure. They\r\nsay the unclean spirit departed from them in May last, but I think he\r\nreturned to them with seven others worse and they have turned the Arcanum\r\ninto a madhouse.\r\n\r\nI do not have the personal acquaintance of all the seven, but two of\r\nthem might be called Landis and Barnard, because the condition of the\r\nArcanum is worse than before. Now every member must pay in his $3,000 in\r\nthe period of his expectancy, and if he lives beyond it he must pay till\r\nhe dies. The new rates indicate that members must die before reaching 65\r\nyears, and if they decline, then they must be fined $192.96 per annum for\r\ntheir refusal to do so.\r\n\r\nAny man who enters the order now, in view of what he must submit to at\r\nand after the age of 65, ought to have his sanity inquired into. It is\r\nhigh time the State should intervene and protect the public from the\r\nschemes of these fraternal orders. The fraternity is humbug, and for\r\nevery loss paid there are many more losses to society from which it\r\nshould be protected. The correct scheme of insurance has not yet been\r\ndiscovered or announced, but when it is it will not be gambling or\r\ncommercialism, but will be simply indemnity—which it should have been\r\nfrom the start.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PEOPLE\r\n\r\nBY JOHN P. SJOLANDER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is well with the world, my masters,\r\n      It is well with the world and you,\r\n    When we move along with a smile and song,\r\n      ’Mid the tasks we are set to do.\r\n    And the song and the smile of the People\r\n      Should be ever your compass and chart.\r\n    Oh! ’tis well with you when the song rings true\r\n      That comes from the People’s heart.\r\n\r\n    It is ill with the world, my masters,\r\n      It is ill for the world and you,\r\n    When our eyes look down, and our faces frown,\r\n      ’Mid the tasks we are set to do.\r\n    Beware of the frown of the People,\r\n      Lest their wrath and their patience part!\r\n    Oh! let not a wrong ever burden the song\r\n      That comes from the People’s heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Back To Nature—Part The Way\r\n\r\nBY EUGENE WOOD.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout once in every so often, we, as a race, all lay back our heads, shut\r\nour eyes, and let out the shuddering shriek: “Back to Nature!” It is so\r\nloud and heart-felt a cry that it makes you wonder why we have to go back\r\nat all—why we didn’t stay there. If the Get-Strong-Quick professors are\r\nright, this thing of our wearing clothes, and dwelling in houses, and\r\neating dainty cooked food three times a day is sheer tom-foolishness, all\r\nthe more tom-foolish in that once we led the healthy, happy life that\r\ninevitably results from fasting three or four days in the week, then\r\ndining on goobers and timothy hay; wearing nothing but a nose-ring and a\r\ndash of paint, and sleeping in the hollow trees.\r\n\r\nFor most of us, “Back to Nature” is too long a road to travel—all\r\nthe way. Nevertheless, the cry is so loud, and so general throughout\r\nthe civilized world that we cannot dismiss it as impracticable and\r\nmeaningless. It betokens something. I think I know what, and if it didn’t\r\nlook so much like serious thinking for you and me, I’d write out what\r\nI think it means. I’ll say this, though: If we judge the future by the\r\npast this universal impulse to touch the naked earth once more, and so to\r\ngather strength and vigor from it, means that the world is pregnant with\r\na great event, and we must be fortified for the labor-pains of it. A new\r\nage is struggling to be born. Mark my words.\r\n\r\nThe timid venture, on the way back to Nature, of a two-weeks’ sitting on\r\nthe front stoop of a boarding house in the mountains or at the seashore\r\ndoes not satisfy us now. Bold and daring spirits have even gone to live\r\nin the wild woods, and have come back to tell us it was bully. We all\r\nknow it is great fun to play at being boys again, but for most of us\r\nthe problem is complicated by our having wives and daughters whom we\r\ncannot well put in cold storage during our absence. I know that under the\r\npressure of the need to go back to Nature some have even taken the women\r\nwith them. I—I—I don’t know about that. It doesn’t look very alluring to\r\nme. Mind you, I don’t know a thing about living in the wilderness except\r\nwhat I have read and heard, but as near as I can come to it, there seems\r\nto be considerable packing to be done. There’s the canoe in the first\r\nplace. If I were thinking of going into the woods, I shouldn’t stir a\r\nstump unless I had a canoe. But you take one fifteen or eighteen feet\r\nlong, and carry it about three miles through thick-set timber, and I\r\nshould say along about the last half of the third mile you’d begin to\r\nnotice it. You’d have to have some kind of a tent, and even when they’re\r\nmade of silk, I should think they would make something of a bundle. You’d\r\nwant your gun and ammunition; you’d want your fishing tackle; you’d need\r\na small ax; you’d have to carry a coffee-pot, a frying-pan, a deep pot,\r\na plate, a knife and fork and cup; you’d need at least one blanket and\r\na rubber sheet of some kind; you’d need to pack your bacon and your\r\nflour, and erbswurst, and matches, and quinine, and morphine, and rags\r\nfor bandages in case—you know—and saccharine, and whisky if there are\r\nsnakes around, and—oh, yes, tobacco; don’t let me forget tobacco—and,\r\noh, I don’t know what all. No women’s fixings in this partial list, you\r\nsee. I don’t know. I knew a man that took his wife along with him to the\r\nwoods—but then, don’t you see, it was on their honeymoon. Oh my! It makes\r\nall the difference in the world when you’ve been married ten or fifteen\r\nyears. Yes, I should say so.\r\n\r\nI once read a most fascinating series of articles by a woman who had\r\nthis delightful experience. The intention was to chirrup: “Come on,\r\ngirls! It’s perfectly elegant!” But she didn’t fool me. I could see that\r\nwhenever there was anything that was arduous, or tedious, or mussy in the\r\nhousekeeping line “the gentlemen of the party eagerly volunteered.” Yes.\r\nM—hm. I can just see ’em. Mind you, I wouldn’t go so far as to say that a\r\nwoman in the woods is a darn nuisance. No indeed. Only—Well, I tell you.\r\nHer husband may be eager to play Injun, but I don’t believe she would be\r\nvery keen to play squaw. That is, and “tote fair.”\r\n\r\nThere is this in favor of taking ’em along: Not every man can cook. I\r\nknow that out there in the forest, when you make camp as the shadows\r\nlengthen after a long day’s tramp, when every muscle aches, but aches\r\nwith glad fatigue; after a day in which your lungs have drunk in the pure\r\nair thinly fragrant with the vague odors that the glazed leaves distill,\r\nas it were offering incense to the god of day; when you have quenched\r\nyour thirst from a spring in the bottom of whose earthen bowl the sands\r\nare reeling and staggering in the delirium of glee; when you have\r\nhearkened to the wild beauty of some unknown bird-call echoing through\r\nthe lofty Gothic aisles; when the western sky flames into undreamed-of\r\nglories and then fades away until the lonely stars come out, I know they\r\nsay that you can choke down any old mess and relish it. Maybe so. I am as\r\ngood a hand at eating pancakes as anybody else, but I don’t know about\r\nthem for every meal and every day; bacon is my favorite vegetable, but\r\nthere comes a time; fish once a week is all I care for. No. It doesn’t\r\nseem alluring to me.\r\n\r\nThey tell me hemlock boughs make a fine mattress. Yes? I know where I can\r\nget better for less money. They tell me that sleeping on the ground with\r\nthe high sky for a ceiling is simply great. If it comes to that, I have\r\nslept on the ground, and the morning after I knew exactly where my hips\r\nand shoulders were. I don’t mind granddaddy long-legs tracking over my\r\nface. They’re kind of interesting. But I have never been able to put away\r\nthe thought that if it should turn chilly in the night, and some snake\r\nshould come and crawl in bed with me, and smuggle his cool slimy body\r\ndown my back, it would probably break my rest. I shouldn’t fancy it, I’m\r\npositive.\r\n\r\nI tell you. I compromised the matter thus last summer. I got back to\r\nNature—part the way. Not so far though as to get out of touch with the\r\nmilkman. I had things cooked to suit me; I slept high and dry upon a\r\nChristian bed, and yet I wasn’t indoors a minute of the time the whole\r\nenduring summer. And I’m never going to be another summer under a wooden\r\nroof if I know how to help it. I’ll tell you about it if you like.\r\n\r\nThere were five of us that wanted to live in the outdoor air for\r\ntwenty-four hours out of every twenty-four. There was the Honest Man who\r\nwent to gainful business every day; there was the Lazy Man who didn’t do\r\none tap the summer long, though often besought to do so, who now takes\r\nhis pen in hand to drop you these few lines; there was the Honest Man’s\r\nwife; and there were the Lazy Man’s Wife, and his growing Daughter.\r\n\r\nThe Honest Man already had in stock a 12 × 14 tent, and a small A-tent.\r\nThe Lazy Man bought a 10 × 12 tent for himself and wife, and the next\r\nsize smaller for his daughter. Each family brought bed-clothing and\r\npersonal apparel. (It was a first-rate opportunity to wear out old\r\nclothes.) The communal property, dishes, oil-stove, egg-beaters, and all\r\nsuch were paid for half-and-half. It stood the Lazy Man for outfit just\r\n$49.27 all told, and the outfit is now down cellar waiting impatiently\r\nfor summer to come again, when it will be as good as new and won’t cost\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nThe summer previous, the Honest Man had gone exploring and found a spot\r\non the Canadian shore of Lake Erie within an hour’s ride on the steamer\r\nfrom his business. A whopping big maple tree, thick and umbrageous, stood\r\na hundred feet or so back from the water’s edge, on a sand slope carpeted\r\nwith wild grape vines. The beach was of fine white sand, without a pebble\r\nbigger than a moth-ball, and it slanted so slowly into the water that\r\nbreast-deep was fully a hundred yards from shore. This made it rather\r\npoky for the men-folks when they went in swimming, but it was ideal for\r\nthe women, to whom a foot of depth is drowning depth. The lake being soft\r\nwater, nobody can adequately express the joy the women had in washing\r\ntheir hair. This favored spot was a shade more than a mile away from the\r\nsteamboat pier at which, six or eight times a day, excursion steamers\r\nunloaded revelers who sought the pallid ecstasy of a non-alcoholic\r\npleasure resort. (It was Canada, remember, and while you might go in\r\nswimming on the Lord’s day, you could not ride upon the giddy-go-round.\r\nA district attorney from the smoky city on the American side presumed to\r\nfish on Sunday, and got sassy to the constable who said he shouldn’t.\r\nThereupon they snaked him off to a neighboring village to the hardware\r\nstore where the ’Squire kept court and fined him $20 and the costs.) We\r\nwere far enough away on the long board walk to miss the transients, and\r\nby looking carefully through the trees you could just see one house from\r\nour place, the castle of our landlord. I am aware that it’s nice to be\r\nexclusive, and get away from common folks, but it’s so blamed expensive.\r\nEven millionaires when they want to make sure of getting any place have\r\nto travel with the cheap crowd. You can think that over. You will find\r\nit’s so, although I haven’t time to work it out in detail.\r\n\r\nThe Honest Man having lived on this spot the summer before, the floors\r\nwere laid of boughten lumber, and the frames were up. Also, the private\r\nwalks, made of such bits of board as the Good Lord had pleased to\r\nsend upon the rolling waves, nailed upon saplings from the wood back\r\nof the camp, were still in place, so that there wasn’t much to do, a\r\ncircumstance that grieved the Honest Man no little. He liked to be busy.\r\nThe Lazy Man was patient under this affliction. He did help when there\r\nwere things to do. He got the nails and handed the hatchet, and generally\r\nfetched and carried, knowing full well what are the drawbacks incident\r\nto being a heaven-gifted literary genius, such as not being of the least\r\naccount about a place.\r\n\r\nAmong the triumphs of the Honest Man’s saw and hammer were the tables,\r\nprime among them being the dining-table under the same maple tree,\r\nwhereon we ate our every meal from July 2 until September 3. It is\r\nfitting that in this public manner I should return thanks for our kind\r\nand considerate treatment by the weather. I can cheerfully recommend\r\nit to all and sundry. It rained at times, I won’t deny. It had to. I\r\ncan see that. But I must say it was most forbearing in the matter, and\r\nrained only out of meal hours. Once or twice it was plain to see that it\r\nstrained a point in our behalf, for example, that time we had to have our\r\nSunday ice-cream in our tents, and the two or three occasions when the\r\nbreakfast dishes were practically storm-washed.\r\n\r\nThis dining-table, the serving-table, the table in the cook-tent, and\r\nthe china-closet—Oh my yes! We had a china-closet. It was made out of\r\na packing box, had shelves in it, and four plank legs—these articles\r\nof furniture were covered with marbled oil-cloth, and the door of the\r\nchina-closet was of the same rich material, being secured with loops and\r\nnails. The cook-tent reared its lofty A on a frame with a waist-high\r\nboard-wall, lined with shelves. It was so studded with nails that for\r\nonce in their lives the women were speechless of complaint that there\r\nweren’t places enough to bestow the junk without which, so it seems, life\r\nin the kitchen is insupportable.\r\n\r\nHard by the china-closet was the refrigerator, in whose construction, let\r\nme say, the Lazy Man bore his part. He dug the hole in the sand in which\r\nwas sunk a barrel with a perforated bottom through which the melting ice\r\ndrained off. The women professed they lay awake nights listening for the\r\nthings piled upon the ice to topple over into smash. They had to worry\r\nabout something. There wasn’t a thing else for them to do but cook, and\r\nmake the beds and wash the dishes.\r\n\r\nI suppose that cooking by a camp-fire is the extreme of picturesqueness.\r\nIt is also mighty hard upon the back, to say nothing of its blinding you\r\nwith smoke, and frying the grease out of your face, even after you have\r\nlearned that it isn’t really necessary to have a conflagration big enough\r\nto melt the nose off the coffee-pot, but that a cupful of live coals and\r\na tiny bunch of twigs will do the trick. You have to stand over such a\r\nfire to keep it going, and when it rains it is the deuce and all. So we\r\nhad a blue-flame oil-stove with an oven, and had everything cooked in the\r\nhighest style known to the art, just as it was before we started on our\r\nway back to Nature. There was just one thing the women missed. Endless\r\nhot water laid on. Their heaviest burden was to remember “the dying\r\nwoman’s advice.” Don’t you know what that is? “Sally,” she whispered with\r\nher latest breath, “always put on the dish-water before you sit down to\r\nyour victuals.”\r\n\r\nBut if the Lazy Man could not bring his mind to penning deathless\r\nLiteratoor, he could at least tote water from the lake, so it wasn’t so\r\nbad after all.\r\n\r\nThe need of cooking was great indeed. In no spirit of carping criticism I\r\ndesire to say that I have seen the Honest Man, many and many’s the time,\r\nwolf down six big potatoes at a meal and other things accordingly. We\r\nothers did our feeble best, but we never quite compassed that. I did eat\r\nsix ears of green corn once, but you must remember that they were right\r\noff the vines, as you might say, and you know how good green corn is when\r\nit’s fresh.\r\n\r\nThis was no lonesome wilderness wherein we had to scuffle for our food.\r\nThe milkman came right after breakfast with the morning’s milk. The\r\nmorning’s milk remember, not the night before’s. Then came the iceman. I\r\nwant to tell you about him. I had seen him pushing the lawn-mower on a\r\ngreen velvet lawn before a mansion up the beach a ways. I thought he was\r\nturning an honest penny taking care of it for some one else. Bless your\r\nheart, he lived there. He had a fine big farm behind it, but it was all\r\nseeded down in grass, because the harvest of ice from the lake before him\r\nin the winter brought him more money for less work than the rich loam\r\nbehind him could raise in summer crops. Then came the grocer from the\r\nvillage back in the country. He always brought us kerosene, sometimes he\r\nbrought us groceries, and all too seldom he brought us the flat loaves\r\nof the Italian baker in the village, flat and crusty loaves, which the\r\ngrocer scornfully called “dog-bread.” There was “the bearded lady”\r\nthat brought us home-made bread just once—just once. Evidently she had\r\nconfused the relative proportions of the yeast and flour. Then came the\r\nold man with the broken hand, talk about which shortened the day for him\r\nand us; also, his wife, a dear old soul, who sold us from time to time\r\nbouquets picked from her garden, old-fashioned flowers made up so round\r\nand hard that if a man were clouted on the head with a nosegay you’d have\r\nto take him to the hospital. There was “the bonnet lady,” a sweet-faced\r\nDunkard in the habit of her faith. There were several whom we came to\r\nknow right well, and after they began to suspect that, like as not, we\r\nweren’t as crazy as we seemed, living in tents—Did you ever hear the beat\r\nof that?—they showed they were just folks, same as anybody else. But\r\nthe one I liked the best was the man that came on Saturdays to fetch us\r\neggs and butter. I aroused his interest by telling him that where I came\r\nfrom they sold eggs by quarter’s worth; so many for a quarter, more when\r\neggs were cheap, fewer when eggs were dear. Well sir, he like to never\r\ngot over that. It was like the returned missionary, telling how the poor\r\nheathens live in China. He was a very conscientious man. “I’m sorry,” he\r\nwould say, “but I’ve got to charge you 21 cents for them there eggs. They\r\nain’t worth it. No eggs is worth that much, no time o’year. They ortn’t\r\nto be more’n 18 cents at any time. But the others is sellin’ ’em for 21,\r\nand I s’pose I got to, too.”\r\n\r\nOne and all, as soon as ever they could in decency get round to it, had\r\nthis one question to ask: “What do you do when it rains?” They’d ask it\r\nwith such a now-I-got-you look that it was funny to see how set-back they\r\nwere when we made answer: “We do the same as you, we go in out of it.”\r\nBut on the rebound you could notice the doubt forming itself in their\r\nminds as to whether we knew enough to do that. I’m sure they drove away\r\nthinking we were kind of be-addled in our intellects. I’ll have to own\r\nup to having asked: “What do you do when it rains?” in the beginning;\r\nand also, “What do you do when it blows?” But now I am convinced that a\r\ncanvas tent well staked is equal to any weather, and I believe that if it\r\nhad a red-hot stove in it, a body might be right cozy in a tent even in\r\nzero weather. I am going to preserve that conviction unshaken by never\r\nputting it to the test.\r\n\r\nI said that the grocer from the village inland stopped. You notice that\r\nI didn’t say the butcher. He wouldn’t. You might go out and “holler” at\r\nhim: “Hay! Hay there! Hay you! I want to talk to you. Hold on a second.”\r\nHe never let on he heard you. I didn’t have a revolver, or I should have\r\nheld him up. I did corner him once down at the Grove, and he explained\r\nto me he really could not be bothered with our money for his meat. He and\r\nhis two men had all they could attend to now, what with their regular\r\ntrade and the two hotels and the boardinghouses down along the beach.\r\nIf he sold to private customers, he’d have to hire more help. When I\r\nsuggested that he do that very thing and make more money, he smiled at me\r\nas one smiles at the foolish prattle of a child. Nup. He was awful sorry\r\nhe couldn’t accommodate me, but—. And that ended it.\r\n\r\nSo for awhile, whenever we paddled down to the Grove in the canoe for the\r\nmail we stopped at the meat-shop. The Grove was where the giddy-go-round\r\nwas; the razzle-dazzle air-ship, the whistle of whose tiny engine\r\nsquealed like a frightened pig; the cake-and-coffee shop, the “red-hot”\r\nstand; the high-class “vawdvill,” admission ten cents, children five; the\r\ndancing floor, patronized by youth and beauty in duck jumpers and sleeves\r\nrolled high on red and peeling arms, ragged with strips of tissue-paper\r\nhide, each mouth distorted with an “all-day sucker” whose pine stem\r\nappetizingly protruded; the combination barber-shop and post-office where\r\nthey were all out of two-cent stamps for weeks together, and “Joe’s.”\r\nI’ll get round to “Joe’s” in a minute if you’ll just be patient, but now\r\nI must tell you about the meat-shop. He was a fine fellow, the first\r\nbutcher, much sought after when he had got into people’s confidence.\r\nThere was the landlord that rented him the shop; there was the landlady\r\nwhere he roomed and boarded; there was the man he bought his meat of;\r\nthere was the man he bought his twine and paper of; the man he borrowed\r\n$20 of and the man he borrowed $5 of—all seeking him and not finding him.\r\nHe was—and then he was not. It was one of those mysterious disappearances\r\nyou read about.\r\n\r\nAfter he went away, we summer folks ungratefully conspired to ruin the\r\nland that sheltered us. You know there is no quicker and surer way to\r\ndo that to a country than by shipping valuables into it. The more iron\r\nand steel and wool and chinaware and diamonds—all kinds of things you\r\npay money for—the more of them are brought into a country, the poorer it\r\ngets. If it were possible to cover the ground knee-deep with all that\r\nheart could wish but brought from another country, the inhabitants would\r\nhave to give right up, and everything would go to smash. Conversely a\r\ncountry which imports nothing is always immensely rich and prosperous.\r\nYou know how that is in private life. The man that raises everything he\r\neats; that does his own butchering, makes his own shoes, whose wife spins\r\nall the flax and wool the family needs—such a man is always well-to-do;\r\nhe’s independent. While those who have to buy everything are always poor\r\nand forlorn. We all know this, but such is the depravity of the human\r\nheart, we want to buy things without asking whether they are made in\r\nour country or not. If it wasn’t for our wicked hearts prompting us to\r\nwant things, we could easily keep out the foreign goods. So as to sort\r\nof even up the injury we do our country, it is arranged that whenever\r\nwe thus sinfully buy foreign wares we pay a fine for it. The fine for\r\nruining Canada by bringing in fresh meat to eat is six cents a pound. Now\r\nI want to tell you that when we had no butcher and the village butcher\r\nwouldn’t stop for us, there were people so selfish that they not only\r\nruined Canada by bringing over fresh meat, but they smuggled it! Yes sir!\r\nSmuggled it. And King Edward needing the money so badly, with all the\r\nexpense he is under.\r\n\r\nThe United States is just as up and coming, though, as Canada. Every bit.\r\nWe don’t propose that our fair land shall be devastated by a flood of\r\ncheap Canadian mutton (it is most mighty good mutton; I’ll say that for\r\nit), so there is a fine on anybody that brings it over. The Beef Trust\r\nhas expensive families to send to college too.\r\n\r\nIn response to popular demand, the baker consented to run the\r\nbutcher-shop. If you found the place locked up, you stamped on the stoop\r\nand yelled awhile. He would come out, rolling the dough off his fingers\r\nand cut you off some meat. Sometimes, though you’d have to wait until he\r\ngot those pies out.\r\n\r\nHe was as good-hearted a man as ever lived, but he caused me many a\r\nsleepless night. I’ll tell you how it was. One day I didn’t go for the\r\nmeat. The Honest Man’s Wife went. She got a roast, five pounds and a\r\nquarter it was, at 18 cents a pound. The man figured on the cost. He put\r\nit down 70 cents, but that didn’t look quite right to him, so he set down\r\na figure 1.\r\n\r\n“Dollar seventy,” he said.\r\n\r\nNow the Honest Man’s Wife had taught school, and was right good at\r\nciphering.\r\n\r\n“Would you mind,” she asked as innocent as a cat lapping milk, “would you\r\nmind figuring that out for me?”\r\n\r\n“Sure thing, lady,” said the baker-butcher. “Five pounds and a quarter.\r\nThere’s your 5¼, at 18 cents. There’s your 18. Five tums 8 is 40. Put\r\ndown the aught and carry 4. Five tums one is 5, and 4 is—is—er—er—Five\r\ntimes 8 is 40. Put down the aught and carry—Hold on. I guess I made a\r\nmistake. Call it 97 cents.” He smiled pleasingly.\r\n\r\n“Seven cents,” mused she. “M—, won’t you please figure out for me how\r\none-fourth of 18 is 7?”\r\n\r\nWell now. I had been paying for meat without ever figuring it out.\r\nConsidering that with his limited arithmetical powers he was certain to\r\nmake mistakes, and considering that those mistakes were equally certain\r\nto be all in his favor, can you wonder that I have tossed and tossed for\r\nhours upon a sleepless couch trying to recall the times I bought meat of\r\nhim, how much it weighed and what I paid him?\r\n\r\nI promised to speak of “Joe’s.” Behold I show you a mystery. I saw a\r\nbillhead of his. His initial was M. Try my best I couldn’t make out to\r\nspell Joe with an M. Yet everybody called him Joe. I asked the Signora,\r\nhis mother-in-law. She pressed her lips strongly together and wildly\r\nshook her head. “Eena Cannodda dey gotta no sensea,” she exclaimed. “Eesa\r\nnemma notta Joe. No. Eesa nemma Mike. Michaele. Seguro. Surea tinga.\r\nCannodda mans ee say: ‘Eh Joe? Youra nemma Joe? Eh?’ Ee know dey gotta\r\nnuss sense a eena Cannodda. Ee say: ‘Sure a-tinga.’ Eesa neema notta Joe.\r\nNo. Eesa nemma Mike. Michaele. Seguro. Surea tinga.”\r\n\r\nAt Joe’s you could buy all things necessary to support life from ham to\r\nhairpins, including Canadian tobacco, which needs a protective tariff if\r\never anything does in this world. Not because it is a weakling though. It\r\nbiteth like a serpent and stingeth like an adder. Funny thing about that\r\nCanadian smoking tobacco. Sometimes it puts you in mind of sauerkrout,\r\nand sometimes it puts you in mind of boneset. I don’t think it is quite\r\nas bitter as boneset, though.\r\n\r\nShelter, and food, and water and tobacco being thus accounted for, there\r\nremains another prime necessity of life, and that is, sleep. I don’t\r\nbelieve there is one person in a hundred that knows the real luxury of\r\nsleep. Consider the uncounted hordes that live in terror of “night air.”\r\nConsider the more enlightened that raise their bedroom windows just a\r\ntrifle, to calk them up as soon as ever it turns a little cool. But\r\neven when wide open, a bedroom with a window in it is not by any means\r\nthe same thing as a tent to sleep in, a tent by the lakeside, its front\r\nall flaring open, and its sides and top working like bellowses with the\r\nbreeze. We had regular wire springs and to the wooden frames we nailed\r\npieces of 2 × 4 for legs. On these were mattresses and bedclothes, plenty\r\nof them. For when we read of city folk dying of sunstroke and rolling\r\noff their roofs where they had gone to get a mouthful of the lifeless\r\nair, robbed of its ozone before it reached them, we were snuggling under\r\none and sometimes two pairs of blankets. And then, I had the pleasure (a\r\nsmall and tepid pleasure you may think it, but very real to me) of trying\r\nto prop my eyelids open every night, as I lay stretched out upon my bed,\r\ntill I could thrust my hand out between the sidewall and the baseboard,\r\nand feel the glossy leaves of the cool grapevine, and try to unkink a\r\ntendril before I lost consciousness. Sometimes I couldn’t get that far.\r\nWe’d stay up till all hours, nine and even ten o’clock, fighting off\r\nsleep. It was a nightly problem with us which we’d rather do, go to bed\r\nand get that lovely sleep, or stay awake a minute or two longer staring\r\nat the “friendship fire.”\r\n\r\nI have vainly tried to think which held the greater fascination for\r\nme: The lake as it shifted its hues before my eyes from reddish brown\r\nto vivid apple-green through leaded gray and royal purple, the farther\r\nshore now so sharp and clear that you could see the houses on it, now\r\nbut a thin slice of pearl against a pearly sky, the water between us\r\nand it now a floor veined and streaked like marble, and now ridgy with\r\nbillows, that practised, as it were, their scales upon the yellow beach,\r\ntheir hand-backs remembering what the teacher said, “no knuckles,” and\r\ntheir finger tips dancing in the white froth: or, the fire of evenings,\r\nfluttering its ribbons of orange taffeta against the back log, snapping\r\nits blank cartridges in sport at us, the red coals so many heaps of\r\nglowing jewels in an Indian prince’s treasure-house. The lake enthralled\r\nme in the day-time. It numbed my brain; it paralyzed my pen-hand, and\r\nleft me only the still and speechless joy of living. When the darkness\r\nfell, the firelight drew me with the master-spell. From the lake I now\r\nand then could turn my eyes. The fire was jealous. Not for a full minute\r\nwould it let me go. In its genial warmth and light our souls expanded,\r\nand we sang the old songs that everybody knows, the songs that lie so\r\nnear the heart its strings must thrill in concord with them, but, through\r\nall, our eyes were fastened on the fire. What magic it must be that thus\r\ncan charm unhaltingly through all the long, long centuries that have\r\ndrifted by like mist since first men gathered about the friendly flame!\r\nThe wonder of it! The wonder of it! Without the Fire there could never be\r\nthe Family, with all that means to us; no Hearth, no Home, with all that\r\nmeans to us. The first priestess was she that kept the coals alive; an\r\naltar is but a cooking-place. Lineal descendant of the first flickering\r\nblaze fed with twigs is all our god-like industry, all that has made us\r\nlords of earth and sea. Back to nature we may go, but farther back than\r\nfire we dare not, lest we perish body and soul.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was the dumb fear of this, the heritage of pre-historic\r\nancestry that made us sigh when the time came to tear the logs apart and\r\nquench them for the night.\r\n\r\nHow happy were those dear idle days! Happy, not only in the retrospect,\r\nbut each moment savoring pleasant to the taste. Once I thought that\r\nHeaven must be rather bore-ous with nothing left to strive for, no\r\nambition, no anxiety. I know better now. I could live on and on forever\r\nin that camp and never wish for anything but to live. As I write, the\r\npictures of the sweet, calm evenings out upon the placid lake in the\r\ncanoe return to me. It heaves in gentle swells, the umber water netted on\r\nits ripple-crests with soft reflections of the flushed sky fading into\r\ntints too delicate for words of color. Black against the lucent edge of\r\nheaven march the slim poplars. The stars are struggling out, and taking\r\npattern from them, the riding-lights of yachts shine yellowly. The waves\r\nplash gently on the shell that holds us, and the water gurgles against\r\nthe paddle that urges onward, or tinkles in drops like tiny bells.\r\nSomething catches in the throat. It is too beautiful, too heavenly for\r\nearth-born. From far across the waters comes Caruso’s voice, by magic\r\nreproduced, sweet to suffocation.\r\n\r\n    “Un regal serto sul crin possarti\r\n    Ergerti un trono vicino al sol.\r\n    Ah! Celeste Aida! Forma divina.”\r\n\r\nOn the taffrail of the departing steamer we leaned and watched the spot\r\nuntil the darkness and the distance smothered the pale gleaming of the\r\ntents where our friends lingered yet a little longer. We sighed; we could\r\nnot help it. A little more and tears would have flowed.\r\n\r\nI want to go back there. I want to go back! Back to Nature—or at least\r\npart way.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Difference\r\n\r\n“That long-whiskered, pompous gentleman over there, who is doing most of\r\nthe talking, is a prominent citizen, isn’t he?” inquired the tourist.\r\n\r\n“Ah-nah!” pessimistically replied the landlord of the tavern at\r\nPolkville, Ark. “He’s a member of the Legislature.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHis Identity\r\n\r\n“Does any one know this poor fellow?” asked the Good Samaritan,\r\naddressing the crowd which had quickly gathered at the scene of the\r\naccident. “His mind seems to have become an absolute blank, and——”\r\n\r\n“Trust official! Trust official!” shouted the assemblage in one voice.\r\n“Out of his head and thinks he’s on the witness stand!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Philosophy of Money_\r\n\r\nBY J. B. MARTIN\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of our Ohio martyred Presidents, James A. Garfield, in delivering\r\na speech in Congress, the last one, I believe, uttered this sentence:\r\n“Whoever controls the volume of money in this country will be absolute\r\nmaster of its industries and commerce.”\r\n\r\nA truer sentence was never uttered in our House of Representatives. But\r\nto see clearly and forcibly its truthfulness and effects, one must have a\r\nproper idea of what money is, by what power it is created, the factors or\r\nelements of money, and its functions and use.\r\n\r\nBriefly stated, money is the debt-paying instrument in all civilized\r\nnations, whose people are actively engaged in making contracts, buying\r\nand selling. Every contract creates a debt, hence the necessity of a\r\ndebt-paying instrument.\r\n\r\nBarbarous nations resort to barter; that is, giving one product or\r\ncommodity for another, and yet with all of our boasted civilization we\r\nhave men—some prominent ones too—who claim that money is a commodity.\r\n\r\nI propose dealing in facts, as they are the stern sentinels of truth.\r\nEvery nation enacts laws compelling its citizens to tender certain\r\nthings, variously called “dollars,” “pounds,” “francs,” etc., as the only\r\nlegal means of payment of debts and taxes. This is the vital point of the\r\nwhole money question. Law, and law alone, makes money. Let us see what\r\nmoney is, and how it comes into existence.\r\n\r\nOur gold, silver, and paper coins; also our nickel and copper coins, are\r\nreally made up of three distinct factors or elements, each of which may,\r\nand often does, exist independently of the other two. This fact is one of\r\nthe central truths concerning money.\r\n\r\nWhat are these three constituents? First is the denominator or namer of\r\nthe unit—Dollar. This is an ideal or abstract term given to an intangible\r\nthing. Second, some tangible or material substance to represent the\r\ndollar, or some multiple of it; and third, its life, the _legal tender_\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\nNo two of these can make money; they must all three be named by sovereign\r\npower, Congress, or we have no money. Sovereignty is a unit and cannot\r\nbe divided, nor can it be delegated. This is why National Bank notes are\r\nnot a legal tender; they are simply the debt of the bank circulating as a\r\nsubstitute for money, so as to gratify the greed of the money sharks, and\r\nthe “Power” that is aiming to be “master of our industries and commerce.”\r\n\r\nBut we are told that Congress, sovereign power, cannot make money out of\r\nnothing, that there must be _intrinsic value_ in our monetary tokens. Let\r\nus analyze this proposition in the light of facts and logical reasoning.\r\n\r\nThe second factor in money is the material substance used to represent\r\nthe dollar, or some multiple of it. This material substance does not make\r\nthe dollar. Remember this.\r\n\r\nThe important factor in the dollar is its _life_—the legal tender\r\nfunction—and sovereign power alone can grant this.\r\n\r\nUnder our constitution, sovereign power is placed in the hands of\r\nthe American people—the whole people, not a part of them,—and their\r\nrepresentatives in Congress exercise that power; so that whatever\r\nCongress says shall be money is money in the United States. So it can be\r\nsafely affirmed that law alone creates money. The fiat or decree of law\r\nin the United States gives us our money.\r\n\r\nBut we are told that paper money, greenbacks, is all right when they\r\nare made redeemable in coin. The word “redeem” should never be used in\r\nconnection with our money here in the American Republic. According to our\r\nbig dictionary, redeem means “to purchase back,” “to ransom, liberate, or\r\nrescue from captivity or bondage.” Now as we have seen, Congress issues\r\nour money and puts it in circulation among the people. Is not Uncle Sam’s\r\nstamp on a piece of paper just as good as it is on a piece of silver or\r\ngold? If not, why not? Will some one please tell us? Then again I ask,\r\nwherein is there any sense or logic in Uncle Sam, the sovereign power in\r\nthe United States, buying himself back? Where has our sovereign power\r\ngot to, that Uncle Sam must ransom, or rescue himself from captivity or\r\nbondage?\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, sovereign power alone can issue money. That being\r\na fact, Congress alone should issue all our money, whether coin or\r\npaper, and it should all be made a full legal tender; and no one kind\r\n“redeemable” in another kind; with no state or National note circulation\r\nas a substitute for money.\r\n\r\nAnother very important consideration is that it should be issued in\r\nsufficient volume to effect all our exchanges on a cash basis, or as\r\nnearly so as possible; for debt and usury, now called interest, is the\r\npresent curse of every civilized country on earth.\r\n\r\nThis accomplished, the Government should establish Postal Savings Banks\r\nin every city having a population of two thousand or more, where the\r\npeople could deposit their surplus money, until needed, in perfect\r\nsafety, paying a small per cent. just as they do for insuring their\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\nThere is always a ratio existing between the total volume of money, free\r\nto flow in the channels of trade, and all things on the market for sale,\r\nincluding labor. This ratio is called—price. Statistics show that we had\r\nour largest volume of money at the close of the Civil War. In 1866 we\r\nhad $80.00 per capita. We then had high prices and every man willing to\r\nwork was employed. There were no tramps on the road begging for work or\r\nsomething to eat.\r\n\r\nThe accursed policy of contraction then commenced, at the instigation\r\nof the “Power” that was aiming to “be master of our industries and\r\ncommerce.” Contracting the money volume continued until 1878, when we had\r\nless than $20.00 per capita. Then our roads and city streets were full of\r\ntramps, so-called. No work was to be obtained. Shops and factories were\r\nclosed and farmers did their own work.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 there were but 520 failures in the United States with liabilities\r\namounting to $8,579,000. In 1878, there were 10,478 failures with\r\nliabilities amounting to $234,383,132. Such were the effects of\r\ncontracting the debt-paying instrument of our country at the dictation of\r\nWall Street money tyrants.\r\n\r\nThe Rothschilds in Europe are the “Power” that controls the volume of\r\nmoney in every one of the European countries, and the result is they are\r\nthe “absolute masters of the industries and commerce” of every government\r\nin Europe.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it can be safely said that through their agent, August\r\nBelmont, and his clique in New York, they are aiming to become the\r\n“absolute masters of our industries and commerce” here in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nCan it be possible that an American President would join in this crusade\r\nagainst the best interests of the American people? It would really appear\r\nso, for Theodore Roosevelt in his recent message to Congress recommends\r\nretiring of the greenbacks and “redeeming” the silver dollars in gold.\r\nThat means that our gold coin shall be our only perfect money, with\r\nNational Bank notes (the debts of the banks, drawing double interest,\r\nonce on the bonds deposited to secure the notes, and again on the notes;\r\nfor no bank note passes over the counter of the bank issuing it, until\r\ninterest is paid in advance), as a substitute for money; thus giving the\r\nbanks the power to increase or diminish our volume of money, just as it\r\nmay suit their sweet will and avaricious purposes.\r\n\r\nAt this point of the discussion we are told that we must have a standard\r\nof value, and that gold is a never-varying standard of value the world\r\nover. In reply to that I find in Sir Frederick Eden’s table of English\r\nmoney, from the Conquest in 1066 down to 1601, that in 1551 gold was\r\nworth only 4 shillings 7½ pence per ounce in London—a little over one\r\ndollar of our money; and in Doubleday’s “Financial History of England,”\r\npage 277, that in 1813 gold was worth 5 pounds 10 shillings an ounce in\r\nLondon—twenty-seven dollars and a half in our money. Does that look as\r\nthough gold was a never-varying standard of value?\r\n\r\nBesides, there is and can be no such thing as a “standard of value.” We\r\ncan have a standard for quantity, gravity, and extension, but not of\r\nvalue. We have the gallon, the bushel, the pound and ton, the yard, rod\r\nand mile, but where is the unit for value?\r\n\r\nSome may say; “Why the dollar is the unit of value”—not correct. The\r\ndollar is the unit in the expression of price; and, as we have seen,\r\nprice is the ratio, so the word dollar is not a unit of value. Not until\r\nwe can measure an idea with a quart cup, measure it with a foot rule,\r\nor put it in the scales and weigh it, can we have a measure of value;\r\nfor remember, value is an idea, an action of the mind, and what has\r\ncivilization invented to measure an idea with?\r\n\r\nValue is human estimation of desirable things, which are limited in\r\nquantity, or which require sacrifice to obtain.\r\n\r\nThere we have a full, clear and scientific definition of value, “Human\r\nestimation”—clearly an action of the mind—an idea.\r\n\r\nWhenever there is a general inability to pay debts on account of an\r\ninsufficient or low volume of money, we call it a—panic. We have had\r\nfive such periods in the history of the American Republic, viz: in 1819,\r\n1837, 1857, 1873 and 1893.\r\n\r\nHow much better it would have been for our Republic had our fathers, who\r\nframed our Constitution and established the Government under it, given us\r\na safe, sound and scientific financial system; with all money, whether\r\ncoin or paper, issued by the Government, and in sufficient volume to\r\ndo a cash business; volume to be increased as population and business\r\nincreased; all made a full legal tender for all debts public and private,\r\nand at no time to be a contraction or reduction in its volume. Then we\r\nwould have had none of the periods called panics and our advancement in\r\nall branches of business and science would be far in advance of what it\r\nnow is.\r\n\r\nIt may be said, and truthfully, that our fathers had no time to devote to\r\nthe money question; but there were a few in those days who did study it\r\nand profited by it just as there are at the present time.\r\n\r\nIf the farmers, the mechanics and wage-workers,—the creators of\r\nwealth—in this country ever expect to get any relief from the tyranny\r\nand oppression of this octopus that is “aiming to be master of\r\ntheir industries and commerce,” they must go to work earnestly and\r\nsystematically in their various organizations—the Grange, The Farmers’\r\nAlliance, the Patrons of Husbandry and the various Labor Unions—to\r\nstudying the money question, and if they persevere they will see clearly\r\nas President Garfield did over a quarter of a century ago, that “whoever\r\ncontrols the volume of money in this country will be absolute master of\r\nits industry and commerce.”\r\n\r\nThere were a few men even at the time our Government was organized who\r\nunderstood the money question. Tom Paine, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin\r\nFranklin concurred in the theory that “good paper money, based on the\r\ncredit of the people is the best money ever invented by man.” “Equal and\r\nexact justice to all men, special privilege to none,” was their motto.\r\n\r\nLet me quote further from Garfield. In that same speech he said: “But\r\nI admit freely that no Congress is wise enough to determine how much\r\nmoney the country needs. There never was a body of men wise enough to do\r\nthat. The volume of currency needed depends upon laws that are higher\r\nthan Congress and higher than Government. The laws of trade alone can\r\ndetermine its quantity.”\r\n\r\nDemand for use is the natural law of money supply, and the Government\r\nshould furnish such an amount as may be legally demanded; the idea being\r\nthat the business of the country will absorb as much as it needs, and no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nMy opinion is, the volume ought not to be less than $50.00 per capita;\r\nand, as I believe, $100 per capita would be none too much to effect all\r\nour exchanges for cash, which is the proper way to do a safe business.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Treasurer’s Reports for 1864, 5 and 6, and Fawcett’s,\r\n“Gold and Debt,” we had in circulation at the close of the Civil War\r\nabout $80 per capita, which was none too much. Then it was that we had\r\nhigh prices and good times.\r\n\r\nOur present Comptroller of the Currency reports $31 per capita in the\r\nvarious kinds of money and substitutes for money now in circulation.\r\nThis is altogether too small an amount for the production and exchanges\r\nrequired in this broad land of ours. The result is debts are being made\r\nand credits are expanding at a fearful rate, preparing the way for our\r\nnext great panic.\r\n\r\nAs stated above, we have never yet passed beyond twenty years without\r\nhaving a panic, and a moment’s thought will present to the mind the fact\r\nthat we are now on the last half of the twenty years since 1893.\r\n\r\nIt is coming, for we all know that “like causes always produce like\r\nresults;” and the cause is an inadequate volume of the debt-paying\r\ninstrument—money—to do the business with. The result is that deferred\r\npayments—debts—must be made, and, as we have seen, a panic is a\r\nprevailing inability to pay debts. So look out for breakers in the near\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nOur present situation is no time to advocate commodity money, for the\r\ndefenders of hard money ought to know that hard money and hard times\r\nalways go hand in hand.\r\n\r\nDemand for use is the natural law of money supply; and, as the demand\r\nnow is far in excess of the supply, it is safe to say, that unless more\r\nmoney is put into the channels of trade, there will be a severe money\r\nstringency; if not a genuine old-fashioned panic.\r\n\r\nI have often wondered why $100,000,000 in gold is kept penned up in the\r\nTreasury Building in Washington. So far as doing the people any good it\r\nmight as well be in the bottom of the ocean.\r\n\r\nMoney performs precisely the same function in the social organism that\r\nblood does in the animal organism. Blood is the vitalizing force in\r\nthe human body, and money is the vitalizing force in the body politic.\r\nEverybody knows that the loss of blood causes weakness in a human person,\r\nand just so the loss of money—a contraction of the money volume—causes\r\nweakness in a government; hence no “Power” should be permitted to control\r\nour volume of money.\r\n\r\nEvery voter in this Republic has a head above his shoulders supposed\r\nto contain a think-shop; and, if the “Power” now controlling our money\r\nvolume, and as a result our “commerce and industries,” is to be removed\r\nand better times secured, every think-shop must get down to business,\r\nwith a full determination to see that our “commerce and industries” shall\r\nnot be interfered with, that the volume of money be increased enough to\r\neffect rapid exchange of products and the payment of debts.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty in accomplishing this lies in the fact that so many\r\nthink-shops are never used, and again, some never read any newspaper\r\nexcept “my party paper,” containing nothing for think-shops to work at,\r\nand the result is—ignorance.\r\n\r\nThought is the mother of ideas, and ideas move the world. The reading man\r\nwill naturally be an observing man, a thinking man, always looking for\r\nthe cause of results which are transpiring around him, either in politics\r\nor science.\r\n\r\nThe election in several States last fall indicated very clearly that more\r\nmen were using their think-shops than in previous campaigns. The good\r\nwork has commenced and may it continue until our Republic be free from\r\nany organization that dare attempt to be—“Master of our industries and\r\ncommerce.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Little Path to Peace_\r\n\r\nBY MARY SMALL WAGNER\r\n\r\n\r\n    Save for the pewee’s plaintive cry,\r\n      Along this way all sound doth cease.\r\n    We christened it, the breeze and I,\r\n          “The little path to peace.”\r\n\r\n    The dusty highway far behind,\r\n      The vine-clad cottage as our goal,\r\n    There lies what many strive to find—\r\n          Peace for the heart and soul.\r\n\r\n    A mother’s voice drifts down the stair,\r\n      Crooning a simple lullaby.\r\n    See Mistress Puss and Fido there,\r\n          In perfect amity;\r\n\r\n    And over all the scent of flowers,\r\n      And over all the spell of home,\r\n    Though simple, for the asking ours,\r\n          Enthralling all who come.\r\n\r\n    O comrade with the restless eyes,\r\n      And greater cares than I can name,\r\n    With weariness you ill disguise,\r\n          Plodding the road to fame—\r\n\r\n    Pause—where the trees lap overhead,\r\n      Close the wee gate, nor seek release.\r\n    And hand in hand we’ll lightly tread\r\n          The little path to peace!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CAPTAIN, DAVY, AND GENERAL KUROPATKIN\r\n\r\nA STORY OF KOREA\r\n\r\nBY ROBERT DUNN.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWest from Ping-Yang, the old Korean capital, flows Tai-Dong River into\r\nthe Yellow Sea. Where in its mouth the flood tide weakens, and junks with\r\nlumber slung over sides drop their brown mat sails; there, where the\r\nclean sharp hills most beautifully are tricked with mirage and blue mist,\r\nsquats the town of Chinnampo.\r\n\r\nKuroki’s army landed there on the March night early in the war when the\r\nice, as if by magic, ground out toward China. Oiled torches spiked to\r\nrafts bobbed on the chill stream, and the winches of blacker transports\r\ncreaked and whistled to the snowy shore. From the holds swung aloft\r\nrice and fodder and knock-kneed, shaggy ponies. Impish guards of the\r\nMikado in red and green, privates in long coats and spectacles, sprang\r\nforth rigidly on land. No noise, no fuss; the brown invasion of Asia was\r\nfurtively begun. The long barracks were ready, and they that had watched\r\nJap coolie sappers a-building them—beer and sweet-cake sellers from the\r\nislands, pioneers in the new westward hegira—sat proud and bland that\r\nnight in their paper-slat doors. Meanwhile, from his desert of filth and\r\nthatched mud huts all about, crouched cousin Korean in the darkness,\r\nunsurprised and cynical, smoking a yard-long bamboo pipe as he dropped\r\nsoft syllables of philosophy on the vanity of effort, and with disdain\r\ndrew his wadded white robes closer.\r\n\r\nEven when the red sun flag fluttered darkly up its pole, no cheers\r\nfollowed. But from a hill overlooking the town an oath arose.\r\n\r\n“Damn these Japs, damn their mustard bellies,” growled Captain Cyrus\r\nBrewster, chewing a stogie on the porch of his lonely bungalow.\r\n\r\nIsolated on his hill, the captain was just such a Yankee, thin-nosed,\r\nblue-eyed and muffin-mouthed but with an imperishable look of youth\r\nfor all his curled gray hair, as you might find in a bungalow with a\r\nflag-pole in front were you wrecked, for instance, off Patagonia; which\r\nis to say he was an iconoclast, and hated the world. He shipped from\r\nChinnampo two million dollars a year in bullion from a gold mine near\r\nthe Yalu River, for which he was “agent;” passed white men’s food and\r\nchemicals through the custom-house, and swore at coolies loading them on\r\nthe light-draught junks he ran to the head of navigation on the Tai-Dong,\r\nwhence carts trundled to the mines.\r\n\r\nBut worse than the world he hated the Japanese, for they militantly\r\ncoveted for barrack joists the only pine grove in the region, which\r\nadorned his homestead. They could not seize the land without stirring\r\ndiplomatic mud, since the captain had bought his stake from the Russians,\r\nwho had eked it from Seoul in ’96, when the Jap ambassador burned the old\r\nEmpress in kerosene, and her son fled to the Slav legation. Therefore\r\nthe Islanders had threatened eviction, with smiles and insults; dickered\r\nblandly with bows, lies, and tissue documents inkily fly-tracked, as the\r\ncaptain repulsed them with a fist blow on the table, and cable blanks\r\ninscribed with fiery messages to Washington, which he never sent.\r\n\r\n“War news?” he’d exclaim to missionaries bound up river. “Don’t ask me,\r\nby crotch! I don’t bother the monkeys in their damned town, and they\r\ndon’t come up here to me.”\r\n\r\nThus being pro-Russian and a truly brave man, Brewster felt he must\r\nvindicate his notions in action. Having heard that a Cossack captain\r\nnear Wonsan on the west coast would be pleased to know how many men and\r\nrice sacks landed with Kuroki, he let a young Russian travel, dressed\r\nas a Japanese, on his junks between the lines. This fellow’s name was\r\nDavydoff, a machinist, who patriotically had quit the mine when the war\r\nbroke out, but being lame could not enlist. In disguise, he traveled\r\nby the name of Ikeda. I do not know how the captain squared with his\r\nconscience in abetting a spy, but that Yankee defect is an over-worked\r\nmyth, anyhow; and a world malevolent enough to land a man, aged fifty,\r\nalone in Korea, with a past like an erasure in a pirate’s log, should\r\ngrant indulgence.\r\n\r\nThis very hour tonight he awaited Ikeda, erst Davydoff. Now through his\r\nnight glass he searched the river, now the silent town distorted by no\r\nflickering camp-fires, the torches, dying into iridescence, revealed\r\nthe black Tai-Dong as a covert serpent stealing across a world numb and\r\nindifferent in white age. “Like them yeller oriental hearts, that river,”\r\nhe muttered, nodding at the stream, “reaching out acrost the world fer us\r\nwhite men’s sceptres, learnin’ to smile whiles they suffer. Oh, they’ll\r\nget the sceptres.” You see, the captain believed firmly in the Yellow\r\nPeril. Soon he turned toward the angled thatches of the town, and a white\r\npainted gable far from the barracks caught his eye.\r\n\r\nHis sharp features softened with recollection. “I see yer hev yer\r\nschoolhouse lit, young missy,” he murmured. “Night school. Workin’\r\novertime civilizin’ Koreans.” For first the invaders had built the\r\nbarracks, then the school—copying the white man’s way in lifting a\r\nyellow burden—which to the captain menaced a right regeneration of Korea.\r\nThe brown people thus handled the surest civilizing weapons of the white,\r\nwho were sealed meanwhile further north in their fortresses of privilege\r\nand prejudice; so the bungalow on the hill and the schoolhouse among the\r\nhuts symbolized the passing of Asia.\r\n\r\n“Karin San’s there,” mused the captain, and a vision of the white clad\r\nKorean boys with long hair parted in the middle, the girls in green\r\nsilk tunics, their snub noses buried in books of English and Japanese,\r\nuprose before him as he had seen them through the doorway, repeating the\r\nalphabet in unison, on a day he had passed the schoolhouse. Then Karin\r\nSan had bowed low on the threshold, saying, “It is a beautiful day,\r\nYou-think-yes? I am Karin-San-the-school-teacher-of-English,” and a big\r\nred pin had fallen from the shiny convolutions of her oiled hair, as\r\nshe bowed so low. “Great Christopher!” the captain had gasped; the same\r\ndizziness now touched his breast as he watched.\r\n\r\nMany times since he had visited Karin San, stealing down to the school\r\nunknown to the Japs, or even Davydoff. He would sit beside her on her\r\nplatform, and she would turn to him for correction when her red lips\r\nmistrusted how an English word should sound. After lessons they would\r\ntalk of Japan and America, for the captain had the reserve of age and\r\ndisappointment, and to Karin the war was no more a subject for discussion\r\nthan the coming of spring itself.\r\n\r\n“Shame me for lovin’ you, Karin San,” he muttered now tonight. “One of\r\nthe yeller-bellies I hates. Hypocrite!” and he turned toward a gigantic\r\nsort of dog-house under his flag-pole, where hibernated in winter and\r\ndozed in summer, the captain’s big brown Siberian bear, Kuropatkin, which\r\nhe loved even more than his twisty pine trees. He tapped on the house\r\nwith his bamboo stick, and wished the General “Happy New Year.”\r\n\r\n“It’s time ye waked and brushed yer teeth,” he said. “World’s a bit\r\nlivelier in these parts than when ye went to bed last year.”\r\n\r\nThe rattle of a chain told the hibernation was over, while eight hundred\r\npounds of shagginess squeezed into the open; tested the ground for frost\r\nwith a paw, waved its head as a man sounds a stiff neck, and as if to\r\nsay, “My! but this is early in the summer to wake a fellow!”\r\n\r\nBut the captain had stooped quickly and snatched at a red object in\r\nKuropatkin’s house. “Cuss them, Gen’ral!” he exclaimed, grasping a\r\nshinbone hung with flesh. “The Japs has tried to pizen ye! Peach\r\nkunnels,” he growled holding the meat to his nose. “But Mr. Jap\r\nMustard-belly ain’t so all-fired wise, and don’t know God A’mighty can’t\r\npizen a b’ar. He’ll learn a thing or two ’bout Rooshian b’ars some fine\r\nday, though now he’s got the nerve and numbers to do most anything.”\r\n\r\nKuropatkin, cocking his head on one side, raised an ankle, and, pointing\r\nlike a setter dog into the pine-grove, let out an “Oof!”\r\n\r\n“You see Mr. Mustard yonder?” drawled the captain, following the\r\nGeneral’s gaze. “You’re sayin’ you’re pretty wise, you b’ars, ain’t you?\r\nI guess the’ ain’t no monkey law _yit_ about watch dog _or_ b’ar licenses\r\nin this country. My timber’s lyin’ pretty loose about this hill. We’ve\r\nlikely got a vendetta on, General,” and having kicked away the poisoned\r\nbone, the captain unhooked Kuropatkin’s ankle chain, thus freeing him.\r\n\r\nQuite right was the Yankee about Jap nerve and a vendetta. The Islanders’\r\nnext militant move in the feud came that very night. In his French\r\nbedstead—the only kind in Korea, with its thin iron mosquito-frame\r\naloft—he was wakened by a rasping, cracking sound out in his grove. Now\r\nand then came a swish and a thump. Then——\r\n\r\n“Yai! Yai! Eee! Eee! and a diabolical yeodle curdled the moonlight on the\r\nhill-side. Presently a big brown object lolled from the shadows of the\r\npines, and stalked majestically toward the flag-pole.\r\n\r\n“Got the fisheatin’ Japs in the act, did yer, Pat?” whispered the captain\r\nout the window, shaking with laughter.\r\n\r\n“Oofski!” grunted Kuropatkin, crowding into his house. Next morning\r\nBrewster walked to his grove to find that three of his tallest pine trees\r\nhad been chopped and carted off, while two axes hung at hasty angles in a\r\nhalf-felled fourth. After breakfast, Puk-Chong, his Korean “boy,” started\r\nfor the Jap headquarters with the copy of a telegram, declared in a brief\r\nnote to be then on its way to the American Minister at Tokio. Brewster\r\nhimself walked unnoticed down the hill to the cable office, which lies\r\nfar from the barracks. He actually despatched the message sent in copy\r\nto the commandant, there being yet no war correspondents, and hence no\r\ncensorship in Korea. It was rather a more fire-eating complaint than any\r\nhe had pretended to send to Tokio before, and some time passed before he\r\nknew the importance of his act.\r\n\r\nAfter tiffin, two Jap soldiers appeared on his veranda, mutely\r\ninquisitive in their brown leggins, yellow shoulder-straps, and high\r\ncrowned caps. They drew white gloves from their hands, smiled, and bowed\r\nthree times till their long swords clicked on the floor. The shorter,\r\ndarker soldier—he with a wispy convex mustache and eyes like a dissipated\r\ndoll—handed the captain a letter bearing the long brown Korean stamp.\r\nThe captain whistled as he opened it. It was addressed in a round,\r\nshaded hand suggesting steel pens and primary writing books. Reading it,\r\nhe glowered; then smiled, as if he discerned something pleasant on a\r\nmountain across the river; frowned again and more deeply, coughed, and\r\nput the letter gently into his left-hand breast pocket, where his heart\r\nunderneath beat faster.\r\n\r\n“So Korean postmen ain’t good enough to carry white men’s letters no\r\nmore?” demanded the captain.\r\n\r\n“We dare no longer trust the shiftless Korean with letters to so august a\r\nperson,” explained the taller soldier, and both bowed.\r\n\r\n“They won’t let you steam them open and read them, like you have this\r\none?” said the captain. “Hey?”\r\n\r\n“Your bear,” said the doll-eye, after each had stared with polite\r\nblankness at the captain, “is he dangerous?” and the soldier indicated\r\nthe flag-pole.\r\n\r\n“Mebbe your pardner’s pants ken show that,” drawled the Yankee, taking\r\nthe other by the shoulder and turning him around. “Um, no,” he growled,\r\n“but that b’ar knows pizen when he smells it.”\r\n\r\n“Pizen?” said the doll-eye vacantly, “What you call pizen?”\r\n\r\n“We feed it to b’ars regular in Americky,” replied the captain fiercely.\r\n“We put it on shin bones and shove it in their kennels. It makes them\r\nstrong so they ken bust chains and plug axes inter trees.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, so, _so_,” gasped the pair, with the Jap stare which conceals\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nThe captain knew the soldiers could never have called on so direct a\r\nmission as to deliver a letter or complain of Kuropatkin’s attack; and\r\nthat to show anger to mere privates at losing his trees would yield him\r\nonly smiles of scorn and pity. What had they come for? Brewster had his\r\nsuspicions, which he started to test. He thrust his hands carelessly\r\ninto his pockets, observing that he guessed he wouldn’t “get no more\r\nletters at all, steamed or unsteamed.” To which the emissaries replied\r\nthat he did them an injustice, that they had no desire to interfere with\r\nthe honorable foreigner’s business, but sought rather to safeguard his\r\nprivacy by official deliveries.\r\n\r\n“_So deska_,” said the captain with falling inflection, which means,\r\n“Well, well, now, you don’t say.” “You mean then, any Jap can bring me\r\nmail?” he challenged.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the tall one. “Indeed. Certainly. If he is in the army.”\r\n\r\n“Then I’d like your boss’s permission,” said the captain slowly, “to\r\ndetail that Jap boy Ikeda I have traveling to the mines for me to bring\r\nmy mail.”\r\n\r\n“Ah—he is expected back soon?” interrupted both at once, stepping\r\nforward eagerly at mention of the spy, confirming Brewster’s suspicion.\r\n\r\n“No,” drawled the Yankee. “No. Ikeda’s welched—gone south to Seoul to\r\nfight for the Korean Emperor.”\r\n\r\n“_So_,” said both with eager incredulity, “We have a great pity for you.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think yer boss could git him back fer me?” asked the captain\r\nsadly.\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\n“You are telling the truth?” said the doll-eye suddenly.\r\n\r\n“No,” said the captain, “I ain’t—not altogether. Good morning.”\r\n\r\nThe soldiers consulted one another with clever glances. The captain\r\nwhistled easily, for he was quite sure now that they had come to arrest\r\nDavydoff. “Good morning,” he repeated.\r\n\r\nThe pair started down the walk to the gate, but turned to bow. As they\r\ndid so, the Yankee seemed to see their stoop grow rigid. They gazed\r\nover his head to the door of the bungalow. He turned. Behind him in the\r\ndoorway stood what seemed to be a Jap—a man wooden-shoed, in a gray\r\nkimono, a derby hat squashed flat over his ears—Davydoff returned.\r\n\r\n“Your boss is pretty obligin’,” called the captain to the soldiers.\r\n“Without my askin’ he seems to have telegraphed Ikeda in Seoul to come\r\nback and carry my letters. An’ he’s come.”\r\n\r\nBut the soldiers had started back up the garden walk on a run.\r\n\r\n“Hi! Pat,” called the captain, “Sic ’em, Pat, _sic ’em_!” he shouted.\r\n\r\nA chain in the big dog-house rattled, and before the emissaries had paced\r\nten yards, their twin brown gaiters were flying across the garden and\r\nswinging over the rail fence, before the galumphing Kuropatkin.\r\n\r\n“I hev a great pity fer ye,” imitated the captain. “They expect all lies\r\nor all truth,” he observed, turning to the bewildered spy. “Mix ’em, an’\r\nyer ken wig a yeller-belly—if ye hev an intelligent b’ar.”\r\n\r\nThe youth exclaimed, trembling; “I have heard all. The two Japanese there\r\nknow me for an informer. It is danger to remain here.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a bullet fer ye on the bund tomorrow,” said the captain,\r\nthoughtfully eying him, and “jail fer me.”\r\n\r\nThe boy limped dazedly to the wash-basin in the dining-room, and a black\r\nwig fell to the floor. In a moment a blue-eyed, yellow-haired youth\r\nsat down to tiffin opposite the captain. A whitish beard curled thinly\r\nover his chin, and except for the roundness of his head and his hair’s\r\ncreeping low on the forehead—as in all exiles’ and settlers’ sons of the\r\nSiberian steppe—he would have passed in America for the second generation\r\nof a Baltic immigrant, refined and sharpened by transplantation.\r\n\r\n“It would be but dying for my country,” he said with effort, but now\r\ncalm, after the two had eaten awhile in silence. “The great work is done.\r\nKosakin, the Cossack, has all the figure of the landing.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Davy, but Rooshia ain’t the captain’s country,” explained the\r\nYankee. “We got to hide you.”\r\n\r\nThe captain lapsed again into silence, listening absently to an excited\r\ntale of suspicion, strategy, and escapes on a week’s trip from Wonsan,\r\ntold in the Russian’s queer, inverted English. As they rose from the\r\ntable, Brewster drew from his pocket the letter given him by the\r\ndoll-eyed soldier, and handed it to Davydoff. “Suppose you read this,” he\r\nsaid. Davy took it, and read:\r\n\r\n    Exalted Sir? The pupils Oyama school of primary, Chinnampo,\r\n    request being you the oneman English speak, observe the\r\n    try-on of drama given bye and after Red cross aid, in the new\r\n    school house of the night you get this. Appreciation would be\r\n    subgestion and correction English spoken. Drama, Uncle Tom’s\r\n    Cabin.\r\n\r\n                        Humbly to be yours,\r\n\r\n                                      Most Honorific Sir,\r\n\r\n                                                       Tatso Karin.\r\n\r\n“I guess we’ll have to take in the show,” remarked the captain, as the\r\nboy glanced up with a queer look of amazement. “We got to go somewheres.”\r\n\r\n“Is there no place else?” asked the boy excitedly, “I would myself\r\nsurrender rather than now to enter the schoolhouse.”\r\n\r\nThe captain met his glance intently. “It’s our one chance, Davy,” he\r\nsaid, searching the boy’s eyes. “I’ll tell ye. I know thet young school\r\nmissy pretty well. Unbeknown to you, I’ve helped her hearing class. She’s\r\nthe one friend I have in town. If the game’s up with us, as I believe,\r\nI’d like to say good-bye to her,” and the captain with bent head turned\r\naway.\r\n\r\nDavydoff sprang to his feet and paced up and down the room, clenching\r\nand unclenching his hands, darting glances at the captain. “No, no,” he\r\ncried. “Not there! Not there! Never, by my honor!”\r\n\r\nThe Yankee turned to catch his eye.\r\n\r\n“It is ye suspicion the letter’s a trap?” he asked searchingly. “It\r\nain’t, I promise ye. Jap though she is, she’d never—never—” he stammered.\r\n“Or——”\r\n\r\nThe Russian stopped short and their eyes met. “No, no,” he answered,\r\n“I apprehend no trap, not from Karin. Only if—” he checked himself.\r\nUnderstanding glimmered in his blue eyes. Then—“If she is as well your\r\nfriend, I will go. I will go to the schoolhouse with you.”\r\n\r\nAt dark, the captain followed by Davy, black-haired and derby-hatted,\r\nwith Kuropatkin swaying comfortably between, halted suddenly as they\r\nentered the moon-lit pine grove. Looking back toward the bungalow, they\r\nsaw two-brown gaitered figures patter up the garden path and steal behind\r\nthe bear house, where one leaped monkey fashion on its roof. The other\r\nwith prehensile feet shinned the flag-pole and hurled a stone down upon\r\nKuropatkin’s roof. Finding he was not at home, they dashed on toward the\r\nbungalow.\r\n\r\n“Jes’ caught the gang-plank in time, ain’t we?” laughed the captain.\r\n“Dodged the yeller-bellies so far.”\r\n\r\nEmerging from the grove, they stole across frozen stagnant water, among\r\nsqualid red clay huts with tiny lattices under the thatching. Four\r\nsoldiers, singing with locked arms as they passed, kicked a fallen Korean\r\nchimney—a tin kerosene can. Not a white-robed philosopher was in sight,\r\nbut through the huts’ straw fences, they could see long-haired hags\r\nhuddled over smoky braziers in which bubbled the head of a dog or hoof\r\nof a bull. Through low door-ways in the haze of tiny, ill-trimmed lamps,\r\nsore-covered children in soiled bright silks rolled on matless earth\r\nbeside chests clamped with iron.\r\n\r\nAt last the schoolhouse, white, high-gabled, and awkwardly occidental,\r\nfaced them. They chained the bear to a rail of the steps, and without\r\nknocking entered a long empty room of half a dozen glass windows, its\r\nplain boards lit by two big swinging kerosene lamps, and decorated with\r\nBritish and Japanese flags. From the platform at the far end, behind a\r\ndrawn red cotton curtain strung on a long wire, a spiral stair wound to\r\nthe loft under the gable overhead. Chairs and benches were piled in the\r\ncorners.\r\n\r\nKarin San tripped down the stair in her best iris kimono and big obi,\r\npausing at intervals as she crossed the floor to bow the glittering comb\r\nin her black hair. Her powdered oval face resembled an enamel shell.\r\nWith half closed eyes and red lips parted, she seemed striving to speak\r\nvolumes of welcome, and to be intensely amused and overwhelmed by her\r\ninability.\r\n\r\n“_Kombomoi kombomoi_,”[1] she gasped and the captain responded, his heart\r\nbeating faster, but his eyes suspicious of the vacant building.\r\n\r\n[1] “Good Evening!”\r\n\r\n“Very sorry, very sorry, Brewster San,” pleaded the little school\r\nmistress. “Tonight, no Uncle Tom. No show.”\r\n\r\nLittle Eva’s red shawl hung from a nail over the platform, also the gray\r\nbeard and spectacles of Uncle Tom, while on it rested a couple of buckets\r\nfilled with ice-cakes. From wondering how that spectacular scene of\r\nEliza’s crossing was to be portrayed—if a samisan could render the proper\r\njumpy music—the captain’s eyes fixed Davy’s in mute wonder.\r\n\r\n“Military authority—Major Kumoda—just now order me no show,” Karin\r\napologized, again bowing with a smile in which her visitors, though used\r\nto oriental deception, could read no duplicity. “Mebbe soldier come.”\r\n\r\nThe soft chords in her neck glistened like velvet, but again the captain\r\nturned from them to his spy, saying, “Right you were in growlin’ to come\r\nhere. Better say yer prayers, boy, if you Rooshians is as good at prayin’\r\nas they tell. She’s snared us for the mustard-bellies.”\r\n\r\n“You shall not so accuse her!” burst out the spy. “May not her deed be\r\nhonorable? Did not the soldiers open and read her missive? Having not\r\nfound us on the hill, they have reason to look here at once.”\r\n\r\nBut the schoolmistress had crept to a window and was looking out, her\r\nsnub nose pressed tight against the pane. From outside came the mutter of\r\nvoices, and crunch of feet on the lingering snow.\r\n\r\n“Damn us for fools!” broke out the captain. “And I’ve dragged ye down to\r\ndeath, boy, for they dassent shoot a Yankee. Davy, blame me. I don’t ask\r\nyer to forgive,” and his voice weakened. “I told yer I come to bid the\r\ngirl good-bye. It’s not the first time this cowardly fool heart o’ mine\r\nhes ruined me with others. But after all these useless years o’ my life,\r\nto find this yeller girl respond to all the stored-up sorrers—” he broke\r\noff, gulping.\r\n\r\n“Then I am happy to come,” said the Russian with tense slowness, “if for\r\nyour sake, my captain. It is then not the forgiveness, I owe,” he added\r\nbitterly, with set teeth, “but—” and he burst out laughing, shouting—“So\r\nthere was no place else to hide? As well here as elsewhere might one be\r\ntaken!”\r\n\r\n“Boy, I knew ye had no fear of death,” said the captain, laying a hand on\r\nDavy’s shoulder. “An’ how I love her—Karin!”\r\n\r\nHe walked to the bright little figure tremblingly preoccupied by the\r\nwindow, and extended his arms. The Russian could stand it no longer. With\r\nfierce Slavic impulse, he tore off his disguise with one dash of his\r\narm, and, erect with blazing eyes, checked the captain.\r\n\r\n“Captain! Fear of death? Never!” he cried. “Because the soldier\r\nmust think Karin in league with me, a vile spy, I would rather have\r\nsurrendered myself than come here to hide with her. Yet I go, because\r\nyou, my friend—dear to me—request, and jealously I think you also love\r\nher. You confess, Captain, we have long been esteemed together, and to\r\nyou I owe more than my life; yet Karin you shall not seize from me, even\r\nin the moment of my death. I love her better than my life or your own,\r\nor her life. We have long loved. Yet may she love you the more. In this\r\nhour, I leave to her to choose between us!”\r\n\r\nWith a cry, the little schoolmistress threw herself into Davy’s\r\noutstretched arms, and was smothered in a long embrace.\r\n\r\nThe captain bent his head. “Davy, forgive me,” he whispered after a\r\nsilence. “I never guessed she was yourn a’ready, else I’d not—I do ask\r\nyer forgiveness now.”\r\n\r\nThe spy limped toward the Yankee to press his outstretched hand, and a\r\nstone struck the schoolhouse door. “You hear,” laughed Karin, at the\r\nwindow again with woman’s tact, but losing innocence of her lover’s\r\ndanger. “Major and two soldiers afraid of him. He very brave, but I think\r\nsoon soldier shoot him. They would come arrest you! You will hide? Go, go\r\nupstair! My room!” she cried excitedly, pointing to the spiral.\r\n\r\nThe captain looked out. “Hold yer ground, Gen’ral,” he called. “This\r\nain’t no picnic bitin’ wood thieves. He’ll hold on to the last, Davy. I\r\nseen him nip the major’s sword, and wink at me—By crotch, they’re gaggin’\r\nhim!” He turned to the lovers. “Go, Davy, go! Up them stairs with her.\r\nIt’s yer one chance. I’ll face the monkeys and take my medicine. It’s\r\nthe least I owe yer,” and a vain thought of his cable message and the\r\nAmerican gunboat at Chemulpo a hundred miles away flashed through him.\r\n\r\nKarin San seized the spy by the arm, and they vanished up the spiral\r\nstairway. Immediately bayonets crashed upon the door, and it burst open.\r\nThe doll-eyed soldier and his companion of the morning, preceded by\r\nthe green-capped cavalry officer, hurled themselves into the room. The\r\nofficer seized the captain by both arms. “Brewster, American, we arrest!”\r\nhe cried, and turning to the doll-eye, delivered a rapid order to search\r\nthe house,—so judged the Yankee—for he smiled and bowed at his prisoner,\r\nsaying, “We find also you friend, Russki spy.”\r\n\r\nBut the doll-eye and his mate were checked in ascending the stair by\r\nKarin San descending with upraised arms and her sweetest smile. The\r\nprivates paused and bowed. The three at first spoke calmly back and\r\nforth. Then the doll-eye began shouting at the schoolmistress, once with\r\nwhat the captain was certain would be an oath in English. But always she\r\nreplied to them earnestly smiling, never pleadingly, gravely shaking her\r\nhead, her hand upon her heart; always quiet, determined, arguing with\r\nutter self-possession, calmly appealing—to what? wondered the captain, in\r\nsuch fanatics of patriotism.\r\n\r\nAt length both soldiers turned and saluted the Major, uttered a short\r\nsentence, and descended the stair.\r\n\r\nThe officer turned to Brewster, elevating his long mustachios in a\r\nsardonic smile. “You see,” he said, “the love of country of the Japanese.\r\nPerhaps you think it is the respect for woman, wherefore my soldier do\r\nnot search the teacher room. It is not. Boy, man, woman, all labor for\r\nthe same end, our country. No one would betray; we trust one another\r\nabsolute. It is so we exist; we fight; we win.\r\n\r\n“We think the spy Russki enter here with you. But Karin San, as much\r\nmyself officer of the Emperor, declare he is not here,” he went on with\r\na self-satisfied smile. “We believe her. He has escape,” and turning to\r\nthe soldiers he gave them another sharp order—to search the town and the\r\nhills about.\r\n\r\nNext morning, sitting cross-legged and politely silent with his captor,\r\nat a breakfast of sweet chicken hash and cabbage, Captain Brewster sprang\r\nto his feet. “_Bzoo-oo-oooo!_” groaned a whistle under the glittering\r\nhills along the river. Away dashed his manikin host without word or\r\nglance. Between the cedar slats of the captain’s prison—the major’s house\r\nby courtesy—the Yankee sighted the long, thin funnel and squat deck of an\r\nAmerican gunboat.\r\n\r\nTwo hours passed. Then the doll-eyed soldier who stood guard on the\r\nveranda, slid open the paper house-door. Three tall Yankee tars followed\r\nby a young lieutenant with sandy hair and a long upper lip, scraped heavy\r\nfeet on the major’s mats.\r\n\r\n“Brewster, are you responsible for this?” said the officer, handing the\r\ncaptain a pink paper oblong.\r\n\r\n“Guess I be,” drawled the prisoner, taking the cable message. He read:\r\n\r\n    State Department orders unconditional protection for Brewster,\r\n    American, Chinnampo.\r\n\r\nThe telegram was addressed to the commander of the gunboat, dated Tokio,\r\nand signed by the United States Minister there.\r\n\r\nThe captain whistled a moment.\r\n\r\n“Say, what’s your state?” he inquired of his countryman.\r\n\r\n“Maine,” replied the lieutenant.\r\n\r\n“Aroostook County?” demanded the captain.\r\n\r\n“No, Skowhegan on the Amonoosuc. Born in Penobsticook myself, but my\r\nfolks was raised on the Allegash,” grinned the officer.\r\n\r\nWhen the captain had whistled again, he observed, “Like to be back there,\r\nwouldn’t you, in a country where they have Christian names you can\r\npronounce?” And the lieutenant embellished his assent gracefully, with\r\nexpletives.\r\n\r\n“These young Napoleons,” he began soon, indicating the little major’s\r\ngreen cap which bobbed in the rear, “are interfering with my orders.\r\nThey say that you’ve been running a spy ranch. Their chiefs have pulled\r\nout for the Yalu, so they want to dicker with Tokio before I take you\r\ncruising and talk over the spring fishing back home.”\r\n\r\n“Let me give you a tip on that, lieutenant,” said the captain, putting\r\nhis hand on the officer’s shoulder. Then he whispered awhile into the\r\nyoung man’s ear. At first the lieutenant shook his head seriously; then\r\nquite as gravely dug the captain in the ribs. And as the delegation,\r\nincluding the manikin major, withdrew, Brewster called after to his new\r\nfriend, “Mind the boys use only blank shells. We want a bluff, not an\r\ninternational war.”\r\n\r\nAnd so the little cavalry officer never came back to his prisoner at all.\r\nIn half an hour, “Boom-boom!” resounded guns from the blue Tai-Dong. The\r\ndoll-eye thrust his head into the paper door. “You hear? You hear?” he\r\ncried pointing to smoke curling about the Stars and Stripes on the river.\r\n\r\n“America—Japan—cross—fight—so,” said Brewster, linking his two\r\nforefingers. And the doll-eye dashed away.\r\n\r\nThe captain’s ruse of firing blank shots to force the telegram had\r\nworked. When he believed that the coast was clear, he stepped out on the\r\nveranda. Only the lieutenant from Maine was walking up the hill.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got a Jap servant and his wife that I’d like to take abroad with\r\nus,” said the captain to his savior, as they descended into the town,\r\nwhere not even a Jap private was in evidence. “They’re over yonder in\r\nthat white building,” and he pointed to the schoolhouse. “And wait,”\r\nadded the captain, while the officer despatched an orderly from the\r\nlanding, “Could he fetch along my—my—pet Newfoundland dog, as well?”\r\n\r\nRemarked the younger man from Maine, as the two watched from the gunboat\r\nthe clean hills fold over the straw roofs of Chinnampo: “If there’s\r\ntrouble from all this, that’s for the dudes in Washington to fix. Spies\r\nis spies, but them pine trees is pine trees, and valuable, as we ought\r\nto know. Too bad about old Kuropatkin, though most orderlies _would_ be\r\nafraid of bears—Hello! Look!”\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the water. Aport, a black oblong rippled the surface of the\r\nriver—Kuropatkin swimming out to the vessel.\r\n\r\n“Hi, Pat! Sic ’em, sic ’em!” shouted the captain.\r\n\r\nWhen the ship had heaved to and started again, the captain’s face was\r\nsalt and wet against a shaggy brown coat.\r\n\r\nAlso wet were the faces of a light-haired youth, and a little teacher of\r\nEnglish as she is Japped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Where the Road Dips_\r\n\r\nHENRY FLETCHER HARRIS\r\n\r\n\r\n    Post-Oak and hickory talk in air,\r\n        And mutter where the roadway dips;\r\n        And tree-toads croak; and darkness drips;\r\n    And blackberries trail live fragrance there.\r\n\r\n    Ragweed and horehound, sage and mint,\r\n        And many a nameless herb beside,\r\n        Work homely magic—at one stride\r\n    The Past returns the way it went!\r\n\r\n    Chuckle of water greets the ear;\r\n        The light wind tries the brake and goes;\r\n        Far off the summer lightning shows,\r\n    But summer thunder comes not near.\r\n\r\n    This tender darkness stills the heart\r\n        As with old music; and the stars\r\n        Drop coolness where the shadow-bars\r\n    Of many branches mix and part.\r\n\r\n    A voice comes on the wind-thrilled night\r\n        Long drowned amid the roaring years;\r\n        My eyes are stung with blinding tears,\r\n    And fear and doubt dissolve in light!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _How Long Will We Tolerate This Outrage?_\r\n\r\n    _Westerman, in Ohio State Journal_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Why the People Love the Senate._\r\n\r\n    _McCutcheon, in Chicago Tribune_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Man Congress Should Go For_.\r\n\r\n    _Westerman, in Ohio State Journal_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Repeal the Land Laws_\r\n\r\nBY HUGH J. HUGHES\r\n\r\n\r\nThere remains something considerably less than 500,000,000 acres of\r\npublic land open to settlement. From this total amount careful and\r\nconservative estimates deduct 300,000,000 acres as not suited to present\r\nknown methods of agriculture. The remaining 200,000,000 of the public\r\ndomain is passing into the hands of private individuals at a rate\r\nexceeding 17,000,000 acres per year. At the present rate of diminution\r\nthe valuable public domain will be exhausted within the next decade and a\r\nhalf.\r\n\r\nThe public domain lies largely in the States and Territories of Arizona,\r\nNevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming,\r\nColorado, South and North Dakota and California. In Texas, by virtue of\r\nthe agreement with the United States at the time of annexation, the title\r\nto the public lands rests in the State. Liberal grants to the Western\r\nStates, of lands for school and institutional purposes, should be added\r\nto the public domain in order to arrive at the total land available for\r\nfuture settlement. These State lands are sold at prices somewhat below\r\nthe price of similar unimproved lands in the same locality, but on long\r\nterms, and appeal about equally to the farmers and the speculators.\r\nTheir gradual disposal is placing in the treasuries of the Eastern\r\nStates a large school fund. The people are the beneficiaries under the\r\nadministration of the State land laws. A possible 50,000,000 acres of\r\nfarming land is available from this source after the National domain is\r\ngone. It is well to note in passing that the value of the State lands\r\nrises in proportion to that of surrounding lands. It is controlled and\r\ndisposed of with entirely different motives from those supposed to govern\r\nthe control and disposal of the lands of the general Government. It is\r\nnot free land in any sense of the word.\r\n\r\nThere are many who, remembering how the Western limit of grain raising\r\nhas crept westward across Kansas, Nebraska and the Dakotas, look for a\r\nrepetition, or, more properly speaking, a continuation of this phenomenon\r\nacross the remaining public domain. It is true that we are only on\r\nthe borderland of plant-breeding possibilities. Spelz, or macaroni\r\nwheat, Kaffir corn, and other drought-resistant cereals are making a\r\nmarvelous change in Western farming conditions, and in the certainty\r\nof crop maturity; but as was stated before, under known conditions,\r\nonly two-fifths of all this Western land is now or will ever be adapted\r\nto agriculture. On the remaining three-fifths, grazing, limited in\r\namount, will continue to be profitable. Within this large area lie\r\nthe giant ridges of the Rocky Mountains. Great gulches channel their\r\nslopes. Valleys are strewn with the debris of ages of erosion. Rain\r\nfall is scanty. Water supplied from artesian wells has only a limited\r\npossibility of use. Irrigation is local in application, and limited not\r\nonly by stream supply, but also by the topography of the country. We have\r\nreached the limits of the immediate adaptation of agriculture to climatic\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe area of the valuable public domain is measurable, but it is as yet\r\nnot measured. To the eastward of the area named there is some land still\r\nopen to settlement under the homestead act. What sort of land is it?\r\nLand covered with glacial drift, swamps, hills, sandy land—the cast away\r\nheritage of three generations of keen-eyed farmers. Greater stress of\r\nneed will bring some of this under the plow, but the fact remains that it\r\nis undesirable land, viewed from the standpoint of the man who desires\r\nnot only a home, but a competence.\r\n\r\nAlaska, with unknown but probably limited agricultural possibilities, is\r\nalready beginning to attract the attention of the speculative public.\r\nFarmers are not greatly interested in the development of agriculture in a\r\nregion so remote and where the season precludes farming on a broad scale.\r\n\r\nThis somewhat lengthy statement of present day conditions is necessary in\r\norder to understand the danger that menaces us as a people through the\r\nalienation of the public domain from its legitimate uses. The land open\r\nto settlement is passing, not into the possession of makers of homes, but\r\ninto the hands of speculators who are enriching themselves in the first\r\ninstance at the expense of the farmers, but ultimately at that of the\r\npeople at large.\r\n\r\nThe vast grants to the transcontinental railroads, by means of which the\r\nGovernment paid private parties royally for building roads that have,\r\nsince their construction, charged the people for services rendered “all\r\nthe traffic will bear,” threw open, wide open, the doors to the land\r\nspeculator.\r\n\r\nRailroad lands were bought up at a low figure by companies backed by\r\nEastern capital, just as today similar companies are buying up and\r\nexploiting the Canadian Northwest. Settlers were sought for and brought\r\nin by the car load. They were located on a quarter section of Government\r\nland, and sold as much more of the adjoining speculators’ land as they\r\ncould be persuaded to buy. Under other firm names these same gentlemen\r\nwho exploited the public and corporation lands sold horses and farm\r\nmachinery to the new settler, taking mortgages as partial security on\r\ncrops not yet grown. The lean years came, and the land companies reaped\r\nto the full their harvests.\r\n\r\nSo passed away from the people millions of acres of land in the Dakotas,\r\nNebraska, Kansas and the bordering States. Today that land is selling\r\nback to the people at prices ranging from $10 to $40 an acre—land which I\r\nhave seen sold under the sheriff’s hammer at less than $1.00 an acre.\r\n\r\nThese land agencies are, in a thousand ways, busying themselves in the\r\nsecuring of further lands for speculative purposes. The days of wholesale\r\ngrants having gone by, they are turning their attention to the lands of\r\nthe individual settler, and under their tutelage clerks, teachers, town\r\nmen and women, hired laborers, men who do not know wheat from barley or\r\nrye from flax, are filing upon the last of the tillable public lands.\r\nUnder the homestead law, these settlers are allowed six months after\r\nentry in which to establish homes on their land. This time is taken full\r\nadvantage of. Then a board shack is built and the law complied with by\r\nthe breaking of a few acres of sod. Eight months more of (constructive)\r\ncontinuous residence, and the land becomes the property of the settler\r\nupon a cash payment of $1.25 to $2.50 an acre, according to location. The\r\ncompany furnishes the commutation money and “finds” a purchaser for the\r\nclaim. The shack is boarded up or moved off. The sod grows to weeds. The\r\nsettler, having made from $800 to $2,500 by a little enterprise and a\r\ngood deal of perjury, is eliminated from the problem.\r\n\r\nThis cat’s-paw of organized land plunder is securing for his principals\r\na large, a very large, percentage of all the public lands passing under\r\nprivate ownership. It would be safe to say that one holding out of every\r\nfour passes into speculative hands. Judged by conditions, past and\r\nexisting, in the two Dakotas, this estimate might be doubled, and yet\r\nfall within the facts. On this point see the report of the Commissioner\r\nof the General Land Office for 1905. The land companies immediately\r\nlist their newly acquired lands, and by an ingenious system of “booms,”\r\ncarefully nursed and let loose at the proper time, they advance the price\r\nof their lands to a point sometimes double or treble the original market\r\nvalue of the raw prairies. This is wholly, or almost wholly, a paper\r\nincrease in value. Roads, schools, markets remain as before save for the\r\nchange wrought by the actual settlers.\r\n\r\nThis is, in essence, the same thing as the watering of railroad or\r\nother stocks, and it is done for the same purpose—that the “ins”—the\r\nland speculators—may fatten on the “outs”—the farmers. And if the land\r\nvaluations now obtaining in the fringe of settlement bordering the public\r\ndomain be from 25 to 75 per cent water, how about its effect on the land\r\nvalues in older sections—say in Iowa, or Ohio, or Illinois?\r\n\r\nObviously the price will be enhanced. And the immediate, discernible\r\neffect of that is to render it more difficult for the landless man to\r\nbecome an owner. I have seen land go from $25 an acre to $60 and over,\r\nin Iowa and other States in the East. The land utility is the same as\r\nin years gone by. It will raise no more—sometimes less than former\r\nyears. But every dollar added to the price has increased the rental, and\r\ndecreased the possibilities of a laboring man becoming owner of his own\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\nSomeone will say that this is untrue; that the returns from an acre of\r\nland are today greater than in former years. What I mean is that an acre\r\nof land cropped for ten or fifteen or twenty years is no more valuable\r\ntoday as a producer of grain or live stock than it was then. The added\r\nvalue of the crop is due to better markets, better implements, better\r\nknowledge of agriculture. In other words it is a net gain due to labor\r\nand intelligence, and as such should go to labor. Instead of that it is\r\nconsumed in rent. With every advance in the values of Western lands and\r\nthe consequent narrowing of the opportunities afforded the landless man\r\nof the Eastern and Central States, the values, or rather the prices, of\r\nthese older lands advance.\r\n\r\nAnd if the speculator is able at this time to force the price of land up\r\nby leaps and bounds—if he can take raw prairie and, without adding to\r\nits value by so much as one furrow of breaking or one bushel of ripened\r\ngrain, can make it double his money for him, how will it be when the last\r\nof the tillable public lands are taken? How will it be when the only\r\ndesirable vacant lands are held for speculative purposes? How will it be\r\nwhen there is no alternative between paying some farmer for a part of his\r\nholding or paying some land company its price, based upon monopolistic\r\nvalues?\r\n\r\nToday, in the West, favored by cheap land—$25 to $30 an acre—I am giving\r\n$1.30 as rental for every $1.00 I receive as tenant. Here it still is\r\npossible for a man to start single handed and win a farm, but the crops\r\nremain about the same, the prices are slowly bettering, the cost of the\r\nbare necessities of living is lowering, the price of land is rapidly\r\nadvancing, the rental is going up, and my wages as a tenant are becoming\r\nrelatively less. I can still say, “Unless you give me a living chance, I\r\nwill go to the free lands and make my own home.” I still can pay for a\r\nhome for myself here. But I know that a decade hence conditions will have\r\nchanged. There will be no ‘farther West’ in the sense in which we know it\r\ntoday. The increased land values will shut out a great body of men from\r\nbecoming land owners, or they will achieve their aim only at the expense\r\nof a life-time of grinding toil. The basis of a landed aristocracy on\r\nthe one hand, and of a landless tenant class on the other will have been\r\nlaid. And you do not live so far to the Eastward, nor are you so deeply\r\nburied in the great cities that the thrill of that new birth of despotism\r\nshall not reach you, and be a portent of danger to your independence as a\r\ncitizen and as a man.\r\n\r\nRepeal the land laws! Let the settlement of the public domain cease\r\nuntil we know its capabilities. Better to deprive a few worthy men and\r\nwomen of the advantage afforded by the laws than to throw away the\r\nbirthright of unborn millions. We do not know very much as yet about the\r\nability of the West to sustain population, but this we do know, that\r\nno general land law can apply to this great semi-arid region and give\r\nanything like equal justice. Investigate carefully the areas desired\r\nfor settlement. Make the unit of the homestead variable, according to\r\nthe amount needed to support a family. In irrigated sections but a few\r\nacres will suffice. In even the drier districts it may well be questioned\r\nwhether more than 160 acres should be granted any one settler. We\r\ncover altogether too much ground. Our Western farming has borne bitter\r\nharvestings of the weed called “land hunger.” We need to concentrate.\r\n\r\nAnd whatever laws may be enacted, they should be of such a character as\r\nwill stop speculation in lands intended for the people. Let the lands\r\nbe sold, and no title pass until after a reasonably long term of years,\r\nand after actual continuous residence and actual valuable improvements\r\nhave shown beyond question that home making was the primary object of the\r\nsettler.\r\n\r\nBut the urgent present need is for repeal of the various laws that permit\r\nthis land plunder. We can settle details of future administration later\r\non. We cannot later on return to the people their stolen lands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Candid_\r\n\r\nMrs. NEWROCKS—If there’s anything I hate it’s writing letters.\r\n\r\nNEWROCKS—Do you?\r\n\r\nMrs. NEWROCKS—Yes, indeed.

He was then a young\r\nman of twenty-five and fresh from his father’s farm. While William was\r\nstill in his teens it was plain that the slow life of New England would\r\nnever satisfy his ambitions and desires and so his restless nature turned\r\nhim to the great, wide West.\r\n\r\nWilliam had scarcely landed in the little, muddy, struggling town before\r\nhe knew that he and the city would grow up together. Even in its early\r\ndays, Chicago had that wonderful power which clings to it still—that\r\npower of inspiring every one who touches it with absolute confidence in\r\nits greatness and its strength.\r\n\r\nWhen William Henry came to Chicago it was a little village stuck fast\r\nin the swamp and mud that bordered the great lake, while in every other\r\ndirection stretched the endless prairie with its black soil and its\r\ngreen, waving grass. But William Henry was young and Chicago was young\r\nand even then in his imagination he saw before him the endless stone\r\nstreets and the unnumbered stores and factories and homes that the future\r\nyears would bring.\r\n\r\nHe had not long been in Chicago before he caught the spirit of its vigor\r\nand they both marched rapidly toward wealth and power. He soon founded a\r\ntobacco warehouse and salesroom on Lake Street, and his business steadily\r\nincreased with the growth of the city until he gained that imposing title\r\nof dignity, influence, selfishness and narrowness, “a business man.” As\r\nhe left the busy years behind, his warehouse grew greater, and he moved\r\nfrom place to place until he occupied a whole building on Lake Street\r\nwhich he had bought and paid for from the incense that a generous people\r\nwas everlastingly sending up, if not to his glory, still to his profit.\r\n\r\nWilliam Henry had come from the farm, and with all his city life and\r\ntraining he kept the inborn love for the soil, for the blue sky, the open\r\nair and a piece of land big enough for a cottage, a garden, a barn and a\r\nchicken house—such necessities as he had known in his younger days. These\r\nsimple surroundings of a rural life which seem hard and bare while they\r\nare living things, because of the toil and pains that all the necessities\r\nof life impose—these simple companions of our youth seem, somehow, to\r\ngrow into the fiber of our being, and when we look back upon them from\r\nour artificial surroundings and our worn out feelings, the mist of the\r\ngathering years covers them with a glamor that makes us think that our\r\nchildhood was lived in a fairyland.\r\n\r\nSo when business grew prosperous, Henry looked for a piece of land. He\r\ndid not want a twenty-five foot lot or even an acre, but he wanted a\r\nfine, big “patch” on which he “could turn around.” He always kept a horse\r\nand buggy, and every Sunday after his week’s work was done, he would\r\ndrive out into the country to find a “patch.” He drove out beyond the\r\nbrick stores; out beyond the houses and frame cottages; out beyond the\r\nutmost limit of the place; out on the open prairie, covered with water\r\nin the spring and rank with high weeds and waving grass in the summer\r\nmonths, and out there in the country he found a “patch” of fifty acres\r\nof raw prairie, which, like a herd of wild horses on the plains, had\r\nnever been subdued by man. His friends and neighbors laughed when he told\r\nthem of his “farm” clear out beyond the confines of civilization, almost\r\nto the red man’s reservation, but he told them to wait and see. In his\r\nprophetic brain there rose the scene of a great city, stretching out\r\nalong the lake, reaching far to the north and south and west—a wondrous\r\nconglomeration of all the people of the earth drawn together by the magic\r\nname “Chicago.”\r\n\r\nIn his vision, he could see railroads and street cars, stone pavements\r\nand brick houses covering the “patch” with teeming life. Poor Henry, he\r\nwas not a fool; he was too wise. For there are two men for whom the world\r\nnever has any use; one is the fool and the other the philosopher. The\r\nfool believes that there is nothing but today; the wise man thinks that\r\nthere is nothing but tomorrow. So the fool toils and the wise man dreams,\r\nand the mediocre man reaps the harvest—reaps the harvest born of the poor\r\nman’s work and the wise man’s dreams.\r\n\r\nWhen William Henry bought this patch, he had a vision of a time when\r\nrelieved from business cares, he would build a house like the one his\r\nfather owned, only on a larger scale. He would have a garden, such as it\r\nseemed to him was planted behind his father’s house. He would have a barn\r\nwith horses, and cows that gave real milk, and a chicken house where real\r\neggs were laid, and then, still further on in the magical future that he\r\nknew was in store for the city that he loved, he saw his “patch” cut up\r\ninto building lots and covered with stores and factories and houses built\r\nof brick and stone and standing firm and brave to verify his faith and\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\nSo Sunday after Sunday he drove to his “Farm”, week by week he carried\r\nout his neighbors and his friends. He planted trees and he dug a well. He\r\nworked and planned and planted and dreamed out on his “patch” beyond the\r\ngreat town ever reaching farther and farther toward the cherished spot.\r\n\r\nWell, the dreams and plans of man all go for naught in the presence of\r\nthe blind forces that control the world, and one day Henry was startled\r\nby the cry of fire. In the twinkling of an eye his warehouse was in\r\nflames and all of his tobacco at once turned into smoke, without so\r\nmuch as the aid of a single pipe. When Henry awoke from his stupor, all\r\nChicago was a smoldering heap of ashes, and he was a ruined man. The only\r\nthing that escaped the flames was the little green patch so far away on\r\nthe prairies that even the fire scorned to search it out.\r\n\r\nHenry no longer had the strength and energy of twenty years before, but\r\nhe did the best he could. He built a little cigar store in place of the\r\ngreat warehouse that was once his pride. He still went back and forth on\r\nSundays to his patch of ground, and now he dreamed only of a little house\r\nout there on the farm where he might keep a cow and some chickens, and\r\nreturn to the simple life that his childhood years had known. But there\r\nwas one man who found his patch, and this was the tax gatherer. No land\r\nwas ever yet too far away for him. Year by year, the assessor put a value\r\non his farm, and the little cigar store could not yield the revenue to\r\npay. Of course, he never dreamed of selling the land to some one else; no\r\none does. Deep in the soul of man is planted the old inborn desire to own\r\na portion of the earth.\r\n\r\nWhen Henry had no money to pay the tax, some of the “patch” was sold.\r\nWith never failing regularity the assessment came, and with almost equal\r\nregularity a piece of the “patch” was sold to a buyer of tax-titles.\r\nFinally, one Sunday in the early spring, Henry drove down to his little\r\nfarm. It was the first visit since the fall. Here and there a swale\r\nfilled with the rain of early spring stood in his path. Now and then the\r\nblack mud of the rich prairie held his buggy fast, but finally, after\r\nmuch time and trouble, he reached the farm, and there, plain before his\r\neyes, was a high, tight board fence which barred him out. His first\r\nimpulse was to go back and get a gang of men to tear down the fence; his\r\nnext was to hire a lawyer. After some search he found a lawyer that he\r\nthought would do. The lawyer knew more about the case when it was done\r\nthan when he started bravely in. Of course, Henry had no money, else the\r\ntaxes would have been paid, so the lawyer took the case on shares and\r\nagreed to pay the costs, and then they started in to get the “patch.”\r\n\r\nNo one familiar with the courts would expect me to tell the history of\r\nthis case. It is familiar to even the common lawyer who reads the State\r\nreports. It was about the year 1880 that Henry’s lawyer filed the first\r\npapers in the court. The lawyer was young and full of hope—full of the\r\nhope that is the heritage of all the young; the hope that gives courage\r\nto live and fight and endure in the vain belief that it all counts for\r\nsomething; the hope that keeps alive while years and adversity, with\r\ntheir deadening, staggering blows, teach that all strivings are equally\r\nvain. But Henry’s lawyer was young. He had the money to commence the suit\r\nand he thought that this would be enough. Both Henry and his lawyer could\r\nsee the fence fall down and the farm platted and sold and their money in\r\nthe bank, while Henry’s life was in the early autumn and the lawyer’s in\r\nthe first green of summer time. But the days and weeks and months and\r\nyears went by.\r\n\r\nAt first they lost the case, but they were not cast down. There were\r\nother courts that were better because they were higher up, and besides\r\nall this, the law provided that in a contest for real estate each side\r\nhad the right to try his case twice, and the right to go each time to the\r\nhighest court of the State. Had Henry’s life been at stake he could have\r\nhad but a single chance and no right to go to a higher court, unless the\r\njudges graciously granted him permission, and then only on the showing\r\nthat he was innocent of the crime. But land is one thing and life is\r\nanother. And this is quite right, for the amount of land upon the earth\r\nis fixed, while there is no limit to human life.\r\n\r\nWell, in a year or two the Supreme Court reversed the case, and then\r\nHenry and his lawyer had another chance. In the meantime two more years\r\nwere passed in waiting and the case came on again. This time Henry won.\r\nIt was the turn of the other side to find a higher court. But the Supreme\r\nCourt found a flaw and sent it back to be tried again. Two or three more\r\nyears were spent in waiting before the case was reached. At last it\r\ncame again. Henry had grown old and white and feeble; his clothes, too,\r\nwere shabby and unkempt. His little cigar store had dwindled until only\r\nhis old comrades came to loaf and talk of the grand old days “before\r\nthe fire.” Henry never doubted that he would win. Through it all he had\r\nheld the same faith in final victory that he had ever cherished about\r\nthe future of his “patch.” He had lived to see cable cars run past his\r\nland, to see crosstown electric cars on each side of the little farm, and\r\nto see the elevated road stretching slowly down in anticipation of the\r\nsub-division that would one day come.\r\n\r\nHenry took the stand and told the story of his “patch,” of his early\r\nyears when he drove out on the raw prairie and fixed the stakes; of his\r\nSunday pilgrimages with his many friends; of his well, and grove and\r\ngreen hedge; of the high board fence that he found on the spring day so\r\nlong ago. He looked like a patriarch as he sat bent over in the witness\r\nchair, and his voice and story was that of some long-forgotten day.\r\n\r\nThe jury could not resist the old man’s case and again he won. Once more\r\nthe other side took it to the higher court, but found no relief. Still,\r\nunder the rules of the law, they had the right to one more trial, because\r\na piece of real estate was involved. So, of course, they took the last\r\nchance that the wisdom of the law held out to them.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Henry’s lawyer had spent $5,000 and waited twelve long\r\nyears. He was no longer young, and most of the illusions and dreams of\r\nearly life had passed away. He was fighting now from habit, and because\r\nhe had learned that there was really not much else in life. He knew that\r\none fights for the sake of fighting, not for the hope of any reward that\r\nfalls to the victorious cause. Two years more dragged on. Henry, of\r\ncourse, grew older and more shabby year by year; then, too, disease had\r\ncome with age; poverty and age and disease often travel hand in hand.\r\nThis is when poverty comes in the latter part of life. When it comes in\r\nyouth the lucky victim misses age. Henry had an iron will, and then he\r\nhad a life’s ambition which seemed to defy years and poverty and disease.\r\nBut time is the only warrior that never knows defeat, and it was plain\r\nthat age and sickness were to triumph even here.\r\n\r\nFinally, one day the long-looked-for trial came. If Henry won, this would\r\nbe the end. It was now fifteen years since the first paper was filed.\r\nThe lawyer sent a carriage for Henry on this long-to-be-remembered day.\r\nIt came back empty to the court. Henry had been taken to the hospital in\r\nthe morning before the carriage came. He had protested, and asked to go\r\nto court, but it was of no avail, so they drove him to the great brick\r\nbuilding and carried him slowly to the elevator and took him to the top\r\nfloor and laid him on the bed. He asked for his lawyer, and was told that\r\nhe was busy with the case, which he had concluded to try without his\r\nclient’s presence in the court.\r\n\r\nDay after day dragged on; each night Henry asked about his case; each\r\nday he was told that he was sure to win. The nurse knew nothing about\r\nthe case, she saw only the old sick man, as white as the spotless\r\ncoverlet that she smoothed tenderly above his wasted form. She knew that\r\nhe might as well spend his last few hours in peace, so she told him that\r\nthe case was coming along all right and that he was sure to win. Henry’s\r\nmind was failing with his strength. The nurse could never tell when he\r\nwas asleep or awake. Sometimes he seemed to be back on his father’s farm,\r\na little boy. Again, he was driving out over the bare prairie looking\r\nfor his “patch.” Then he wanted to get out of bed and buy a cow and some\r\nchickens for his “farm,” and then he sank to sleep.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the lawyer fought valiantly along. Finally the case\r\nwas ended, and for the last time the jury gave the land to Henry. The\r\nlawyer waited only to hear the verdict read, then rushed to the elevator\r\nand down to the street. He took a carriage and told the driver to go\r\nwith all speed to the hospital. He ran to the wide approach, passed the\r\ndoorkeeper, went up the stairs two steps at a time and turned down the\r\nhall. He stopped at Henry’s door, opened it softly and went in.\r\n\r\nThe nurse was standing silent near the little iron bed. At the window\r\nthe setting sun was struggling through the smoke and grime of the great\r\ncity and painting the sky with a dull red glare. Its last beams struggled\r\nthrough the dim window and fell upon the white coverlet, the worn, sad\r\nface and the scattering hair. Henry was as still as the bed on which he\r\nlay.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer looked down at the old, white face, and saw the eyes staring\r\nout at the red beams of the setting sun. He could plainly see that they\r\nrested on nothing this side of the crimson sky.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A RADICAL CORPUSCLE\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES FORT.]\r\n\r\n\r\nA white corpuscle, of venerable and intellectual appearance, dug a claw\r\ninto the lining of an artery and paused.\r\n\r\nPast him surged millions of his fellows, all intent upon doing what\r\nthey believed they had been sent into the Man to do, which was to earn\r\na living; tired mother-leucocytes, starting out upon the day’s work\r\ndragging small leucocytes after them; young leucocytes, with not a\r\ncare in the world and never a thought for tomorrow; serious-looking\r\nleucocytes, weighed down with responsibilities.\r\n\r\nHere and there were some whose individuality would attract attention—that\r\nold fellow with the prominent proboscis, forced along in the rush,\r\nas others were, but at the head of an association formed by him, so\r\nbenevolent to himself that he got all the white meat, while the workers\r\ndivided pickings, of every disease germ captured. There had been battles\r\nwith an invasion of diphtheria germs, skirmishes with germs of typhoid,\r\nsmall-pox, and scarlet fever. The leucocytes had overcome every enemy,\r\nand they were a triumphant, arrogant race.\r\n\r\nThe venerable corpuscle might have clung where he was, all day,\r\nwithout interfering with traffic, were it not for a peculiarity of the\r\ncorpuscles. A very hungry white corpuscle, coursing ravenously, noticed\r\nthe venerable old gentleman, and paused. Stronger than even hunger was\r\nhis feeling that he should have to learn why the old gentleman was\r\nstanding on a corner, instead of pouncing, grabbing, and struggling.\r\nSmall leucocytes, with messages to deliver, paused and gaped; and,\r\nbecause they paused and gaped, such a crowd gathered that a burly\r\ncorpuscle, with a stout club, came along and growled:\r\n\r\n“G’wan, now! don’t be blocking up this artery.”\r\n\r\nBut the wise old corpuscle had provided himself with a permit.\r\n\r\nHe began: “Fellow leucocytes——”\r\n\r\n“Hooray!” from irresponsible, small leucocytes.\r\n\r\n“Fellow leucocytes, I look around and see among you some who may remember\r\nme. These may recall that a long time ago I withdrew from the activity\r\nand excitement of our affairs, and may wonder where I have been. I\r\nhave been secluded in the land of gray soil at the upper end of our\r\nworld. In a remote convolution of this gray matter I have lived and\r\nhave absorbed something of a strange spirit permeating it—the spirit\r\nof intelligence—and I have learned much from it. I feel that I have a\r\nmission among you. Let me start it abruptly with a question. Fellow\r\nleucocytes, do you know why we are placed here in this Man?”\r\n\r\n“To get all we can out of it!” answered a sleek, shiny corpuscle.\r\n\r\nThe others laughed good-naturedly, agreeing that this was their sole\r\nreason for being.\r\n\r\n“Out of _it_!” cried the wise old corpuscle. “Why not out of _him_? Then\r\nyou don’t believe that the Man we inhabit is a living creature? You\r\nthink that because his life is not like our life, he has no life? And\r\nyou think that, when you can feel the element of him that we inhabit,\r\npulsate?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that’s only the tide!”\r\n\r\n“You have never heard his voice?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing but thunder!”\r\n\r\n“You think he never moves?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing but a manquake, now and then.”\r\n\r\n“You doubt that he is kept alive by internal heat, just as we are? For,\r\nwithout heat, there could not be life.”\r\n\r\nA studious white corpuscle had become so interested that he permitted\r\na fine plump pneumonia germ to pass him without pouncing upon it. He\r\nstepped forward and said, learnedly:\r\n\r\n“Yes, there is internal heat in the world we inhabit, but we are taught\r\nthat the Man was once a ball of fire and is now gradually cooling off.\r\nIt is ridiculous to say it is alive like us. Look how fine and delicate\r\nis our flesh; see the Man made of coarse, rough substance forming banks\r\nalong every river we navigate. Think of how tremendous its heat is, when\r\nit is great enough to keep these teeming millions of us from perishing!\r\nCould any living creature produce such heat? You say we can feel it move?\r\nIt must move very infrequently then, for these manquakes are far apart.\r\nAnd you regard as a pulsating, the coming and going of the tide? Why, our\r\nhearts beat thousands of times in the span of one ebb and flow of the\r\ntide we are familiar with!”\r\n\r\nSaid the wise old corpuscle: “I say that not only is this Man alive, but\r\nthat he, and millions like him, inhabit a world as vast to him as he is\r\nto us.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, let the old fellow rave!” laughed good-natured leucocytes.\r\n\r\nBut the financier-corpuscle, with the prominent proboscis, coming along\r\nwith a germ under each arm, rolling half a dozen others in front of him,\r\nmuttered, savagely:\r\n\r\n“Another of those cursed agitators!”\r\n\r\n“This wide Man of ours,” pursued the cursed agitator, “is between five\r\nand six feet in length, according to his system of measuring. The world\r\nthat he inhabits is twenty-five thousand miles in circumference.\r\nTelepathy has told me so; I have been able to interpret throbs of his\r\nintellect to mine. He calls his world the Earth. I say that he is a white\r\ncorpuscle to the Earth, as we are to him. He will not accept this belief.\r\nHe argues as do you. Flesh that he lives upon is so gross that he calls\r\nit rock and soil; as rivers and brooks he looks upon arteries and veins.\r\nHe knows of a tide and sees it pulsate. During one ebb and flow, his\r\nown heart beats thousands of times. He says the Moon causes the tide.\r\nPerhaps; then the Moon is the Earth’s heart. He feels agitations similar\r\nto those we know as manquakes. They are very infrequent. He knows that\r\nthere is heat in the Earth, but can not conceive that it is a source of\r\nlife, because of its extreme degree. He has no sense of proportion. He\r\ncan not conceive that a tremendous creature with an existence of ages\r\nmust move, breathe, and throb in proportion to bulk and longevity, and be\r\nsustained by heat that would consume him.”\r\n\r\n“Too deep for me!” cried a group of young leucocytes. “Oh, he’s some kind\r\nof a fake! Start in advertising something, in a minute!” Each jumped on a\r\nred corpuscle and went sliding down hill.\r\n\r\nBut the studious white corpuscle again stepped forward.\r\n\r\n“Friends,” he said, “let us not deride this old person. Let us, rather,\r\npoint out his astonishing errors to him. Be tolerant, I say! Be\r\ntolerant, by all means, even when we are opposed. Sir, we’ll admit that\r\nthere are many Men instead of only this one, and that all inhabit some\r\nvast creature that they call the Earth. But what for? We are here for\r\npleasure, profit, and to store up germs.”\r\n\r\n“Are we? For a long time it has been my theory that we are here solely\r\nfor the welfare of the Man we inhabit; that our food and our enemies are\r\nelements inimical to him; we remove them in his behalf.”\r\n\r\n“Vile agitator!” The financier-corpuscle, coursing round again, was so\r\nagitated that he nearly dropped a germ.\r\n\r\n“Let him speak!” urged the studious corpuscle. “His views differ from\r\nmine, but I will be tolerant! I have arguments that will silence him\r\nsoon. Now, then, my friend, if our reason for being is such as you\r\ndescribe, and you liken men to us, these many men you speak of must\r\noccupy a relation to their Earth similar to ours to this Man. Do they\r\npounce upon and destroy every organism malignant to their creature?”\r\n\r\n“I have no doubt of it!” cried the old corpuscle. “I believe that,\r\nexisting with those that are workers, are others, similar to them but\r\nidle or weak, or, at any rate, of no value to the Earth. I do not say\r\nthat these worthless ones are pounced upon and eaten, but I do believe\r\nthat in some way those of no value are forced out of existence; perhaps,\r\nbesides weak and idle individuals, there are whole tribes who are being\r\nexterminated, unable to survive in the struggle with the fit.”\r\n\r\n“What industrious, unselfish beings these Men must be to do so much for\r\ntheir Earth!” sneered a doubter.\r\n\r\n“Now, let him speak!” urged the tolerant philosopher. “I have arguments\r\nthat will destroy his views, in a moment. Let there be freedom of speech,\r\nby all means!”\r\n\r\n“Industrious and unselfish?” repeated the old corpuscle. “Are we?\r\nIndustrious, yes; but unselfish, no! For our own existence we are working\r\nin this Man’s behalf. We are not philanthropists. For the necessities\r\nof life we perform our appointed functions, most of us never dreaming\r\nthat we are laboring in the interests of the Man we inhabit. So it is,\r\nI believe, with them! I can’t quite imagine what their beneficent tasks\r\nare, but perhaps they till the soil, as we till the soil of this Man,\r\nkeeping the Earth’s system in good order, doing everything in the belief\r\nthat they are working only for themselves.”\r\n\r\n“Pursue your analogy!” cried the rival philosopher. “If we populate a\r\nliving creature, then the creature inhabited by Man must itself be a\r\ncorpuscle floating in the system of something inconceivably vaster. We\r\nare leucocytes to Men; Men are to the Earth; then hordes of Earths are\r\nto a Universe? You speak of many Men. Are there hordes of Earths?”\r\n\r\n“You have expressed a thought of my own! I believe that there are other\r\ncreatures like the Earth. Perhaps they are faintly visible to the Earth.\r\nPerhaps they revolve and have orbits and course through a system just as\r\nwe do.”\r\n\r\n“There,” cried the old corpuscle’s opponent, “I’ve got you! Be tolerant\r\nto him, my friends; I’ll silence him in a moment. My friend, then these\r\nvast revolving creatures like the Earth are remote from one another? They\r\nfloat in nothingness, then? But you have called them corpuscles, or tiny\r\nparts of a whole. How can they be parts of a solid, when they are widely\r\nseparated bodies floating in nothingness?”\r\n\r\n“Take an object of any kind,” was the answer. “Of what is it composed?\r\nYou call it a solid, but I have lingered long enough in this Man’s brain\r\nto catch glimmers of what he calls the atomic theory. This doctrine is,\r\nthat all matter is composed of ultra-microscopic particles known as\r\nmolecules. These molecules are not stationary; they revolve; they have\r\norbits; in everything you think solid and dead, tiny specks of itself are\r\nfloating and are never still. A myriad worlds like the Earth, are only\r\nmolecules floating in ether, forming a solid, just as the molecules of\r\nany substance you are familiar with form a solid. Only comparatively are\r\nthey far apart, as to a creature microscopic enough, the molecules of a\r\nbit of bone would seem far apart and not forming a solid, at all. To the\r\nmolecules nearest to him he would give names, such as Neptune or Mars;\r\nlike Men, he would call them planets; remoter molecules would be stars.”\r\n\r\n“Wretched nonsense!” cried the other philosopher-corpuscle. For he had no\r\nargument left. “Subversive of all modern thought! You ought to be locked\r\nup for promulgating your wild views! I’ll be the first to hang you, if\r\nsomeone will bring a rope! You have it that all existence is a solid,\r\nthen? That a myriad worlds like your fancied Earth are molecules to an\r\nultimate creature? But there can, then, be no ultimate creature; he, in\r\nturn is but a microscopic part of— Beware of him and don’t listen to him,\r\nmy friends!”\r\n\r\nSuddenly a number of rough-looking corpuscles began to circulate through\r\nthe crowd, paid in typhoid germs by the wrathful financier-corpuscle,\r\nwho, standing farther down the artery, could not control his excitement,\r\nas he cried:\r\n\r\n“Vile agitator! Already there is too much murmuring against my invested\r\nrights!”\r\n\r\n“You tell us,” shouted a rough-looking corpuscle, “that we, the\r\nconquering inhabitants of this Man, fresh from a war in which we were\r\ngloriously victorious, are placed in this Man only for his welfare?”\r\n\r\nThe crowd muttered indignantly.\r\n\r\n“Fellow leucocytes,” said the old philosopher, earnestly, “I do tell\r\nyou that! Through our own selfish motives we do our best to benefit\r\nhim, but each one of us for himself only, haphazard and without system.\r\nThen never mind what Man’s relation to his Earth may be, and never mind\r\nwhat his Earth’s relation to its Universe may be; let us think only\r\nof our relation to this Man. Let us have done with our grabbing and\r\nmonopolizing, and study and find out just what is best for us to do in\r\nour appointed task of taking care of this Man. With that view, let us all\r\nwork together and overcome that egotism that makes the thought of our own\r\ntrue humble sphere so repellent——”\r\n\r\nBut, excited by the defeated philosopher-corpuscle and the emissaries of\r\nthe financier-corpuscle, the crowd had become a mob. Angrily it shouted:\r\n\r\n“And he says that we, with our great warriors and leaders, our marvellous\r\nenterprises, our wondrous inventions, are only insignificant scavengers\r\nof this Man we inhabit? Down with him! Or, if we’re too civilized to tear\r\nhim apart, put him away where he belongs!”\r\n\r\nAnd the fate of the wise old corpuscle would have been the fate common\r\nenough in the tragedies of philosophy, were it not that a few disciples\r\nhurried him away, seeking refuge in a tiny vein far from battle,\r\nstruggle, and selfishness.\r\n\r\n“He says we were made for the Man!” jeered the few leucocytes who gave\r\nthe distasteful doctrine another thought. “But we know, and have every\r\nreason to know, that this Man was made for us!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Election Reforms_\r\n\r\nTHE TREND TOWARD DEMOCRACY\r\n\r\nBY J. C. RUPPENTHAL\r\n\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, election is simply choice. In a narrower sense the\r\nterm is limited to the choice of persons for political offices, or for\r\nnomination to such offices, by the people, or by a somewhat numerous\r\nbody, as distinguished from appointment by a single person; or the\r\ndetermination of other questions submitted by law to popular vote.\r\n\r\nThis paper seeks to present the general features of American laws in the\r\nnature of election reform, in the narrower sense, with especial reference\r\nto the decisions of the highest courts thereon.\r\n\r\nWhen the thirteen original American Colonies revolted against the mother\r\ncountry, their government was essentially that which had been evolved in\r\na thousand years of struggle and conflict in England. But in details,\r\nthere was as wide divergence as could well be imagined among people of\r\npractically common origin, race, religion and language. With the more\r\npermanent union under the Federal Constitution came an impulse to conform\r\nmuch governmental procedure to a common standard. Especially was this\r\ntrue in the matter of elections.\r\n\r\nAfter 130 years of trial and change, nearly all of the States vote on the\r\nsame day, choose representatives in Congress and Presidential electors,\r\nas well as most other officers in the same manner, and do not differ\r\nvery widely in methods of voting. The qualifications of Electors are\r\nsomewhat diverse, though probably less so than at the beginning, and\r\neverywhere the right of suffrage has been widely extended. The period\r\nof active assimilation to common standards lasted to the time of the\r\nCivil War. Then the universal, extended and heated discussion of human\r\nrights, the fury of partisanship, the passions engendered in the great\r\ninternecine conflict, the adoption of the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments,\r\nand following all this, the expansion of the nation in wealth and power,\r\ntogether with the accumulation of colossal fortunes, and the growth\r\nof corporate importance and influence, all these led to the trial and\r\ntesting of the most fundamental and long-established rights of man, while\r\nevery new measure in law, has had to run the gantlet from the preliminary\r\nproposal in caucus, convention, primary, or elsewhere, to the final\r\ndecision thereon in the highest judicial tribunal. There was no final\r\njudicial inquiry into the right of suffrage until in 1857 in New York and\r\nin 1859 in North Carolina; but such became numerous in the reconstruction\r\nperiod. From questioning new rights of black men, it was a short step to\r\nattacking old rights of white men.\r\n\r\nHow the matter of popular elections has grown in importance may in a\r\ndegree be illustrated by the court decisions. The syllabi up to September\r\n1, 1896, in all State and Federal cases affecting elections, occupy\r\n553 columns of a digest; for the eight and one-half years immediately\r\nfollowing, up to April 1, 1905, 396 columns are so filled. Seemingly\r\nnearly four-fifths as many points relative to the elective franchise have\r\nbeen passed on in less than a decade, as in the earlier 120 years of free\r\ngovernment. Except in the instance of Kentucky, 1889, on the Australian\r\nballot for the city of Louisville, no question reached a court of last\r\nresort prior to 1890 on such matters as the Australian ballot, factional\r\nnominations, and nomination papers, while in that year four such cases\r\nwere decided in the New York Court of Appeals alone, and others in\r\nMontana and Missouri.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier, simpler, primitive days an important aim was the securing\r\nto each State its rights, real or fancied; latterly more attention has\r\nbeen given to the rights of the individual to an effective share in\r\nGovernment from its beginning in primary election, caucus, convention, or\r\notherwise, within a party or without it, and continuing until his wishes\r\nare at last crystallized in the form of laws, and to protection against\r\nfraud, violence and intimidation while exercising the prerogatives of an\r\nenfranchised citizen. Not unknown are instances of denying rights already\r\npossessed and restricting privileges long exercised. There has been\r\ntyrannical suppression of individuals and classes. But the sweep of the\r\nyears, though slow-moving, has been in consonance with the Declaration of\r\nIndependence—“to secure these rights, to life, liberty and the pursuit\r\nof happiness, governments are instituted among men deriving their just\r\npowers from the consent of the governed.”\r\n\r\n    Yet I doubt not, through the ages,\r\n      One increasing purpose runs,\r\n    And the thoughts of man are widened\r\n      With the process of the suns.\r\n\r\nIn the recent movement for election reforms, four lines of advance are\r\nmarked: (1)—To secure the voter, by protecting him from evil influences,\r\nas is the object of the various “corrupt practices acts” and kindred\r\nlaws; by guarding him against fraud, intimidation and overawing, by\r\nmeans of an absolutely secret ballot, as under the Australian system;\r\nand by preventing, as with voting-machines, any manipulation of ballots\r\nor count. (2)—To extend the franchise by reducing the qualifications\r\nof Electors, and so making suffrage more nearly universal, as in the\r\n15th Amendment, and the laws enabling women to vote. (3)—To increase\r\npopular control over officials and their acts, over law-making, and over\r\nthe initial steps in making nominations, as in making offices elective\r\ninstead of appointive, in adopting the initiative, the referendum, and\r\nthe recall, and in prescribing legal forms for primary elections and\r\nmaking nominations. (4)—To secure more equitable representation of\r\nevery individual, class, party or interest; to avoid the despotism of\r\na majority, or worse yet, a plurality; and to prevent the practical\r\neffacement of minorities.\r\n\r\n(1) To preserve the purity of elections, many states have “Corrupt\r\nPractices acts” forbidding the purchase of votes, directly or indirectly,\r\nby candidates, committees or others, with money, intoxicating liquors,\r\ncigars, promise of office, or otherwise. Some limit the amount of\r\nexpenditures of candidates; others require detailed sworn statements of\r\ncampaign outlays to be publicly filed. President Roosevelt in at least\r\nhis last two messages urged Congress to enact stringent laws to prevent\r\nbribery and corruption in Federal elections, and to secure publicity of\r\nthe expenses of candidates, parties and committees, and of the source of\r\ncontributions.\r\n\r\nVoting was doubtless at first _viva voce_. In some States, particularly\r\nin the South, elections were so conducted for many years, and in Kentucky\r\nthis was in accordance with a constitutional provision. For a number of\r\nreasons, however, voting by ballot was adopted in all the States, either\r\noriginally, or superseding the _viva voce_ method.\r\n\r\nThe written or printed ballot was gradually perverted to such degree that\r\nin 1857 the legislature of South Australia adopted an official secret\r\nballot, printed and paid for by the public, and wholly controlled and\r\nhandled by public officers. The idea was speedily carried to England,\r\nspread over Continental Europe, and at a somewhat later date reached the\r\nUnited States, where in some form, almost everywhere modified, it has\r\nbecome part of the electoral machinery in every State, under the name of\r\nAustralian ballot. On first test in American courts, the system was held\r\nto be unconstitutional, but it has later been sustained almost everywhere\r\nas being merely regulative. The tendency of these laws has been to make\r\nelections more formal, and less flexible. Changes on the ballot and\r\n“scratching” are no longer possible with the ease of the old private\r\nballot system. But in general the voter’s choice is not restricted to\r\nthe names printed on the ballot. Constitutional guarantees of secrecy\r\nare not impaired by those clauses which permit aid by election officers,\r\nto the disabled or illiterate, in marking the ballot. In some States,\r\nas Tennessee and Maryland, illiterates are indirectly or partially\r\ndisfranchised by laws which permit aid only to persons “that by reason of\r\nblindness or other physical disability” are unable to mark their ballots.\r\n\r\nThese laws have been sustained in the highest courts. Regulations, if\r\nnot too difficult in the opinion of the court, are upheld, and likewise\r\nprovisions that require a party to have cast a certain percentage of the\r\nvote at the last preceding election, before it may be entitled to an\r\nofficial ballot. Even forcing a citizen to choose between voting under\r\nan obnoxious party heading, or not at all, is, at least in New Jersey,\r\nviewed as no deprivation of his rights.\r\n\r\nIn a number of States, voting machines which automatically register the\r\nvoter’s choice have been authorized, and to some extent used.\r\n\r\nAt this point mention may be made of compulsory voting, which has been\r\nseriously discussed as advisable to bring out otherwise good citizens\r\nwho are apathetic as to their civic responsibilities. In 1898 the people\r\nof North Dakota adopted a constitutional amendment, permitting the\r\nLegislature to impose a penalty for failure to vote.\r\n\r\n(2) Although the theory of the Declaration of Independence is broad,\r\nthe practice as to the “consent of the governed” was decidedly limited\r\nat the time of the Revolution, and the ruling power in at least some\r\nof the States was vested in so few persons as to be oligarchic rather\r\nthan popular. Property qualifications were often essential to the\r\nright of suffrage. These no longer exist in any State. Also age, race,\r\nsex, citizenship, residence and payment of taxes determined a person’s\r\neligibility either to vote, or to hold office, or both. A higher age is\r\nset generally in Europe, but in America twenty-one years is universally\r\naccepted as marking maturity for voting purposes. Race distinctions\r\nwere wiped out by the fifteenth amendment to the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States. Religious tests were always few, and are probably wholly\r\nabolished—the last effort being to bar Mormons in Nevada about twenty\r\nyears ago, but held unconstitutional. Sex is no longer considered\r\nin Wyoming, Idaho, Utah and Colorado. While only males are fully\r\nenfranchised in the other States, suffrage has been given to females in\r\nmany matters, particularly municipal and school. Only American citizens\r\nmay vote in a large number of States, but in others aliens also, who have\r\ndeclared their intentions to become citizens by naturalization, have full\r\nrights. In an anomalous position are Porto Ricans and Filipinos, who are\r\nneither citizens nor aliens. Residence where the elector offers to vote\r\nis always required, usually a year or more in the State, but sometimes\r\nless; and a shorter time in the county and voting precinct, or city and\r\nward.\r\n\r\nThe extreme mobility of our population, so different from conditions\r\nin the Old World, or even earlier America, has led to a feeling that,\r\nin some way, the good citizen should be enabled to express his choice\r\nin National elections, though for any reason he may have moved from\r\none State to another shortly before election; likewise that he save\r\nhis vote for State and district officers and measures, though crossing\r\ncounty lines; and on county matters, though removing from precinct to\r\nprecinct. An effort to avert this temporary disfranchisement was made\r\nin Kansas, by a law permitting railroad employees to vote where their\r\noccupation happens to take them on election day. The payment of taxes has\r\nlong been a pre-requisite to casting a ballot in Pennsylvania and other\r\nEastern States. In the South, this requirement, as well as educational\r\nqualifications, appears to gain ground.\r\n\r\n(3) The extension of the subjects of popular decision has been most\r\nmarked, and the drift is increasingly in that direction. A further\r\ninnovation, rapidly growing, is the expression of a wish or preference by\r\nthe electorate where such vote is merely advisory and not binding. Office\r\nafter office, once appointive, is made elective, and when so gained by\r\nthe people is never surrendered again. In 1776-1783 only Georgia, among\r\nthe Colonies elected judges. Today thirty-one States elect them. Then\r\nscarcely a governor was chosen by the people. At first presidential\r\nelectors were named in a variety of ways. But by 1832, the right had\r\neverywhere been yielded to the people. The very many resolutions of\r\namendment offered in Congress, providing for the election of United\r\nStates Senators by direct vote, the passage of such measures repeatedly\r\nby the House, and the persistent, reiterated requests for this reform by\r\nvarious Legislatures, all show a deep-seated popular desire.\r\n\r\nScarcely had America copied from Australia her ballot system, when,\r\nbecoming adept as Rome in absorbing from surrounding nations, she\r\nborrowed from the Swiss the Latin terms _referendum_ and _initiative_,\r\nalthough the principles thereby expressed are as long established on this\r\ncontinent as English settlements. For centuries among Germanic peoples,\r\nthere has been a steady transition of power. The right to petition the\r\ncrown grew into legislation. Final power was transferred from king to\r\nparliament, and now in turn it is passing from the legislative branch\r\ndirectly to the electorate.\r\n\r\nNone of the colonial charters, except those of Pennsylvania, had any\r\nprovision for amendment, and of the original States, only Massachusetts\r\nand New Hampshire submitted their constitutions to the people for\r\nratification. By 1787, provision for amendment, thitherto wholly lacking\r\nin all State constitutions, unless Pennsylvania’s, was added to eight\r\nof them. The custom of amending constitutions by popular vote arose,\r\nand is now established in every State except Delaware. Thus, changing\r\nthe organic law, upon legislative initiative, has become commonplace.\r\nThe next step—to permit the people themselves to initiate the change\r\nand finally for them to ratify or reject and even to propose important\r\nlaws,—was slower of acceptance. Switzerland began this revolution in free\r\ngovernment in 1830 and by 1848 had the principle embedded in its federal\r\nconstitution. About 1886 discussions of the Swiss institutions, and\r\nespecially the initiative and referendum, as seen by American students\r\nabroad, began to appear in leading American journals and magazines.\r\nIn 1898 South Dakota amended its constitution by adopting a provision\r\nfor initiative and referendum. In 1900 Utah followed this example. In\r\n1902 Oregon by the decisive ratio of eleven to one in the popular vote,\r\nadopted the most clearly expressed section yet developed in our country.\r\nIn 1904 Nevada added a similar feature to the organic law.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1901, the matter of an initiative and referendum amendment\r\nfirst reached a supreme court, coming up in South Dakota, regarding\r\nacts to take immediate effect, passed under the emergency clause of\r\nthe amendment. The court held that the Legislature is sole judge as to\r\nwhat laws are “necessary for the immediate preservation of the public\r\npeace, health or safety, or support of the State government and its\r\nexisting institutions.” The fundamental principles involved were not\r\nquestioned on either side. But in December, 1903, the initiative and\r\nreferendum amendment was directly attacked in the Supreme Court of\r\nOregon, and unanimously sustained. The Court, per Bean, J., said: “Nor\r\ndo we think the amendment void because in conflict with Sec. 4, of Art.\r\n4, of the Constitution of the United States, guaranteeing to every State\r\na republican form of government. Now the initiative and referendum\r\namendment does not abolish or destroy the republican form of government,\r\nor substitute another in its place. The representative character of the\r\ngovernment still remains. The people have simply reserved to themselves\r\na larger share of legislative power, but they have not overthrown the\r\nrepublican form of government, or substituted another in its place. The\r\nGovernment is still divided into legislative, executive and judicial\r\ndepartments, the duties of which are discharged by representatives\r\nselected by the people. Under this amendment, it is true, the people\r\nmay exercise a legislative power, and may effect veto or defeat bills\r\npassed and approved by the Legislature and governor but the legislative\r\nand executive departments are not destroyed, nor are their powers or\r\nauthority materially curtailed.” Although the question of the nature of\r\nlaws initiated, or otherwise adopted by the people, upon reference to\r\nthem, was not directly before the court, it said: “Laws proposed and\r\nenacted by the people under the initiative clause of the amendment are\r\nsubject to the same constitutional limitations as other statutes and may\r\nbe amended or repealed by the Legislature at will.”\r\n\r\nConcerning that clause in the amendment which says: “the veto power of\r\nthe governor shall not extend to measures referred to the people,” the\r\ncourt held that this applies to bills actually referred to the people,\r\nand not to all that might be referred, and that all acts not submitted\r\nto a referendum may be vetoed. The Utah and Nevada amendments have not\r\nbeen tested in court. Indeed, that of Utah is not self-executing, and\r\nthe Legislature has not yet enacted a method of procedure to give it\r\neffect. The South Dakota amendment specifically applies to municipalities\r\nas well as the State. Nebraska in 1898 enacted a general initiative and\r\nreferendum statute for counties, townships, cities, villages and school\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\nSince the time when “popular sovereignty” was a party shibboleth in the\r\nfree or slave-State controversy, so many matters are frequently, if\r\nnot habitually, submitted to a vote that such course no longer excites\r\ncomment. The charter of Greater New York was adopted upon a referendum,\r\nwhich method has become the rule rather than the exception in giving\r\ncharters effect. Within the charters themselves, the Initiative and\r\nReferendum appears with increasing frequency.\r\n\r\nMany of the earlier acts referring matters to the people were assailed\r\nas unconstitutional on the ground of delegating legislative power to\r\nthe people. The diverse decisions on the subject cannot be reconciled.\r\nBeginning with Delaware in 1847 and continuing to as late date as 1902\r\n(in Ohio), various courts have pronounced such laws invalid. On the\r\nother hand, the Supreme Court of Louisiana decided flatly in 1853 and\r\nagain in 1854 that conditional legislation, to take effect upon popular\r\napproval, is not unconstitutional. Then began some subtle and attenuated\r\n“distinguishing” among decisions. Many courts came round to the position\r\nthat “while the Legislature cannot delegate its power to enact laws,\r\nit may provide that whether or not a law enacted shall be operative,\r\nmay be made to depend upon the popular will.” An interesting fact is\r\nthat the courts in the Southern States invariably upheld reference to\r\nthe people, and that adverse decisions are very numerous in the North.\r\nA peculiar referendum was attempted in Massachusetts, but was declared\r\nunconstitutional. The act provided for submitting the question of\r\nextending municipal suffrage to women, but by a special section allowed\r\nthe women to vote on the proposition of their own enfranchisement. Where\r\nthere are constitutional clauses requiring some matters to be referred to\r\nthe people, the rule of _expressio unius est exclusio alterius_ has been\r\ninvoked in opposing the submission of other laws to the people, but in\r\nvain. The failure of the proper officers to provide for taking a vote at\r\nthe first election after the passage of a referendum law, cannot defeat\r\nthe will of the people, or deprive them of the option of acceptance or\r\nrejection. Until accepted by popular vote, the law takes effect only\r\nfor the purpose of submission, and at a later election mandamus will\r\nlie to require the officials to hold the election properly. In 1900 a\r\nmovement began in Australia to make it obligatory to refer the matter to\r\nthe people in case of a deadlock between the two houses on any bill or\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\nThe latest development of the principle is the advisory referendum, and\r\nadvisory initiative. As the name indicates, these simply show to the\r\nlegislative and executive departments the will of their constituents, and\r\nno legal obligation rests upon the officials to give form to the popular\r\nexpression. In 1901 Illinois enacted a “public opinion law.” Delaware has\r\npending a constitutional amendment to establish the advisory initiative\r\nand referendum. In 1905 Texas enacted a very interesting experiment in\r\nthe way of a primary election law, which not only provides for nomination\r\nof candidates by direct vote, but contains provision for the use of the\r\ninitiative and referendum within party lines to direct party policy, and\r\ndetermine what principles shall be promulgated in the party platform.\r\nMany city councils have voluntarily resorted to this method of learning\r\nthe people’s will. In Buffalo in the fall of 1905 three questions were to\r\nbe submitted. But the commissioner failed or refused to put the questions\r\nupon the voting machines at the proper time. Mandamus was brought in the\r\nSupreme Court. Thereupon Justice Krause granted the writ on one question,\r\nthat relating to public ownership of a light and power plant by the\r\ncity, but denied it on the other two, saying as to these: “They involve\r\nquestions of legislation over which the city council manifestly has no\r\npower. Indeed, their very purpose is not to furnish information for the\r\nguidance of the local authorities; but they are peculiarly matters for\r\nthe Legislature.”\r\n\r\nWhen the Federal Constitution was submitted for ratification, many\r\nof the conventions in the several States, dissatisfied with certain\r\nfeatures and more often with omissions in, the new instrument, offered\r\namendments. These were numerous and varied, and some were later adopted.\r\nIn New York and Rhode Island the conventions offered an amendment for\r\nthe recall of United States Senators at the will of the Legislature,\r\nand the substitution of others. In 1803 and again in 1806, the Virginia\r\nLegislature passed resolutions in support of such amendment for recall.\r\nA revival and much broader application of the principle has lately been\r\nseen. In 1903 the city of Los Angeles, California, amended its charter\r\nby popular vote, and in addition to the initiative and referendum, it\r\nplaced in the people’s arsenal another powerful weapon—the recall. A\r\nfew words in the charter clearly define the recall. In the special\r\nelection in September 1904, the councilman whose course in voting for two\r\ncertain ordinances was not approved by his ward, was defeated by another\r\ncandidate. The incumbent then petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of\r\nmandamus to compel the rest of the council and city government generally\r\nto recognize him for the remainder of his term. Without deciding the\r\npoint, the court assumed the validity of the recall amendment, but\r\nsustained the petitioner on the ground that the procedure in calling\r\nthe special election was not quite regular. Even on this point, Chief\r\nJustice Beatty dissented. In an inferior court, the matter had come up in\r\nanother form, and Judge Ostler decided against the incumbent, holding\r\nthat the recall amendment is not obnoxious to either the State or Federal\r\nconstitution, that it was not necessary to make charges in the petition\r\nfor election, but simply to make statements of reasons to enlighten the\r\npublic; that the officer had no property in the office nor vested right\r\nto hold to the end of his term; that it was no contract, but a mere\r\nagency, terminable at any time by the principal, the sovereign people.\r\n\r\nWith the general adoption of the Australian ballot, whether pure or\r\nmodified, a certain rigidity and official formality was introduced, which\r\nmakes independent action, or the rejection of “regular” party candidates,\r\nhowever unworthy they be, increasingly difficult. This put a premium\r\nupon the control of conventions and party machinery, and the naming\r\nof party candidates by whatever means. To secure a fair, untrammeled\r\nexpression of popular will in the initiatory step of making nominations,\r\na system of primary election laws has been evolved, and now exists in\r\nalmost every State. The early forms applied where parties voluntarily, in\r\nprimary elections, made nominations, sometimes of candidates by direct\r\nvote, but more often only of delegates to conventions, all under party\r\nmanagement and control, subject to such public laws; the later forms are\r\nmandatory, requiring all parties to nominate candidates, or delegates,\r\nat an official primary election, under public control. The usual course\r\nof evolution has been to hold primaries for naming delegates, and then\r\nto assume the nomination of all candidates without the intervention of\r\ndelegates.\r\n\r\nAbout 1879 or 1880 a primary election law was enacted in Kentucky, but\r\nno obligation was imposed on any party or persons to nominate candidates\r\nby primary election. In 1895, almost simultaneously, several States\r\nadopted compulsory primary laws, limiting their operation at first to\r\none or several large cities, and later extending them over the State in\r\neither a mandatory or an optional form. So widely do these enactments\r\ndiffer, that it is hard to deduce general statements of their features.\r\nMany have been upheld, and not a few overthrown. There has been a general\r\ntendency to substitute mandatory for optional laws. After a bitter fight,\r\nextending over a series of years, Wisconsin by a majority of over 50,000\r\nadopted a mandatory primary election law in 1904, that provides for\r\nnomination by direct vote, of almost all officers from the smallest up\r\nto candidates for United States Senators, by all parties upon the same\r\nday at the same polling places and with the same election officers, who\r\nare publicly chosen from the two leading parties in the State. In 1900\r\nCalifornia expressly recognized the primary election by a Constitutional\r\nprovision, and empowered the Legislature to prescribe conditions on\r\nwhich voters may participate in such elections. The Constitution of\r\nMississippi, Section 247, declares that the Legislature shall enact laws\r\nto secure fairness in primary elections. Where the primaries are official\r\nand mandatory, all expenses are paid by the public; where they are\r\nvoluntary, the cost falls on the party holding them. Myriads of questions\r\nhave arisen out of these elections, and Legislatures have sought in a\r\nvariety of ways, to solve them. The proclivity of some voters to take\r\npart in all primaries has been an ever-present problem in those States\r\nthat permit the several parties to hold their primaries at different\r\ntimes and places.\r\n\r\nWhere it is entirely optional with a party, whether or not to nominate\r\nby primaries, having decided affirmatively the party must conduct such\r\nelection strictly in accordance with the statutes. The first primary laws\r\nmade past acts the test of qualification to take part in a party primary\r\nelection. But later laws incline to accept future intentions instead,\r\nwhile New Jersey, at least, requires both faith and works. Kentucky’s\r\ncourt has held that the Constitutional provisions relating to elections,\r\ndo not apply to primary elections, but most courts that have considered\r\nthe subject, take the opposite view. Massachusetts holds that a primary\r\nlaw is not unconstitutional in authorizing printing on the ballots, the\r\nnames of candidates presented by a certain number of voters, if blanks\r\nare left for the insertion of the names of other candidates not so\r\npresented. But Minnesota denies this poor boon to voter and candidate,\r\nand says that no blanks need be left in which to write a name.\r\n\r\nIn many instances, only parties casting a certain percentage of the total\r\nvote are privileged to avail themselves of the mandatory laws, and such\r\nlimitation has been upheld where ample provision is made for nominations\r\nin other ways, by the minor parties. In some of the laws, the procedure\r\nis minutely detailed; others are very brief and general. Some leave much\r\nto the party rules and machinery already in existence, or that may be\r\nprovided, and even expressly declare that the party’s rules shall govern\r\nin matters not provided for in the law. While the provisions of a primary\r\nlaw may apply only to general elections, seemingly to the exclusion\r\nof special elections, it is not therefore a special law, within the\r\nConstitutional meaning of the term, and in all elections to which the act\r\ndoes not apply, the old statutes will govern as before the passing of a\r\nprimary law. Nor is a law rendered special by requiring direct choice of\r\nthe candidates in a single ward or township, while for larger divisions,\r\ndelegates are selected to hold nominating conventions. A New York statute\r\ndistinguishes between municipal and other elections in determining party\r\naffiliations, so that a man may claim party regularity, though voting\r\ndifferently at will in city affairs. The inalienable right of the people\r\nto call Cincinnatus and Putnam from their plows, when the office seeks\r\nthe man has been vindicated by the Supreme Court of Michigan.\r\n\r\n(4) Ever since man first espoused the doctrine of majority rule in\r\npopular Government, students have been perplexed by the problems\r\npresented when three or more candidates for one office, or three or\r\nmore solutions of one question, have been before the people. Likewise,\r\nthe utter elimination of the minority from a voice in affairs, and its\r\ntreatment as a wholly negligible factor, has troubled philosophers and\r\nstatesmen who desire justice and truly representative government. In the\r\nearly history of this nation, five or more of the original commonwealths\r\nchose their representatives in Congress on a general ticket; five chose\r\nby districts, and this system gradually spread, until in 1842 it was made\r\nmandatory. Numerous constitutional amendments were offered, especially\r\nin the early days, to elect Presidential Electors by districts, and\r\nRepresentatives by districts. In 1877 and again in 1888, Maish of\r\nPennsylvania presented resolutions of amendment dividing the electoral\r\nvotes of each State in proportion to the popular vote for the several\r\ncandidates. Many States provide for the distribution of election boards,\r\nand some few other offices among political parties, usually between the\r\ntwo leading parties. In 1870 Illinois adopted a constitution with a\r\nsection to secure proportional representation, or more properly, minority\r\nrepresentation, in the legislature. Quite a number of proportional\r\nmeasures have been passed in the different States, but most of them have\r\nbeen pronounced to be unconstitutional. In March 1889, the Michigan\r\nLegislature enacted a law embodying the “cumulative” plan to represent\r\nthe minority. It was held unconstitutional. In the opinion, Chief Justice\r\nChamplin discusses the matter philosophically and historically, and\r\ndescribes the four plans known as the “restrictive” or “limited vote,”\r\nthe “Cumulative,” the “Geneva,” “free vote,” or “Gilpin” plan, and the\r\n“Hare” or “single vote” system. To this there has since been added\r\nperhaps as, fifth—the “Gove” plan.\r\n\r\nThe “restrictive” or “limited vote” plan has been used in American\r\nelections more than any other method designed to assure representation\r\nof a minority. The Pennsylvania Constitution prescribed the limited\r\nvote for Judges of the Supreme Court, County Commissioners and some\r\nother officers. The principle has been extended by simple statutory\r\nenactment, in the Keystone State, and upheld there. But similar laws\r\nin Ohio, New Jersey and Rhode Island, have been repeatedly pronounced\r\nunconstitutional. In foreign countries, the system is much used. The\r\n“cumulative” plan is much used in corporations, and some attempt has been\r\nmade to apply it in general elections, the Illinois selection of its\r\nlower house, being the most prominent example. Beginning in 1874, Ohio,\r\ntoo, used this method for a while in selecting Legislators. In 1889 it\r\nwas applied in Boston to choosing Aldermen. In Michigan the attempt so\r\nto elect the lower house was held void, as has been stated. The “free\r\nvote” has gained no foothold in our land, but is much used in Europe. The\r\nHare-Spence plan has been in use in some parts of Denmark since 1856,\r\nalso in Tasmania, parts of Australia and New Zealand.\r\n\r\nThe “preferential ballot,” which is a prominent feature of the\r\nHare-Spence method of securing proportional representation, has also been\r\nused where single candidates are to be chosen to office, in order to\r\nassure a majority choice among three or more candidates.\r\n\r\nEven this simple survey of events shows strongly the steady advance of\r\nthe electorate in taking power into their own hands. If any mistrust the\r\npeople, if any have any misgivings lest the masses be incapable of using\r\nwisely the powers they have assumed, he may find relief in the thought\r\nthat whereas the average mature American of the year 1800 had enjoyed but\r\n82 days of schooling in his life, his descendant of today receives 1,034\r\ndays’ public instruction. The trend toward democracy may be the result of\r\nmen’s conscious deliberate design; it may be unconscious destiny.\r\n\r\n          States are not great,\r\n          Except as men may make them.\r\n    Men are not great, except they do and dare;\r\n          But States, like men,\r\n          Have destinies that take them.\r\n    That bear them on, not knowing how or where.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Our Sword of Damocles_\r\n\r\n    _Warren, in Boston Herald_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Uncle Doesn’t Seem to be Going Anywhere_\r\n\r\n    _Wilder, in Chicago Record-Herald_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Jolly Rogers_\r\n\r\n    _Cory, in N. Y. World_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PIERRE, SANSCULOTTE\r\n\r\nBY LA SALLE CORBELL PICKETT.]\r\n\r\n\r\nYou wonder why the world should be so fair to me today—to me, Pierre\r\nof the People, the poor oppressed people, whose heart’s blood has been\r\ncrushed out until it rushed forth in floods that cover the streets of\r\nParis with a crimson stain?\r\n\r\nEven for me the sun shines today and the flowers bloom with a fragrance\r\nthey never breathed before—the red stains that clot the dust in the\r\nstreet are great crimson roses blossoming with a glory never before worn\r\nby flowers.\r\n\r\n“Pierre,” said Monsieur le Géneral, “you are not a traitor to France, are\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“No, Monsieur,” I said sturdily, setting my teeth and giving him as\r\nsteady a look as he was bending upon me.\r\n\r\nI told the truth. We who would free France from the rule of the\r\naristocrats are not traitors. Rather are they traitors who would make of\r\nour nation a stagnant pool of slavery and corruption.\r\n\r\nMonsieur le Géneral looked at me again, keenly.\r\n\r\n“We may not agree upon definitions.”\r\n\r\n“My definitions are from the book of real life, Monsieur le Géneral. They\r\nare always in agreement with the truth. Monsieur knows, though, that he\r\nmay trust me for himself, however my definitions may differ from his\r\nown. He has not forgotten that I saved his life once from an English\r\nsword. I know the memory is graven upon the mind of Monsieur le Géneral\r\nas deeply as the scar is cut in my arm.”\r\n\r\n“I think you love me, Pierre,” he replied.\r\n\r\nI laid my hand on my heart, bowing till my head almost touched one of the\r\ncrimson roses in the velvet of Monsieur’s carpet.\r\n\r\n“More than my life, Monsieur.”\r\n\r\nWhat could I say fairer than that, for was not life the dearest thing to\r\nme then?\r\n\r\nSo matters stood with my lord and me on that morning when he sent me with\r\na missive to Mademoiselle Denise. To her or to another, what mattered\r\nit to me? They were all young demoiselles and, as such, of far less\r\nconsequence than the silver mounting of my lord’s pistols or the flash of\r\nhis gold-sheathed sword.\r\n\r\nAs I crossed the courtyard a dark-eyed page, idling by the fountain that\r\nsparkled in the sun, was singing:\r\n\r\n    “By the garden-wall the rose blooms red,\r\n    And lifts to the sun its royal head;\r\n    There’s never a flower of such sweet grace\r\n    As the blossoming rose on my lady’s face—\r\n    Rose-red, flower grace,\r\n    Never a rose like my lady’s face.”\r\n\r\nWith that refrain ringing in my ears, “Never a rose like my lady’s face,”\r\nI went from the shining flood of sunshine into a hall that seemed like\r\ndusky twilight after the outside brilliance. But in the centre was a\r\nspace where the sunlight drifted down through an open window into a\r\ncircle of radiance and in the middle of it stood Mademoiselle, a shining\r\nfigure that dimmed all other light. She was clad in white and gold, and\r\nthe long folds of her robe lay in shimmering snow along the marble floor.\r\nHer amber hair was like a river that the morning sun-rays cross. Her eyes\r\nshone like great sapphires set under long lashes of gold and arched over\r\nby golden brows. It was as if the light of a thousand suns had centered\r\nin one fair woman.\r\n\r\nThe scar, once a proud and happy place upon my arm, burned as if a coal\r\nof fire had been dropped upon it and for one wild moment I could have\r\ncut from me the arm that had interposed to save the life of my master.\r\nThen I knelt before her, when she had waved her hand for my approach, and\r\npresented the letter. She looked at it carelessly and turned her eyes\r\nfrom it to me where I knelt and beckoned me to rise.\r\n\r\n“Tell me of yourself,” she said in a voice that was like the softest\r\nstrain of a lute. “Who are you?”\r\n\r\nWho was I? Yesterday I would have said a man. Had I not done a man’s part\r\nin battle? Was it not a man’s right arm that had stretched itself forth\r\nto save a great life? Now I was—nothing. There was not a grain of dust in\r\nthe streets of Paris smaller than I.\r\n\r\n“Nothing, my lady,” I said, not daring to lift my eyes to her face, nor\r\nscarcely to look at her hand lying like a white lily on the snow of her\r\ngown.\r\n\r\n“That proves you very much,” she said, “for a man never thinks himself\r\nnothing till he has a standard of merit with which to compare himself and\r\nthe possession of such a standard is a proof of worth.”\r\n\r\n“I am only Pierre—the servant of Monsieur le Géneral.”\r\n\r\nWith what pride I should yesterday have avowed myself the servant of so\r\nbrave a soldier and so grand a gentleman. With what hatred of him and\r\nwhat contempt for myself did I make that statement today. Did not the\r\ngreat gulf between the gold and white Queen of the World deepen and widen\r\ninfinitely with the significance of my words?\r\n\r\n“Monsieur le Géneral is fortunate.”\r\n\r\nShe wrote a line on a leaf from a gold and white tablet and gave it to\r\nme, sealed with a golden seal.\r\n\r\nI bowed low and went out from her presence with my face toward her. At\r\nthe entrance I lifted my eyes and looked dazzled at the spot of light\r\nin the centre of the great hall. Thus I passed out into the courtyard\r\nflooded with sunlight which seemed dim in comparison with that supernal\r\nradiance.\r\n\r\nThe dark-eyed page had seated himself on the rim of the basin into which\r\nthe fountain fell with a tinkling music that kept rhythm with the song he\r\nwas still singing. With the refrain yet ringing in my ears, “Never a rose\r\nlike my lady’s face,” I went back to Monsieur le Géneral with the missive\r\nshe had given me.\r\n\r\nA little later the blood of the Paris streets spattered to the gold robes\r\nof the court. I saw the head of Monsieur le Géneral carried by me on a\r\nspike and the dark-faced, ragged man who bore it sang a ribald song as he\r\nlooked mockingly up into the face, one word of which would have been his\r\ndeath-warrant had it been uttered when that head yet sat upon the stately\r\nshoulders. For a moment a sorrowful thought of the days when I loved him\r\nlay like a cloud upon my mind, but what time was there then for thinking\r\nof love—at least of that love.\r\n\r\nI left the crowd of raging demons and ran across the courtyard where\r\nthe fountain yet tinkled merrily down into the basin. No dark-eyed page\r\nloitered there and sang of the red rose and his lady’s face to the music\r\nof the falling water. I dashed past the fountain and ran into the great\r\nhall. It was empty and there was the print of muddy feet trampled over\r\nthe marble floor. I went to the Leader of the People.\r\n\r\n“Where is Mademoiselle Denise?”\r\n\r\nHis wicked eyes flashed vindictively.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Pierre, if you owe a grudge to the aristocracy of France you can\r\nfeed to it now the most luxurious viands of earth. Even she is offered to\r\nthe vengeance of justice and her head will grace a pike as none other has\r\never done.”\r\n\r\nI threw myself down before him.\r\n\r\n“Citizen, what has she done to you or to France?”\r\n\r\n“Done? She has done nothing. She is. That is the crime of an aristocrat.”\r\n\r\nI pleaded with him for the life of that woman whose gold and white beauty\r\nwas the fairest thing I had ever gazed upon and whose beautiful heart\r\nlooked out from eyes that showed all its goodness and truth. Citizen\r\nBeauget had received many services at my hands in the days when I was\r\nnear the powers of the court because the favorite of the king had owed\r\nhis life to me.\r\n\r\n“Eh!” he cried. “A citizen of France seeking to save the life of one of\r\nthe oppressors of France? Ah, I have it. If she will marry you, good\r\nPierre, her life is yours. Ha, the white and gold lily of the court marry\r\nPierre, the Sansculotte! Beautiful thought! Perhaps she will wish to save\r\nher life.”\r\n\r\nThen I stood up before him and looked at him with a scorn before which he\r\ndropped his gaze.\r\n\r\n“Citizen Beauget, Mademoiselle will marry where she loves or kiss the\r\ncruel ‘Maiden of Liberty’ with pure lips and a brave heart.”\r\n\r\nBut I took the paper he gave me and went straight to the prison where she\r\nstood, and even there space was bright because of her. She turned and\r\nlooked at me and the glow that comes once to a woman’s face was in hers\r\nwhen her eyes fell on me.\r\n\r\n“You have come to help me die,” she said reaching out her hand.\r\n\r\nI took the hand and fell upon my knees and pressed it to my lips.\r\n\r\n“Nay, not so, Mademoiselle. I come to bid you live, if I read truly what\r\nis written on your face.”\r\n\r\nHand in hand we went out into the night and neither the terror of the\r\nliving nor the faces of the dead staring up into the moon-lit sky marred\r\nthe peace that filled our hearts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The New Party_\r\n\r\n_What Shall It Be Named?_\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES Q. DE FRANCE\r\n\r\n_Secretary People’s Party National Committee_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are phenomena a-plenty, said the _New York World_ editorially\r\n(December 31), “which unmistakably foretell a new party and a new issue\r\nin American affairs. It comes in a multitude of shapes and clothed in a\r\nmultitude of garments.”\r\n\r\nComing from the source it does, this utterance is significant. There is\r\nno doubt about the existence of the phenomena, but your conservative\r\nusually delights in playing ostrich. Personally I would like to question\r\nthe accuracy of the _World’s_ forecast—for I contend that we have now\r\nmore political parties than economic conditions warrant—but regard for\r\ntruth requires affirmation instead of denial. The new party is bound to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Bryan,” the _World_ continued, “has already defined it (the new\r\nparty) in terms of triple state socialism—city ownership, State ownership\r\nand national ownership of all public utilities.”\r\n\r\nGranting that this is correct, it is not hard to see that a new party\r\nis superfluous, for the People’s Party now covers this ground; and the\r\nDemocratic Party has in places adopted a portion of the program.\r\n\r\nThe public mind, however, is thinking of a new party—and that settles it.\r\nThe arguments of a few feeble individuals cannot change public opinion.\r\nSo let us accept the inevitable and try to make the best of it.\r\n\r\nThe new party, it is safe to say, will pre-empt a large portion of the\r\nground now occupied by the People’s Party. It will declare for true\r\ndemocracy. It will adopt one of two methods in making its declarations.\r\nIt may, in a few well worded paragraphs, state fundamental principles of\r\ndemocracy, avoiding the peculiar isms of the various factions which will\r\nbe brought together in the new organization; or it may attempt to frame a\r\nplank acceptable to each of the factions. It is needless to say that the\r\nformer will lay the foundation for success, while the latter will give\r\nrise to dissensions and result, finally, in disintegration.\r\n\r\nBut I do not wish to suggest a platform for the new party. Able men will\r\nbe present at its birth, and they will know what to do. I do wish to be\r\nheard, however, on the question of name for the infant party.\r\n\r\nPopulists well know that for the past four years I have fought\r\npersistently against changing the People’s Party name. I have freely\r\nadmitted its faults, but have insisted that a faulty name is less\r\ndangerous than a change. The organization of a new party presents a\r\ndifferent problem. A new name is necessary.\r\n\r\nWhat shall it be?\r\n\r\nViewed superficially there are many good names which might be adopted;\r\nbut when subjected to careful analysis, the number dwindles down to a\r\nvery few. I take it that the name should indicate the predominant feature\r\nof the party; that it should be but one word, and that word short,\r\npreferably of three syllables, not explosive or difficult to pronounce,\r\nbut capable of being uttered easily; that whether used as noun or\r\nadjective no change is necessary; that it should not be an unusual or a\r\nnewly coined word, but one the meaning of which, in its generic sense, is\r\nnow well understood by, or at least familiar to the public.\r\n\r\nA year or so ago a writer in _The Public_ (Chicago) suggested Isocrat,\r\none who believes in equal rule; and Orthocrat, one who believes in\r\ngood rule—both charming names but violating what I believe to be very\r\nimportant: that the name should not be unusual, newly coined, or\r\nunfamiliar to the public. Isocrat, isocratic, isocracy; orthocrat,\r\northocratic, orthocracy. Ingenious inventions, but hardly suited to our\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nSeveral persons in the past few years, notably Rev. John V. Potts,\r\nof Ohio, have made good arguments in favor of “The People’s\r\nDemocratic-Republican Party.” I shall not discuss this further than to\r\nsuggest that a 27-letter name is too long; and that to designate a member\r\nof the party would require a hopeless amount of circumlocution.\r\n\r\n“Home Rule,” “American,” etc., have been suggested; but a little thought\r\nwill disclose their weak points.\r\n\r\nI suggest the good, old word RADICAL.\r\n\r\nNine men out of every ten today—who would likely become affiliated\r\nwith the new party—will, when questioned as to their political belief,\r\ngenerally preface their remarks by declaring, “I am a radical.” Why not\r\ngive them an opportunity to say it with a capital R?\r\n\r\nThe Radical Party; a Radical; Radical measures; Radicalism.\r\n\r\nNot so many years ago the suggestion of this name would have aroused a\r\nstorm of protest—but it is different today. Then a radical was looked\r\nupon as a rash man, if not, indeed, a revolutionist. Men coveted the\r\ndistinction of being regarded as conservative. To put a radical in an\r\nimportant public office, as Governor, for instance, would “drive capital\r\nout of the State.” Only a “con-ser-r-va-tive” (how they did roll that r)\r\ncould prevent things from going to the demnition bow-wows.\r\n\r\nToday it is almost criminally libelous to call a man “safe and sane,”\r\nso great a change has come over the public mind. The words “radical”\r\nand “conservative” have come to be understood in a new light. The\r\nnew meanings have quite obscured the old. A “conservative” is looked\r\nupon today as the beneficiary, as principal or agent, of some special\r\nprivilege—franchise, tariff tax and the like—which gives him the\r\npower to absorb wealth produced by others, without rendering an\r\nequivalent therefor. Naturally, he desires to “conserve” this unfair\r\nadvantage—for civilization has by no means eliminated the wolf in man—and\r\nis, therefore, opposed to radical change. He is a conservative, a\r\nstand-patter, a let-well-enough-aloner.\r\n\r\nI make no claim of altruism for the radical, and am inclined to look\r\nwith suspicion upon the man who prates overmuch about doing everything\r\nfor others and nothing for himself. Self-preservation is the first law\r\nof Nature, and man hasn’t learned how to repeal it. Besides, it isn’t\r\nnecessary, even if we knew how. But there is selfishness and selfishness.\r\nConservative selfishness means to build up one’s self at the expense of\r\nothers; radical selfishness has for its motto, “Live and let live.” In\r\nother words, by promoting the general welfare, I can best advance my own\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nBut, for the sake of argument, let us admit that men are alike in\r\ntheir selfishness; that all are wolfish, whether conservative or\r\nradical. Common sense teaches us that only a comparative few can be the\r\nbeneficiaries of special privileges. If we all possessed equal powers\r\nto rob, conferred by legislation, the result would be about the same as\r\nthough none of us possessed such powers. The former alternative is, of\r\ncourse, impossible; for a special privilege would cease to be such if\r\nmade general. But the latter is possible. Let us frankly confess that the\r\nradical would be a conservative if he could become the beneficiary of a\r\nspecial privilege. Given the opportunity, I feel sure he would act much\r\nas other legalized robbers do.\r\n\r\nI believe we have indulged in too much denunciation of the beneficiaries\r\nof special privileges, the legalized plunderers, and paid too little\r\nattention to the criminal ignorance of the great majority who permit\r\nthemselves to be robbed. I believe we should admit that the masses have\r\nacted as “them asses”—and resolve to quit playing the fool. That’s why I\r\nsuggest the name Radical for the new party. It means a going to the root\r\nof the trouble and uprooting it. It means a change which will hurt the\r\npride of a few, because they can no longer hoodwink and rob their tens of\r\nthousands under guise of law—a change which will benefit the pockets of\r\nthe many, because they will no longer be picked by legal enactment.\r\n\r\nAnd this would be a radical change. Let it be made by a Radical party.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Wild Enthusiast_\r\n\r\n“He——?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he is the kind of a chap that would try to blow up a balloon with\r\nbaking-powder.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Unfinished_\r\n\r\nJohnny—Mamma, I was having such a nice dream when I woke up.\r\n\r\nMAMMA—Were you?\r\n\r\nJohnny—Yes.

Wattles\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present revolt against bossism and the recent destruction of several\r\nof the strongest and best constructed machines, naturally suggest the\r\nquestion as to the permanence of the results. The vital problem now is\r\nwhether the boss will rise again, or whether a new one will come in his\r\nstead. To know the answer we must understand the causes and conditions\r\nwhich bring the boss into existence.\r\n\r\nThe supposition that the boss arises by virtue of his strong personality;\r\nthat he is an organizer, a general, one born to command; that the\r\n“machine” is the product of his skill and genius, and that no one who\r\ndoes not possess the same elements of character can follow him, is wrong.\r\nThe municipal boss is an effect rather than a cause. He is the product\r\nof certain forces, working under certain conditions, and so long as\r\nthe forces are unchecked and the conditions unchanged, a new boss must\r\ninevitably be created to fill the place of every one the people may\r\ndethrone.\r\n\r\nIn municipal politics, the boss comes into being at the point where the\r\ncriminal rich come in contact with the criminal poor. The criminal rich\r\ndesire franchise privileges, which are among the most productive and\r\nvaluable of all forms of property. How valuable they are may be better\r\nunderstood if we remember that a recent conservative writer estimates the\r\nfranchise values of Greater New York at four hundred and fifty millions\r\nof dollars, a staggering sum, but the real market value of actual\r\nproperty which has been virtually stolen from the people. Property, too,\r\nof great earning power as compared with most other investments, capable\r\nof paying almost unlimited dividends; and often giving its possessors\r\ncontrol over all other branches of business, even over life itself. And\r\nthis property, amounting to half a billion dollars in New York alone and\r\nto an incalculable sum in the cities of the whole United States, has been\r\nappropriated by the criminal rich through the agency of the municipal\r\nboss.\r\n\r\nIn order to consummate these thefts, the franchise grabbers must have\r\na purchasable city council. To elect and maintain a purchasable city\r\ncouncil two things are necessary: a division of the “good” citizens\r\nagainst each other, and a boss to unify and keep solid the criminal poor\r\nas a balance of power.\r\n\r\nThe “good” citizens—by this term I mean the great mass of fairly\r\nwell-meaning people—are kept divided by the extension of national\r\npolitical interests into municipal affairs. This division is the first\r\ncondition essential to the development of the boss.\r\n\r\nThe criminal poor—meaning not merely professional criminals, but all who\r\ngamble, get drunk, have occasional fights, and are liable to get into\r\ntrouble with the police—having with them the saloons, dives and all the\r\nhosts of graft and shady business, hold the balance of power. The boss\r\nmaintains his hold upon them by means of his ability to help them out\r\nof trouble. The first step of the boss must be to corrupt the police\r\nforce and the justices’ courts. This is not hard, for the police and the\r\njustices are usually very anxious to be corrupted; it pays them much\r\nbetter to be corrupt than to be honest.\r\n\r\nSo the boss comes in as a business agent between the criminal poor and\r\nthe police, enabling the criminal to escape punishment, and the police to\r\nget rich by sharing in the profits of crime.\r\n\r\nUnder this régime the criminal poor are permitted to prey upon society\r\nby dividing their spoils with the police. The power of the boss is in\r\nhis ability to withdraw his protection from any individual who may waver\r\nin his political support. The boss never preys upon the poor, whether\r\ncriminal or not, he is always a friend in need, a refuge in time of\r\ntrouble to those who follow without questioning.\r\n\r\nBy means of this following he elects his henchmen to the city council;\r\nand so it is to him that the criminal rich must come when they want to\r\nappropriate franchise property. The boss really steals the franchise and\r\nsells it to the rich.\r\n\r\nThus, under the boss régime, both the criminal rich and the criminal poor\r\nare permitted to prey upon society.\r\n\r\nWe understand, now, that the municipal boss is the product, first, of\r\nthe political condition which keeps the good citizens voting against\r\neach other; second, of the condition which makes possible the private\r\nownership and control of municipal public utilities; third, of two\r\nforces, equally desirous of preying upon society—the criminal rich and\r\nthe criminal poor.\r\n\r\nAnd it is evident that so long as the conditions continue and the forces\r\nare permitted to operate, the creation of new bosses is inevitable.\r\n\r\nIt is only possible to hold the good citizens together in independent\r\norganizations in a very spasmodic and uncertain fashion so long as the\r\nparty system prevails in national politics, but it is always possible to\r\nunite them on any one question by means of the referendum. Therefore,\r\nthe first condition may be changed by the enactment of laws requiring\r\nthe submission of all franchise questions to the popular vote. On a\r\nreferendum, the good citizens of all parties, if they vote intelligently,\r\nwill present a united front to the forces of graft. This will prevent the\r\nconsummation of new thefts, but it will not restore the property already\r\nstolen, except by the slow process of awaiting the expiration of the\r\npresent franchise grants.\r\n\r\nThe second condition may be removed by training the people in knowledge\r\nof the practicability of the municipal ownership and operation of public\r\nutilities. Until the people believe in municipal ownership as a practical\r\npossibility, it is impossible; once they do believe, and are ready, it is\r\nprobable that the laws of the States for the recovery of stolen property\r\nwill be found sufficient to bring about the restoration to them of all\r\nthat is rightfully their own.\r\n\r\nAt the end, we always come to the proposition that to check the forces of\r\nevil we must eliminate the profits of evil doing. There is no other way.\r\nBy this plan, the social problems in which the municipal boss appears\r\nwill be found easy of settlement, and possibly those connected with the\r\nstate and national boss also. For they, like their prototype of the city,\r\nare not the great personalities we have deemed them, but merely the\r\nproducts of conditions easily changed and of forces amenable to control.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Silence of Johnny\r\n\r\nBY Harriette M. Collins.]\r\n\r\n\r\n“Is the letter from Johnny, Mary _agra_?” The pathetic appeal in Mrs.\r\nRyan’s quavering voice, and the heart-hunger expressed in her wrinkled,\r\nparchment-like face brought a lump to the throat of her daughter as she\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n“No, mother darlin’, it’s from Andy this time.”\r\n\r\n“Why doesn’t Johnny write, an’ why doesn’t he come an’ see his poor ould\r\nmother afore she dies?” the old woman wailed. “Och, but me heart is sore\r\nwid the longin’ for me darlin’ boy, an’ me ould arrums is achin’ to hould\r\nhim agin! Niver a word from him this three years, come Chrisymas! It’s\r\nnot like Johnny! It’s not like Johnny at all, at all!”\r\n\r\n“But, mother _achree_, Johnny doesn’t forget you,” Mary answered\r\nsoothingly. “An’ he never forgets to send you two pounds every three\r\nmonths by Liza, or Andy, or Katie.”\r\n\r\n“I know it, Mary. Johnny was always a ginerous boy: but it’s not his\r\nmoney I want, but himself back agin! Shure I’d rather beg wid Johnny than\r\nown the wurruld an’ all wid-dout him!” Mrs. Ryan answered. “Read Andy’s\r\nletter for me, Mary _acushla_.”\r\n\r\nWhile Mary Ryan read aloud the letter which she had just brought from\r\nthe village post-office, her mother gazed yearningly over the restless\r\nexpanse of dark blue ocean, which stretched away to the crimsoning west.\r\nWith dreamy eyes, which saw but heeded not, she watched the hovering,\r\nscreaming sea-gulls, the white-sailed fishing-smacks and the long, black\r\nstreak of smoke that, far away on the horizon, marked the course of an\r\noutward-bound steamer.\r\n\r\nFor many years Mrs. Ryan had been in the habit of sitting on the rude\r\nbench by the door of the cabin, that was perched high up on the rugged\r\nhill-side, and watching the steamers as they came and went.\r\n\r\nFour times during those weary years the mother’s heart within her had\r\ngrown numb with pain as she saw the black streak fade in the distance and\r\nknew that one of her darlings was being borne away from her.\r\n\r\nAndy was the first to leave the overcrowded cabin and seek work in the\r\ngrand land of plenty across the water. In a year, Andy sent the passage\r\nmoney for Liza, and, in another year, Liza sent the passage money for\r\nKatie. Then Johnny, the idol of her declining years, kissed his mother\r\ngood-bye and, with cheery, hopeful voice, promised to return to her in\r\ntwo, or at most, three years. With that dumb resignation, sometimes born\r\nof a sense of hopeless inability to cope with circumstances, Mrs. Ryan\r\nhad watched him wend his way, with many a backward glance and wave of\r\nthe hand, down the narrow zig-zag path to the village and the train for\r\nQueenstown, where the merciless steamer waited to bear him away forever\r\nfrom her loving arms. She remembered still how the sunbeams had glinted\r\nupon his auburn hair that morning, and how handsome he had looked in his\r\nnew tweed suit and green tie. She thought of the tears that had welled up\r\nin his blue eyes when she gave him her parting blessing, and she recalled\r\nthe silent anguish with which she had sat by the cabin door and watched\r\nthe black steamer, silhouetted against the golden sunset and slowly\r\ndisappearing in the distance. It had been hard to see the others go, but\r\nJohnny—what would life be without Johnny?\r\n\r\nThat was five years ago. For two years Johnny had written regularly,\r\ntelling of steady work and good wages, and promising to come home for a\r\nvacation as soon as possible. Then there came a short, badly-written note\r\nenclosed with a letter from Andy, and after that—silence.\r\n\r\nAndy and Liza and Katie wrote regularly and sent money for the support of\r\ntheir mother and Mary. It was Mary’s mission to remain in the Old Country\r\nand take care of the feeble, aged mother.\r\n\r\nEvery three months, Andy or one of the girls sent an order for two pounds\r\nand wrote that Johnny sent it with his love. That was all. They never\r\nanswered the questions concerning Johnny, his doings and his whereabouts\r\nwhich Mary repeatedly wrote at her mother’s behest.\r\n\r\n“Is that all, Mary? Is there nothing at all, at all about Johnny?” Mrs.\r\nRyan queried in disappointed tones, when her daughter had finished\r\nreading Andy’s letter.\r\n\r\n“There’s not a word in it about Johnny, mother darlin’,” Mary answered\r\nreluctantly.\r\n\r\n“Andy said Nancy Quin is comin’ home on the boat that gets in Saturday,\r\ndidn’t he?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, mother,” Mary replied, “Nancy is comin’ to spend a month with her\r\npeople.”\r\n\r\n“An’ Nancy Quin lives out in the same family as Liza?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, mother; she’s parlor-maid where Liza’s cook.”\r\n\r\n“Then, plaze God, Mary, when Nancy comes to see me I’ll larn the truth\r\nabout the onnatural silence of Johnny! Och, but he was the darlin’\r\nboy—always so gay and pleasant!”\r\n\r\nThere was a brief silence, after which the old woman drew a worn and\r\nyellow sheet of paper from beneath the plaid woolen kerchief that was\r\nfolded across her bosom.\r\n\r\n“Read it for me, Mary _agra_,” she said sadly, “read it for me agin—the\r\nlast letter from Johnny. God bless him, wherever he is, this day an’\r\nnight!”\r\n\r\nMary held the frayed and faded sheet before her eyes. The writing was\r\nalmost illegible and the paper was worn into holes where it had been\r\nfolded, but she knew the words by heart and, as if conning a familiar\r\nlesson, repeated them slowly:\r\n\r\n    “Dear Mother. Don’t fret if I don’t write. I will sind money\r\n    to you now an’ agin by Andy an’ the girls. Mebbe if it’s God’s\r\n    will we’ll meet before long. God bless you, mother darlin’.\r\n    Goodbye from Johnny.”\r\n\r\n“Three years an’ niver a word from him!” sighed the old woman, as she\r\nagain laid the long-treasured note in its accustomed place over her\r\nheart. “Och, but me ould eyes is achin’ for a sight of him—me darlin’\r\nboy!”\r\n\r\nThe sunbeams were glittering upon the wide, heaving expanse of ocean\r\nwhich lay between Mrs. Ryan’s cabin and the great Western world whither\r\nher children had gone.\r\n\r\nSitting upon the beach by the open door, the aged woman watched Nancy\r\nQuin laboriously climbing the steep, zig-zag path which led to the\r\ncottage. When the visitor reached the door and the usual salutations had\r\nbeen exchanged, Mrs. Ryan steadfastly fixed her eyes upon the girl’s face\r\nand asked:\r\n\r\n“In the name of God, Nancy Quin, why doesn’t Johnny write an’ why doesn’t\r\nhe come home?”\r\n\r\n“Arragh, thin, Mrs. Ryan, darlin’, how should I know that? I haven’t\r\nlaid me eyes on Johnny these three years.” Nancy answered evasively, but\r\nher embarrassment and the compassion in her voice were not lost upon her\r\nquestioner.\r\n\r\n“Don’t lie to a poor, ould woman, Nancy _acushla_,” Mrs. Ryan entreated,\r\n“but tell me, God’s truth, where me boy is an’ why he doesn’t come to me?”\r\n\r\nFor a moment Nancy Quin looked with infinite pity into the anxious,\r\nwrinkled, pleading face, then, dropping her eyes before the old woman’s\r\nwistful gaze, answered brokenly:\r\n\r\n“Don’t fret yourself about Johnny, Mrs. Ryan _agra_. You’ll soon see\r\npoor Johnny; you’ll be wid your boy before long,” and turning away with\r\na stifled sob, she entered the cabin in search of Mary, while Mrs. Ryan\r\nsat very still upon the bench and gazed with tearless, unnaturally bright\r\neyes out upon the bounding, white-crested waves of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mary _acushla_, she’s read it in my face!” Nancy cried in remorseful\r\ntones, “an’ I promised I’d keep it from her.”\r\n\r\n“Keep _what_ from her?” Mary asked, anxiously. “Is it anything about\r\nJohnny, Nancy _agra_?”\r\n\r\n“Yis, Mary,” Nancy answered sorrowfully, “Sure an’ it wrings me heart to\r\ntell you. Poor Johnny was killed—run over at a crossin’ three years ago.”\r\n\r\n“An’ why didn’t they let us know?” Mary sobbed, “Where was the use of\r\ndeceivin’ us?”\r\n\r\n“It was the poor boy’s wish,” Nancy replied tearfully. “They took him to\r\nthe hospital and kept him alive for a day, an’ before he died, he made\r\nAndy an’ the girls promise they’d never let his mother know of his end.\r\nHe had a hundred and fifty dollars saved to take him home an’ he bade\r\nthem sind it to her a little at a time wid his love. His last words were\r\n‘Don’t let poor mother know! It would kill her! Don’t let poor mother\r\nknow!’”\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence, broken only by the subdued sobbing of the\r\ngirls. At last Mary said, wiping her eyes with her apron:\r\n\r\n“By the help of God, Nancy, we must still keep it from mother. She’s not\r\nlong for this world, an’ Johnny, poor boy, was the light of her eyes!”\r\n\r\nGoing out of the cabin, they found Mrs. Ryan still seated upon the bench.\r\n\r\n“Mother darlin’,” Mary said softly, “it’s growin’ cold, an’ you’d better\r\ncome in for your cup of tay.”\r\n\r\nThere was no answer. A smile of ineffable peace lingered upon the aged,\r\ncare-worn face. In the faded blue eyes, whose unseeing gaze was fixed\r\nupon the merciless ocean which had taken her darlings, one by one, from\r\nher arms, shone the wondrous light “that never was on sea or land.”\r\n\r\nTo his mother, the silence of Johnny was no longer a mystery. He had not\r\ncome to her, but she had gone to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vanished Years_\r\n\r\nBY HELEN A.

Since that time I have\r\neagerly sought to read all you have said and written. Being strictly in\r\naccord with your political views, I greatly admire the firm stand you\r\nhave taken in alleviating the burden from the masses of people, your\r\nhonesty of purpose and the plain and outspoken way you have in presenting\r\nyour views. I have had the pleasure of voting for you twice and yet hope\r\nto see you elected our national executive. The crowning act of your life\r\nwas your work in the last election when you took our banner from the dust\r\nof fusion and confusion and unfurled it to the breeze, and fought the\r\nbattles of reform practically alone. May you yet receive your reward.\r\n\r\nAs to your Magazine, I subscribed for it before it was ever printed.\r\nAm well pleased with it. Have no improvement to suggest. I quit the\r\nDemocratic Party in 1890. Have only made one mistake since and that was\r\nwhen I voted for Bryan in 1896.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _L. P.

Love to\r\nhave it read in every home in the United States. Then have every one\r\nact upon its teachings. I know of no way of making it better unless\r\nadvocating return to Africa by American Africans. That subject seems to\r\nbe neglected, though I don’t know that I could write on that subject to\r\nany advantage.\r\n\r\nGo on with the great work.

I think\r\nit’s the best book of Education that is published. Its principles are\r\nright and just to all, and I wish both of the old parties would take a\r\nfew doses of the medicine prescribed in your book.

It is a regular monthly feast to read his pieces. In reading\r\nhis pieces, I am made to feel as though I was communicating with the\r\nsupernatural.\r\n\r\nI wish to call Mr. Watson’s attention through his Magazine to his\r\nphysical health. Take care of your health, Mr. Watson. We need your\r\nwonderful mental power with good health behind it. You are so completely\r\nabsorbed and enthused in your great work for the people, you might\r\nover-tax the brain and bring on a collapse: that would be a national and\r\nincalculable misfortune.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Amos H.

Ellis, Hayward, O. T._\r\n\r\nI have been a reader of your splendid Magazine from the first issue. I\r\nsaw by the papers prior to the time you commenced your publication that\r\nyou were going to edit a magazine. I immediately began to plan to stop\r\nthe circulation of a 50-cent dollar long enough to get it to you for one\r\nyear’s subscription, but son beat me to it, he having no taxes to pay,\r\nnor no overalls to buy, went barefooted, wore a seven cent straw hat and\r\na thirty cent hickory shirt and saved his money and sent it in to you\r\nwhile I was sweating blood trying to pry a money lender loose from one of\r\nhis idols.\r\n\r\nI’m glad to know that I am not disappointed in the character and make-up\r\nof your magazine. You call a spade a spade. You did that while you\r\nwere in Congress and it is a reproach to the grand old Commonwealth of\r\nGeorgia that a hide-bound, moss back, clay-eating democracy could not\r\nhave been broad enough to have let you stay in Congress. Who was the man\r\nthat defeated you? I don’t know. I doubt if his name is known outside of\r\nthe Congressional District. Georgia has produced but four men that have\r\nchallenged the serious attention of the people of the country. Viz:—Old\r\nJames Oglethorp, Alexander Stevens, Bob Toombs and Thomas E. Watson.\r\n\r\nI see that many of your correspondents hope to see you President. No,\r\nThomas, you will never be President of the United States. Why? First, you\r\nare too big, have convictions and the honesty and courage to express\r\nthem. Second, too many fools (with an adjective prefixing “fools”).\r\nYour editorials are very fine. I have seldom read anything finer than\r\n“Dropping Corn,” “A Tragedy in a Tree-top.” Then there is your insurance\r\npolicy which is a source of joy. “Monarchy Within the Republic” by Mr.\r\nFox was instructive. The cartoons are superb. The McCurdy family, in your\r\nlast, conveys the idea that the McCurdy’s are “agin” race suicide, but\r\nyou must remember that sapsuckers are more numerous than eagles. You very\r\nskillfully put the good to Bryan, but say what you will, he stands head\r\nand shoulders above any other Democrat of this day. Compare him, if you\r\nplease, to Alton B. Parker. When I hear the name of Bryan, I think of the\r\nAmerican Eagle soaring the blue ether of Heaven. When I hear the name of\r\nParker, I think of a tomtit sitting on a watering trough.\r\n\r\nBest wishes for THOMAS WATSON’S MAGAZINE and a long life for its brainy,\r\nhonest and fearless editor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Orlando K.

We all admire the principle set forth in your grand\r\neditorials and know that what you say is truth, but I do think that\r\nyou are a little too harsh and a little too personal when you speak\r\nof Cleveland, Rockefeller, Ryan, Belmont, Morgan, McCarren, Taggart\r\nand others of that class. You know that poor human nature is the same\r\nthe world over and if we were to kill out these men whom you handle so\r\nroughly, others would soon take their places. So then the system which\r\nbrings this state of affairs about in our government is to be blamed more\r\nthan these men. Therefore, let’s strive (in the right spirit) to remove\r\nthe evils which beset us as a Christian people. “Vengeance is mine, saith\r\nthe Lord.” And besides, I want you to live long and lead this grand fight\r\nfor reform, but when I read your cutting editorials I shudder for fear\r\nsome of these people may have you assassinated.\r\n\r\nI address you as “dear comrade” because I am getting to be an old man now\r\nand enlisted in this movement for reform away back in the palmy days of\r\nthe Grange, and myself on the “Ocala Platform”, believing it to be just\r\nand in line with the principles later on, under the Alliance banner,\r\nplanted our Revolutionary sires fought for, and I am proud to say that\r\nout of fifty odd Congressmen who were elected on that platform, Tom\r\nWatson is the only one who remained true, and I admire every red hair on\r\nyour head for your loyalty and bravery, and have always voted for you\r\nwhen an opportunity was offered, and if I were called upon to make a\r\nnational ticket of men whom I believe to be true, it would be,\r\n\r\n    Tom Watson,\r\n    Theodore Roosevelt,\r\n    Gov. Folk,\r\n    Frank Burkitt,\r\n    Gov. Vardaman,\r\n    Scott Hathorn,\r\n    W. R. Hearst.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _D. L. Anderson, Soochow, China._\r\n\r\nMy son was on a visit to the States last summer and he sent me your\r\nbooks—“The Story of France,” “Napoleon” and “The Life of Thomas\r\nJefferson.” The books reached me during the summer holidays, and as new\r\nbooks are somewhat scarce out here and yours moreover looked so inviting,\r\nI began to read the day after their arrival, and day after day this\r\nreading continued until I had gone through the four volumes.\r\n\r\nOn finishing the last volume I purposed to write and thank you for the\r\npleasure you had given me through your books, but the fall term of the\r\nUniversity opening about that time I was very busy and so did not write.\r\nBut now I wish to thank you for a very pleasant summer, for the enjoyment\r\nand instruction I received from your excellent books. New light has\r\nbeen thrown on France and her relations to the other powers of Europe,\r\nespecially to England. Napoleon becomes, to me at least, a new man in\r\nyour hands. Your “Thomas Jefferson” is a much needed antidote to much\r\nof the history that has been written and gives a clear view of the man\r\nand his times. Especially would I thank you for your statements with\r\nreference to the formation of the Constitution of the United States, also\r\nfor your explanation of the “Genet Affair.”\r\n\r\nIn one or two allusions that you make to affairs out here, you have\r\nevidently been misled by the newspapers. In your “Napoleon,” page 215,\r\nyou say:\r\n\r\n“In the year 1900 Russians, Germans and other Christians invaded China to\r\npunish the heathen for barbarities practiced upon Christian missionaries.”\r\n\r\nI don’t think that you state correctly the real object of this invasion\r\nof China. The missionary’s part in this Boxer affair was to suffer. Not\r\nonly were many murdered, but both those who were murdered and those who\r\nescaped were made the “scape goats” in the eyes of the world. I enclose a\r\nslip that recently appeared in one of the Shanghai papers that gives the\r\ntrue genesis of this Boxer trouble. The armies of the different nations\r\ndid not “invade China to punish the heathen for barbarities practiced\r\non Christian missionaries,” but they came to rescue their respective\r\nministers, who by their blundering policy had gotten themselves shut up\r\nin Peking. If these officials had not been in Peking the armies would\r\nnever have come. I don’t know of any Government that cares quite that\r\nmuch for a missionary, though they all seem quite ready to use a murdered\r\nmissionary to advance their land-grabbing schemes.\r\n\r\nAgain on page 218 you mention that Admiral Seymour ordered his wounded\r\nkilled, etc. This was published in the papers at the time, but there\r\nnever was any truth in it. It was simply one of the many horrid stories\r\nthat went out from Shanghai during those dark days—manufactured in\r\nShanghai.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Mr. Watson, I trust that you will pardon me for inflicting you\r\nwith this, but I felt that I ought to write and thank you for those\r\nbooks. I trust your pen will not rest. I sincerely wish that you would do\r\nfor Germany or for Italy what you have done for France.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _W. E. Brown, Gainesville, Fla._\r\n\r\nIt is a splendid work you are doing. Your Magazine is a live wire and\r\nyou are a powerful dynamo. The good you and Bryan are doing can never\r\nbe reckoned or measured. You are right, and right is the most powerful\r\nforce in existence, because God himself is the author and is behind all\r\nright. May you live to see your work crowned with success. While touching\r\nup other things, don’t forget we poor farmers of Florida. Between high\r\nfreights and commission merchants we catch it. I am what you might call\r\na one-horse farmer, but every year I pay the railroad $2,000 to $3,000\r\nfreight on stuff I make to get it to market to say nothing about the\r\nfreight I pay on what I buy. I would like to make a trade agreeing to\r\ngive one-half my stuff to get the other half to market and sold. And when\r\non account of delays or for want of ice or any cause not traceable to\r\ndownright negligence our truck arrives in bad condition and is sold for\r\nfreight the railroad takes it all. I had one year 102 baskets shipped\r\nover one line and 15 over another. The 15 sold for $3.00 per basket, the\r\n102 were refused because the car was not properly iced on the way to New\r\nYork and arrived rotten, and I never got a penny. A piece of negligence,\r\nbut could not be proved. This is by no means an unusual case and every\r\ntruck farmer in the state, I guess, could make such a complaint or one\r\nequally unjust to the shipper. But the railroad agent for the A. C.\r\nL. at this place, so it is commonly talked on the streets, absconded\r\nwith $2,000 of rebate paid to him by the railroad to be paid to a big\r\nphosphate concern here, and there is nothing doing. They say he won’t\r\neven be arrested and, of course, the railroad and the receiver of stolen\r\nmoney will not be punished, although I was told by an attorney of this\r\ncity that the railroad commissioners were notified of the facts in the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nSo I say, God speed you, and may you be the means of accomplishing great\r\ngood for this, our glorious country—too good to be wrecked by sordid\r\ngreed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _J.

(a few hours run by rail). I had to pay $1 charges\r\nand part of the oats were eaten (I suppose) by rats. I shipped a box of\r\npears (50 lbs.) from Thomasville, Ala., to Braidentown, Fla. I was told\r\nby clerk or agent the express charges were $2.00. I told him I would not\r\npay such a charge. Another clerk or agent looked in a book and said the\r\ncharges were $1.00. I paid it. That was on Friday. The pears reached\r\nBraidentown, Fla. Tuesday. They should have been in Selma or Mobile\r\nSaturday morning, and where they were from then until Tuesday we know\r\nnot. A letter saying the box had been opened and a part of the pears\r\ntaken out was received yesterday. Have I no redress? I wrote to the Mayor\r\nof Birmingham to know if such thieving was allowed in his city.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _N. W. Rogers, N. Y.

The loathsome and criminal devices resorted to by our would-be\r\naristocracy, in their greedy desire to acquire money, merits a more\r\nactive opposition than that brought about by a public exposure of their\r\ncrimes. Complete restitution of all funds wrongfully acquired in the\r\nexercise of an extortionate monopoly would be but a small punishment.\r\n\r\nI wish you all success in your endeavors and only regret that I cannot at\r\nthe present time take an active part in the campaign.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _F.

If I am wrong, show me my\r\nerrors. It really seems that people never will hear and accept the truth,\r\nuntil some fellows have been hung for telling the truth.\r\n\r\nLet us be honest and acknowledge that our so high praised Christian\r\ncivilization is a total failure. Might is right. The greatest hypocrite\r\nand most brutal beast is the absolute master, who dictates the terms by\r\nwhich he will rule.

You advocate many things which men of all\r\nparties have always been agreed on—that is, honest men of all parties.\r\nIf you could only get the people to take you seriously and make the\r\nten commandments a partisan issue, you would win out hands down, for a\r\nbig majority of the people are honest in principle and want an honest\r\nGovernment. I dissent from very much that you are trying to teach in the\r\nway of political economy and you make many assertions and statements\r\nwhich I believe to be errors. But that does not count. The greatest\r\nfault I find with it as a magazine is the tendency toward being a common\r\nscold—with a good deal to denounce and little or nothing to commend.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _C.

There is a party in the field fully\r\norganized and standing for “all the people”. “Government ownership”,\r\nwith the Government as it now stands, would only add to our burdens. But\r\nfirst—Let the people own the Government. For this the Socialist Party\r\nstands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _O. E.

R. RICHARDSON.”\r\n\r\nBeing a subscriber to the Magazine, I offer the above letter for\r\npublication in the Magazine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _D. C. Pryor, Uvalde, Tex._\r\n\r\n    I send you a “legal tender,”\r\n      A thing you have often seen,\r\n    For which, please send to me, “dear Tom,”\r\n      Your splendid Magazine.\r\n\r\n    Whilst I am a Democrat\r\n      Its ranks I’d hate to leave,\r\n    But I’d vote for you, “dear Tom,”\r\n      Before I’d vote for Cleve.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Dr. H. P. Boyce, Los Angeles, Cal._\r\n\r\nYour editorial “Peonage in Panama” published in the December number,\r\nwas read by me with a great deal of interest, as I have lived for seven\r\nyears in Central America and am thoroughly familiar with labor conditions\r\nthere, having during my residence there had constantly in my employ on\r\nplantation work from 15 to 50 laborers, or mozos, as they are called.\r\n\r\nOf course, I do not know the exact conditions under which these laborers\r\nwere contracted in Martinique, but am confident the conditions were\r\nsimilar to those under which all labor in that country is contracted.\r\nThe employer of labor signs up a number of men and the men ask for,\r\nexpect and receive an advance of money against their future services of\r\nan amount equal to from two to four months’ wages. There is a form of\r\ncontract signed in which the laborer acknowledges the receipt of so much\r\nmoney paid him for future work to be done by him under the contract,\r\nby which he also agrees to work for the employer for a specified time\r\nat the rate of so much per month. This is the general custom in those\r\ncountries and with the class of labor available is the only way in which\r\nthe employer can be reasonably certain of securing and retaining his\r\nlaborers, as the law forces the mozo to live up to his contract and also\r\nmakes him secure in obtaining his money after he has worked out the\r\namount advanced.\r\n\r\nIt was unquestionably the case with the Martinique negroes that they\r\nhad all received advances of money against their future services, and\r\nthat the money had all been spent before leaving their homes and, such\r\nbeing the case, where would the employer have found himself if he had\r\nsubmitted without any resistance and allowed the laborers to nullify\r\ntheir contracts and return home?\r\n\r\nThe Martinique and Jamaica negroes are as a rule a very unruly,\r\nunreliable and impertinent class and it requires strenuous measures to\r\nkeep them in subjection and make them live up to their contracts. They\r\ncannot be compared to the American negro, who is much easier to manage.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your feelings in the matter, but do not think you thoroughly\r\nappreciate the conditions of affairs as they exist in regard to the\r\nrelations of employer and employee.\r\n\r\nWhen the Martinique negro claims he does not know conditions as they\r\nexist at Panama, or other points on the Central American coast, he is\r\nlying, as they are all of them more or less familiar with the entire\r\ncoast from personal visits to it or information acquired from friends who\r\nhave been on the coast.\r\n\r\nI know nothing from personal observation of the Peonage system in the\r\nSouthern States but I do know that the contract labor system is the\r\nonly way to handle labor in Panama, for you cannot get them without the\r\nadvance of money and if you do not protect yourself by the contract, the\r\nchances are 9 out of 10 that your man will never show up to work it out.\r\n\r\nA gang of those negroes numbering 500 or 600 are not easily handled by\r\nany means, and force must be used at times, or at least a strong display\r\nof it made or discipline would not be maintained twenty-four hours.\r\nConditions are altogether different from anything existing here and\r\nmatters must be judged differently. Existing conditions must dictate the\r\nline of action to be pursued in any given case and from my knowledge\r\nof the character of the men and the conditions, I do not see how the\r\nauthorities could have acted otherwise than in using force, if necessary,\r\nto persuade these negroes to disembark. You certainly would not consider\r\nit just that these negroes take the contractors money, spend it, have\r\ntheir fare paid on the steamer to Colon and then on arrival deliberately\r\nsay they would not land and work out what they had already been paid, but\r\nwere going to return home. There would be no justice in such a course and\r\nif the employer had to use force to obtain what was coming to him, the\r\nman’s labor in exchange for his money which the man had already spent,\r\nit seems to me he was entirely within his rights. These laborers owed\r\nthis money to the employer just as much as a man owes money that he has\r\nborrowed from another and given his note for, and, just as much as the\r\nborrower should expect to pay his note, just so much should this laborer\r\nexpect to give his services in payment of the money advanced to him. As I\r\nhave stated before, the laws of these countries recognize this condition\r\nof the field of labor and uphold the employer just as our laws recognize\r\na man’s liability when he signs a note agreeing to repay money advanced\r\nto him. When the laborer has repaid by his services the money advanced to\r\nhim he can no longer be held to his contract, but just so long as the\r\nlaborer demands the advance of money before doing any work, just so long\r\nmust he expect to be forced, if necessary, to carry out his agreement,\r\nand his services as laborer being his only asset he must give those\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nIn those countries you only have your laborer as long as you keep him in\r\nyour debt, for as soon as he gets a month’s wages in his pocket, he is\r\nready to loaf and get drunk.\r\n\r\nI think if you were thoroughly acquainted with conditions there, as I am,\r\nyou would take a different view of the matter. I have been a constant\r\nreader of your Magazine since the first issue and enjoy it very much, but\r\nfelt I must give you my views on this question.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _John C. Sanner, Redding, Cal._\r\n\r\n“Who Are The Rabble?”\r\n\r\nIt is _de rigeur_ nowadays for a “genteel” personage travelling along\r\na country road in a buggy or automobile to address any casually met\r\npedestrian as “my man” when seeking local information. This seems boorish\r\nto my old fashioned notions. We are evidently becoming very aristocratic\r\nalong with our tremendous increase in national wealth. It is a very\r\ngreat exhibition of gall for a large employer to so bespeak an humble\r\nsubordinate.\r\n\r\nI will present to the editor of the TOM WATSON’S MAGAZINE, if he can find\r\nspace, an article addressed mainly to the uneducated and unthoughtful\r\nhard working men and voters of our United States. The writer is an\r\nuneducated man and a life-long hard toiler and acquainted with grief,\r\nsorrow and adversity and has lived over three score and ten years. My\r\nmother being left a widow with four little dependent children, she\r\nwas forced to hire me at seven years old for bread and hence I feel\r\ninterested in millions of men, women and children that are dependent\r\nand in grief and sorrow, that if they had equal rights and justice in\r\nthis government, they would be a prosperous and happy people, and a\r\njust principle that presides in my heart prompts me to write an article\r\naddressed to that dependent, unthinking army of men in this government.\r\nThough I am forced to write from the hand of an uneducated man or from\r\nthe language of my mother’s tongue, I hope my position will be understood.\r\n\r\nIn the first place I want to draw your minds to the man that has no equal\r\nin this government to wit: Thomas E. Watson. The day before the national\r\nelection of 1901 I heard him make a speech in the city of Gainesville,\r\nGa. He said that there was no chance for the Populists in this election,\r\nbut that he would commence the fight the next day after the election\r\nfor 1908 and now you see he is true to his word. He has begun with an\r\neducational school by offering his school-book or magazine in the house\r\nof every family in the United States that wants it, when each monthly\r\nbook or magazine is worth more than the year’s subscription to any\r\nthinking man, and I feel greatly astonished that every workingman of the\r\nnation does not take it, for I am sure it is the greatest educator as\r\nto how the world has moved on in the great governmental ways since the\r\ncreation until the present day, and especially the last forty years of\r\nthe government of the United States. Then I earnestly beg and solicit\r\nall men to take the magazine, and especially the workingmen, that you\r\nmay learn that this little delicate man, Tom Watson, is the workingman’s\r\nfriend and is making a fight for you and your weary wife and children\r\nthat they may be freed from slavery and brought from under the greedy\r\nlaw of the privileged few that are now corporated into a thievish and\r\nrobbing body, that they may steal and rob the workingman of his hard\r\nearnings. Yes, he has taken this greedy lion or corporation by the throat\r\nwith a cry that he surrender to the working people their rights and that\r\nthey must be equal to you. Then, my brother workingman, I appeal to you\r\nwith all my earnest and honest heart to rally to this honest and brave\r\nman, Watson, and stand by him and vote for him and aid him to devour the\r\ngreedy lion that you may have your liberties and rights for yourself,\r\nwife and children. Now, in conclusion I will say I have been a hard\r\nlaboring man all my life and I am now standing on the bank of Jordan and\r\nmay, before you read my little message to my brother working voters that\r\nI am so much interested in, be across the river. Though I am in eternity\r\nat the election of the next President I have three sons and seven\r\nsons-in-law and grandchildren that will vote for the hero, Watson, for\r\nthe interest of workingmen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _J. N. Hale, Cairo, Ga._\r\n\r\nForty-eight years ago I was born a Democrat and I have been one ever\r\nsince. I love true democratic principles now, but find it impossible to\r\nwork and vote for these principles and remain true to the party as it is\r\nnow organized and run. I have been a member of the State Dem. Ex. Com.,\r\nwas Chairman of the 5th Congressional Committee when you were being\r\ncursed, abused and robbed and was glad of your defeat because I thought\r\nyou wrong. I thought the fight for reform should have been made within\r\nthe party; but, alas! there is no reform and never will there be reform\r\nso long as the Belmonts, Gormans, Clevelands and other trust tools are in\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nI now believe that you are right. The only hope for the people is to\r\nrise up and hurl from their rotten pedestals both of the old parties and\r\ntake the reins of government into their own hands. Never before were\r\nthe people more ready to act. Here in the new County of Grady, which\r\nwas “officially born” today, the people are overwhelmingly in favor of\r\ncutting loose from the old parties and marching under a new banner. I\r\nwill advocate in my paper which I have just started, new, clean methods,\r\nand fight for democracy as you see it and so ably preach it.\r\n\r\nThe people are now with you and pure democracy is going to win.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _J. F. Laman, Arp, Tenn._\r\n\r\nI have been a subscriber to TOM WATSON’S MAGAZINE from first to last and\r\nexpect to continue as long as the light holds out to burn and I believe\r\nit is getting brighter. I hope and pray for Tom Watson to live to see the\r\ngood day when he can realize that his work has been crowned with complete\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nYou ask me to give my views concerning the Magazine. I know it is the\r\nbest I ever saw, and I have seen a good many. As to improvement, I have\r\nno suggestions to submit in regard to the make-up of the Magazine, but I\r\ndo suggest that you make it hotter, if possible, for the scoundrels who\r\nrob honest toil of the fruits of its labor.\r\n\r\nI have been a Populist as long as anybody I know of and the older I\r\nbecome the deeper my belief is in the justice of our cause and our\r\nprinciples. I was an admirer of Tom Watson when he was a member of\r\nCongress years ago and I am for him now and will remain for him as long\r\nas he travels in the road he is now in and I have no fear that he will\r\napostatize.\r\n\r\nWith best wishes for you and all your co-workers, I remain your friend to\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _T. A. Thompson, Guntown, Miss._\r\n\r\n1 am a Populist and have been one since 1880 and opposed to Fusion\r\nfirst, last, and all the time. I have been receiving your Magazine since\r\nNovember. I have three brothers that live in Alabama that have been\r\nvoting the Democratic ticket all their lives, and I want them to read\r\nsomething that will open their eyes for I consider them politically\r\nblind; and I want to help you in your gallant fight for the right. I\r\nlike your Magazine. I wish I was able to send you 100 dollars to have it\r\nsent to men that think that they cannot afford to spend one dollar for a\r\npaper. But the trouble with them is that they don’t think at all. They\r\nuse their heads to hang their hats on only. In the Presidential election\r\nof 1876 I voted my last Democratic vote for President. I hope to live to\r\nsee a reformer elected President of our Government. I believe that time\r\nis near when the people will get their eyes opened. Bossism is dying\r\nslowly but surely. Populism is not as dead as the two old twin parties\r\nwould like to see it.\r\n\r\nSuccess to your Magazine and to the People’s Party and its principles.\r\n\r\nA Happy New Year to you.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _J. W. Waite, So. Hadley, Mass._\r\n\r\nI have much enjoyed the Magazine; but have for sometime been in doubt as\r\nto whether I should be warranted in letting you continue to send it. Its\r\ngood strong meat has not disarranged my digestion; it’s not that, but it\r\ncomes near—very near—to being a lack of circulation of the life current\r\nof the country on the little corner I occupy.\r\n\r\nI was a railroad man over 20 years and was discharged, not for\r\nincompetency, but for propagating Populist doctrines. Vocally and with\r\nthe pen I spread the words of Jefferson, Lincoln and many others. I\r\nposted them on bulletin boards and wrote some articles for the Dedham\r\n_Transcript_—near Dedham, Mass. I was laboring the last few years of\r\nmy railroad service. However, my story is not so interesting as that\r\nof many. I have three sons railroaders—all scattered, and I have been\r\nliving here alone on a little corner belonging to the oldest, locomotive\r\nengineer for the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad. He reads your\r\nMagazine occasionally and I send one occasionally to the others.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _A. C.

Now I am happy to know that the people are waking up\r\nto know that justice and righteousness will prevail against fraud and\r\nrascality. I feel happy to believe that Tom Watson will be our next\r\npresident. Now let us all get to work by showing up the light of truth to\r\nour misguided laboring people. Our forefathers taught us the principles\r\nof self-government—equal rights to all and special privileges to none.\r\nI would say that every voter should read WATSON’S MAGAZINE and vote for\r\nWatson for President.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _W.

I\r\nhave been handing out my paper so you see I have obtained four old yellow\r\ndog subscribers. I hope to send more soon. I am one of the Old Guard. I\r\nam for Tom Watson against all comers. Tom and Hearst would make a team,\r\nso put me down for them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _J. R. Murdock, Dallas, Tex._\r\n\r\nTOM WATSON’S MAGAZINE is the best educator that I read. I learn more by\r\nreading it than I do from all the daily papers I can get. Mr. Watson’s\r\neditorials are worth the subscription price. I believe Tom Watson is\r\nthe greatest and grandest statesman in America today. With Watson for\r\nPresident we can smash the present National Banking system and abolish\r\ncorporate railroad robbery and regain our freedom stolen from us through\r\ncorrupt legislation both State and National. I am for Watson in 1908 for\r\nPresident. Can vote for him with a clear conscience without fear of ever\r\nregretting casting my vote. I am still proud I voted for him November,\r\n1904. Give it to old Grover and the wiggle tails and trust. As ever I am\r\nfor Watson and Liberty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _J. E.

I say wonderful\r\nbecause it has no equal in championing the cause of the people and in\r\ndenouncing the big thieves who go scot free because they have plenty\r\nof money with which to bribe both judge and jury. For the last decade\r\nthere has been a huge suspicion in the minds of the masses that both the\r\nold parties are dominated by the same Wall Street influences and your\r\nbrilliant editorials have confirmed this suspicion. There was a huge\r\nsuspicion that the leaders of the so-called Democratic Party in 1904\r\nbetrayed the people into the hands of Wall Street, and your editorials\r\nhave certainly confirmed this suspicion. Indeed the “magazine with a\r\npurpose back of it” is having a mighty influence with every honest and\r\nfair-minded man. The literary features of your Magazine are excellent.\r\nThe “Educational Department” alone is worth more than the subscription\r\nprice. In fact your Magazine has no peer for the price in America.\r\n\r\nDear Tom, we trust your health will continue good, that you may continue\r\nto expound those sacred principles that have emanated from the Sage of\r\nMonticello.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _J.

The only way to improve the Magazine is to put more of your own\r\nwritings in it—say “The Life and Times of Jefferson” in serial form.\r\n\r\nMay your health be preserved that you may continue the good work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _T.

There is often a conflict as to who shall read\r\nit first though perhaps half a dozen other new magazines are lying about\r\nunread, for we take many. My husband, busy high-school teacher, says Tom\r\nWatson refreshes him after his hard day’s work. As he reads it, I can\r\nhear him chuckling occasionally, sometimes laughing heartily. We enjoy\r\nthe editorials, especially, but it is all good. The fiction is of a high\r\norder. I hope to see your Magazine in our public library. Many more would\r\nlike it if they knew of it, and a great many do most of their reading\r\nhere in the public library.\r\n\r\nMy husband has his life insured in the Equitable—I hate the word. He did\r\nit to protect me and the children in case of his death. But now we are\r\nundecided whether to keep up the thing or not. Do you think the Equitable\r\nmight fail to fulfill the contract in case of death? I should like to\r\nknow your opinion. We have just paid three premiums and another will be\r\ndue next spring. I have two little children and if my husband should be\r\ntaken we should be in a dreadful plight. But we are trying to make other\r\nprovisions. It is simply outrageous the way the people are treated. It\r\nfills one with helpless rage.\r\n\r\nI was interested in the article “Phases of the Peonage Question.” Was the\r\nplanter who “had to kill a negro” ever tried for it? I would like to know\r\nthat planter’s name and address, so that I can follow his suit when it\r\ncomes off. I am interested in this question. Won’t you request the author\r\nto give me this information, if you cannot give it. I prefer to have it\r\nthrough the pages of the Magazine.

Just keep on pumping the hot shot into\r\nthe trusts and corporations for, if they are let alone, they will soon\r\nbe taking the house and lot while the old man and boys are at home.

In your editorial of October you\r\nconfound “ownership” with “possession.” If you will read chapters XVIII\r\nand XIX of “Social Problems” the great essential difference will be\r\nclear to you. Neither George nor Tolstoi ever proposed any division or\r\npartition of the land—nothing of the sort. George indeed, in chapter\r\nII, book VIII of “Progress, and Poverty” makes this most plain, saying\r\n“I do not propose either to purchase or to confiscate private property\r\nin land.” But surely, Mr. Watson, if you have not, carefully, without\r\nbias read these incomparable works, you ought to do so; he expressly\r\ndisclaims his “fundamental reform” as being any “panacea;” he fully\r\nrecognizes and so does Tolstoi “that even after we do this, much will\r\nremain to do.” I am an old and very poor man of 73. Had I the means I’d\r\nbuy and send you George’s “Condition of Labor.” No honest Christian after\r\nreading that little, but truly logical and ethically admirable “Open\r\nLetter to the Pope,” could say, much less maintain, that Nature (God)\r\ndid not intend the Rent of Land—Land values—for the use and the support\r\nof human Governments. I hope you will honestly “read, mark, learn and\r\ninwardly digest” George’s works. You then would see and own that “The\r\nLand Question is the Labor Question” and far more important than “The\r\nMoney Question,” serious though that certainly is.

But there it stops, and as long as it stops there it will,\r\nin my humble judgment, eventuate in no permanent good to the great body\r\nof our citizenship today so sorely in need of deliverance from the\r\nwealth-absorbing institutions and processes of these U.

What is money? It is nothing\r\nmore than a little glittering dirt, taken from the bowels of the earth\r\nby man, rolled in little flat round pieces, and given the name of money.\r\nAnd we, who consider ourselves civilized, allow that glittering dirt to\r\ninfluence us far more than principle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _A.

I don’t know which\r\nto admire most—the principles it advocates or the brilliant manner in\r\nwhich they are presented. I hope some day to be able to read “The Life of\r\nNapoleon,” “The Life and Times of Thomas Jefferson,” and “The Story of\r\nFrance” by the editor of the Magazine. I will say though, that I believe\r\nif all the reforms advocated by the Populists (who are nothing more or\r\nless than real Democrats) and the best plank in the platforms of the two\r\nold parties that do not conflict with the former, were adopted into law,\r\nthat the condition of the lower strata of society would be benefited very\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\nThe reasons therefor would take up too much space in this letter but\r\nthey are ably set forth in “Progress and Poverty” by Henry George, and\r\nin chapter nine, Social Statistics. In one of the early editions by\r\nHerbert Spencer, George’s remedy, explained in a few words, provides\r\nfor confiscating rent for the purposes of governmental expenses and\r\nabolishing all taxation on labor. If anyone thinks the above change\r\nwould hurt the farmer, he should read what Tom Johnson, the Mayor of\r\nCleveland, O., has to say on the subject. A perfect monetary system and\r\na transportation system run at cost, would only make much more wealth to\r\nbe absorbed by the earth owners. The writer has been a loyal member of\r\norganized labor (Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers) since 1872, and he\r\nhas come to the conclusion that no permanent relief can be expected in\r\nthat direction even without taking taxation from productive effort.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _M.

In the way\r\nof reformation there are many obstacles to change our governmental\r\naffairs by a vote of the people. They seem to be hypnotised by the great\r\nmoney power of corporations. The press is almost entirely subsidized.\r\nThe reader gets but one side of the question discussed by writing or\r\norations. Each candidate of his party makes his speeches without joint\r\ndebate, generally, and the result—but very few have but a vague idea of\r\npresent conditions. Today is my birthday.

E. W., Ohio._\r\n\r\nIn the January number of WATSON’S MAGAZINE, among the items of home news\r\nfrom November 9 to December 7, I notice that the Standard Oil Co. raised\r\nthe price of refined oil ½ cent a gallon. That is equivalent to 21 cents\r\na barrel. That was only one half of the story. They dropped the price of\r\nCrude Oil at the same time 3 cents a barrel, or from $1.61 to $1.58 per\r\nbarrel, and not a paper or a magazine in the country as far as I have\r\nseen has a word to say about it. I do not think it of any use to comment\r\non it to you. I have no idea you knew of it, or you would have been after\r\nthem with a hot stick.\r\n\r\nOn page 268 in commenting on John D., you say he is the man who compelled\r\nthe railroads, etc. It has always been a surprise to me that some of our\r\nstatesmen as well as Ida Tarbell, Tom Lawson and other writers, talk\r\nabout the Standard Oil Company compelling the railroads. I have had\r\ntwenty-five years’ experience in the business and I say it is nothing of\r\nthe kind. _The railroads are the Standard Oil Co._ Rockefeller, as far\r\nas the oil business and the railroads are concerned, is only a _stool\r\npigeon_. If you want proof of it look at Pullman. When Pullman was alive\r\neverything was Pullman. When he died it was found he had only a one-sixth\r\ninterest. If he could make the money he did on his one-sixth interest,\r\nwhat must the gang back of him have made? Now oil can be carried cheaper\r\nfor long distances by rail than by pipe-line. What is the use of talking\r\nabout the railroads being compelled? I do not believe this country has\r\nany more idea of what it is up against than a lot of babies.\r\n\r\nI should like to see you. I know you are in New York often. Some time\r\nwhen I am in the city I will call at your quarters and see if you are\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Reddin Andrews, A. M., Tyler, Tex._\r\n\r\nI have read every number of WATSON’S MAGAZINE. It is immense. There is\r\nnothing like it in the whole realm of literature. It is the only magazine\r\ndealing with political, social and economic questions, that tells the\r\nwhole truth. It is the only one that is in position to afford indulgence\r\nin such a luxury as telling the whole truth.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that WATSON’S MAGAZINE has met with greater favor than you\r\ncould have anticipated. I wish that it had a million subscribers. I do\r\nnot now take time, nor tax your patience by reading further, to mention\r\nsome special excellencies of the Magazine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _A. C. Ditty, Appleton City, Mo._\r\n\r\nAm still a Populist, but Populists are few here. The most of them got\r\nsuch a dose of Bryanism in ’96 that it killed the most of them and that\r\nwas just what Bryan and his bunch wanted, and it worked well in these\r\nparts; yet some of the fools say Bryan is a good Populist. If Bryan is a\r\nPopulist, I am not—no, not by a d—n sight! He stands for anything to get\r\na big name and make a big blow. That’s all, and if the Populists ever\r\nexpect to do anything they must let such cattle as W. J. alone. Nothing\r\nin him but wind and not Pop wind either. He is plumb full of plut. wind\r\nand that isn’t good for a Populist; or that is my view of the orator from\r\nthe Platte. I hope to see a new revival along Populist lines in the near\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nI will try to convert some of the old fellows. They all admit we are\r\nright, but yet they still vote the old ticket. That is mighty poor logic.\r\nThe great trouble, as I see it, is this. The prejudice that grew out\r\nof the War still sticks in the people, and as long as the Democrats and\r\nRepublicans can hold the reins, just so long will that prejudice remain\r\nwith the people either one killed. I was a Confederate soldier but I have\r\nno love for either of the old parties. I claim it was the war Democrats\r\nthat licked us Johnnies—no, not licked, but overpowered us.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _H. N. Holmes, Hemple, Mo._\r\n\r\nI am one of the charter members of your Magazine and I have been handing\r\nit out to some mighty good men for them to read. I am forty-eight years\r\nold and have read a heap and I believe that I will be inside of the truth\r\nwhen I say that there is more good sound sense in one of your Magazines\r\nthan in all of the newspapers that I ever read outside of the _Missouri\r\nWorld_ and the paper that you used to publish. I took it as long as you\r\nran it. I have followed you ever since you were in Congress. I got a\r\ncouple of your campaign books at that time, voted for you every time I\r\ngot a chance to. I would rather cast ten thousand votes for Tom Watson\r\nthan one for the sainted Bryan. I wouldn’t give Tom Watson for all the\r\nBryans that could stand on Nebraska soil. I don’t think he is good stuff\r\nfor reform, or for the plutocrats either. I will close by saying that I\r\nthink TOM WATSON’S MAGAZINE is the finest in the world, and I have never\r\nseen anything that would equal it for an educator. Give it to them, Tom.\r\nI believe the boys are leaning your way.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _J. L. Reynolds, North Augusta, S.

I have always\r\nadmired Mr. Watson as a writer, and as long as he writes as well as\r\nduring these last two or three years I shall continue to read his stuff.\r\n\r\nI admire some of his politics but am not a third party man, nor am I\r\npopulistic in my views. I am an independent, I presume, or “on the fence”\r\nready to fall in line with an honest party, one foreign to the present.\r\n\r\nI see no reason why the Magazine should not reach into the millions. It\r\nis good enough, fair enough, bold enough, and honest enough to give each\r\nand every one a fair deal. Tell Tom to hit Roosevelt and he’ll please me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _F. C. Gibbs, Waterville, Minn._\r\n\r\nYou are doing splendid work with the Magazine. I was chairman of the\r\nState Central Committee of this State in 1896, the year Bryan ran the\r\nfirst time, and the year he destroyed the People’s Party. When he\r\nswallowed the gold standard, Parker, gold telegram, boots and all, he\r\nlost the last vestige of respect I had for him. He has been weighed in\r\nthe balance and found wanting.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _S. A. Hauser, Winston-Salem, N. C._\r\n\r\nI have never stated to you my position on the money question. You say\r\n“Mr. Hauser seems to think that there is substantially no difference\r\nbetween the Socialist position on money and that taken by the Populist.”\r\nYes, there is some difference. The Pops are wedded to the legal tender\r\nsystem which is the only sane system, too safe and sound and just\r\nfor the exploiters. I am a Socialist and my position is this on the\r\nmoney question. I would have legal tender only till the co-operative\r\ncommonwealth is established. Then I would use labor checks to denote the\r\nprice of a given article. For instance, if it took John Smith 30 minutes\r\nto make a hat, 30M. would be the cost in labor, and hence would be the\r\nprice of the hat. So Dick Jones, who labors 30 minutes and makes a pair\r\nof shoes, could take his time check and exchange it for the hat. In Rev.,\r\n18 chap. and 11 verse, you will find this: “For no man buyeth their\r\nmerchandise any more.” That time is coming and it looks as if it was\r\nnearly here. The Ethics of Socialism are the same as the Bible and are\r\ntherefore right. Therefore Socialism is irrefutable.\r\n\r\nI know the Pops and Soc. ought to unite, but whether they will or not is\r\nthe question. If the Pop Party represents the workingman’s interest then\r\nthe working people in that party and the working people in the Soc. Party\r\nshould harmonize their differences. When they become sensible enough they\r\nwill. The capitalists have laid the example for the workingman. He must\r\ndo or be done forever.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Charles R.

M. Brannan, Guy, Ark._\r\n\r\nI reckon the Lord only knows how much I rejoice while reading the\r\n_Missouri World_ and WATSON’S MAGAZINE, and in each of them see that we\r\nyet have men who have the wisdom and ability to turn on the light and are\r\nnot afraid to do it. Yes, men who are veteran patriots, worthy of all\r\nthe honor that has ever been conferred on them and to whom this American\r\ngovernment will owe lasting praise and gratitude for its salvation.\r\nNow, sir, I don’t believe I have said too much so far and what I say\r\nmore than this is real. I now feel like repeating the words of Paul\r\nJones when asked if he was not ready to surrender, “I have just begun to\r\nfight,” and I tell you the truth when I say that I have been saying this\r\nfor thirteen years. But let me tell you, and all who may see this, the\r\nmeanest, dirtiest thing I have done politically in all these thirteen\r\nyears. Right now some of the Old Guard are ready to say “He voted for\r\nBryan and Fusion.” Well, yes, I did. The fact is I didn’t know as much\r\nthen as I do now and I wanted relief, and I got it. Yes, got relieved of\r\na chance to vote for reform until the last Presidential election when I\r\ngot to vote, and not only to vote but work also for the election of our\r\ngallant, patriotic, country-loving, people-serving and never-surrender\r\nThomas E. Watson. And if it is the Lord’s will I pray that he may not, as\r\nour brave L. L. Polk, fall before the great battle is fought, or rather\r\nfinished, but that he may live to see his ambition realized and all the\r\ndown trodden and corporation ridden laborers and producers once more free\r\nand enjoying the fruits of their labors, and this government once more in\r\nthe hands of the people.\r\n\r\nI have just returned from Foulkner Co., a county south of where I live,\r\nand while there I met one of my old Populist friends and he began to tell\r\nme about receiving one of Watson’s Magazines, and, said he, “It is the\r\nbest thing politically I ever saw,” and, “In a short while after that\r\nthey registered my name as a subscriber and I have been reading it ever\r\nsince.” He then went on to say that Dr. Snoddy of Saltillo has received\r\nthe November number, and said the doctor says it is the richest and\r\nablest political magazine he ever saw. So I see how much good we all may\r\ndo by sending out Populist literature among the people.\r\n\r\nEd. J. Chastain, and I went to work and got 5 subscriptions for that\r\nchampion of the people’s cause. If I was able to I would send, or\r\nhave sent, TOM WATSON’S MAGAZINE to 20 men here in this country. Yes,\r\nand I believe if Congress was creating money and regulating the value\r\nthereof as the Constitution says they should, I would be able to do\r\nthis. Yes, and not only that, but 20 men would have the money if we had\r\na just division of the wealth that we produce, but when I ask a man to\r\nsubscribe for the Magazine he says, “I would love to have it but I am\r\nnot able,” and so it is. So now, you poor man, see where we are at.\r\nThe money changers and money creators have got us now where we can’t\r\nafford to spend a little of the little money, we can get for something\r\nthat will tell us how to find where we are at. I believe the day is now\r\ndawning on our American land. Our great chiefs and hypocritical leaders,\r\nwho have been looking across the briny deep with pitying eyes, are now\r\nbeginning to feel a little muddled and puzzled at the turn things are\r\ntaking on this side, and I feel like the dirt will be finally scraped\r\noff deep enough so that enough of the deceived wealth producers, real\r\ngovernment supporters, can see the greatness of our (Populist) claims and\r\nthe injustice of the favoritism that does now exist as shown up by our\r\nnoble watchmen, and elect men to steer the ship of state once more so as\r\nto save this one glorious American government to the people who pay the\r\ntax to run it. And now, in conclusion, let me say that it seems like we\r\nare doing nothing here in Arkansas; at least it appears so to me. Yet I\r\nthink if we had an organizer to go ahead, that many of the bewildered\r\nDemocrats, and Republicans too, would fall into line and march with us\r\nto victory. I see that Benty has been appointed national organizer. If he\r\nshould see this I hope he will let us know when we may expect him in our\r\npart of Arkansas. I live in Van Buren County.\r\n\r\nI am aiming to take and read and study the inestimable TOM WATSON’S\r\nMAGAZINE just as long as I can raise a dollar to pay for it, and I am\r\ngoing to get all to subscribe for it I can, and sometime in the future I\r\nwant to write something for the benefit of preachers, as there is much\r\ndepending on them just now.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Owens Miller, Gatesville, Tex._\r\n\r\nI have been purchasing the Magazine from our news agent since the\r\npublication began, and have all the back numbers up to and including the\r\nNovember issue. I can’t afford to lose a single issue as I desire to keep\r\nthem for reference in the future. Our news agent sold all of his December\r\nsupply before I called.\r\n\r\nI quit the Democratic party when Cleveland demanded and compelled\r\na Democratic Congress to finish the Republican financial policy by\r\nrepealing the Sherman Silver law, and selling bonds to supply a gold\r\nreserve in the treasury, and I have been a Populist from that day to this.\r\n\r\nOf course, I have been left almost alone since W. J. B. and his followers\r\nappropriated the bulk of our platform timbers and in that way captured\r\nand allured thousands of our good reformers back into the so-called\r\nDemocratic fold, and things have looked gloomy and lonesome around the\r\nold camp-fires most of the time, but I can’t get my consent to undertake\r\nto keep up with the shifting peregrinations of the Democratic band-wagon\r\nunder its latter-day leadership. So I am content to remain with the\r\nfaithful mid-roaders who have had the courage to resist the allurement of\r\nthe fleshpots of modern Democracy.\r\n\r\nI am by profession a lawyer and while I voted the old party ticket and\r\nsupported all of its nominees, regardless of their fitness for the\r\npositions they were running for, I had a good patronage and was doing\r\nfairly well, but when I threw off the shackles and refused to obey\r\nthe party lash, scores of my old friends withdrew their patronage and\r\nsuddenly concluded that I had lost my influence with the courts and\r\njuries of the county, and joined in a hue and cry to ruin my business\r\nand by this means to force me to at least be quiet in reference to my\r\npolitical convictions. Some of my ancestors were Irish and some Scotch\r\nand I was born and grew to manhood in Kentucky, and of course the blood\r\nthat runs in my veins and the atmosphere that I breathed in my young life\r\ncombined has developed a disposition that revolts at coercion in matters\r\nof conscience and the right to speak and vote as I see the right to be.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have lived these things down in a measure, and am still\r\nearning a living for myself and family in spite of persecutions, and I\r\nenjoy the privilege of occasionally reminding the hide-bound Democrats\r\nof their inconsistencies and of asking them what position their party\r\noccupies today and what its position will be in 1908. Of course they\r\ndon’t know just where they are at now and no prophet could afford to\r\npredict where they will be even next year, and so they are mute and can\r\nonly reply by a sickly smile.\r\n\r\nI often wonder how much longer this rotten fabric can hold together. Of\r\ncourse a party with no fixed principles or common policies, can never\r\nsucceed in gaining control of the government machinery and they ought\r\nnot to, for no one can foresee or even surmise what the results would be\r\nwith such a mass of inharmonious elements undertaking at the same time\r\nto steer the course of the ship of state. The Populo-Democrats would\r\npull hard on the oars in one direction and the Republico-Democrats would\r\nstrive to pull the vessel in the opposite direction, and of course the\r\nresults would be “confusion worse confounded.”\r\n\r\nI can see but one way of hope and that comes from the wide-spread\r\ndisposition to condemn crimes in high places, and to break away from\r\npartisan bossisms throughout the land. This may be the breaking of old\r\nparty chains that will ultimately result in independent political thought\r\nand action, and culminate in an era of honesty in the administration of\r\npublic affairs and also in private dealings among men. At least I hope\r\nso.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PUTTERIN’ ROUND.\r\n\r\nBY CORA A.

DECEMBER 29, 1905.\r\n\r\n    _Honorable Thomas E. Watson_,\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\n    (1) Are the Greenbacks all retired, and if so, when retired?\r\n\r\n    (2) Are the Greenbacks legal tenders?\r\n\r\n    (3) Are National Bank bills legal tender paper, and if not, on\r\n    what basis do they have circulation?\r\n\r\n    (4) What is meant by “free coinage” as advocated by silver men?\r\n\r\n    (5) Could the holder of greenbacks during the War convert them\r\n    into Government bonds at their face value?\r\n\r\n    (6) Did the United States Government ever propose to pay the\r\n    National Debt in silver or gold at its option, and when? If\r\n    not, why not?\r\n\r\n    (7) If silver coin is not a legal tender, why do silver dollars\r\n    pass current at their face value, and why do National Banks pay\r\n    out their silver at their counters and refuse to exchange them,\r\n    as is usually the case, for gold?\r\n\r\n    (8) Who determines the value of foreign coins?\r\n\r\n                              Yours,\r\n\r\n                                                             ⸺ ⸺.\r\n\r\nANSWER\r\n\r\n(1) No. $346,000,000 still circulate, much to the annoyance of the\r\nNational Bankers.\r\n\r\n(2) Yes. Except for Import dues and interest on Bonds.\r\n\r\n(3) The law declares that they are “money” and guarantees their payment;\r\nhence they pass as money, but are not, strictly speaking, Legal Tender.\r\nThe basis of their circulation is the Credit of the Government. The\r\npeople have to pay taxes to meet the interest on the bonds in order that\r\nthe National Bankers shall have the vast profit and power of using the\r\nGovernment Credit for their private gain.\r\n\r\n(4) The privilege of taking silver bullion to the mint and having it\r\nturned into coin on the same terms that are granted to the owners of gold\r\nbullion.\r\n\r\n(5) Yes.\r\n\r\n(6) The Public Debt, at the time it was contracted, was payable in lawful\r\nmoney. The same motives which led the money-Kings to impair the credit of\r\nthe Greenback with the “Exception Clause,” led Congress to change the law\r\nto the effect that the bonds should be payable _in Coin_. This of course\r\nmeant either silver or gold, at the option of the Government. Another\r\nstep was taken and the bonds are now payable in gold.\r\n\r\n(7) Because, under the rulings of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Gold\r\nReserve can be drawn upon to keep silver and paper currency up to the\r\nGold Standard. I presume that National Bankers prefer to keep their gold\r\nbecause it is the money of final payment.\r\n\r\n(8) Commercial usage, and the banks. Foreign coins have no legal status.\r\nTheir value and currency is a matter of private agreement.\r\n\r\n                                       NEW YORK, DECEMBER 24, 1905.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Honorable Thomas E. Watson, Thomson, Ga._\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR: In your “A Call to Action” in January issue, you have\r\n    forstalled my wish, in part only.\r\n\r\n    As soon as a reasonable number respond by sending their names\r\n    to Mr. Forrest, I want you to sink all personal desires by\r\n    asking Messrs Hearst, La Follette, Folk, Douglass of Mass.,\r\n    Johnson of Minn., Garvin of R. I., and such other men as you\r\n    know to be loyal and true, and insist upon their coming to the\r\n    conference, as it is high time that all good men and true,\r\n    combined to destroy the Grafters.\r\n\r\n    This meeting should be held about the time of debate on the\r\n    question of opening of the ballot boxes in New York and having\r\n    a fair count; this will give us a chance to hang the members of\r\n    the Legislature who refuse to give us an honest count of the\r\n    ballots cast on November 7th last.\r\n\r\n    Every leader like Hearst, Folk, La Follette, and possibly\r\n    Watson—et al, has the Presidential Bee in his bonnet, and each\r\n    is afraid that the other fellow will get it; but do you not\r\n    agree with me, that in a issue like this, all personal feelings\r\n    should be secondary? Let us by some means get all of these men\r\n    to line up at the conference.\r\n\r\n                         Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                                                               ⸺ ⸺.\r\n\r\nANSWER\r\n\r\nYes: I fully agree with you. The Presidential Bee which buzzes in my\r\nbonnet is a feeble little thing, and with the help of a few stalwart\r\nfriends I think it can be controlled.\r\n\r\nI am willing to line up any time.\r\n\r\nYes: I looked into your book and think it is great. As you say it is the\r\nonly book which intimates that there are two sides to Fire Insurance.\r\n\r\nI have been thinking here of late that it is highly probable that some\r\nFire Insurance Companies are grander rascals than some Life Insurance\r\nCompanies. Your book deepens that suspicion. $25.00 is little enough for\r\nthe book.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                 MILLEDGEVILLE, GA.\r\n\r\n    _Hon. Thomas E. Watson, Thomson, Ga._\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR: Will you please answer the following in the\r\n    Educational Department of your Magazine?\r\n\r\n    (1) Where can I get a McEllicott’s “Debater?” I have been to my\r\n    book store and they haven’t got it, and do not know where to\r\n    order it from.\r\n\r\n    (2) I want to be a first class lawyer, and I want to know if\r\n    it would be better to go on and get a High School and College\r\n    education, and have all of those dead languages to learn, or\r\n    get a High School education and read and learn all necessary\r\n    studies at home, and state what books and where I can get them,\r\n    which to study first, second, third and all the rest until I\r\n    have finished my course.\r\n\r\n                        Yours for success,\r\n\r\n                                                               ⸺ ⸺.\r\n\r\n    P.S.—Is there any use of studying ancient history?\r\n\r\nANSWER\r\n\r\n(1) I find that McEllicott’s Debater is out of print, but if you will\r\nsend fifty cents to F. E. Grant, 23 West 42nd street, New York City, he\r\nwill mail to you an excellent, up-to-date book which covers about the\r\nsame ground as the McEllicott Debater.\r\n\r\nMr. Grant is an unwearied, indefatigable, never-say-die bookseller, and\r\nhe makes a speciality of getting all sorts of books for all sorts of\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n(2) Get a thorough High School Education and let the dead languages go\r\nto thunder. If you want to learn any other language than English, study\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\nP.S. Yes: there is a good deal of use in studying ancient history. It is\r\nworth a great deal for a man to have a clear general idea of what was\r\ndone on this earth before he got here.\r\n\r\nYou don’t want to feel bad because of your ignorance when gentlemen with\r\nwhom you may be talking refer to Semiramis, Alcibiades, Cyrus, Alexander,\r\nCæsar and the rest of those ancient celebrities. Oh, yes: read up on\r\nhistory, ancient and modern, so that when you associate with intelligent\r\npeople you will know what they are talking about.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                  BELFAST MILLS, VA., Jan. 1, 1906.\r\n\r\n    _Hon. Thomas E. Watson, Thomson, Ga._\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR: What are some of the distinguishing features of the\r\n    “Code Napoleon?”\r\n\r\n    Which do you consider the half-dozen most important and\r\n    significant events in the history of the world in 1905? Ditto\r\n    in the history of the United States for 1905?\r\n\r\n    Who were the ten or twelve greatest statesmen in the South\r\n    during the Reconstruction Period?\r\n\r\n    Dividing the history of the United States from 1860 to 1905,\r\n    into epochs, what periods would you name?\r\n\r\n    Does not Roosevelt’s administration mark a new period or epoch?\r\n\r\n                           Yours truly,\r\n\r\n                                                               ⸺ ⸺.\r\n\r\nANSWER\r\n\r\n(1) To answer with any fulness would require more space than we can now\r\nspare. The Code Napoleon follows, in a general way, the Roman Civil Law,\r\nwhile most State Codes in the United States are founded upon the Common\r\nLaw of England.\r\n\r\n(2) The war between Russia and Japan; the separation of Norway and\r\nSweden; the defeat of Clericalism in France; the quasi-alliance between\r\nGreat Britain and France; the overthrow of the Tory ministry in England\r\nand the appointment of a Labor Agitator as a member of the Cabinet; the\r\n“butting in” of the German Emperor in Moroccan affairs; the labor and\r\npeasant revolutionary movements in Russia.\r\n\r\n(3) The Hearst campaign in New York City; the Roosevelt peace; the Life\r\nInsurance revelations; the Lawson articles on Frenzied Finance; the\r\nPresident’s declaration for Federal regulation of railways; the set-back\r\nto political Bossism in the State and City elections last Fall; the\r\nestablishment of this Magazine.\r\n\r\n(4) Zebulon Vance of North Carolina; George G. Vest of Missouri; L. Q. C.\r\nLamar of Miss., John. T. Morgan of Ala., Benj. H. Hill of Ga.; James Z.\r\nGeorge of Miss.; Roger Q. Mills of Tex.; James B. Beck of Ky.\r\n\r\n(5) The War Period is a distinct epoch; the Reconstruction Period is\r\nanother, and this period may be said to have ended when President Hayes\r\nwithdrew the troops from the South.\r\n\r\nThe election of a so-called Democrat (Cleveland) over a Republican\r\n(Blaine) may also be said to have marked the advent of another epoch.\r\n\r\nThe McKinley-Mark Hanna dispensation was also an epoch and will take\r\nits place in history as the high-water mark of class-legislation, Trust\r\nmaking and rotten politics.\r\n\r\nYes; Roosevelt seems to be making himself an epoch—just what sort of one\r\nneither he nor anybody else seems to know.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Hon. Thomas E. Watson_,\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR: Would you kindly inform me through your Educational\r\n    Department:\r\n\r\n    Whether there has been adopted by any nation the 8 hour law?\r\n\r\n    And what change would have to be made in our Constitution to\r\n    put such a law into effect in this country?\r\n\r\n    Thanking you in advance for the desired information.\r\n\r\n                           Respectfully,\r\n\r\n                                                               ⸺ ⸺.\r\n\r\nANSWER\r\n\r\nNew Zealand has what is practically the 8 hour law. In other words, from\r\none end of the colony to the other 8 hours is recognized as the Standard\r\nWorking Day, both in public and private service.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, 8 hours is the legal working day on public works.\r\n\r\nNo change would have to be made in our Constitution to make such a law\r\ngeneral in this country.\r\n\r\nCongress and the States have just as much legal right to make an Eight\r\nHour Day as they have to make a Thanksgiving Day, or other Holiday.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                      ROCKHAM, S. D., Jan. 1, 1906.\r\n\r\n    _Hon. Thomas E. Watson, New York._\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR: There it is, in WATSON’S MAGAZINE for January 1906,\r\n    page 276. Report of Wm. H. English; “a large sum to our credit\r\n    for lost and destroyed bills.”\r\n\r\n    Now the question I would ask—tried to ask once before,\r\n    but failed to make it plain—is: By whose authority and to\r\n    what extent or per cent. do National Banks profit by bills\r\n    _supposed_ to be destroyed through the carelessness of you and\r\n    I and others, not accustomed to handling money?\r\n\r\n    We know many bills _are_ lost, and it seems to me that, if the\r\n    value cannot be restored to the original losers, it ought to\r\n    result in profit to the general public, the Government. Why\r\n    should the bank get any credit, did I not have to pay them for\r\n    my loan?\r\n\r\n                                                               ⸺ ⸺.\r\n\r\nANSWER\r\n\r\nReferring to page 108 of November number of the Magazine, I find that our\r\ncorrespondent was informed that the Government made good to the National\r\nBanks all old notes which were worn out, mutilated or destroyed, and that\r\nthis was done by virtue of Section 24 of the National Bank Law.\r\n\r\nI really do not know how to give a plainer answer.\r\n\r\nOld bank notes which become worn out, mutilated, or destroyed are\r\nreplaced by new notes. The Comptroller of the Currency issues the new\r\nnotes under and by virtue of the law. The entire National Bank act is a\r\ndisgrace to the Statute Book, and section 24 is simply one of its clauses.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                 PASSAIC, N. J., DECEMBER 17, 1905.\r\n\r\n    _Hon. Thomas E. Watson, New York._\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR: Every month your Magazine grows better and your\r\n    editorials are great in their unborrowed simplicity, power and\r\n    naturalness, and in their humble consciousness of truth and\r\n    right.\r\n\r\n    (1) _But how do you manage to call Napoleon a Democrat?_ I\r\n    reverence the word Democrat, it is my religion as well as\r\n    my politics, and I don’t like to hear such an unquestioned\r\n    authority as you call him a Democrat. It will be an interesting\r\n    article, I think, if you answer my objection.\r\n\r\n    (2) In an answer to a correspondent in regard to the best\r\n    English histories _you omit the favorite_—my favorite—and I\r\n    think the best—John Richard Green’s _Shorter History of the\r\n    English People_. _Why did you omit it?_ Another interesting\r\n    article.\r\n\r\n    (3) I can’t understand what you mean by saying that the “cry\r\n    of the people ground down by their masters, was what brought\r\n    Napoleon back from Elba.” I have read your history of Napoleon,\r\n    too. _Was it not solely his ambition, and he saw in the\r\n    disaffection of the people a chance to swell his armies?_\r\n\r\n    Let me congratulate you on Clarence Darrow’s story. It has the\r\n    element that made Burns and Wordsworth.\r\n\r\n    Please accept my congratulations. Wishing you a Merry Christmas\r\n    and you and your Magazine a Happy and Prosperous New Year.\r\n\r\n                         Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n                                                               ⸺ ⸺.\r\n\r\nANSWER.\r\n\r\n(1) I call Napoleon a democrat because he made war upon caste and\r\nprivilege, upon Kings and aristocracies, and because he favored universal\r\neducation, equal opportunities for all, and equal rights for all.\r\n\r\nIn judging any man, great or small, you must allow for environment.\r\n\r\nBorn in Corsica, and coming to France to be educated for the army in a\r\nroyal school, Napoleon could hardly be the kind of democrat the average\r\nAmerican boy so naturally becomes.\r\n\r\nFrance was ruled by a King and aristocracy, just as other European\r\nnations were. Monarchical institutions, hundreds of years old, stood on\r\nevery hand.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution crashed through them all, and prostrated them all, but\r\nthe Revolution could not sustain itself. Reaction set in, and there was\r\ndanger of a Bourbon restoration.\r\n\r\nNapoleon struck in at “the psychological moment,” and became the people’s\r\nKing. Personally he became despotic, but _his work_ was always democratic.\r\n\r\nI call him a democrat because he made it possible for the poorest boy in\r\nFrance to advance to the highest pinnacle of glory; because he lifted\r\nthe boycott against men of obscure birth and made _merit_ the test of\r\ndistinction; because he abolished the outrageous privileges of feudal\r\nnobility in every part of Europe which came under his control; because\r\nhe rebuked the bigotry of priesthood and punished a clerical Ass who\r\nhad insulted the corpse of an actress; because he scornfully repulsed\r\nthe flatterers who wished to “make up” a fine ancestral tree for him,\r\nand proudly dated _his_ nobility from the date of his first great\r\nachievement; because he studied to improve the condition of the common\r\npeople; because he tried to make school-teaching practical—that is he\r\ntried to have his schools fit every boy for the career which _that_ boy’s\r\ntalent was suited for; because he equalized taxation; because he based\r\nhis administration and his Code upon the broad righteous principle of\r\n“Equal Rights for all and special privileges for none.”\r\n\r\n(2) An oversight. Green’s “Short History” is a classic and every library\r\nshould contain it.\r\n\r\n(3) The Bourbons had broken the pledges which they had made as a\r\ncondition precedent to their being restored. Not until Talleyrand and the\r\nother traitors had besought the help of the Czar Alexander, would Louis\r\nXVIII even go through the form of granting the reforms which had been\r\npromised.\r\n\r\nWhen the Allied armies withdrew, the Bourbon reaction set in with a\r\nheadlong rush. The veteran soldiers of the army were affronted brutally\r\nby young aristocratic officers who had never smelled gunpowder.\r\nNapoleon’s officers who had won renown on scores of battle-fields were\r\ncontemptuously maltreated. The _wives_ of the officers were snubbed by\r\nthe high-born dames of the old nobility.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary and Napoleonic system was being uprooted in various\r\ndirections, and _the people_ of France realized that the Bourbons\r\nmeant to restore the Old Order with all of its brutal inequalities and\r\ninjustice and oppression. _The people_ saw that the Bourbon restoration\r\nmeant once more the galling chains of _the noble and the priest_. Hence,\r\nwhen Napoleon came from Elba, the masses of the French hailed him wildly.\r\nThey followed him with mad cries of “_Hang the priests!_” _The Masses_\r\nclamored for arms, asking to fight and die for _The Man_, Napoleon. Even\r\nafter Waterloo, they clung to him frantically, tumultuously rallying\r\nto him, and begging him to give them guns. Had Napoleon frankly thrown\r\nhimself into the hands of the masses of the French people, he could have\r\nhung the Talleyrands, Fouchés and Marmonts, and driven the Allies out of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nBut Napoleon was a soldier of the Military Academy. He had no faith in\r\nthe fighting quality of “the mob.”\r\n\r\nAnother hundred years had to elapse before the Boers of South Africa\r\ncould show to the world that if your mob is the right sort of mob, and\r\nhas the best guns, and can shoot with the best aim, it can knock your\r\npainfully disciplined army into a cocked hat.\r\n\r\nYes: Clarence Darrow is a writer of marvelous power. Read his “An Eye for\r\nan Eye,” and you will realize that the Chicago lawyer has all the genius\r\nof Tolstoy when it comes to making a story of thrilling interest out of\r\nthe commonest human materials.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                    VAN DYCK, TENN.\r\n\r\n    _Hon. Thomas E. Watson_,\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR: I have seen it stated that the working people of\r\n    this country make or create $7 worth of wealth for each day\r\n    in the year. For every man engaged in gainful pursuits do the\r\n    statistics justify such a statement. If so, we do not get our\r\n    share. My father is a very great Populist and I aim to make\r\n    some speeches in the future and will take it as a very great\r\n    kindness if you will let me know if I will be perfectly safe in\r\n    making that declaration.\r\n\r\n    Thanking you in advance I remain your great admirer.\r\n\r\nANSWER\r\n\r\nThere are 29,000,000 people in this country engaged in gainful pursuits.\r\n\r\nAn author (Bolton Hall) who has devoted much study to our economic\r\nsituation states these producing citizens annually create wealth to the\r\namount of $19,000,000.\r\n\r\nYou can figure out for yourself how much each worker creates. Ten per\r\ncent of our population get almost all the annual production of wealth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                             GRAND PRAIRIE, TEXAS, JANUARY 1, 1906.\r\n\r\n    _Hon. Thomas E. Watson, Thomson, Ga._\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR SIR: A Republican here claims that the tariff shuts\r\n    out the cheap labor of the European countries and on that\r\n    account, the laborers here in our factories get high prices.\r\n    He says that the factories of England pay their laborers\r\n    twelve to fifteen cents per day on account of free trade in\r\n    England. He says children work for five cents per day, and\r\n    railroad engineers get only $4 per month. He says that if\r\n    this country were to adopt free trade, the factories of the\r\n    European countries could come over here and buy our cotton and\r\n    raw products, ship them to England, manufacture them, ship them\r\n    back here and sell them cheaper than our factories could do it,\r\n    and the result would be that our factories would be compelled\r\n    to close down, thus throwing thousands of people out of\r\n    employment. I think his claims are extravagant. I want you to\r\n    explain this fully. I want to be loaded for him the next time\r\n    I meet him, and if I can get “loaded up” on your ammunition, I\r\n    will dead sure knock him out.\r\n\r\n    I have read all you have written about the Bank system and am\r\n    prepared to put up a very fair argument. I don’t understand\r\n    this, Mr. Watson. In a recent issue of your Magazine, you say\r\n    there is no reason on earth why the Government should not loan\r\n    the money direct to the people instead of the 5000 bankers.\r\n    Please explain fully just how this could be done. How much\r\n    per share did Cleveland get for the bonds that he sold on the\r\n    midnight deal? I have heard it said that he sold them for $125\r\n    per share.\r\n\r\n    Thanking you for the great work you are doing for the common\r\n    people and with kindest regards to you personally,\r\n\r\n                         I am, very truly,\r\n\r\n                                                               ⸺ ⸺.\r\n\r\n    P. S.—I am a Georgian. I met you personally on two occasions\r\n    at Athens. Perhaps you have long since forgotten me. I would\r\n    consider it an honor to be known by you, and to know you as a\r\n    personal friend. In ’96 I wrote you from Athens for a copy of\r\n    the P. P. P. I had misplaced my copy wherein you showed up the\r\n    littleness of Bill Arp’s school history of Georgia. You sent me\r\n    a copy from Thomson; I have it yet.\r\n\r\nANSWER\r\n\r\nThe Republican who told you those things about English wages did not know\r\nwhat he was talking about. The idea of a railroad engineer getting four\r\ndollars per month, and factory hands being paid five cents per day! The\r\nfigures are so ridiculous that even a Protection-soaked Republican ought\r\nto know better.\r\n\r\nIf high Tariffs benefit the laborer, why is it that workmen get better\r\nwages in free-trade England than in high-Tariff France, Italy and\r\nGermany? If high-Tariffs give the benefit to the laborer why is it that\r\nthe Salvation Army had to save the factory hands at Fall River, Mass.,\r\nfrom starvation, by ladling out free soup? The best paid laborers in the\r\nUnited States are the negroes of the South who raise cotton, a free trade\r\nproduct. The laborer gets a larger share of the cotton he produces than\r\nany employee in any protected industry.\r\n\r\nIn England the wages paid to factory hands are at least equal to those\r\npaid in the United States when the amount of the wage is compared with\r\nthe amount and quality of the product.\r\n\r\nAsk your Republican friend if he does not know that his great Apostle,\r\nJames G. Blaine, made this assertion some twenty years ago.\r\n\r\nThe statement was not denied then and cannot be denied now.\r\n\r\nThere is a huge army of the poor and the unemployed in England, but it\r\nis not due to Free trade.\r\n\r\nIt is the natural result of three things.\r\n\r\n(1) Land monopoly.\r\n\r\n(2) A diabolical financial system.\r\n\r\n(3) The host of non-producers who use the government as a means of\r\ngetting their support and their wealth by oppressing the producers.\r\n\r\nThe Government could easily establish a Bureau of Loans, and could adopt\r\na business-like system of lending money direct to the people.\r\n\r\nThis principle has been put in successful operation in Great Britain,\r\nNorway, Greece and other foreign countries.\r\n\r\nNot long ago, the firm of N. A. Harris & Co., of Chicago, New York and\r\nBoston, put out a Circular offering for sale “Sanitary District of\r\nChicago” bonds to the amount of $500,000. As a recommendation of these\r\nbonds, Harris & Co., declared in the Circular that the United States\r\nGovernment had accepted the bonds as security for Government deposits.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the National Banks have been borrowing the people’s money\r\nout of the Treasury on the faith of these bonds. Of course, the banks\r\npaid no interest.\r\n\r\nNow does it not occur to you that the Government could as well lend\r\nsome of that money to you at four or six percent interest upon security\r\nequally good, as to lend it to a favored few without interest?\r\n\r\nI do not believe that Mr. Cleveland profited personally by the sale of\r\nthe bonds. He acted stupidly and he acted in violation of law. The whole\r\ntransaction had an ugly look because Morgan had recently been his client\r\nand Stetson (who drew the contract) had recently been his partner. But I\r\ndo not think he acted corruptly.\r\n\r\nMr. Cleveland did not get 125 for the Bonds.\r\n\r\nOh, no. He sold them for 103½, and Morgan, Belmont, Rothschild & Co.\r\n_immediately realized_ 112¼.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                  SAVANNAH, GA., December 18, 1905.\r\n\r\n    _Hon. Thomas E. Watson._\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR: I have been a constant reader of your eminent\r\n    Magazine from the first issue and have become converted to your\r\n    Populist principles of which I will stand by as long as I have\r\n    the liberty of voting.\r\n\r\n    Tonight we have organized a club in the city of Savannah, Ga.,\r\n    principally of working men, so that we might study politics,\r\n    and thoroughly understand how to cast our ballot intelligently,\r\n    and for the best of our interest; we think the day is fast\r\n    approaching when if the workingman doesn’t wake up and take\r\n    hold of the reins of government, he will find in the near\r\n    future that his liberties have flown never to be regained. My\r\n    object in writing to you is for information in your Educational\r\n    Department. How would you advise as to the most intelligent way\r\n    to do this?\r\n\r\n    They don’t seem to understand how to get together, and I\r\n    believe you can give us the desired information.\r\n\r\n                           Respectfully,\r\n\r\n                                                               ⸺ ⸺.\r\n\r\nANSWER\r\n\r\nI would advise the reading, by the members of the club, of such books as\r\nthe following: “Politics in New Zealand,” “Poverty,” by Robert Hunter;\r\n“The Menace of Privilege,” by Henry George; “Letters and Addresses of\r\nThomas Jefferson,” recently published by The Unit Book Publishing Co.,\r\nNew York, “Bossism and Monopoly,” by Spelling.\r\n\r\nThese books will not cost a great deal, and they will give you a very\r\ncomplete survey of our political and economic condition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                               WASHINGTON, D. C., January 17, 1906.\r\n\r\n    _Hon. Thomas E. Watson, New York._\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR: As you will notice in the wording of the question\r\n    printed above, which we shall debate with the University of\r\n    Cincinnati, the entire discussion will probably hinge on the\r\n    term “Capitalistic combinations called trusts.”\r\n\r\n    In order to get the consensus of authoritative opinion as to\r\n    what capitalistic combinations are called trusts by those\r\n    who are most competent to use the term intelligently, we are\r\n    taking the liberty of asking the editors of a dozen of the most\r\n    prominent monthlies, weeklies and dailies in the United States\r\n    to give us their definition of this term.\r\n\r\n    Will you, therefore, be kind enough to sacrifice enough of your\r\n    time to state briefly what capitalistic combinations, in your\r\n    opinion, should be called trusts.\r\n\r\n                        Very respectfully,\r\n\r\n                                                               ⸺ ⸺.\r\n\r\nANSWER\r\n\r\nMy conception of a Trust is: A combination of individual or corporate\r\ncapital which practically establishes such a monopoly that it can control\r\nthe output, dictate the price, and crush competition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                BLUE HILL, NEB., November 29, 1905.\r\n\r\n    _Hon. Thomas E. Watson._\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR: I am a regular reader of your Magazine, having bought\r\n    the first one ever sold in our town. I like it very much. It\r\n    speaks my sentiments better than I know how to express them\r\n    myself. I have never heard but one thing said against your\r\n    Magazine—one party thought you were a little hard on the darky.\r\n\r\n    I want to ask one question. If you were elected President of\r\n    the United States, and had a House and Senate of your own\r\n    faith and political belief, and you were to abolish the gold\r\n    standard and the national banks, what effect would it have upon\r\n    the country? Would not the banks totter and fall and ruin many\r\n    depositors? Banks have become a necessity. In your message to\r\n    Congress, what kind of banks and what kind of money would you\r\n    recommend?\r\n\r\n    At present, corn husking is the issue of the day, but that will\r\n    soon be over. Then I will take your subscription blanks and\r\n    go out among the farmers and see what I can do for the best\r\n    Magazine on earth.\r\n\r\n                        Yours respectfully,\r\n\r\n                                                               ⸺ ⸺.\r\n\r\nANSWER\r\n\r\n(1) I don’t think I have been “too hard on the darky.”\r\n\r\nDoctor Booker Washington, spoiled by too much praise, got too gay in his\r\nstatements concerning the rapid progress of the negro in civilization.\r\nThe Doctor’s idea seemed to be that as soon as you caught a young\r\nAfrican, washed him, combed him, put clothes on him, and taught him how\r\nto read, write and cipher, he was at once civilized.\r\n\r\nI knew better than this, and the Doctor does now. He will be more\r\nparticular how he claims superiority for the negro race, hereafter.\r\nEspecially since his brethren in Santo Domingo have given that “Republic”\r\nanother push hellwards.\r\n\r\nOn that island, one of the most favored spots on the globe, the negroes\r\nhad the advantage of beginning with an elegant civilization which the\r\nFrench had taught them.\r\n\r\nThe negroes expelled the French, set up a government of their own, and\r\nthe record of their _republic_ has been one of the foulest blurs on the\r\nhistory of the human race. They get worse and worse and worse. There are\r\nnot a sufficient number of whites in Santo Domingo to keep the negroes\r\nstraight: in this country there are. _That makes all the difference._\r\n\r\n(2) If I were President and could do away with the Gold standard,\r\nrestoring the currency to the constitutional status, depriving the\r\nNational Banks of the privilege of creating paper currency, and\r\nexercising that power directly by the use of Treasury Notes, why should\r\nthe banks “totter and fall?”\r\n\r\nA good many of them have tottered and fallen; many more of them are going\r\nto “totter and fall.” Why? Because the system is rotten. Thousands of\r\nindividual banks and bankers are as sound as gold dollars, but the system\r\nisn’t, for the reason that too much bank-made currency, of various sorts,\r\nis afloat; the line of credits has been lengthened until it is about\r\nto snap; wild-cat speculation is rampant; and thousands of banks are\r\ndabbling in business which isn’t legitimate banking.\r\n\r\nI am in favor of Banks of Deposit and Discount—so long as we cannot get\r\nPostal Savings Banks.\r\n\r\nBut I am opposed to Banks of Issue—that is, banks which issue their\r\npromises to pay and get rich on what they owe. These are the National\r\nBanks. Render to Cæsar the things which are Cæsar’s; restore to the\r\nGovernment the sovereign power of issuing paper currency.\r\n\r\nDepositors would not be endangered by our policy of expanding the\r\ncurrency; the more money in circulation, the more certain the depositors\r\nwould be to get paid.\r\n\r\n(3) In my Message to Congress, I would recommend Postal Savings Banks,\r\nfor the reasons stated in the December issue of this Magazine, page 231.\r\n\r\nThe kind of money I would recommend would be that which the Fathers fixed\r\nin the Constitution, and which the practice of a hundred years seemed\r\nto render “irrevocable”—a system which had the sanction of Washington,\r\nHamilton, Jefferson, Adams, Madison, Monroe, Jackson and Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe Constitutional system of currency, as shown by the law and the\r\npractice of Presidents, and the decisions of the Supreme Court, is\r\n_Silver_, _Gold_, _Treasury Notes_, and the silver dollar was _the unit\r\nof money_.\r\n\r\nCongress sold itself to Bank of England agents, and changed our system of\r\ncurrency to suit European financiers.\r\n\r\nMr. August Belmont, of New York, could tell you how much Rothschild money\r\nhis bank spent to bring about the change.\r\n\r\n_And I hold in my desk sworn evidence that Ernest Seyd, Bank of England\r\nAgent, spent $484,000 for the same purpose._\r\n\r\nThe fight for reform will never stop till you have wiped out that shame,\r\nand have put our financial system back on the sound basis built by the\r\nFathers.\r\n\r\nIf the Corn husking issue has been settled, please hustle for those\r\nsubscriptions if you would make us happy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                  WESTMINSTER, S. C., Jan. 3, 1906.\r\n\r\n    _Hon. Thomas E. Watson, Thompson, Ga._\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR: I am very much interested in the Educational\r\n    Department of your excellent Magazine, and glean much valuable\r\n    information from it.\r\n\r\n    The inductive or interrogatory style, so often and\r\n    advantageously used by yourself in your editorials, is the\r\n    best method of teaching on any subject. Questions are easily\r\n    asked—any one can do this.\r\n\r\n    Answering is sometimes more difficult.\r\n\r\n    (1.) If National Banks should be abolished, and the Government\r\n    issue the money used by the people, how would it be put in\r\n    circulation?\r\n\r\n    (2.) If the National Banks were abolished, would it not be a\r\n    matter of convenience in business transactions, be necessary,\r\n    to have private banks?\r\n\r\n    (3.) Can you furnish back-numbers, from the beginning of your\r\n    paper?\r\n\r\n    These questions are frequently asked by the common people, and\r\n    some of us are puzzled to know how to answer satisfactorily.\r\n\r\n    Grover Cleveland, I think, once said, that however money\r\n    might be created, the middle-man, by trusts, monopolies, and\r\n    speculations, would take the advantage and oppress the poor and\r\n    needy, just the same.\r\n\r\n    If you think the above questions worthy of notice, please\r\n    answer in your February number.\r\n\r\n    I am glad to note the contemplated improvement in your\r\n    Magazine. I will do my best to get you more subscribers.\r\n\r\n                        Yours respectfully,\r\n\r\n                                                               ⸺ ⸺.\r\n\r\nANSWER\r\n\r\nThe National Banks now have outstanding notes to the amount of\r\n$550,000,000 in round numbers. If the privilege of issuing these notes\r\nas money were taken away from the National Banks, the paper money now in\r\ncirculation would be reduced to $550, 000,000. Suppose the Government\r\nshould issue an equal sum in its own notes to take the place of the\r\nNational Bank notes—how could the Government put its own notes into\r\ncirculation?\r\n\r\n(1) It could _immediately_ put the entire amount in circulation by\r\napplying it to the part payment of the public debt. We are the richest\r\nnation on earth: the richest that history knows anything about—yet we\r\nkeep ourselves mortgaged with a perpetual National Debt because the\r\nfavored few demand bonds to bank on. If National Banks were abolished, as\r\nreal Democracy always sought to do, there would be no further excuse for\r\nkeeping the Bond-Mortgage on the National estate.\r\n\r\n(2) It could put the entire amount $550, 000,000, in circulation\r\n_gradually_ by paying the national expenses with it.\r\n\r\n(3) It could put the money in circulation by building Government\r\nrailroads with it.\r\n\r\n(4) And my opinion is that the whole sum could be benevolently\r\nassimilated by that Panama Canal business which the sleek Cromwell and\r\nhis Varilla unloaded on the impulsive Roosevelt.\r\n\r\nSecond Question: Yes. We wage no war on private banks. As long as banks\r\nconfine themselves to legitimate banking, loans, discounts &c., they\r\nare not a source of national danger. It is only when a certain class of\r\nbankers, like the National Bankers, usurp the Governmental function by\r\nsupplying the country with money, that they are, as Jefferson said, more\r\ndangerous to Republican institutions than standing armies.\r\n\r\nQuestion 3: Yes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                     MEMPHIS, TENN., Nov. 30, 1905.\r\n\r\n    _Hon. Thomas E. Watson, New York._\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR: I am a regular reader of your Magazine, which I find\r\n    very interesting and instructive. I believe in the Public\r\n    Ownership of Public Utilities, but fear that does not go far\r\n    enough to cure the land of the evils that now curse it. With\r\n    Government banks, Government railroads, Municipal Ownership of\r\n    Public Utilities, there would still be that awful strife of\r\n    the many for bread and butter. If we may ride cheaper on the\r\n    “Railhighways,” if we get our Water, Gas, and Electric Light\r\n    cheaper, will not the wages of the workers go down as the cost\r\n    of living decreases? Will not then as now, the “iron law” of\r\n    wages be operative?\r\n\r\n    Please answer in your Educational Department.\r\n\r\n                              Yours,\r\n\r\n                                                               ⸺ ⸺.\r\n\r\nANSWER\r\n\r\nAs the cost of living decreased, the purchasing power of wages would\r\nincrease, and every dollar now paid to Labor would command for the\r\nlaborer a greater quantity of necessaries, comfort and luxuries of life.\r\n\r\nHow could you suppose that the wages of workers will go down when the\r\nmasses of the people wrest the Government out of the hands of the\r\nplutocrats? Public ownership of public utilities cannot be brought about\r\nuntil the people rout the Privileged Few at the polls, when that day\r\ncomes do you fear that _the people_ will cut down _their own wages_ as\r\nthe Privileged Few have done?\r\n\r\nNot many weeks ago the price of cotton advanced. The farmers of the South\r\nhad suffered so long and so much from low prices that they organized. The\r\nresult was a rise in the price of raw cotton.\r\n\r\nHow did the Protected Manufacturers of New England meet this increase in\r\nthe cost of raw material?\r\n\r\nThe Government reports show that the manufacturers have been earning\r\ntwice as much on their invested capital as the farmers had earned. It\r\nwas fair for the farmers to contend for a juster division. Hence their\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturers saw that they would lose a part of the unjust profits\r\nwhich they were reaping from the Protective system, and they promptly cut\r\ndown—their fat dividends?

Watson, New York._\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR: Will you please tell me in your Magazine the\r\n    principal object you had in leaving the Democratic party and\r\n    going into the People’s party?\r\n\r\n    Have the Republican or Democratic parties ever advocated the\r\n    Government ownership of public utilities? If so, which one and\r\n    when? Has that question ever been agitated in Europe? When and\r\n    who by?\r\n\r\n                           Truly yours,\r\n\r\n                                                               ⸺ ⸺.\r\n\r\nANSWER\r\n\r\nMy election to Congress was due to my support of the Ocala Platform of\r\nthe Farmer’s Alliance, and when the Indianapolis Convention of 1891\r\ninstructed all Congressmen so elected to stand by the principles of the\r\nAlliance regardless of the Caucus dictation of political parties, I\r\ndeclined to enter the Democratic Congressional Caucus in Washington.\r\n\r\n(1) I was immediately denounced in the bitterest terms by nearly every\r\nDemocratic paper in Georgia; yet I could not have done otherwise without\r\nbetraying the Alliance-men who had elected me.\r\n\r\nI did not join the Alliance as so many time-servers did; I remained\r\non the outside, but they trusted me so implicitly that I received the\r\nsolid Alliance vote. How, then, could I walk into the Caucus trap, to be\r\nsilenced and tied by a majority vote which was dead against the Alliance\r\ndemands?\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1891, I had held a series of great public\r\nmeetings throughout my District, and these Conventions of the voters\r\noverwhelmingly and enthusiastically instructed me to stand by the\r\nprinciples rather than the party, if the time came when it was necessary\r\nto choose the one course or the other. Then came the organization of the\r\nPeople’s Party, after it had become plain that neither of the old parties\r\nmeant to give the people relief.\r\n\r\nI went with the People’s Party because my election had been due to those\r\nprinciples, and because the same overwhelming majority of Democrats who\r\nhad elected me had gone into the People’s Party, and because I had no\r\nhope whatever of getting the reforms inside the Democratic Party.\r\n\r\n(2) Neither the Republican nor the Democratic party has ever advocated\r\n“Government Ownership of Public Utilities.”\r\n\r\nIn Europe the principle is almost universally recognized and _practiced_.\r\n\r\nGovernment ownership of Railroads is the rule on the Continent. In\r\nEngland the Imperial Government owns the Telegraphs and Telephones. The\r\nGovernment Parcels Post does the work of an Express Company. Municipal\r\nrailroads, telegraphs, telephones, lighting plants, water systems,\r\nlaundries, bathing establishments, bakeries, etc., etc., are in operation\r\nall over Great Britain and all over Europe.\r\n\r\n_We_ are the laggards, we smart folks of the United States. We are the\r\nonly nation of civilized cattle on earth which the Corporations find easy\r\nprey.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                         MILLEDGEVILLE, GEORGIA, December 18, 1905.\r\n\r\n    _Hon. Thomas E. Watson, Thompson, Ga._\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR: TOM WATSON’S MAGAZINE contains more sound principles\r\n    and good common horse sense, (just what the people need) than\r\n    any other paper published in the United States, and I wish you\r\n    would answer the following questions, to wit:\r\n\r\n    (1) Does it not look like the North, East and West are\r\n    determined to adhere to their hellish, reconstruction policy to\r\n    the end of time?\r\n\r\n    (2) What material difference does it make to Georgia, or the\r\n    Common people in her limits whether she has six or eleven\r\n    representatives in Congress?\r\n\r\n    (3) Is it not true that the only material benefit in being\r\n    represented at all in these times, accrues to the fellow who\r\n    draws the five or six thousand salary annually?\r\n\r\n    (4) Is it not true that the Northern, Eastern and Western\r\n    Democrats vote as a unit with the Republicans whenever any\r\n    question affects the South is the issue?\r\n\r\n    (5) Why is it that the Southern Democrats do not stand as a\r\n    unit and vote for whatever is best for the whole country,\r\n    regardless of party, and thereby hold the balance of power in\r\n    the Government?\r\n\r\n    (6) How can the North, East and West be convinced and made to\r\n    understand that the negro lives in the South, is part of the\r\n    South, and that the white people of the South are going to say\r\n    and dictate what the negro’s political and social status shall\r\n    be while he remains in the South?\r\n\r\n    (7) Are there not thousands of white people in every State of\r\n    the Union who are as incompetent to cast a vote intelligently\r\n    as the negro is, and why not reduce the representatives in\r\n    Congress from each State accordingly?\r\n\r\nANSWER\r\n\r\nMy opinion is that a majority of the people of the North, East and West\r\nhave become satisfied to let the South exercise the same right to settle\r\nher domestic affairs that they practice in settling theirs.\r\n\r\nOnly a minority—some members of which try to make up in noise what it\r\nlacks in numbers—cling to the old prejudices, passions, and policy of\r\ninterference. Mr. Ernest Crosby—a hot partisan for negro rights—has\r\nrecently published a “Life of Garrison,” and very boldly admits that\r\nwhile Slavery was wrong the war which was waged upon the South was also\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nTen years ago such a sentiment would have drawn volleys of protest from\r\nthe North, the East and the West.\r\n\r\nThere are no protests now; and I shouldn’t wonder if a majority of the\r\nintelligent people of those sections would admit that while Slavery was a\r\nmoral wrong, that it had been practiced by both sections, given a solemn\r\nConstitutional sanction as a condition precedent to the Union, that the\r\nSouth had a right to withdraw from a voluntary compact whose terms had\r\nnot been kept, and that the war which was made upon her to force her back\r\ninto the Union was a colossal mistake and wrong.\r\n\r\n(2) None whatever.\r\n\r\n(3) It is.\r\n\r\n(4) If it is a question where sectional interest or feeling is\r\naroused—yes.\r\n\r\n(5) Because of the tyranny of party name and party organization. Southern\r\nDemocrats dare not vote independently.\r\n\r\n(6) I think they begin to understand it. The more they see of the negro\r\n_in Mass_, the better they will realize our problem. As long as they seem\r\nto think that all the Southern negroes are as nice and wise as Booker\r\nWashington, they will, of course, find it difficult to get our point of\r\nview of the race question. But they will gradually come to see that there\r\nis only one Booker Washington and that _he_ isn’t doing anything more\r\nthan running a large school which any ordinary white College President\r\ncould run on one half the money which Doctor Washington rakes in—why\r\nopinion will change. The doings of the negroes in San Domingo—where there\r\nare no mean Southern whites to beat, cheat, or lynch them—will also have\r\ninfluence in opening the eyes of the world as to what the negro, _in\r\nMass_, actually is.\r\n\r\nThe idea that the negro is merely a white gentleman whom the Almighty\r\ninadvertently painted black will disappear, in time.\r\n\r\n(7) The “suppressed vote” in some of the states of the Union appears to\r\nbe quite large and the number of illiterate, criminal and incompetent\r\nvoters is likewise great. A square deal would demand that whatever rule\r\nis applied to the South should be applied to the others.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                  IDALIA, COLO., December 29, 1905.\r\n\r\n    _Hon.

Am a member of the Old Guard and I take\r\n    the liberty to ask you a few questions in the line of Populism.\r\n\r\n    (1.) Does England call her navy to a certain point from\r\n    thousands of miles distant to fire a salute on George\r\n    Washington’s Birthday, or that of any of our noted Presidents,\r\n    as we did eighteen vessels a month ago for King Edward? How\r\n    ridiculous for a republic!\r\n\r\n    (2.) Why has not the Census of 1900 been given to the public,\r\n    as were former ones, within two years after being taken? It was\r\n    the disclosures of the 1890 Census that tripled the Populist\r\n    vote in ’92.\r\n\r\n    (3.) Has the $900,000,000 of farm mortgage indebtedness been\r\n    increased or diminished in the ten years following 1890?\r\n\r\n    (4.) Are the free holdings of the people increasing on a ratio\r\n    with the increase of population in these U. S.?\r\n\r\n                         Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n                                                               ⸺ ⸺.\r\n\r\nANSWER\r\n\r\n(1) No.\r\n\r\n(2) You can get the Census Reports of 1900, by spurring up your\r\nCongressman.\r\n\r\n(3) The “encumbered” homes show an increase, as do the “hired” homes.\r\n\r\n(4) No. Concentration of wealth in the hands of a few goes on at a more\r\nfrightful rate than ever. _Five thousand men_ now own one-sixth of the\r\nentire wealth of the Union. One man, J. D. Rockefeller, could buy the\r\nState of Georgia, give it away, and then have enough to buy it back.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                   COOLEDGE, TEXAS.\r\n\r\n    _Hon. Thomas E. Watson._\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR: I received your August number of Magazine. I don’t\r\n    know exactly what it is you propose. It is perhaps the dull\r\n    apprehension of an old hayseed from down at the fork of the\r\n    Creek.\r\n\r\n    (1.) Is the money you propose for the Government to issue to be\r\n    redeemable Treasury Notes, or is it to be absolute Fiat money?\r\n\r\n    (2.) Do you propose the free and unlimited coinage of gold and\r\n    silver at 16 to 1? If not at that ratio, what ratio do you\r\n    propose?\r\n\r\n    (3.) Is it not a fact that from 1792 to 1834 we were\r\n    practically on the silver standard and that after 1834 we were\r\n    practically on the gold standard, and that this change was the\r\n    effect of the change of ratio, made by the act of 1834? Why\r\n    was it that in 1853 the Government coined fractional silver of\r\n    lighter weight in proportion to value than the standard dollar?\r\n\r\n    (4.) You claim for the Government the power to create money. If\r\n    that be so, why clamor for gold and silver only? Let us suppose\r\n    that the United States Treasury is now full of such money as\r\n    you propose, Gold, Silver or Fiat. I want some of it. How am I\r\n    to get it?\r\n\r\n    I agree with you heartily that the making of our Federal\r\n    Government is all out of joint, and I think that it is the\r\n    unwarranted meddling with affairs over which it has no rightful\r\n    control. The remedy, as I think, is _not_ in enlarging and\r\n    extending its powers, for every step taken in that direction\r\n    makes worse conditions possible. Let us say to her in plain\r\n    language: “Thus far shalt thou go, and no farther. Get back to\r\n    the track marked out for you and stay there.”\r\n\r\n    What is here written is in all honesty and in a controversial\r\n    spirit and should you see fit to refer to them, I will be glad\r\n    to have the number.\r\n\r\n    I am not a subscriber now. May be soon.\r\n\r\n    Best wishes.\r\n\r\nANSWER\r\n\r\n(1) Money that is “redeemable” in other money is not my idea of money.\r\nA dollar is not redeemed by swapping another dollar for it. The only\r\nredemption of the dollar which amounts to anything beneficial is when a\r\ndebt, public or private, is redeemed by paying it off in legal tender. I\r\nredeem my promissory note by paying the amount of money it calls for: I\r\nredeem all my other dues and debts in the same way. Nothing is redeemed\r\nwhen a gold dollar is given for a silver dollar, or a metallic dollar\r\nexchanged for a paper dollar. That method of fooling the people will go\r\nout of fashion as the people become educated. All money is absolute fiat\r\nmoney. That is, the law makes the money. God made no money. Nature made\r\nno money. Evolution made no money. The law takes raw material and makes\r\nmoney out of it, just as the lumberman takes a log and makes plank or\r\nshingles out of it.\r\n\r\nThe Government fiat makes gold money, makes silver money, makes nickel\r\nmoney, makes copper money. It would with equal ease and certainty make\r\niron or paper _money_.\r\n\r\nWhenever _the law_ says that a paper dollar shall go just as far, as _a\r\nlegal tender_, as the gold dollar goes, the paper will suit me and you\r\njust as well as the gold.\r\n\r\n(2) Yes.\r\n\r\n(3) No. See page 275, January issue of this Magazine.\r\n\r\n(4) I do not clamor for gold and silver only. We demand the money of the\r\nConstitution which has been taken away from us by venal Congressmen who\r\nwere bribed by Wall Street and the European financiers.\r\n\r\nHow could you get some of the fiat money?\r\n\r\nThis is but another form of the old question of getting the paper money\r\ninto circulation.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways.\r\n\r\n(1) The Government could pay off the National debt.\r\n\r\n(2) The Government could build new railroads, or buy those already built.\r\n\r\n(3) The Government could pay current expenses with it.\r\n\r\n(4) Could build the Panama Canal with it.\r\n\r\n(5) Could establish a Department which would lend it to the people,\r\ndirect, at a low interest, as is done in Europe.\r\n\r\nIn Norway and Sweden the Government lends money to the farmers on\r\ntheir land, on long time, at low interest. These banks have been most\r\nbeneficial and successful.\r\n\r\nIn France and in Russia the Government makes loans upon produce.\r\n\r\nIn Germany the Government bank lends money on land security, directly to\r\nthe land-owner.\r\n\r\nIn Greece, the farmers can get money from the Government banks.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain, the Government lends money to the citizen to buy land.\r\n\r\nThe only reason in the world why our people cannot secure similar\r\nadvantages, is that we are cruelly oppressed by corporation tyranny and\r\ngreed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_In Passing_\r\n\r\nBY LURANA W. SHELDON\r\n\r\n\r\n    A nod, a smile, perchance a word,\r\n        Where road meets road on life’s broad way;\r\n    The pilgrim’s heart with joy is stirred;\r\n        More brightly glows the weary way.\r\n\r\n    A word, a glance, a subtle thrill\r\n        Of sympathy for brother woe,\r\n    And from the fount of human ill\r\n        The sweetest drops of pleasure flow.\r\n\r\n    Though nevermore our paths may meet,\r\n        Nor heart greet heart with welcoming kiss,\r\n    An instant makes the sad world sweet;\r\n        One passing fills the soul with bliss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _HOME_\r\n\r\n_BY Mrs. Louise H. Miller._]\r\n\r\n\r\nLast month I spoke of how easy it is to let a light day tire you as much\r\nas a heavy one. If you can do three-thirds in one busy day why does it\r\ntake all another day to do two-thirds and tire you about as much in one\r\ncase as in the other? Why didn’t you have a third of it for your own\r\namusement or improvement? What became of that third? It is all just\r\nanother proof that it pays to do a thing with all your heart, with all\r\nyour mind, and with all your body. If you had worked as earnestly the\r\nsecond day as you did the first, you would have done the day’s work,\r\nhad a third of it to yourself, and been no more tired than you were the\r\nfirst. It wasn’t because you were lazy—you just “had the time” and put it\r\nall on the daily work instead of taking some of it for yourself.\r\n\r\nI can hear a small chorus of objections to the above. Wait a minute. No\r\none knows better than I that the housework for one day is often different\r\nin kind and amount from that of the day before; that one’s strength is\r\noften not the same two days in succession; that there are extras and\r\nspecials and interruptions; that the baby may sleep most of one day and\r\ncry most of the next; that many things depend on the mother; that some\r\nwomen really have all they can do day in and day out and year after year\r\nand work at high speed all the time until they die of it; that often what\r\nfits one case does not fit another. I know all that. _But the principle\r\nis true!_ And nine times out of ten that principle applied to your own\r\ncase would help you physically, mentally and morally. And those about you.\r\n\r\n“I know all that,” says some one. “There’s nothing new in that.”\r\n\r\nI venture that this person, however well she knows it, hasn’t been\r\n_applying it_. No there’s nothing new in it. That’s just where the danger\r\nlies—it is so old a principle that we forget all about it.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” say a dozen more, “you are right. That person ought to apply it\r\nand profit by it. If we had work like hers we could accomplish a lot by\r\nit. But we haven’t, more’s the pity, and _our_ work is such that we can’t\r\ndo that way with it.”\r\n\r\nThere lies the real trouble. As in everything else, we can see how\r\n_others_ can make an improvement, but when it comes to our own case,\r\nwhy, that is quite different, because this and because that and because\r\nthe other. The funny part of it is that these other people, while they\r\nare blind about themselves as we are about ourselves, can see very easily\r\nhow we could improve matters. Of course other people generally think they\r\ncould improve our methods much more than they really could, but it is\r\nequally true that we think they could improve it less than they really\r\ncould. Two heads are better than one, and it does help to see ourselves\r\nas others see us.\r\n\r\nI don’t believe many busy women can save as much as a third from their\r\nlighter days, but I do firmly believe that nearly every one of you can\r\nsave some part of it. Maybe it is only half an hour, but much can be done\r\nin even that little space several times a week. What we need in our daily\r\nwork is more generalship. Your body is like an army blundering around\r\nwithout a leader unless you guide it with your head. That is what your\r\nhead is for—to save your body and help it accomplish more. The trouble\r\nis that we all get into a rut too easily and go on doing our work in the\r\nsame old way for years. We quit thinking, quit using generalship.\r\n\r\nWhat each of us needs to do many times a year is to sit down and\r\ncarefully consider her own work. Does too much time go to one thing and\r\ntoo little to another? Can we omit any of it without harm to anybody?\r\nIs there some way of doing this duty more quickly without slighting it?\r\nWould such a simple thing as changing the height of the sink, the kitchen\r\ntable, the wash-bench, save time, strength and aching back? Will a plain\r\nshelf or two along the kitchen wall make work easier? Would an hour\r\nspent on a carefully planned rearrangement of the kitchen utensils and\r\nsupplies save many hours during the coming months? There is no end to the\r\nuseless things one can buy for a kitchen, yet there are many appliances\r\nand arrangements that, some in one household, some in another, will pay\r\nfor themselves many times over in a year. Read advertisements, papers,\r\nmagazines—you can glance through the advertisement pages in a very few\r\nminutes—perhaps go to demonstrations by agents of practical devices for\r\nlightening housework. Notice what your friends are using. Look much and\r\nbuy little. But keep yourself awake to new ideas, and now and then when\r\nyou are sure of your ground adopt some of them. Where there is no outlay\r\nof money necessary try frequent experiments, but not many at a time. If\r\nany of your family or friends are of an inventive turn of mind, call them\r\nin for consultation. The most valuable inventions are the simplest ones.\r\n\r\nYou cannot believe all you read or hear about, but you can generally\r\nbelieve your own eyes if you use them carefully. Go to those of your\r\nfriends who seem to manage their work well. If they have any utensils\r\nor appliances that actual experience has proved good investments, note\r\nthem carefully. Maybe you or some of your family can make something that\r\nanswers the same purpose. If not, sleep on the question and if your\r\njudgment still says that it will pay in the end to get it, try hard to\r\nraise the money. Even on a basis of dollars and cents it may pay in the\r\nlong run. And it is generally a question of more than money—a question of\r\nbody, mind and soul.\r\n\r\nNote carefully how other good housekeepers manage their work. There is a\r\npractical study for you! You have probably watched them many times before\r\nthis, but now watch them with seeing eyes.\r\n\r\nTurn your attention to the tasks that burden you heavily. Here reforms\r\nare needed most. You will hardly be ready to assert that you are doing\r\nthese tasks in the very best way in the world. Find out why not, and then\r\ntry to improve on the old method.\r\n\r\nAfter you have thought over your work in general sit down some evening\r\nand plan out the duties of the next day as far as you know them. Forget\r\nhow you used to manage. Maybe you will be able to make only one or two\r\nsmall changes the first time. That is a good beginning. Try again later.\r\nKeep your wits about you and your thinking-cap on all the time. It will\r\npay.\r\n\r\nAs the world grows older it accomplishes more in a given time than it\r\nused to do. They can make a hundred things now in the time it took to\r\nmake one fifty years ago. Are you a part of the world and its progress or\r\nare you something left behind in the onward march? Not your fault? Well,\r\nyou can be pretty sure that it is _partly_ your fault and that you can\r\nremedy some of it if you only will.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_FREE SUBSCRIPTION_\r\n\r\n_Besides the prize for the best story of “heroism at home,” every month\r\nanother free year’s subscription will be given for the best item or\r\nparagraph of any kind for the Department. The two subscriptions will not\r\nbe given to the same person. The subscription may begin with any number\r\nyou please._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSomeone says that the world’s progress doesn’t concern her off in her\r\nlittle corner—that she has her work to do and that’s all there is to it.\r\nWell, perhaps it doesn’t in one way of speaking, but her life is both\r\nless happy and less useful than if she let the world’s progress concern\r\nher a little. She says it wouldn’t help her any in making biscuit or\r\nsweeping the floor if she did know some of the stories of history, how\r\nthe revolution in Russia is getting on, about the great writers and\r\npainters, about anything outside her work. Well, it wouldn’t—in a way.\r\nThe biscuits wouldn’t be any better nor the floor any cleaner. But any\r\none that isn’t half-witted can learn to sweep a floor or even to bake\r\nbiscuits. You are, or ought to be, more than a cook and a housemaid. You\r\nare a _home-maker_, and though good biscuits and clean floors are very\r\nnecessary things in any house, they are _not_ enough to make a _home_\r\nout of it. In a true _home_ there must be mental and moral, as well as\r\nphysical, comfort. You are still something more. You are a woman and a\r\nfree human being. You have your duties to other people, as everyone has,\r\nbut, like everyone, you have a duty to _yourself_. You were given a brain\r\nand a soul, as well as a body. You can easily see the need of feeding\r\nyour body: the need of feeding your brain and soul are equally necessary.\r\nWhy were they given to you? To starve?\r\n\r\nNo pen, however powerful, no voice, however eloquent, can present in\r\nthe full force of its true colors the value of intellectual and moral\r\ndevelopment to the housewife, the woman, the home-maker. Religion is\r\nnot a subject for our Department. The matter of creed is for each one\r\nto settle for herself. But in those questions of ethics and social\r\nmorals that arise in any household and generally have, after all, their\r\nfoundation in religion, and in all those questions of intellectual living\r\nand growth, this Department of ours does have its field and its purpose.\r\n\r\nWhy? Because, as I said, a _home_, a _real_ home, has its moral and\r\nintellectual sides as well as its material side. Because even its\r\nmaterial side, the everyday round of duties, cannot be made what it\r\nshould be unless brain and soul are made fit to direct the body. Because\r\nas wives, mothers, daughters, sisters we are responsible for the members\r\nof our family, and for ourselves as human souls. It is not enough to\r\nbring a child into the world and then feed it, wash it, dress it, give\r\nit a place to sleep, and one day say to it: “We have raised you. Go\r\nforth and make your living.” Of course not. We all know that, though\r\ngoodness knows there are plenty of people who don’t do even that much.\r\nIt is not enough to furnish a clean, warm house and three meals a day\r\nto the bodies of your husband, parents, brothers or sisters. They could\r\nget that much at a boarding-house or hotel. They, and you, must have\r\nmoral and mental food, baths, clothes and beds as well as physical ones—a\r\n_home_—not merely a house. We cannot give what we don’t have. To furnish\r\nthese things to them we must first get them ourselves.\r\n\r\nThen we should give heed to moral and intellectual living and growth\r\nbecause it is our _duty_. There is another reason—because it is for our\r\nown happiness and pleasure.\r\n\r\nIt was once my privilege to go over a thousand or two letters from people\r\nwho, after becoming members of a great and good system of education by\r\ncorrespondence, had written in the fullness of their hearts to tell how\r\nit had made their lives brighter and happier and to thank the school,\r\nnot as much for the knowledge they had acquired from their reading\r\nand study at home, but for the great pleasure and joy the _having_ of\r\nthis knowledge had brought them—for the _new intellectual, social and\r\nmoral life_ that had come to them with it. The letters came from all\r\nover the English-speaking world, but I was most struck by the fact that\r\na large part of them came from housewives. The following is a fair\r\nsample of hundreds from farmers’ wives, laborers’ wives, clerks’ wives,\r\nbusiness-mens’ wives:\r\n\r\n    “Life has been a new thing to me since I took up your course.\r\n    My housework used to be an awful drudgery—a never-ending grind.\r\n    Now it is easy and I do it better, for my mind has _something\r\n    outside to think about_ and be interested in.”\r\n\r\nThe wording wasn’t alike in any two, but, in every one of the hundreds\r\nwritten, there was the same idea—“something outside to think about and be\r\ninterested in.” This was the note sounded in nearly every one of all the\r\nletters from men and women both. Some were women living many miles from\r\nthe nearest neighbor, some were bed-ridden invalids, some factory girls,\r\nsome servants, a few fashionable “society women,” some of the men, lonely\r\nsheep-herders on the Western plains, some naval officers, some this, some\r\nthat, but one and all gave thanks from grateful hearts for a lift out of\r\nthe rut of daily drudgery, for a broader horizon, for greater usefulness.\r\nI cried over some of those letters. They came straight from the heart if\r\never anything did.\r\n\r\nThat was the voice of _experience_, not the voice of theory. What they\r\ncould do, we can do. We are not going to have any study courses or any\r\nlessons to learn. There will be nothing any of us _has_ to do. But I\r\nbelieve each of us is going to think things over, talk it over and then\r\nmake herself some spare moments, if she hasn’t some already, and set to\r\nwork to make life a better thing for herself and those dear to her by\r\ngetting “something outside to think about.”\r\n\r\nHow am I going to bring this about? Oh, _I_ am not going to do\r\nit—_we_ are! I have no idea of going into any house and saying, “Do\r\nthat this way, and do this that way.” All of us are going to help by\r\nmaking suggestions, by giving experiences, by offering interesting\r\nbits of information. It is for you to decide which of these _you_ can\r\nuse. The thing to be desired above all others is that each of us may\r\nlearn to _think for herself_. Many think for themselves very keenly\r\nalready—perhaps more keenly than I do—and these are the very ones that\r\ncan help the rest of us most; but we can all think better, if we all\r\nthink together.\r\n\r\nBy the next number, April, which will come out March 25, there ought to\r\nbe a fair number of questions and suggestions from our readers. Don’t\r\nforget that the best suggestion or bit of information sent in each month\r\nentitles the sender to a year’s free subscription, to any name and\r\naddress desired. And remember that another free year’s subscription goes\r\nevery month to the person, man or woman, who sends us the best true story\r\nof heroic living in common everyday life. The notices elsewhere in our\r\nDepartment give the particulars.\r\n\r\nHow are we going to get “something outside to think about?” Well, there\r\nare plenty of things outside and there are plenty of ways of bringing\r\nthem into our lives. Each of us will find some things and some ways—all\r\nby herself if she will try and then she can tell the rest of us about\r\nthem—but in our Department each month we can take one set of things, see\r\nwhether there isn’t something of value there for us, ask questions, make\r\nsuggestions, try experiments, offer bits of information, talk about it\r\nwith our families, think about it while we are working and while we are\r\nresting or amusing ourselves, bring new things into our lives. I am not\r\ngoing to set up as a teacher and there isn’t going to be any course of\r\nstudy. There is only one thing I claim to know that some of you don’t\r\nknow—that we, any of us, can make our lives brighter and more valuable by\r\nfeeding our minds as well as our bodies. I know this by experience—not\r\nonly by my own experience and that of my two daughters but also by the\r\nexperiences of scores and hundreds of other women I have known and,\r\nperhaps, helped a little. I never talked to anyone in print before, but\r\nfor many, many years, ever since one golden day when I discovered that I\r\nwas actually making my own life happier and fuller and less ugly by an\r\neffort to feed my starving mind in my few spare moments, I have never\r\nmissed a chance to do what I could to show other women how they could\r\nget the same blessing for themselves.\r\n\r\nIn this number we will talk and think about reading and what it can do\r\nfor us if we go about it right. Next month we will consider woman’s\r\ninterest in politics. After that there are many more subjects—flowers,\r\ntrees, gardens, stock, other animals, history and women in history,\r\nbusiness and women in business, painting and women artists, women’s\r\nclubs and study circles, customs of other nations, food, correspondence\r\ncourses, music and women musicians, and hundreds of other subjects. I\r\nwant you to help me select the subjects as we go along.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_IS READING WORTH WHILE?_\r\n\r\n    “In science, read, by preference, the newest works; in\r\n    literature, the oldest. The classic literature is always\r\n    modern. New books revive and redecorate new ideas; old books\r\n    suggest and invigorate new ideas.”—_Bulwer._\r\n\r\nWhat is reading worth to a busy housewife? “Well,” says one, “it may be\r\nworth a good deal, but I haven’t time to find out.” If this woman knew\r\nthere was a twenty-dollar gold-piece to be picked up at the end of a few\r\nminutes walk, would she have time to stop her housework long enough to go\r\nand get it?\r\n\r\nWhat can we get by reading? Maybe only rest, amusement and a “change.”\r\nMaybe this and also some knowledge. Maybe some valuable experience. Are\r\nany of these worth taking time from housework for?\r\n\r\nThere is surely no need of saying that rest, amusement and change are\r\nnecessary in the long run for any kind of work. You save time by taking\r\na vacation. Somebody has said that anyone can do twelve months work in\r\neleven, but that no one can do eleven months’ work in twelve, meaning\r\nthat we can accomplish more in a year by devoting one month of it to a\r\nsensible vacation.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that we can gain much knowledge from books. It is\r\none of the chief sources from which the world gets all that it knows. But\r\nis any of this knowledge worth while for a housewife? If anyone doubts\r\nit, stop and think. How about the Bible, the newspapers, the cook-book?\r\nIs this the only reading from which we can profit? In your own experience\r\nsurely you can recall at least a few other books that told you something\r\nyou were glad to know.\r\n\r\nHow do you get _experience_ from reading? Isn’t it safer to learn human\r\nbeings and their ways by studying them direct? Yes, and no. It depends on\r\nthe book. Perhaps the author can tell you in a few hours more real truth\r\nabout men and women than you can learn alone in years.\r\n\r\nWe have heard so many queer things about “literature” that we are likely\r\nto think of it as fancy things written by a lot of delicate, long-haired\r\nmen and masculine women and having very little to do with our own\r\neveryday lives. Well, there are many over-cultured and over-educated\r\npeople who would define literature that way. But they are mightily wrong!\r\nThe _best_ literature is generally simple, not “fancy.”\r\n\r\nLiterature is the spoken or written record by which each generation\r\nof mankind is enabled to preserve the knowledge and experience of the\r\ngenerations before it and to begin where the last one left off instead of\r\nhaving to begin all over again.\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t matter whether it is written or only spoken. Indeed, before\r\nman invented the alphabet or even learned to transmit his ideas and\r\nfeelings by crude, rough pictures there wasn’t any literature except what\r\nwas spoken or recited. The “Iliad” and “Odyssey” of Homer were sung or\r\nrecited, long before they were put down on parchment. Our fairy-stories\r\nand legends generally date back hundreds and hundreds of years and were\r\npreserved only by each generation telling them to the next. In later\r\ndays, especially during the Middle Ages, many valuable poems and stories,\r\nand even more of history, would have been lost to us forever if wandering\r\nbards and minstrels had not recited or sung them and taught them to\r\nothers. There is no way, except literature, by which we can learn from\r\nthe past. Did you ever think that our generation has, by itself, added\r\nonly a very, very tiny bit to the knowledge existing in the world when\r\nour generation was born? All our great inventions would be impossible\r\nwithout this previous knowledge.\r\n\r\nOf course, literature in its stricter sense is more limited than all the\r\nmaterial covered by the definition above. A dictionary, for example, can\r\nhardly be called literature. A bit of writing or talking to be literature\r\nmust show the imprint of the author’s personality and it must have in it\r\nsomething valuable enough to make it worth preserving. But, in general,\r\nthe definition as given gets at the root of the matter, and that is all\r\nwe need be concerned with. It shows that literature is not a fad or an\r\namusement of too highly cultivated people, but one of the biggest and\r\nmost valuable things in the world. _We_, no matter who or where we are\r\nor even whether we can read or write, are dependent on literature in our\r\neveryday lives.\r\n\r\nHow can we tell good literature from bad? Well, it is often pretty hard\r\nto tell about the books and stories of today, but there is a very easy\r\nway of telling about what was written a hundred or a thousand years ago.\r\nNowadays, when most people can read and write and the printing-press\r\nmakes it possible to produce great numbers of books and papers, there\r\nare thousands of people writing all the time and naturally a lot of them\r\nwrite very poor stuff. We talk about the “best selling books” and go wild\r\nover some new novel. We did the same last month and we’ll do the same\r\nnext month.\r\n\r\n“What is the most popular novel this month?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, ‘So-and-so’ by So-and-so. It’s simply grand!”\r\n\r\n“What was the most popular novel last month?”\r\n\r\n“Let’s see. Oh, yes—‘So-and-so,’ by So-and-so. It’s a perfectly charming\r\nstory.”\r\n\r\n“What was the most popular novel a year ago?”\r\n\r\n“A _year_ ago? Mercy, I don’t know! There are so many novels now.”\r\n\r\nThere it is. All the time people are raving about the “latest” book. Like\r\nas not in a year they can’t even remember its name. Why is that? Because,\r\nhardly any of these books are really _good_ literature. Many of them are\r\ninteresting and amuse us while we read them, but that’s all. In a year,\r\nor less, we have forgotten them.\r\n\r\nThen what _is_ good literature? We can find out this way. Consider\r\nall the books that were written a thousand, a hundred, fifty or even\r\ntwenty-five years ago. How many of them are read now? Comparatively very,\r\nvery few. Now _why_? Because they weren’t good enough. There is a sure\r\ntest for you—if a book lives on after its author is dead and buried you\r\ncan be pretty sure that it is good literature. It had something to say\r\nthat did more than amuse people for a month. The author had put into\r\nit some little bit of _human nature_, of _human life_, that is as true\r\nfor people a hundred years later as it was for those who first read it.\r\n(Mind you, I am talking about novels, stories and plays, about fiction\r\nand poetry, not just about such things as histories which are generally\r\npreserved anyway because of the cold facts in them.) The authors of such\r\nnovels or poems have written into them some of their own experience and\r\nobservation of _life_. The characters in them are real human beings, and\r\nthe feelings, thoughts, passions, sentiments, actions of the characters,\r\nor those expressed by the author without the aid of his characters,\r\nare, in general, the same feelings, thoughts, passions, sentiments and\r\nactions that you and I and our acquaintances have in us today. Therefore\r\nwe understand the people in those books and sympathize with them, even\r\nthough they may have lived centuries ago, in a foreign land, dressed\r\nin strange clothes, bound by strange customs and outwardly having very\r\nlittle in common with us. There is only one thing that people are\r\n_always_ interested in—human nature. It is according to whether a book\r\ngives us a true picture of human nature that it lives or dies, that it is\r\ngood literature or bad.\r\n\r\nWith new books now appearing by thousands it is almost impossible to tell\r\nwhich will live and which will die, which are really good and which are\r\nnot. Time is the only sure test. The men talk about Dr. Conan Doyle’s\r\n“Sherlock Holmes” stories now and some of us women like these tales\r\nequally well, but will they be alive in 1975 or not? Emile Gaboriau died\r\nonly twenty-three years ago. His detective stories are better ones than\r\nDr. Conan Doyle’s, but they are no longer read except by the few. Wilkie\r\nCollins wrote novels that made you hold your breath with interest and\r\nwere widely read. He has been dead only seventeen years, yet already “The\r\nMoonstone,” “The Woman in White” and his other books are of the past.\r\nBoth Gaboriau and Collins have some real merit and will probably always\r\nbe read at least slightly, but what of the thousands of other authors who\r\nwrote books twenty-five years ago and whose very names are forgotten?\r\n\r\nAmong the books that have come down to us from the past we can choose\r\npretty safely. If they have lived this long we can be sure there is\r\nsomething worth while in them. I know a few sensible women, some of them\r\nwith both time and money, who make it a rule never to read any book until\r\nit has been published a year. If at the end of that period it is still\r\ninteresting other people, then they buy it, being pretty sure that it\r\nmust have at least some small merit. They say it is surprising how very\r\nfew books do remain in the public attention that long.\r\n\r\nNow I know just what will happen. Some of you know all I have been saying\r\nas well as I do, but some one is sure to say:\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, that’s all true enough, I suppose, but when I find time to\r\nread, I don’t want to wade through anything heavy.”\r\n\r\nNobody asked you to. Books aren’t “heavy” just because they are good.\r\nThomas Bailey Aldrich’s “Marjorie Daw” and “The Story of a Bad Boy,”\r\nMark Twain’s “Tom Sawyer,” “Huckleberry Finn” and “Innocents Abroad” are\r\ncertainly far, far from being heavy; so are Charles Kingsley’s “Water\r\nBabies,” De Foe’s “Robinson Crusoe;” so are Dr. Brown’s “Rab, and His\r\nFriends,” Ouida’s “A Dog of Flanders,” though both bring tears to the\r\neyes; so are the poems of Robert Burns and Longfellow; so are Æsop’s\r\n“Fables,” the stories of Joel Chandler Harris and Thomas Nelson Page; so\r\nare hundreds of others. Yet all these just named are good literature.\r\nIf by “heavy” you mean only things that are dull or hard to understand,\r\nthe list of good books that are not “heavy” grows tremendously, and\r\nthere are still others that may be hard to understand in places but are\r\nnevertheless interesting enough to “amuse” you all the way through.\r\nShakespeare, George Eliot, Hawthorne, Poe, Tennyson, Stevenson, Dickens,\r\nThackeray, Whittier, Helen Hunt Jackson, Hugh Conway, Bret Harte,\r\nAugusta J. Evans, Louisa M. Alcott and scores besides are more than\r\n“worth while.” If there are now and then dull or difficult pages in some\r\nof them yet they are all the world away from being “heavy.”\r\n\r\nReading for amusement only is much better than not reading at all. We\r\nneed amusement. But there is one danger. If what we read for amusement\r\nhappens to be poor literature it is _not true to life_ and you are\r\nlearning things about yourself and others that are not true and may lead\r\nyou into mistakes some day. You know what dime novels—Wild West and\r\ndetective stories—will do to young people. It isn’t only because they\r\nare exciting and deal with crime, but because they give false ideas of\r\nlife and false ideals. There are thousands of books, apparently harmless\r\nenough, that will hurt grown people as much as dime novels hurt the\r\nchildren. There are plenty of books you can read “just for amusement”\r\nwhich are also very good literature and very good teachers of life. Why\r\nwaste time on the poor ones?\r\n\r\nWhen I say a book is good or bad I am not referring to its morals but to\r\nits merit as literature. A hopelessly poor piece of literature may have\r\nexcellent morals, and a book that is good literature may be very unsafe\r\nfrom a moral point of view. The relation of literature to morals is too\r\nbig a question for me to discuss. Each of us must steer her own course\r\nin regard to this question. It is, however, helpful to remember that if\r\nthe purpose and main lesson of a book are morally good, even though it\r\nmay deal a little with questionable subjects, its reading may tend toward\r\ngood rather than evil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_SHOULD WOMEN BE INTERESTED IN POLITICS?_\r\n\r\nNext month in the April number we will take up woman’s interest in\r\npolitics. Is there any reason for her being interested in them? What\r\neffect do city, state and national laws and law-makers have on her own\r\npersonal welfare or that of her family? If she raises children what\r\neffect does that have on future politics? What two great questions now\r\nbefore the country bear directly on the price she pays for food and\r\nclothing and on the price her husband receives for what he sells or for\r\nhis labor? What about the men the voting members of your family help\r\nelect to the state legislature or the national Congress or White House?\r\n(Perhaps if you live in Colorado, you vote for President yourself.) What\r\nabout the wives and children of these men? What about the candidates who\r\nwere not elected and their families? If there is an election on, ought\r\nyou to know which of the candidates are rascals, which represent wrong\r\nprinciples, which will vote for measures that will make the things you\r\nbuy more expensive? Ought you to use your influence against such men?\r\n\r\nLet us each see who can send in the best reason for a woman’s being\r\ninterested in politics. The answers must be very short, and they must\r\nreach our office before March 10, for the April number, as you know,\r\nappears March 25, and by March 10, at the very latest the printer should\r\nbe working on whatever is to go in it. This seems like working a long\r\nways ahead of time, but the Editor tells me that most magazines by that\r\ntime, will be all done with the April number and working on May or June!\r\nSo you see you will have to write very quickly to be in time.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _THE INTEREST OF EVERYDAY THINGS._]\r\n\r\nWe had a glimpse last month at some of the interesting things connected\r\nwith bread and bread-making. The house is full of things we have known so\r\nlong that we scarcely think of them except as parts of the daily routine,\r\nbut which, if we turn our attention to them, prove veritable mines of\r\ninformation, history, travel and even romance. This month we’ll consider\r\nsome of the things concerned in bread-making.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wheat_\r\n\r\nWheat, for example, takes us all over the earth and back to the days\r\nbefore there was any history at all. Wheat, like our other grains,\r\nbelongs to the Grass Family and its scientific name is _Triticum\r\nvulgare_. It is the most valuable of all the cereal grasses and, next\r\nto maize, or Indian corn, the most productive. Rice is really its only\r\nrival as a human food. It is generally supposed that it originally came,\r\nlike so many of our grains and fruits, from the plains of Central Asia,\r\nbut it has been found that a certain wild grass of Western Asia and the\r\nMediterranean regions, can be cultivated into what we call wheat. It\r\nis the bread-food of most European nations (who, by the way, call it\r\ncorn) and is supplanting maize in America. In our country alone 40 or 50\r\nmillion acres are devoted to it every year, and the yield is a million\r\nor so over half a billion bushels. Generally, one-fifth to two-fifths\r\nof this is sent to other countries. Russia, Canada and other countries\r\nproduce large quantities of it.\r\n\r\nWheat was widely grown in the pre-historic world. As far back as there\r\nis any record of languages there was a word for wheat. We know that\r\nthe Chinese (who knew about gunpowder, printing, glass, spectacles\r\nand many other things centuries before we “invented” them) cultivated\r\nwheat as far back as 2,700 B. C., and regarded it as a direct gift from\r\nheaven. The Egyptians attributed wheat to their heathen goddess Isis.\r\nThe Greeks believed that Ceres, their goddess of agriculture, gave it to\r\nher favorite, Triptolemus, and lent him her miraculous chariot to drive\r\nover the earth and distribute the new grain to the sons of men. There\r\nis a pyramid in Egypt, which scientists estimate was built 3,359 years\r\nbefore Christ was born, more than 5,000 years ago, and in one of the\r\nbricks of this pyramid they found imbedded a little grain of wheat. How\r\nmuch that single grain told the world! The lake-dwellers of Switzerland\r\nand Italy also left traces showing they knew the use of wheat, as did the\r\ninhabitants of what is now Hungary, in the Stone Age.\r\n\r\nThere are more cultivated varieties of wheat than of any other grain, the\r\nnumber running up into the hundreds. New varieties are generally secured\r\nby taking the pollen from tiny flowers of one variety and putting it on\r\nthe pistil of another, so that the resulting seeds, while they take after\r\nboth parents, produce a new variety unlike either of them. This process\r\nof cross-breeding has been made to produce marvelous results not only\r\nin other grains, but in fruits, nuts, flowers and trees, as any of you\r\nwho are familiar with the work of Mr. Luther Burbank, the “California\r\nWizard,” know.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Flour_\r\n\r\nFlour, being generally a product of wheat, has had much the same history,\r\nbut the process of milling has a little story of its own. The earliest\r\nmills consisted merely of two stones, one round, the other hollowed\r\nout. The grain was placed in the hollow and then crunched into small\r\nbits by the round stone. Later on, man thought of putting a handle on\r\nthe round stone, making something like a mortar and pestle. Another and\r\nlater way of improving this crude mill, was to groove the round stone\r\nand make it fit into a fairly deep hole in the under stone, with a place\r\nfor the ground meal to come out. This is called a quern. You have heard\r\nof someone’s being “caught between the upper and nether mill-stones.”\r\nIn Deuteronomy (XXIV, 6,) we find this: “No man shall take the upper or\r\nnether mill-stone to pledge, for he taketh a man’s life to pledge.” In\r\nNumbers (XI, 8), “ground it in mills or beat it in a mortar” shows that\r\nthe children of Israel, knew both kinds of mill, and other passages show\r\nthat they had at least two kinds of meal or flour.\r\n\r\nThe Romans used only the mortar and pestle, and until 173 B. C. the poor\r\nwoman did all the work. Then baking became a regular occupation, and the\r\nbakers were called _pistores_, which means “pounders.” When the Romans\r\nconquered Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Holland, Belgium and Britain\r\nthey took their customs with them. The hand-mill was followed by one\r\nwith animal power, and later by one with water-power. As late as 1800 A.\r\nD. there were to be found in remote parts of Scotland and Ireland crude\r\nmills made of two large stones ground against each other by running or\r\nfalling water.\r\n\r\nThe wheat grain is really not a seed, but a fruit, for it is composed\r\nnot only of the true seed, but of the seed and its husk or covering. The\r\ntwo considered together, make what botanists call a “fruit.” In modern\r\nmilling this husk is generally separated from the seed and made into\r\nbran, while the seed becomes flour. When the two are mixed we have “whole\r\nwheat” flour.\r\n\r\nGood flour, should be a pure, uniform white powder, only faintly tinged\r\nwith yellow, free from grits and lumps, should show some adhesiveness\r\nwhen pressed, should have no smell of damp and moldiness or any acidity\r\nof taste.\r\n\r\nMost flour now, is “new process” flour, made by a gradual crushing\r\nbetween sets of rollers revolved by water-power, steam or electricity.\r\nThe “new process” originated in Hungary and France and began to be\r\ngenerally adopted about 1880.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Yeast_\r\n\r\nYeast is a vegetable. Strange as it may seem, yeast is a tiny fungus\r\ngrowth, though it takes a microscope to see it. In brewing (particularly\r\nwith hops), in wine-making and in any other process of fermentation\r\nwhere the liquid contains some sugar and some albuminous matter, the\r\nclear liquid becomes “muddy.” Then the minute things that made it muddy\r\ncollect into a foaming, bitter mass which is yeast. This yeast has the\r\npower of setting up fresh fermentation when put with other things. It is\r\nfermentation that makes bread-dough “raise.” Oh, yes, there is alcohol\r\nin bread-dough, but it doesn’t stay there. As I told you last month,\r\n12,000,000 gallons of alcohol are made and lost in bread-making every\r\nyear in Germany alone! Some day scientists will learn how to save it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hops_\r\n\r\nWe generally think of hops when yeast is mentioned. I wish any of you who\r\ncan tell us the story of hops would send it in to our Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Salt_\r\n\r\nHow could we cook, or eat, or live without salt? It is an absolute\r\nnecessity for people and animals. Also, it is very valuable as a\r\nfertilizer, and was used as such centuries and centuries ago by the\r\nHindoos and Chinese. Further than this, soda is derived from salt, and as\r\nsoda is necessary in making both glass and soap, these two useful things\r\ncould not be made if it were not for salt. Most of our modern textile\r\nfabrics are more or less dependent on chlorine, which is made from salt.\r\nWe all know how valuable salt is as a preservative for butter, meats and\r\nother animal food, and now they are learning a way to preserve timber\r\nwith it. We know, too, its use in freezing ice cream, but may not realize\r\nhow much it is used for refrigerating other things. In short, even if we\r\ncould live at all without it, life would be pretty miserable.\r\n\r\nThe chemists call salt _chloride of sodium_ and use this symbol for it—Na\r\nCl, which shows what it is composed of, but doesn’t mean anything to me.\r\n\r\nWe get salt in three ways—from rock-salt mines, from natural brine\r\nsprings and from evaporating sea water. The world’s biggest rock-salt\r\nmines are in Gallicia, upper Austria, Bavaria, Hungary, Transylvania,\r\nWallachia; at Vic and Dienze, France; at Bix, Switzerland; at Cadrona,\r\nSpain, and at Cheshire, England. That at Wieliczka in Gallicia is a mile\r\nlong, three-fourths of a mile wide and over a thousand feet deep. Some\r\nof its chambers are 150 feet high—as high as a sky-scraper—and one of\r\nthem is fitted up as a chapel to St. Anthony, the altar, statues and\r\neverything being solid salt. In this mine is a lake 650 feet long and\r\n40 feet deep. There are horses there that have never seen the light of\r\nday, and men, women and children who live in salt houses and never see\r\nthe outside world above their heads. It is a small village buried down\r\nunder the ground. When the emperor and his family visit the mine, it is\r\nbrilliantly illuminated and a grand festival is held in a great hall.\r\n\r\nIn Africa are large beds of salt land, beds of rock-salt and a lake\r\ncovered at times with a shining white crust of pure salt two feet thick.\r\nFrance, Spain, Portugal, Italy and some Mediterranean islands are the\r\nchief producers of sea-salt. In China there are salt wells of great depth\r\nand number.\r\n\r\nIn Spain, France and other countries salt is a government monopoly, and\r\nno one else can sell it. Travelers tell me they have seen salt lakes in\r\nSpain where the people living along the shores were prevented by the\r\n_guardia civile_, or national police, from picking up the salt deposited\r\nin large quantities at the water’s edge. They had to buy it of the\r\ngovernment. The poor use salt sparingly over there even now, and you may\r\nremember that the heavy tax on salt was one cause of the awful French\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nIn our country nearly every state has salt deposits of some kind.\r\nVirginia furnishes lots of rock-salt. The most important salt springs are\r\nin Onondaga County, New York, and furnish nearly half of what the country\r\nuses. The state owns them and gets a royalty of one cent a bushel.\r\nMichigan produces about twenty million bushels a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _VARIOUS HINTS._]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Removing Grease Spots_\r\n\r\nTo remove a grease-spot from cloth, lay a piece of clean blotting paper\r\nover the spot and then pass a hot iron back and forth over blotter. As\r\nthe grease is melted and soaked into the blotter, cover the stain with a\r\nfresh part of the blotter and continue the operation until the stain has\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dish-Mop_\r\n\r\nThe little dish-washing mop is a comparatively recent invention, but its\r\nuse is increasing as its advantages are learned by experience. It is\r\nmerely a handle about ten inches long with a miniature mop, smaller than\r\nyour clenched fist, at the end. With very little trouble a home-made one\r\ncan be arranged, which is practically as good as the store ones, though\r\nthe latter can be bought for ten or fifteen cents. The little mop saves\r\nthe hand from going into the water so much, answers every purpose of the\r\nold dish-rag, and can, like the cloth, be cleaned by vigorous boiling.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spice Cabinets_\r\n\r\nThe little tin or wooden cabinets, now on sale in large quantities at the\r\nbigger stores, with from four to twelve small drawers for spices, are\r\ngreat space-savers and time-savers. The only objection is that, despite\r\nthe label on each drawer, the busy cook is sometimes likely to get hold\r\nof the wrong one.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Soup-Stock_\r\n\r\nIf soup-stock is put to cool in an earthware vessel, instead of a metal\r\none, much better results are obtained. It is claimed that this is one of\r\nthe secrets of the excellent soups the French are famous for.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Fuel Saver_\r\n\r\nIf one uses a gas stove, a single burner can be made to do several\r\ntimes its ordinary work by means of a thin sheet of iron, about a foot\r\nsquare, placed directly over it. The flame spreads out against this sheet\r\nand renders its whole area available for cooking, so that two, three\r\nor even four small vessels can get from this one burner enough heat\r\nto boil water, or at least to keep the contents warm against the time\r\nfor serving. No more gas is used than when a single vessel is allotted\r\nto each burner. It is possible to buy a sheet of iron, an eighth or a\r\nquarter of an inch thick, made expressly for this purpose, the edges\r\nbeing turned down to raise it about half an inch from the surface of the\r\nstove.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Table Mats_\r\n\r\nAsbestos, bought in large pieces, cut into round, oval or square mats,\r\nand either covered daintily or placed under regular table-mats, makes\r\nnot only an economical protection for a polished table against hot\r\ndishes, but a very sure one.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coal Oil and Gasoline_\r\n\r\nIf you are in the habit of starting a fire by pouring coal-oil on the\r\nkindling, break yourself of it. You may do it safely fifteen hundred\r\ntimes and be blown up the next. Coal-oil will not even burn if you drop\r\na match in a barrel of it, but if you spread it out in any way (as on\r\na lamp-wick) it will not only burn but the gas thus formed will often\r\nexplode with terrific force. Never fill a coal-oil lamp while it is\r\nburning.\r\n\r\nGasoline is still more dangerous. If the fire insurance inspector finds\r\nout that you keep even a small bottle of it in the house, he will have\r\nyour policy cancelled immediately, unless you have paid extra for a\r\nspecial clause permitting you to keep a small amount on the premises.\r\nI knew a physician who was killed and blown clear across the street by\r\nthe explosion of gasoline in a saucer, which was being used for cleaning\r\nspots on the carpet of a house he was visiting. The vapor caught fire\r\nfrom an open grate two rooms away from where the saucer had been left.\r\nGasoline is an excellent cleaner, but if you use it, do so out of doors.\r\nLet no one come near with a lighted match or cigar, and throw away any\r\nof the liquid that may be left. As an explosive, gasoline is much more\r\npowerful than gunpowder.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Cheap Shower Bath_\r\n\r\nFive feet of rubber tubing and a ten-cent spray will make as good a\r\nshower-bath apparatus for the bath-tub as any one could ask. The stem\r\nof the spray will twist into one end of the tubing and if the bath-tub\r\nfaucet has the right kind of attachment it will twist into the other end,\r\nmaking a long flexible shower-spray that will prove an unending comfort.\r\nIf the faucet hasn’t the right kind of nozzle to fit a hose, one can be\r\npurchased from the plumber or hardware store for very little. Besides\r\nthe pleasure and comfort a spray gives, there is the added satisfaction\r\nof thoroughly cleaning the body with perfectly clean water before drying\r\nwith the towel.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Warmer Bed_\r\n\r\nIf you continue to feel cold in bed even after piling on a mountain of\r\ncovers, turn your attention underneath. A feather-bed lets no cold reach\r\nyou from below, and a box-mattress is often nearly as good a protection,\r\nbut an ordinary mattress, even a good one, is very likely to let the cold\r\nthrough. If you don’t use a comforter under the sheet, for the sake of\r\nthe mattress and for greater softness to the body, put one there for\r\nwarmth. If this is not enough, spread several layers of newspaper or\r\nwrapping paper between this comfort and the mattress. It will crackle\r\nunder your weight for a time, but it will keep you warm and cosy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hanging Pictures_\r\n\r\nIf you are hanging a picture from a nail in the wall instead of from the\r\npicture-molding, you can save the wall by using a very small, thin wire\r\nnail. If it is driven in without “wobbling” and downward at a narrow\r\nangle with the wall a small nail will hold a surprisingly large picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Save your Eyes_\r\n\r\nDo not sleep with a strong light shining into your eyes. In sleep the\r\neyes are relaxed and, closed though they are, suffer from too strong\r\na light. The sun shining into them before you wake in the morning is\r\nespecially bad. Never read or put the eyes to a strain before breakfast.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Reduce Weight_\r\n\r\nA physician gives the following foods as a broad and common-sense diet\r\nfor those wishing to reduce their flesh: lean mutton and beef, veal and\r\nlamb, soups not thickened, beef-tea and broth, poultry, game, fish and\r\neggs, bread in moderation, greens, cresses, lettuce, etc., green peas,\r\ncabbage, cauliflower, onions, fresh fruit without sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Peeling Onions_\r\n\r\nIt is said that if when peeling onions one holds a needle or any small\r\npiece of polished steel between the teeth, the steel will attract the\r\nacid fumes of the onion and save the eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Keep Lemons_\r\n\r\n1. Cover with buttermilk or sour milk and change once a week. This will\r\nalso freshen dry lemons.\r\n\r\n2. Put in clean white cask or jar, cover with cold water, change every\r\nother day and keep in a cool place. This method will keep lemons fresh\r\nfor months.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Clean Knives_\r\n\r\nMany are unfamiliar with this old-time method: Take even portions of fine\r\ncoal ashes and soda, mix with a little water, rub the knives briskly with\r\nthe preparation, wash in tepid water without soap, and wipe dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Floor Polish_\r\n\r\nOne quart turpentine, six ounces yellow beeswax, four ounces white resin.\r\nMelt the beeswax and resin together over a _slow_ fire and when partly\r\ncool add the turpentine. Bottle for use.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _HEROISM AT HOME._]\r\n\r\n\r\n_A PRIZE FOR THE BEST TRUE STORY._\r\n\r\n_Every month the Department will publish a little story of heroism in\r\nthe home—not any one act of heroism, but the tale of how some one lived\r\nheroically, lived self-sacrifice, in everyday life.

Tell your story simply and plainly._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _THE MONTH’S MEMENTO._]\r\n\r\nThe Wickedness of Worry\r\n\r\n“Worry is one of the worst curses of modern life. I say of modern life,\r\nnot because people a thousand years ago did not worry, because as\r\ncivilization advances men become more highly strung, more sensitive, and\r\nless capable of detachment. Thus, we often say, in a very expressive\r\nphrase, that a thing ‘gets upon our nerves.’ Something distressing\r\nhappens to us, and we cannot shake it off. Some one treats us rudely,\r\nharshly, or unkindly, and the word or deed rankles in our minds. We think\r\nit over until it is magnified into a grievous and intentional insult.\r\nWe take it to bed with us, and no sooner is the light put out than we\r\nbegin to recall it, and turn over in our minds all the circumstances\r\nthat occasioned it. We sleep feverishly, haunted all the time with the\r\nsense of something disagreeable. We wake, and the accursed thing is still\r\nrankling in our minds. This is one form of worry, which is very common\r\namong people of sensitive minds.\r\n\r\nAnother form of worry is the tendency to brood over past errors. The\r\nbusiness man, or the public man, is suddenly overwhelmed with the\r\nconviction that he has made an awful mess of things. The worst of all\r\ncalamities is the lack of energy to grapple with calamity, and in most\r\ncases it is worry that breaks down a man’s energy.\r\n\r\nA third, and perhaps a more common form of worry, is the gloomy\r\nanticipation of future calamities. There are some men who, however\r\nhappy they may be today, are perpetually frightening themselves with\r\nthe possibilities of a disastrous tomorrow. They live in terror. When\r\nactual sorrow comes upon us, most of us discover unexpected resources of\r\nfortitude in ourselves. But nothing sickens the heart so much as imagined\r\nsorrow. Of this form of worry we may well say, “It’s wicked!”\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that most of my readers know by experience what some of\r\nthese things mean. No doubt also many of them have many real causes for\r\nanxious thought, and they will ask me how I propose to deal with it.\r\nOne of the best ways is to be content to live a day at a time. Sydney\r\nSmith counsels us with rich wisdom to take short views of life. Each day\r\nis an entity in itself. It is rounded off by the gulf of sleep; it has\r\nits own hours which will never return; it stands separate, with its own\r\nopportunities and pleasures. Make the most of them.\r\n\r\nAnother good and simple rule is never to take our griefs to bed with\r\nus. ‘Easy to say, but how difficult to do,’ will be replied. But it is\r\nlargely a matter of will and habit.\r\n\r\nJohn Wesley once said that he would as soon steal as worry, for each\r\nwas equally a sin. To worry is wasteful and foolish; we have also to\r\nrecollect that it is wicked.”—_W. J. Dawson._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _RECIPES, OLD AND NEW._]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lemon Pie (Old)_\r\n\r\nTwo lemons, five eggs, two teaspoonsful of melted butter, eight large\r\nspoonsful of white sugar. Squeeze the juice of both lemons and grate the\r\nrind of one. Stir together the yolks of three eggs and the white of one,\r\nwith the sugar, juice and rind, beat well, add one coffee-cup of cream\r\nand beat well for a few minutes longer. Pour the mixture into the waiting\r\ncrust dough. Bake until pastry is done. Meanwhile beat the remaining\r\nwhites of eggs to a stiff froth and stir in four spoonsful of white\r\nsugar. Spread on top and brown slightly. This is enough for two pies.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Simple Pudding_\r\n\r\n(No eggs or milk needed) Slice some good bread rather thick, cutting away\r\nthe crust. Butter on both sides, lay in a deep dish and fill it up with\r\nmolasses after seasoning with ginger, cinnamon or lemon.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Irish Potato Pie (Old)_\r\n\r\nTwo good pints of potatoes after they are boiled and mashed. Put through\r\na sieve while warm. Add small cup of butter, milk enough to make a\r\nbatter. Cinnamon, lemon, spices and sugar to taste. Four eggs beaten\r\nseparately, stirring in the whites after the yokes. This is enough for\r\nfour pies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _BOOKS_\r\n\r\n_BY Thomas E. Watson._]\r\n\r\n\r\n    =The Social Secretary.= By David Graham Phillips. The\r\n    Bobbs-Merrill Co., Indianapolis.\r\n\r\nAn exceedingly clever novel, dealing chiefly with the effort of a\r\nCongressional family to break into good society in Washington, D. C. The\r\nCongressman is a Western man with a lot of money, and with a wife who has\r\nlots of horse sense and a sound heart.\r\n\r\nThey need a pilot to steer them into the realms of fashion and influence.\r\nTo this position comes a beautiful, spirited and accomplished girl who\r\nbelongs to a well-known family which is eminently respectable but is in\r\nreduced circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe campaign mapped out by the Social Secretary in behalf of the\r\nCongressional family is finally crowned with success, and the heroine\r\nmarries the son of the Congressman, as a natural, logical result.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the campaign, the author gives us many an enlightening\r\nglimpse of what goes on in Washington “behind the scenes.” This little\r\nitem for instance: When President Roosevelt is called away from the\r\ndinner-table by some urgent matter which requires instant attention, Mrs.\r\nRoosevelt, all the ladies, and all the gentlemen rise as the President\r\nrises and remain standing until he returns.\r\n\r\nI, for one, was quite surprised to know that our sturdy lion-hunter,\r\nbronco-busting President had fallen into snobbery of that description. I\r\nhope it isn’t so.\r\n\r\n\r\n    =A Maker of History.= By E. Phillips Oppenheim. Little, Brown &\r\n    Co., Boston, Mass.\r\n\r\nA book which catches hold of you and takes you right along. It is\r\noriginal in its plot, dramatic in its incidents, absorbingly interesting\r\nin its narrative.\r\n\r\nA young Englishman, by accident, happens to witness a meeting between\r\nthe Emperor of Germany and the Czar of Russia—a meeting which elaborate\r\nprecautions had been taken to keep secret. Another accident puts into the\r\npossession of the young Englishman a page of the secret treaty between\r\nthe two Emperors. The scheme of this treaty is that Russia shall give\r\nEngland a _casus belli_, that Germany shall come to the assistance of\r\nRussia, and that Great Britain shall be despoiled. The young Englishman\r\nis suspected, and his footsteps are dogged by German spies. Later he\r\ntalks imprudently in a Parisian restaurant, and becomes an object\r\nof intense interest to the French Secret Service. He suddenly and\r\nmysteriously disappears. His sister arrives in Paris, is astonished at\r\nthe disappearance of her brother, and starts out to search for him. Then\r\nthe sister disappears.\r\n\r\nAfter a time everything turns out happily for hero and heroine, but in\r\nthe meanwhile many an event of thrilling interest happens to keep the\r\nreader wide awake and wondering what the outcome will be.\r\n\r\n\r\n    =The Greatest Trust in the World.= By Charles Edward Russell.\r\n    The Ridgway-Thayer Company, New York City.\r\n\r\nThis book is made up of the articles which were published in _Everybody’s\r\nMagazine_, and which created such a profound impression by their calm,\r\nrelentless exposure of the most cruel and most lawless and most despotic\r\nTrust on earth. Not even the Standard Oil Company grinds the common\r\npeople as the Beef Trust does, for the latter deals with food products\r\nwhich are indispensable to life, and the Beef Trust can and does say to\r\nthe people, “Pay my price or die.”\r\n\r\nThe book treats of the might of this monopoly; of the great yellow car,\r\nthe bandit of commerce; of the manner in which the Trust intimidates the\r\nrailroads; of the manner in which the Federal Government white-washed the\r\nTrust; of the union between rotten business and rotten politics.\r\n\r\nIt is a book that all should study.\r\n\r\n\r\n    =American Diplomacy.= By John Bassett Moore. Harper & Brothers,\r\n    Publishers, New York City.\r\n\r\nMy own impression has been that “American Diplomacy” has never amounted\r\nto much, and I cannot say that Dr. Moore’s book has convinced me to the\r\ncontrary.\r\n\r\nThe only apparent triumph of American Diplomacy was the securing of\r\nFrench aid in the Revolutionary War; and as to that most students\r\nwill agree that “diplomacy” had nothing to do with it. France saw an\r\nopportunity to strike at her hereditary foe, Great Britain, and she sent\r\nan emissary to the American Congress to drop certain hints which led to\r\nthe sending of Dean, Lee and Franklin to Paris. Where France was already\r\nso eager, “diplomacy” could claim no triumph.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that Dr. Moore fails to mention John Laurens in\r\nconnection with French aid. The fact is that Washington and Congress\r\nbecame dissatisfied with Franklin, and that John Laurens was despatched\r\nto France to hurry matters up. He did so. He got the money with which\r\nWashington made the decisive Yorktown Campaign, and brought it home with\r\nhim. Surely Dr. Moore ought to have mentioned the name of John Laurens.\r\n\r\nIn the famous Jay treaty, “American Diplomacy” made a craven surrender to\r\nGreat Britain, and in the Treaty of Ghent we certainly won no laurels.\r\nAndrew Jackson and his Southern volunteers threw the only crumb of\r\ncomfort which the situation could boast when they shot the life out of\r\nWellington’s veterans at New Orleans.\r\n\r\nIn the various negotiations concerning the Northwestern boundary,\r\n“American Diplomacy” has yielded up an Empire to British bluff and\r\nshrewdness. During the Civil War, “American Diplomacy” ate humble pie\r\nwith a vengeance more than once; and even in the Venezuelan affair when\r\nCleveland’s attitude seemed so heroic, England, it would appear, packed\r\nthe arbitration board and got pretty much everything that she wanted.\r\n\r\nIn the last tilt between us and the mother country, touching the Canadian\r\nboundary, we were assured that the arbitration was a mere matter of form,\r\nand that Great Britain could not possibly get anything at all. Yet when\r\nthe award was made, it developed that Great Britain had got slices of\r\nstuff all along the line—the land line and the water line.\r\n\r\nAmerican Diplomacy?\r\n\r\nBah!\r\n\r\nLook at the manner in which Great Britain used us as her depot of\r\nsupplies during the Boer War.\r\n\r\nShe held John Hay in the hollow of her hand, and with our aid crushed the\r\nrepublics of South Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n    =Fables and Symbols.= By Clemence De La Baere, Sacramento, Cal.\r\n\r\nThose who love truth and humor served up in the literary form of the\r\nfable, will find this an entertaining little volume. There is much wit\r\nand wisdom packed away in these stories; and they reveal a thorough\r\nknowledge of human nature and of present conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n    =Garrison the Non-Resistant.= By Ernest Crosby. The Public\r\n    Publishing Co., Chicago.\r\n\r\nWhen a Southern writer eulogizes such a bitter foe to his people as was\r\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison, his words will bear the same discount as must be\r\ngiven to the words of a Southern ex-Brigadier, when he goes North and\r\ntells pleased audiences, “I am glad you whipped us.”\r\n\r\nThe truth is the South does not love Garrison and is _not_ glad she was\r\n“whipped.”\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Crosby frankly states, as he does in this book, that Garrison\r\nhad no sympathy whatever for the sufferings of the white laborers of\r\nthe land, he put his finger upon the trait which caused Garrison’s great\r\nunpopularity in the South.\r\n\r\nHe was narrow and fanatical, and while he hated slavery for its own sake,\r\nhe hated the South about as much as he hated slavery.\r\n\r\nWendell Phillips, after the negro was freed, went on broadening in the\r\nscope of his sympathies and his work. He became one of the stalwart\r\nchampions of the rights of white labor. He studied its case, denounced\r\nits wrongs, demanded better things for the millions of toilers who were\r\nbeing exploited and destroyed by insatiable commercial greed.\r\n\r\nNot so Garrison. The negro freed, the South reeking with her own\r\nlife-blood, her homes in ashes, her soul crushed in utter desolation,\r\nGarrison was happy. His work was done. White men, white women, white\r\nchildren might groan and suffer and die in a worse slavery than had\r\nafflicted the blacks of the South, but Garrison did not sympathize—did\r\nnot lift a finger, did not utter a word in their behalf. Another trait in\r\nGarrison’s character was just the trait to stir the dislike of a Southern\r\nman. He carried to such an extent his doctrine of non-resistance, that\r\nhe declared he “would not defend by force his own wife in case of an\r\nassault.” In other words, rather than forcibly resist the criminal who\r\nsought to violate his own wife, he would stand idly by and permit the\r\ncrime to be committed. I do not know how many Northern men endorse a\r\nsentiment of that kind. In my judgment they are few, very few. But I\r\ndo know that there is not a respectable man in the South or West, who\r\nwould not feel disgraced by the utterance of such a doctrine. Mr. Crosby\r\ndeserves great credit for his courage and candor in admitting that while\r\nslavery was wrong, the war waged upon the South was wrong. Of course it\r\nwas wrong. The whole negro race, here and throughout the earth, were not\r\nworth the frightful cost of the Civil War. Mr. Crosby’s book would have\r\nbeen more valuable had he omitted the last two chapters. The author is a\r\nvery talented man but he cannot get to know the true status of the South\r\nby listening to the talk of loafers in the office of the hotel where he\r\nhappens to stop.\r\n\r\n\r\n    =Sidney Lanier.= By Edwin Mims. Houghton, Mifflin & Company,\r\n    Boston and New York.\r\n\r\nA more interesting biographical work than this it would be difficult to\r\nname.\r\n\r\nThe author is temperate in his estimate of the genius of his subject, and\r\nrelates the life struggles of the Georgia poet with sympathetic spirit.\r\n\r\nAs the years go by the fame of Sidney Lanier will grow. That he\r\nwrote some poems which have little merit is true; that his peculiar\r\nand unfortunate mannerism mars the beauty of other poems which do\r\npossess merit is also true; but after all this is conceded, it can be\r\nconfidently claimed that he sometimes rose to the heights of Keats and\r\nShelley, and that his art sometimes equalled the marvelous skill of Edgar\r\nPoe.\r\n\r\nHere and there, throughout Lanier’s poems, can be found gems of thought\r\nand expression which in loftiness, purity and exquisite form lose nothing\r\nby comparison with the higher work of the best English poets.\r\n\r\nNor will the story of his life ever lose interest. It is so full of\r\ninnate nobility; he met the most exacting duties so cheerily, so bravely;\r\nhe fought the battle for bread with such manly confidence, such sweet\r\nsympathy for others; he gave to the world so much more than he asked from\r\nit; he was so independent and yet so companionable; he so long held at\r\nbay, with buoyant pluck, the ghastly White Terror, Consumption; he was\r\nso refined and strong and lovable and valiant and nobly aspiring that\r\nalways and everywhere the simple facts in the life of this Georgia boy,\r\nConfederate soldier, painstaking lawyer, aspiring author, heaven-endowed\r\nmusician, original poet, will move the hearts of men to respect, to\r\nsympathy, to admiration and love.\r\n\r\n\r\n    =Civil War and Reconstruction in Alabama.= By Walter L.\r\n    Fleming. The Columbia University Press, New York, Publishers.\r\n    The Macmillan Company, Agents.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, this is the most valuable contribution that has\r\nyet been made to the literature of the Reconstruction Era.\r\n\r\nThe book contains some 800 pages, and the mass of important data is a\r\nmonument to the industry of the author.\r\n\r\nNot only are we given a full account of the manner in which Secession was\r\nbrought about, not only do we get the story of military operations during\r\nthe Civil War and Carpet-Bag operations afterward, but we are given\r\nilluminating pictures of social and economic conditions, the unspeakable\r\nrottenness of negro government; the cotton frauds and stealings; the\r\ntroubles in the churches; the movements of the Ku Klux Klan (which Tom\r\nDixon most unaccountably traces back to the clan life of Scotland); the\r\nstruggles of the native whites to throw off the carpet-bag and negro\r\nyoke; the upbuilding of an educational system; the gradual creation of a\r\nnew industrial system; and the final triumphant vindication of Alabama of\r\nthe right of local self-government and white supremacy.\r\n\r\nMr. Fleming has done a great and beneficent work in the gathering of the\r\nmass of facts which he embodies in this volume.\r\n\r\nCompared to his, every other book on the same subject seems fragmentary.\r\n\r\n\r\n    =Frenzied Finance.= By Thomas Lawson. The Ridgway-Thayer Co.,\r\n    New York.\r\n\r\nNo matter what Mr. Lawson’s motive may have been, he has done a public\r\nservice in the exposure of the methods of Wall Street which cannot be\r\noverestimated. For thirty years the story which Lawson has told has been\r\nasking for an audience. Time and again, books and magazine articles were\r\npublished warning the people of the ways of the system. As far back as\r\nthe days of Peter Cooper, loud voices of clear-eyed men were raised in\r\nthe effort to rouse public attention. The literature of the Greenback\r\nmovement, of the Farmers’ Alliance movement, and of the People’s Party\r\nmovement was full of notes of warning, full of statements of fact exactly\r\non line with Lawson’s revelations.\r\n\r\nWhy then did the revelations of Lawson sound like a new trumpet and rouse\r\nthe country so quickly and so universally? Because Lawson spoke from the\r\n_inside_: because Lawson was one of the kings of finance himself: because\r\nLawson had played the game himself: because Lawson drew to himself that\r\npeculiar attention which attaches to the witness who “turns State’s\r\nevidence.” A robber who has worn the mask and ridden with the band on\r\nmany a midnight marauding foray is always listened to with breathless\r\ninterest when he enters the box and tells how the robbery was planned,\r\nhow the crime was committed, and now the spoil was divided. This is but\r\nnatural. No matter how much proof one may have to establish the guilt of\r\nthe accused, one feels, always, that there are details which none but the\r\ncriminal can supply. Here Thomas Lawson’s value is beyond dispute and\r\nbeyond price. That the methods of Frenzied Finance are substantially what\r\nLawson says they are, can no longer be a matter of doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “=When You Were a Boy.=” By Edwin L. Sabin. The Baker & Taylor\r\n    Co., New York.\r\n\r\nIt seemed impossible that another successful book on school-life and\r\nboyhood days could be written, but the author has shown how easily\r\none may be mistaken about a thing of that sort. Here is no story of a\r\nfascinating but impossible “Little Lord Fauntleroy”; here is no coarse,\r\nwitless, stupid “Stalky & Co.,” here is no “Huckleberry Finn” or “Tom\r\nSawyer,” or “Tom Brown,” or “Peck’s Bad Boy,” or “Master William Mitten.”\r\nThe hero of “When You Were a Boy”—is you. The author has looked into his\r\nown heart and drawn your picture to life. You had your little “fist and\r\nskull” fights—and here they are in this book. You had a pet dog who did\r\nall sorts of funny, aggravating, endearing things, and then died while\r\nyou were off from home; and the author tells of it, intimately. Your\r\nfirst experience with your father’s shot-gun, your savage rapture over\r\nthe first thing you killed—here it is in the book. And the first fishing\r\ntrip, the first “party” you attended, the first girl you “saw home,”\r\nthe first sweetheart—it is all put down, accurately, vividly. Even that\r\ntime—you mean little whelp!—when you determined to punish your parents by\r\n“running away from home,”—the author found it out on you, and you will\r\nhang your head once more, and your eye will dim, as you read about it,\r\nin the book. The author does not preach and does not prose, and does not\r\nsentimentalise—but “When You Were a Boy” is one of the most life-like\r\ndelineations of the American boy—his character, his feelings, his habits,\r\nhis fun and frolic, his passions, his standards—that has ever been put in\r\na book.\r\n\r\n\r\n    =Bossism and Monopoly.= By Thomas Carl Spelling. D. Appleton &\r\n    Co., New York.\r\n\r\nAn exposition of the evils of the twins—Bossism and Monopoly. Mr.\r\nSpelling brings the record of trust robbery and boss despotism down to\r\ndate, and while he necessarily has to treat the same facts and conditions\r\nwhich so many other writers have handled, none of them has a firmer grip\r\nupon the subject than he—nor have any of them produced a more essentially\r\nuseful book. He is the only writer who has seized upon and utilized the\r\ntremendously important facts set forth by Albert Griffin in the financial\r\narticles which he wrote for this MAGAZINE some months ago. What Mr.\r\nGriffin calls Hocus Pocus Money another may call fictitious values,\r\nunsupported credit, wild-cat inflation, or any other name, but the fact\r\nas first pointed out by Mr. Griffin is that the Privileged Few in the\r\nBanking world are taxing the people to an enormous amount for the use of\r\nbogus money.\r\n\r\nMr. Spelling also deals with the Railroad problem in a masterly way,\r\nadvocating, as all sane men will soon be found doing, Government\r\nOwnership.\r\n\r\n\r\n    =The Coming Crisis.= By Gustavus M. Pinckney. Walker, Evans and\r\n    Cogswell Co., Charleston, S. C.\r\n\r\nThis is a book to read closely and to think about. It is full of solid\r\nfact and sound reasoning. Its tone is calm, but its thought is deep, and\r\nit deals with matters of gravest import.\r\n\r\nA quotation will give some idea of the scope of the work:\r\n\r\n(1) “Society under government naturally tends to fall into two parties,\r\none attached to the consumption of taxes and increase of power, the other\r\nattached to the decrease of taxes and to the limitation of power.\r\n\r\n(2) The tendency of the first party is to absorb the rights and property\r\nof the second: the tendency of the second is to resist the process.\r\n\r\n(3) Remaining unchecked, the first will steadily encroach and absorb\r\nuntil the second is compelled in self-preservation to resist by tendering\r\nthe issue of force.”\r\n\r\nThat’s a clear bold statement and a true one.\r\n\r\nIllustrating the method by which the one party appropriates the property\r\nof the other, Mr. Pinckney cites our infamous Tariff System.\r\n\r\n“The amount of prices advanced under a 40 per cent. tariff and\r\n_transferred from one private pocket to another_, would ... soon extend\r\nto figures to _dwarf the national debt_.”\r\n\r\nSome one has calculated that from Independence to 1861, the amount thus\r\ntransferred from private pockets to other private pockets, without\r\nconsideration, was something like $2,770,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe sum so stolen from private pockets by the damnable Tariff, since\r\n1861, and put into other private pockets is a great deal more than the\r\ncolossal figures mentioned above.\r\n\r\nMr. Pinckney likewise takes up the National Banker and shows how the\r\nGovernment allows him advantages over his fellow man that are “utterly\r\nwithout right, reason, or justification.” After explaining the juggle\r\nwhich takes place over the bonds, and the notes, he sums it up thus:\r\n\r\n“_The people are taxed in order that the privilege of issuing money may\r\nbe farmed out to the banks._”\r\n\r\nNobody has ever summed up the iniquity of the National Banking System in\r\na more startling sentence, and a good Democrat, like Mr. Pinckney, must\r\nhave been sorely grieved when he saw every Democratic Senator and every\r\nDemocratic Representative unite with the wicked Republicans in 1893-1894\r\nto renew the charters of the National Banks for twenty years.\r\n\r\nSpace forbids the extending of these comments further. I will only add\r\nthat no student of present conditions can afford to miss Mr. Pinckney’s\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n\r\n    =Letters and Addresses of Thomas Jefferson.= Edited by Wm.\r\n    B. Parker, of Colombia University, and Jonas Viles, of the\r\n    University of Missouri. The Unit Book Pub. Co., New York.\r\n\r\nWhen two college professors start out to give the world a new book on\r\n_Thomas_ Jefferson, the world has a right to expect an unusually valuable\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nProfessors Parker and Viles did not undertake an original composition.\r\nTheirs was the simpler task of making a good selection from the letters,\r\nState papers and addresses of Mr. Jefferson. That such a selection should\r\nbe a success, it was necessary that the compilers acquaint themselves\r\nintimately with all that Jefferson wrote, and that the selections made\r\nshould fairly represent _Jefferson himself_—Jefferson the man, the\r\nscholar, the farmer, the builder, the inventor, the advanced thinker, the\r\nman of bold speculative ideas, the statesman, the student of social and\r\nindustrial problems.\r\n\r\nHave our learned professors done this?\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson’s book, “Notes on Virginia,” contains more than 300\r\npages. It is full of his most characteristic thinking. It displays the\r\nworking of his mind on matters great and small, social, racial, historic\r\npractical and speculative.\r\n\r\nOur Professors quote eight pages from the book, wherein Mr. Jefferson\r\ndiscusses Religion, Slavery and American Genius—three subjects only.\r\nThese are important quotations, but what a pity it is that the Professors\r\ndid not quote Jefferson’s profound study of the Indians, their physical\r\nand mental peculiarities, their mode of life, their love of their\r\nchildren, their fortitude under suffering, their undying loyalty to\r\nfriends, their skill and bravery in war, their eloquence in council,\r\ntheir system of tribal government. Mr. Jefferson wrote nothing more\r\ninteresting than this account of the Indians of Virginia. It was in this\r\nthat he reproduced and handed down to posterity that gem of oratory which\r\nwe boys used to “speak” at school—“Logan’s speech” sent to Lord Dunmore.\r\n\r\nOn page 166 of the “Notes,” Mr. Jefferson gives a concise and\r\ncomprehensive statement of the wrongs which the colonies suffered at\r\nthe hands of the King. Inasmuch as we have developed a school of Tory\r\nhistorians who make light of the American grievances, it might have been\r\na good thing had the Professors quoted Mr. Jefferson’s summary of those\r\ngrievances.\r\n\r\nOn page 172 of the “Notes,” Mr. Jefferson makes a remarkable prediction\r\nof the manner in which abuses will creep into our Government, and he\r\nsolemnly warns his countrymen to combat these abuses “before they shall\r\nhave gotten hold on us.”\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the abuses which Mr. Jefferson dreaded have gotten hold on\r\nus, his prophecy, published more than a hundred years ago, deserves a\r\nplace in any collection of Jefferson’s works.\r\n\r\nOn page 216 of the “Notes,” Mr. Jefferson has a word to say on popular\r\nself-government which every American boy should read as soon as he\r\nbecomes a voter. I am sorry the Professors left it out.\r\n\r\nThe most powerful chapter in the “Notes on Virginia,” is that beginning\r\non page 228 and ending on page 235. As it stands written, it is a\r\nmasterpiece. To spoil a good thing is easy; and the Professors spoilt the\r\nbest chapter in Jefferson’s book by cutting out only a portion of it for\r\nuse, and not the best part at that.\r\n\r\nOn page 240 of the “Notes” is Mr. Jefferson’s splendid tribute to the\r\nworking classes of the rural communities—but the Professors seemingly\r\nattached no value to it.\r\n\r\nWhat could have been more timely than the re-publication of Mr.\r\nJefferson’s magnificent plea against War, and against Militarism, which\r\ncovers pages 253, 254, and 255 of the “Notes”? The Professors could not\r\nhave embraced in their collection anything of greater intrinsic and\r\neternal value than this, and they have given much space to matter which,\r\ncompared to this, is mere trash.\r\n\r\nI have neither the time nor the patience to compare the letters which\r\nthese Professors have collected with those which they have left out.\r\nIf they selected the letters in the same spirit that they culled from\r\nthe “Notes,” their compilation is just as far from doing justice to Mr.\r\nJefferson as “The True Thomas Jefferson,” by W. E. Curtis, was from the\r\ntruth. There is no American book of the same size that contains more\r\nerrors than Curtis’s “True Jefferson;” and when I saw that these two\r\nProfessors had named that book as one of their authorities—well, you can\r\nsee for yourself how it stimulated my attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n    =Democracy in the South Before the Civil War.= By G. W. Dyer,\r\n    M. A., Pub. House of the M. E. Church South. Nashville, Tenn.\r\n\r\nThe author modestly calls this a compendium of a more comprehensive work\r\nwhich will be published later.\r\n\r\nIt is an exceedingly valuable study. The author has dug up a lot of\r\nburied treasure. His refutation of many unfounded opinions concerning\r\nsocial economic and political conditions in the South prior to the Civil\r\nWar is supported by a diligence of research that gather all the necessary\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nAmong other facts of importance which Mr. Dyer establishes, Prof. John\r\nBach McMaster to the contrary notwithstanding, are:\r\n\r\n(1) There was no land monopoly in the South. On the contrary there was a\r\nbetter pro rata distribution of land than in the free States.\r\n\r\n(2) Manual labor was not a badge of disgrace. On the other hand, the\r\nwhite population of the South was engaged in all kinds of manual labor,\r\nexcepting menial service.\r\n\r\n(3) The South had a larger number of miles of railroads in 1860 in\r\nproportion to her free population than the rest of the country.\r\n\r\n(4) In 1860, Southern people were engaged in almost all kinds of\r\nmanufacturing.\r\n\r\n(5) In 1860 the South was the richest section of the country, and her\r\nwealth was increasing with greater rapidity than that of the other\r\nsections.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that in one of his great speeches in Congress\r\nWilliam L. Yancey demonstrated this truth.\r\n\r\n(6) Wages were higher in the South than in the North in 1860.\r\n\r\nSo they are even now. The laborer who produces that free trade product,\r\ncotton, gets nearly one-half of the value of the cotton produced. In the\r\nProtected industries of the North the laborer does not receive an average\r\nof twenty-five percent of the product of his labor.\r\n\r\nMr. Dyer proves another fact worth mention:\r\n\r\nThe idea of a State fund for the education of those who were not able to\r\npay their tuition originated in the South. In other words, the present\r\nAmerican system of State free public schools was born in the South. If\r\nMr. Dyer’s more comprehensive work increases in value as it increases in\r\nsize it will deserve to be a most successful book.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “=Sonnets to a Wife.=” By Ernest McGaffey. William Marion\r\n    Reedy. St. Louis, Mo.\r\n\r\nMr. McGaffey makes his Sonnets a continuous hymn of the beautiful in\r\nNature. The clean atmosphere of the open world is in every sonnet. All\r\nthe airs of heaven blow pureness about these lovers. The spiritual\r\nsignificance of the great Nature, of which husband and wife and their\r\nlove for each other are a part, is always strongly suggested, and this\r\nwithout cant either of orthodoxy or of the dolorous minor poet lamenting\r\nthe loss of himself to the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n    =The Eternal Spring.= A Novel. By Neith Boyce. Fox, Duffield &\r\n    Co., New York, $1.50, postpaid.\r\n\r\nThe story opens at an Italian villa, overlooking Florence. Elizabeth\r\nCraven is wearing “second mourning” for a deceased husband who was too\r\nold for her, and who had never satisfied her womanly cravings for male\r\ncompanionship. Elizabeth is thirty-eight years old, but is still in the\r\nflush of health and strength and beauty. Hers is the villa, and to her\r\ncomes Barry Carlton, who has been stock-gambling for several years in\r\nChicago, and has quit because he had won a modest competence and had\r\nbrought himself to the brink of nervous collapse.\r\n\r\nBarry Carlton had known Elizabeth intimately five years before and had\r\nbecome warmly attached to her. Poor Elizabeth! She had loved Barry all\r\nthe while, and she loves him yet.\r\n\r\nShe is radiantly happy as she welcomes Barry to her villa. She knows that\r\nhe has come from America to ask her to become his wife. He is thirty\r\nyears old, and while worn down to a painful thinness she has no doubt\r\nwhatever that rest and loving attention will soon restore his robust\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\n_Then_ she will live. She has never known life; she has been cramped and\r\nconfined all these years; when she marries her young lover, she will know\r\nthe passion of _living_.\r\n\r\nBut alas! Barry wooes tamely. Elizabeth is coy, expecting more heat.\r\nBarry cannot give it, the wooing lags, no engagement occurs, and then\r\ncomes the shipwreck of Elizabeth’s hopes. Barry falls in love with a\r\ndivinely gifted and lovely young creature who is also a guest at the\r\nvilla.\r\n\r\nA strange thing happens to the reader. Elizabeth has won _his_ heart,\r\nand she holds it to the end. She is so womanly in her devotion to Barry;\r\nso womanly in her grief at losing him, so majestic in her renunciation\r\nof her own hopes, so beautifully generous and helpful to the man and the\r\ngirl who have broken her own heart, that the reader feels himself about\r\nto say:\r\n\r\n“One Elizabeth were worth a dozen Claras.”\r\n\r\nFor the reader does not fall in love with Clara. She is a bit unnatural\r\nand uncanny.\r\n\r\nHer mother, the bad but magnificent Mrs. Langham, is far more real and\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\nAs to Barry himself, the reader never does quite understand why the women\r\nfind him so irresistible. It does not appear that he is very handsome, or\r\nvery accomplished, or very anything else, excepting that he is abominably\r\nselfish in his dealings with Elizabeth. The women who fall in love with\r\nhim rave about his “honesty,” but that is a quality which seldom carries\r\nwomen off their feet. Decidedly Elizabeth remains the heroine and next\r\nto her in interest comes the bad, beautiful Mrs. Langham. The author\r\ntells the story with superb art. There are no incidents, no thrills, no\r\ndramatic climaxes, and yet there is not a dull page in the book.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cause for Joy_\r\n\r\n“Well, now, which do you think is correct, ‘measles is’ or ‘measles\r\nare’?” chucklingly inquired the landlord of the Torpidville tavern.\r\n“Also, would you say, ‘The Glee Club are’ or ‘the Glee Club is’?”\r\n\r\n“D’know!” replied the patent-churn man, shortly. “Those old\r\ncatch-questions don’t interest me a little bit. But what I’d like to know\r\nis why everybody looks so pleased and smiling today? Is there a picnic or\r\ncelebration or something of the sort on the tapis?”\r\n\r\n“No, skurcely that. It’s the relief that is tickling ’em, not\r\nanticipation. You see, the Glee Club of the village Academy was going to\r\ngive a concert and cantata tomorrow night, assisted by our best local\r\ntalent, and now the measles have, or has, as the case may be, broken out,\r\nup there in the temple of learnin’, and every member of the Glee Club\r\nhave, or has, got it, or them, good and plenty and the entertainment has\r\nbeen indefinitely—haw! haw!—postponed.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Say of Other Editors_]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Democrat has no axe to grind, no scores to settle nor heads to whack\r\nin advancing the erection by the city of an electric lighting plant.

And it may be only a short\r\ntime until Mr. Rogers is holding an unenviable seat with Mr. McCall and\r\na lot of other unscrupulous fellows who a short time ago imagined that\r\nthey were practically the whole financial show.

He\r\ndodged service of the subpoena until outwitted by an officer and in the\r\nwitness chair he refuses to answer questions propounded by the attorney\r\ngeneral of Missouri. He refuses with a supercilious air that asserts his\r\ncontempt for such humble affairs as courts and officers of the law. The\r\nworld’s greatest trust, the world’s richest men, tell the world that they\r\nare not amenable to the regulations to which the balance of the world is\r\nbound to conform. This is the anarchy of wealth. Recently representatives\r\nof the oil trust told Commissioner Garfield that the Standard Oil was\r\ngreater than the government; that John D. Rockefeller was a bigger man\r\nthan the President of the United States; that he owned the Senate and\r\nthe House and was able, by the mere passing of the word, to cause the\r\nremoval of Secretary Metcalf and Commissioner Garfield. A few years back\r\nin history the Standard Oil corporation defied the Supreme Court of Ohio\r\nand caused the political defeat of the presumptuous attorney who brought\r\nan action against it and won because his case was just. Now comes Henry\r\nH. Rogers, second to John D. Rockefeller, bristling with defiance because\r\na Western court proposes to make him and his associates obey the same law\r\nthat common persons have to obey. It is greatly to be feared that the oil\r\nmagnates are invoking a test of strength—feared because some one is going\r\nto be roughly handled should there come a popular adjustment between\r\nthe forces of wealth and government. The American people have been very\r\npatient and are still patient. But if they are called upon to pass upon\r\ncertain points raised by the contumacy of Mr. Rogers and the rest, the\r\ncontroversy will be short, sharp and decisive.—_Howard (S. Dak.)

Watson’s reply to Howell on the Sibley letter\r\nwas the hottest, the strongest, the most cutting and most biting\r\npolitical epistle that we have ever read.\r\n\r\nEvery word in it was as sharp as a two-edged sword and went as straight\r\nto the mark as a rifle ball.\r\n\r\nWe care but little what some writers say about us, but there are two\r\npeople in Georgia, Mrs. Felton and Tom Watson, with whom we hope forever\r\nto keep on terms.\r\n\r\nAnd Tom Watson is a man of convictions. He isn’t afraid of abuse when it\r\ncomes to taking a stand for what he considers right.\r\n\r\nSmart as he is, he sees through the political scheme being worked in\r\nGeorgia to defeat Hoke Smith and he denounces it in no uncertain terms.\r\n\r\nListen to him: “If Hoke Smith succeeds, if the people will but realize\r\nthat Hoke Smith is the only anti-ring candidate in the field, if they\r\nwill but realize that the candidacies of Clark Howell, Jim Smith, Dick\r\nRussell, J. H. Estill, Jack Robinson, and Hiram-Fat-and-Go-Last all\r\ntend to the same object; if they will but realize that these different\r\ncandidates are jumping-jacks which Hamp McWhorter has strung upon the\r\nsame string, and that when Hamp strikes the string with the straw they\r\nall dance in the most diverting and uniform manner: if the people will\r\nbut use their common sense and refuse to be divided, then Hoke Smith’s\r\ntriumph is assured.”\r\n\r\nListen again to this patriotic paragraph: “And in my purpose there is a\r\nmotive so dominant, and a plan so full of the promise of glorious results\r\nfor Georgia and the South, that I shall not allow the rigid limits of\r\nparty lines to tie my hands; but shall hold myself perfectly free to\r\nserve my people in the best way that circumstances allow, and as duty\r\ndirects.”\r\n\r\nAnd nobody will close Watson’s mouth. On that score he says: “One-horse\r\npoliticians devoted to the ring need not think that their permission is\r\nnecessary for me to advise with the people of Georgia. Their consent will\r\nnot be asked. As a Georgian I have a right to be heard. My people came\r\nhere when the Indians still roamed in the woods, and have been a part of\r\nGeorgia ever since, serving her dutifully in the time of peace, fighting\r\nfor her manfully in the time of war. There never lived a man who was\r\nmore devoted than I to the best interests of my state and of the South.\r\nAs a Southern man, I resent from the depth of my heart the political\r\ndegradation into which our state has fallen, and I am going to do my\r\nlevel best to help Hoke Smith redeem it.”—_Lawrenceville (Ga.)

Thus, if the National City Bank of New York had issued all the\r\nnotes it could against Government bonds, and a big stock gambler asked\r\nfor a loan of $1,000,000, the bank would issue notes in that sum, charge\r\nhim, say 10 per cent, retire the notes when the loan was paid, and pocket\r\nthe interest in excess of the 6 per cent tax to the Government.

MORGAN\r\n\r\n\r\n“The Ladies’ Aid Society of the church have undertaken the task of\r\ncollecting half a mile of pennies,” said the Old Codger’s niece, “for the\r\npurpose of sending our pastor on a vacation trip.”\r\n\r\n“Humph!” answered the veteran, with all the suavity of a hyena.\r\n\r\n“A row of cents half a mile long,” persisted the lady, “will amount, so\r\nSister Eunice Tubman has figured out, to $420.00, and—”\r\n\r\n“I don’t care what they amount to!” doggedly declared the venerable\r\ncurmudgeon. “While I’ve got any sense nobody will get any cents out o’\r\nme for any such purpose! I don’t care a contaminated drat whether ‘our\r\npastor’ stays at home or goes to the Whangdoodle Islands—whatever he does\r\nwon’t be at my expense, lemme just rise to remark!”\r\n\r\n“But, Uncle, you know the laborer is worthy of his hire, and—”\r\n\r\n“Yuss! And the less they labor the higher they want their hire to be!\r\nLabor!—_huh!_ If more preachers would—aw, well, I won’t give an inch of\r\nthat ’ere half mile of cents, and that settles it!”\r\n\r\n“Why, Uncle, how _can_ you talk so? You are generally ready to give to\r\ngood causes, and—”\r\n\r\n“Ah-yah! But _his name is Bertram_!”\r\n\r\n“To be sure, it is! And he is in every way such a worthy young man, and\r\nso intellectual, too! What possible grudge can you have against him?”\r\n\r\n“Just told ye!—his name is Bertram! He also says ‘eyther’ and ‘nyther’,\r\nwhich pronunciations cheat me out of all the good his sermons might\r\notherwise do me. I could overlook that, though, if his name wasn’t\r\nBertram. For years that’s been pretty nearly a fighting word with me.\r\nWhen I was a freckle-nosed schoolboy in the old Head-o’-the-River\r\ndistrict, there was a boy named Bertram there, who had a swifter sled\r\nthan mine, and didn’t have to wear his Pa’s cut-down-to-fit-him clothes\r\nlike I did, and who spelt me down the last day of school, and took from\r\nme the bashful affection of the pantaletted little girl who was all the\r\nworld to me at that particular time. I couldn’t get even with him then\r\nfor he could lick me, and did. And ever since I’ve—”\r\n\r\n“But, my goodness! This isn’t the same Bertram!”\r\n\r\n“No, but he’s a Bertram, and somehow all Bertrams have looked alike to me\r\never since. All these years I’ve been hostile to Bertrams, and have never\r\nbeen able to conquer the feeling, try as I might. Any Bertram affects\r\nme the same way—a Bertram is a Bertram, to me, and I simply can’t help\r\nit. The Lord loves a cheerful giver, and as I couldn’t any more give\r\ncheerfully to this or any other Bertram than I could sing a hymn while\r\nsitting down on wet ice, I won’t add a cent to that ’ere half-mile of\r\npennies.

He declares the President has\r\ntwisted the Monroe Doctrine into a “Roosevelt Doctrine.”\r\n\r\n    President Roosevelt transmits the report of the Panama Canal\r\n    Commissioners and the Panama Railroad directors to the Senate.\r\n    The reports are accompanied by a letter from the President in\r\n    which he challenges an investigation of the canal work.\r\n\r\n    Senator Bacon, of Georgia, introduces a resolution in the\r\n    Senate asking President Roosevelt why the United States is\r\n    mixing in the quarrel over Morocco, which threatens to bring\r\n    about a European war.\r\n\r\n    A resolution is introduced in the House for a committee to\r\n    investigate the treatment of Mrs. Minor Morris at the White\r\n    House.

Prominent senators and\r\ncongressmen condemn the President’s treatment of them at the hands of his\r\nsecretaries. The newspaper correspondents claim that he exerts a press\r\ncensorship over the Departments and allows nothing to be given to the\r\npress except what suits him. Many acts of misconduct in the Departments\r\nhave been kept a secret. A large force of secretaries and secret service\r\nmen prevent officials from seeing the President on official business,\r\nunless the President cares to attend to such matters.\r\n\r\n    The House Committee on Postoffices and Post Roads requests\r\n    Postmaster General Cortelyou to supply the Committee with all\r\n    information he may have on the franking abuses.\r\n\r\n    The National Bank of Commerce, New York City, drops J.

He virtually calls Bigelow a liar, but\r\nadmits that negro women were sent to the Isthmus to be distributed as\r\nwives among the laborers. The charge that a boat-load of negroes from\r\nMartinique were clubbed is also admitted.\r\n\r\n    The Federal Grand Jury at Utica, N.

The minimum tariff is to be the Dingley law. The maximum is a 25\r\nper cent. addition to the Dingley schedule.\r\n\r\n    Congressman Longworth, of Ohio, addresses the House on the\r\n    Philippine tariff bill, and declares the Philippines to be a\r\n    shiftless, worthless lot of people.\r\n\r\n    The Insurgent Congressmen, that is, the Republicans who\r\n    oppose Speaker Cannon on the joint statehood bill, claim that\r\n    they have 51 votes and will defeat the bill. Two of them are\r\n    from Missouri. The President sends for the entire Missouri\r\n    delegation and tries to whip the two members into line, but\r\n    fails.\r\n\r\n    Mrs. Cassie Chadwick begins her term of imprisonment in the\r\n    Federal Penitentiary at Columbus, Ohio.\r\n\r\n    Congressman McCall, of Massachusetts, warns his Republican\r\n    colleagues that they must revise the tariff, or the Republican\r\n    Party will be defeated at the next election.\r\n\r\n    District Attorney Jerome, of New York City, prepares to\r\n    prosecute the guilty officials of the big life insurance\r\n    companies.\r\n\r\n    The Clyde Line steamship _Cherokee_ goes ashore on Brigantine\r\n    Shoals, off Atlantic City, N.

Tugs and life-saving crews\r\n    have gone to the aid of the passengers and crew.\r\n\r\nJanuary 13.—President Roosevelt holds a conference with prominent New\r\nYork Republicans with reference to ousting Odell from the leadership of\r\nNew York State.\r\n\r\n    The President has a conference with Representative Hepburn and\r\n    indicates that he favors the Hepburn bill on railroad rate\r\n    regulation.\r\n\r\n    The notice to make H. H. Rogers testify in the Standard Oil\r\n    investigation is argued before Justice Gildersleeve in the New\r\n    York Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n    The debate on the Philippine tariff bill continues in the House.\r\n\r\n    Troops in the Philippines are being held in readiness to sail\r\n    for China in case the feelings against Americans cannot be\r\n    controlled by the Chinese Government.\r\n\r\n    Attorney General Mayer, of New York, prepares to bring suit\r\n    against the McCurdys and the directors of the Mutual Life\r\n    Insurance Co. for the restitution of illegal salaries and\r\n    commissions.\r\n\r\nJanuary 14.—All of the passengers and a part of the crew are rescued from\r\nthe stranded steamer _Cherokee_. The captain, two mates and the ship’s\r\ncarpenter refused to leave the vessel.\r\n\r\n    According to statistics gathered by insurance men, 17,700\r\n    persons were killed or wounded in the factories and steel\r\n    plants in Allegheny County, Penn., in 1905.\r\n\r\nJanuary 15.—Private Secretary Loeb denies that the President stated,\r\nwhile trying to whip the Missouri delegation into line on the Statehood\r\nbill last Friday, that money was being freely used by corporations to\r\ndefeat the bill. About the time the denial is made, a delegation from\r\nArizona returned from the White House, and stated that practically the\r\nsame charge was made to them.\r\n\r\n    Secretary Taft declares that the Southern Pacific Railway,\r\n    through its ownership of the Pacific Mail Steamship Co., is\r\n    responsible for the congestion of freight on the Isthmus of\r\n    Panama, and consequent hindrance of canal work. The steamship\r\n    company refuses to move the freight on the Pacific side, hoping\r\n    to keep the blockade on the Atlantic side so great that no\r\n    Government boats can land there with more supplies. This will\r\n    force shipment via the Southern Pacific to San Francisco, and\r\n    from there to Panama via the Pacific Mail Steamship Co.\r\n\r\n    The captain with the remaining members of his crew abandons\r\n    the _Cherokee_. The rescue of passengers and crew was made by\r\n    Captain Casto, of Atlantic City, N. J., with his crew in his\r\n    schooner _Alberta_.\r\n\r\n    The debate on the Philippine tariff bill is brought to a close\r\n    in the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\n    The President prepares a message to Congress, favoring a lock\r\n    canal. The Canal Commission asks for $5,000,000 to continue the\r\n    work during the balance of the present fiscal year.\r\n\r\nJanuary 16.—Marshall Field, Chicago’s millionaire merchant, dies of\r\npneumonia in New York City, at the age of 70.\r\n\r\n    The Panama Canal Commission decides to build the Canal by\r\n    contract. The President has approved the plan.\r\n\r\n    Congressman Hermann, of Oregon, who is under indictment for\r\n    participating in land frauds, takes the oath of office, and\r\n    begins to draw his salary.\r\n\r\nJanuary 16.—The House of Representatives passes the Philippine tariff\r\nbill. The bill admits goods the growth or product of the Philippines\r\ninto the United States free of duty, except sugar, tobacco and rice, on\r\nwhich a tariff of 35 per cent of the Dingley rates is levied. Philippine\r\ngoods coming to the United States are exempted from the export tax of\r\nthe islands. The bill further provides that after April 11, 1909, there\r\nshall be absolute free trade each way between the United States and the\r\nPhilippines.\r\n\r\n    The vote on the Statehood bill is indefinitely postponed\r\n    because Speaker Cannon fails to secure a sufficient number of\r\n    pledges to make its passage certain.\r\n\r\n    The annual meeting of the United Mine Workers of America is\r\n    held at Indianapolis.\r\n\r\n    The Senate debates the question whether Congress has the right\r\n    to delegate to the courts its power to fix railroad rates.\r\n\r\n    The resolution introduced in the New York State Senate, asking\r\n    Senator Depew to resign, is lost by a vote of 34 to 1.

The Minister thinks no one\r\n    power will care to force a war with China, as she can now put a\r\n    modern army, of 200,000 men, in the field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Along the Firing Line_\r\n\r\nBY THE CIRCULATION MANAGER\r\n\r\n\r\nThere isn’t much to say this month about circulation work except that\r\nresults have been highly satisfactory. We appreciate the loyalty and\r\nenergy of our friends, and extend sincere thanks for their help. January\r\nwas our best month, but at this writing (Feb. 8) the indications are that\r\nFebruary will be still better. A great many subscriptions expired with\r\nthe February number. Some weeks ago we sent out a postal card notice\r\nasking for renewal and one new subscriber. The prompt replies to this\r\ncard made us throw up our hats and give three cheers for the Old Guard.\r\nNearly every one who replied sent one to four new subscriptions with his\r\nrenewal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRemember that the subscription price is now $1.50, but as a favor to our\r\npresent subscribers we will accept renewals and new subscriptions at the\r\ndollar rate until March 31. Get in before the time limit expires.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI made reference last month to Mr. Forrest’s advertisement and the\r\nresults up to January 4—only a few days after the January number was\r\nplaced on sale. Since then Mr. Forrest has received several thousand\r\ncoupons, and more are coming in every mail. He writes me that the\r\nconference is assured, and that it will be a grand success. Mr. Bentley’s\r\nclub organization movement is going right along and he expects to call\r\na conference at St. Louis about May 1. I have suggested that he and Mr.\r\nForrest join forces and hold but one conference. I can give no details of\r\nMr. Bentley’s work, except that he is in touch with Populists in 1,800\r\ncounties out of some 2,800.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOrganizations on a smaller scale are springing up all over the country.\r\nIn Pennsylvania the Referendum Party is beginning active operations. A\r\npreliminary committee on organization has been appointed, consisting of\r\nthe following gentlemen:\r\n\r\nClarence V. Tiers, chairman, Pittsburgh, Pa.,\r\n\r\nClement V. Horn, Wilkinsburg, Pa.,\r\n\r\nH. F. Lea, Bellevue, Pa.,\r\n\r\nH. W. Noren, Allegheny, Pa.,\r\n\r\nWalter Becker, Allegheny, Pa.,\r\n\r\nJohn C. Innes, Pittsburgh, Pa.,\r\n\r\nGeorge D. Porter, Philadelphia, Pa.,\r\n\r\nJohn E. Joos, Allegheny, Pa.,\r\n\r\nNathaniel Green, Swissvale, Pa.,\r\n\r\nJ. Ludwig Koethen, Jr., Pittsburgh, Pa.,\r\n\r\nHon. W. F. Hill (Master State Grange), Chambersburg, Pa.,\r\n\r\nJames William Newlin (Member of Constitutional Convention 1873),\r\nPhiladelphia, Pa.\r\n\r\nHeadquarters are located at Pittsburgh. Address communications to Lock\r\nBox 305, Pittsburgh, Pa. The Referendum Party requests the active\r\nco-operation and financial support of all who favor:\r\n\r\n    First.—The calling of a Constitutional Convention to revise the\r\n    State Constitution;\r\n\r\n    Second.—Granting to the people the right to veto unjust laws or\r\n    ordinances by direct vote; this right to be exercised only if a\r\n    vote is demanded on any law or ordinance, by petition signed by\r\n    two per centum of the voters of the State or locality affected.\r\n\r\n    Third.—Granting to the people the right to enact, by direct\r\n    majority, needed laws which their Legislature fails or refuses\r\n    to enact.\r\n\r\nRegarding candidates it is announced that—\r\n\r\n    It is the intention of the Referendum Party to nominate for the\r\n    election of November 6, 1906, a complete state ticket including\r\n    candidates for the Legislature (Senators and Representatives)\r\n    but the State Executive Committee suggest that, unless\r\n    exceptionally strong, aggressive, independent candidates for\r\n    either branch of the Legislature can be nominated, it would\r\n    be advisable for local committees to indorse (by filing\r\n    nomination papers) candidates of some other party who would\r\n    pledge their support to the principles of the Referendum Party\r\n    as stated above.\r\n\r\n    After the election the Referendum Party will be entitled to a\r\n    regular place on official ballots in every district where it\r\n    polled two per centum of the largest vote cast. For this reason\r\n    it is most desirable that it nominate a candidate in every\r\n    Legislative district within the State. The forming of local\r\n    organizations in the Referendum Party should therefore begin at\r\n    once.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe People’s Party State Central Committee of Kansas met at Topeka,\r\nFebruary 2, and directed Chairman Babb and Secretary Fowler to call a\r\nState convention some time in July. Chairman Babb and some other members\r\nof the committee favored the organization of a voters’ league to question\r\nand secure pledges from candidates on the old party tickets, making\r\nno third party nominations—something on the plan devised by George H.\r\nShibley, editor of the _Referendum News_, Washington, D. C. The committee\r\nwas not, however, a unit on this point, several of the members insisting\r\nupon making straight People’s Party nominations. This, it seems likely,\r\nwill be done.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Union for the Common Good” is the name of a new organization just\r\nstarting in Kansas. Rev. O. H. Truman, La Crosse, is one of the moving\r\nspirits. In the manifesto sent out by this new aspirant for political\r\nhonors the committee say:\r\n\r\n    _Whereas_, undisputed proofs of corporate greed, unscrupulous\r\n    and law-defying, have recently multiplied; and certainties\r\n    that “Boss” domination has largely prevailed in city and state\r\n    politics, frequently dictating to the people from low resorts,\r\n    encouraging graft and other corruptions to fester and flourish;\r\n    and also the great exchanges for disposing of stocks and bonds\r\n    and grain have long displaced the law of supply and demand\r\n    by their gambling methods, resulting in frequent failures,\r\n    suicides, and loss to all but the unscrupulous few; and\r\n\r\n    _Whereas_, the people, at last aroused and indignant, are now\r\n    demanding redress and prevention of further wrong;\r\n\r\n    _Therefore_, we deem it timely to organize into a society those\r\n    having a strong definite purpose to reclaim all monetary,\r\n    political, and other rights and interests from the greedy grasp\r\n    of the few to the promotion of the Common Good.\r\n\r\n    Civilization advances by evolution and revolution. Evolution\r\n    makes slow progress over a long period of time, while\r\n    Revolution advances rapidly in a short space of time.\r\n\r\n    Revolutions are caused by giant evils which must be overthrown\r\n    suddenly or not at all.\r\n\r\n    America has passed through two revolutions, and we are now\r\n    entering a third, equal in importance and greater in character\r\n    than either of the others.\r\n\r\n    The great evils that now threaten our existence are\r\n    intemperance, trusts, and political corruption.\r\n\r\n    We are to choose between Socialism and Christian Government;\r\n    nothing else is presented and nothing else is worthy of our\r\n    attention.\r\n\r\n    Socialists have gathered much valuable information; but their\r\n    leadership would dethrone God from our nation and overturn all\r\n    our history.\r\n\r\n    Christian Government would fulfill prophecy in giving Christ\r\n    the kingdom of this world, and would be in line with national\r\n    experience.\r\n\r\n    Socialism is an ideal as yet untried, without a code of morals\r\n    to preserve from corruption. In Christian Government the\r\n    legislative, executive and judicial powers would be directly\r\n    tested by the teachings of Christ.\r\n\r\n    The demands of complete Socialism are too radical for this\r\n    crisis or for any single movement. Masses of men can be moved\r\n    only so far at any one time; and revolutions are no exception\r\n    to this universal rule. To attempt more is to cause reaction\r\n    and loss.\r\n\r\n    Christian Government would accept the possible while striving\r\n    for the Christ ideal of perfection.\r\n\r\n    Nearly all revolutions have resulted in war and we believe that\r\n    complete Socialism for this crisis would be no exception to\r\n    that rule.\r\n\r\n    The Christian and moral sentiment of the nation is now\r\n    sufficiently strong, if aroused and united, to accomplish its\r\n    work by the moral power of the ballot without resorting to war.\r\n\r\n    What measures do we propose for the present crisis, and what\r\n    remedies do we suggest for existing evils?\r\n\r\n    American society may be roughly divided into three great\r\n    classes: A small, wealthy class at the top; a great mass of\r\n    laborers at the bottom; and a medium Christian and moral class\r\n    in the middle. The church middle class thus holds the balance\r\n    of power, and is responsible for safe leadership and moral\r\n    results.\r\n\r\n    The Christian and moral forces of the nation must now be\r\n    organized into a moral society for the express purpose\r\n    of leading this reform movement and developing Christian\r\n    Government.\r\n\r\n    At the outset of our organization we need consider only those\r\n    remedial measures to which all research and all demands are\r\n    now pointing; and our specialty as a society is to urge and\r\n    aid the careful testing of the best means of relief from a\r\n    dangerous condition, and also to aid in fullest adoption and\r\n    application of measures approved after trial. The key phrases\r\n    or watch words for our organization are these: “Thorough\r\n    Testing” and “The Common Good.”\r\n\r\n    We favor a fair and safe trial of municipal and other Public\r\n    Ownership, as it seems to be in harmony with the destiny of our\r\n    country and the spirit of the age.\r\n\r\n    State incorporation having been tested and found wanting, we\r\n    urge national incorporation instead, including reasonable\r\n    restrictions, and also liability to forfeiture if lawless.\r\n\r\n    We favor the election of United States Senators by direct vote\r\n    of the people; also a thorough test of the initiative and\r\n    referendum and the imperative mandate.\r\n\r\n    Any person of good moral character may become a member of this\r\n    society by accepting the constitution and paying one dollar\r\n    a year to the national society, or a life membership fee of\r\n    twenty dollars.\r\n\r\n    Each member of the society shall have a vote, by mail or\r\n    otherwise, for all officers of the national society, and on all\r\n    principles and policies adopted.\r\n\r\n        O.

Even then I didn’t do the convincing—but Ted knows now that I\r\nwas right. He tried to get an ad. from a certain baking powder concern\r\nthat was mixed up in a scandal over in Missouri not so long ago. Its\r\nproduct is claimed to be “absolutely pure,” but the Missourians were\r\n“shown” that some of its agents couldn’t truthfully say as much of\r\nthemselves or their concern.\r\n\r\nI’m right glad Ted got the icy stare. We need the money, no doubt—but\r\n“alum baking powders” won’t seriously impair our digestion. And we’ll\r\nfeel better not to have had the ad., after all.\r\n\r\n“Why, Flaacke,” said the man who places the advertising, “if WATSON’S\r\nMAGAZINE had a million circulation and the rate was a dollar a page, I\r\ndoubt if we would use it.”\r\n\r\nYet some poor, simple souls still think business men—big, brainy,\r\nsuccessful business men—never mix politics and business. They do. And I\r\ntrust our people will not forget it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEver notice how a late train keeps falling behind and getting later and\r\nlater the farther she goes?\r\n\r\nWell, we had an experience similar last month with the February number.\r\nA combination of circumstances made it certain that we should be a few\r\ndays late—say two or three. But in our wildest dreams we never imagined\r\nbeing over two weeks late. One after another something new arose to still\r\nfurther delay us.\r\n\r\nI can sympathize now with the railroad station agent who is obliged to\r\ntell passenger after passenger that “No. 23 is 40 minutes late.... Yes,\r\nshe’s due here at 11:44.... Yes, that would bring her here about 12:24.”\r\nAnd so on and on and on. From Mr. Watson’s editorials, however, I take\r\nit that station agents on the Southern Railway give out no information\r\nregarding late trains. Maybe they will after Hon. Hoke Smith is\r\ninaugurated governor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnybody inquire why the February WATSON’S didn’t come? My dear friend,\r\nyou would think so if you could see the stacks of letters and postal\r\ncards which poured in—hundreds and hundreds; yes, thousands, I believe.\r\nIt made us a great amount of additional work and worry, but—\r\n\r\nOn the whole, we’re rather glad the February number was late, because it\r\ngave us conclusive proof of the high esteem in which WATSON’S MAGAZINE\r\nis held. People don’t worry and write postal cards and letters about\r\npublications in which they are not interested, that’s a cinch.\r\n\r\nA few of the Old Guard were frightened. They thought we’d suspended!\r\nI can’t blame them for that. It has always been a rocky road for any\r\nradical publication, and especially so if it advocates Populism. But\r\nWATSON’S MAGAZINE will be an exception. Nothing but the accomplishment of\r\nthe reforms for which it stands could kill it. That might, by removing\r\nthe necessity for such a magazine, but not necessarily. The discontent\r\nof the masses is too great now not to furnish a most fertile field for\r\nMr. Watson’s teachings—and his influence is growing at a tremendous pace.\r\nEven his enemies admit that. And that means a pronounced success for\r\nWATSON’S MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThanks to the Old Guard, Watson’s Magazine gets subscribers at less\r\ncost than any other publication. Everywhere these old veterans are\r\nplugging away for subscribers and scarcely one of them will take a cent\r\nof commission for his work. Some of the other magazines are spending a\r\nfortune in newspaper advertising, and, of course, building up big lists;\r\nbut we are well satisfied with a slower growth of subscriptions that will\r\nstay with us year after year. February is forging to the front in fine\r\nstyle and we shall more than double our list by the end of March.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Figures won’t lie,” asserts the oracle. “Thet’s so,” retorts the plain,\r\nold, common-sense man, “but liars kin figger.” And the old fellow is\r\nright. Witness some of the stunts done by Carroll D. Wright as to the\r\nincreased cost of living, and young Garfield’s showing of a net profit\r\nto the Beef Trust of a dollar, “marked down to 99 cents,” on each steer\r\nslaughtered.\r\n\r\nMy old colleague, T. H. Tibbles, Mr. Watson’s running mate in 1904, and\r\nnow editor of a 25-cent-a-year Populist weekly at Omaha, Neb., _The\r\nInvestigator_, was editor of the _Nebraska Independent_ when young\r\nGarfield made that justly famous report. As I recollect, Tibbles figured\r\nthat the Beef Trust must have a secret railroad (not a rebate) to Mars\r\nand had smuggled in countless thousands of beef cattle from that little,\r\nold red planet, contrary to the Dingley Bill “in such case made and\r\nprovided,” because—\r\n\r\nThere weren’t enough beef steers on this old earth of ours—and haven’t\r\nbeen since the days when Christ drove the “System” out of the Temple—to\r\naccount for the Beef Trust’s fortune at 99 cents per.\r\n\r\nI have never examined Tibbles as to his proficiency in arithmetic,\r\nbut I’m willing to bet a hat—a wide-brim “Cady” (Eugene Wood, please\r\nanalyze)—that Tibbles either made a Sherlock Holmes “deduction” regarding\r\nthat Martian railroad, or—\r\n\r\nPerish the thought, that the martyred President’s son—well, had been\r\ndoing some “figgerin’” and other things.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI’ve been doing some real hard figgerin’. The P. O. D., which means in\r\nproper spelling, Post Office Department, insists that because we change\r\nto WATSON’S MAGAZINE, dropping the “Tom,” that we must apply for a new\r\nentry as second-class matter. Of course, as a matter of fact, as our\r\nlegal friends remark—no, I won’t say that, in view of what Abe Hummel\r\ndid and what Jerome is failing to do—our _lawyer_ friends, rather, we\r\nnever have been “second-class.” That’s a way Madden has of irritating\r\npublishers. TOM WATSON’S MAGAZINE always was _first-class_—now, wasn’t it?\r\n\r\nAt any rate, we have to tell the P. O. D. how many subscribers we have;\r\nhow many we sell at news-stands, etc. Of the subscribers, we must show\r\nhow many came direct, how many took a premium, how many subscribed\r\nthrough an agent or a newspaper clubbing with us.\r\n\r\nIt’s a big job to get this correct, because right now we’re swamped with\r\nnew subscriptions and renewals. I think I got it right, however, and as\r\nthe figures may interest you, I shall give you an idea what each State is\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nGeorgia still keeps far in the lead. Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Nebraska,\r\nNew York, Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee, Illinois and Kansas follow in\r\nthe order named, ranging from two to fifteen per cent of the total.\r\n\r\nFlorida, North Carolina, California, Louisiana, Indiana, South Carolina,\r\nOhio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Iowa and Oklahoma—in the order named—have\r\nless than two and one or more than one per cent. of the total.\r\n\r\nWashington, Virginia, New Jersey, Minnesota, Michigan, Colorado, West\r\nVirginia, Montana, Massachusetts, Indian Territory, Idaho, Wisconsin,\r\nOregon, North and South Dakota (tied), Connecticut, New Mexico, Maine,\r\nArizona, Maryland, District of Columbia, Wyoming, Nevada, New Hampshire,\r\nVermont, Canada and Rhode Island follow in the order named, each with\r\none-tenth of one per cent. or more up to nine-tenths of one per cent.\r\n\r\nAnd three-tenths of one per cent. of the total goes to Alaska, Cuba,\r\nDelaware, Hawaii, Mexico, Panama, Philippine Islands, Porto Rico, Utah\r\nand a number of European countries. WATSON’S MAGAZINE is not only\r\nnational but international. Up in Nova Scotia, Manitoba, and Northwest\r\nTerritory the radicals are enthusiastic over it. Uncle Sam’s soldiers and\r\nsailors are taking it in the far corners of the earth. The War Department\r\nhas asked for subscription rates.\r\n\r\nYet WATSON’S MAGAZINE reaches more people in the Sunny Southland than\r\nmost any other magazine, whether published south of Mason and Dixon’s\r\nline or north of it.\r\n\r\nAnd it will bring business for the advertiser who wishes to break into\r\nthe Southern field, because every subscriber and news stand buyer has\r\nconfidence in Mr. Watson. Oh, dear, I forgot. Advertising isn’t my line\r\nat all. See Ted Flaacke about that. He knows. But I know I’m right,\r\nnevertheless.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _C.

LAFFITTE\r\n\r\n\r\n    I knew no love but hers, nor cared to know,\r\n    She grieved and did not hide from me her grief that this was so.\r\n    I shut my heart with jealous care about her glowing face,\r\n    Her voice, her eyes, her lips, her woman’s sweet and tender grace.\r\n    I snatched her hands away when she caressed a wounded dove,\r\n    I envied all she looked on, grudged each smile, and called it love.\r\n\r\n    She died, I saw her lying there so still and cold and sweet.\r\n    Her roses flung their fragrance unheeded at her feet;\r\n    I laid my face against her own, her white soul spoke to mine\r\n    And warm across my frozen heart a bright light seemed to shine.\r\n    With aching arms I drew a suffering world into my life\r\n    And, chastened, learned too late that I had never loved my wife.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf Vital Importance to Patriotic Citizens\r\n\r\nNational Documents\r\n\r\na collection of notable state papers chronologically arranged to form a\r\ndocumentary history of this country.
