It is practical in the highest\r\ndegree, while running over with fresh speculation that seeks everywhere\r\nthe well-being of society by growth of material and moral power.  There\r\nis a wonderful fertility of mind, and almost whimsical precision of\r\ndetail, with good sense and good humour to form the groundwork of a happy\r\nEnglish style.  Defoe in this book ran again and again into sound\r\nsuggestions that first came to be realised long after he was dead.  Upon\r\none subject, indeed, the education of women, we have only just now caught\r\nhim up.  Defoe wrote the book in 1692 or 1693, when his age was a year or\r\ntwo over thirty, and he published it in 1697.\r\n\r\nDefoe was the son of James Foe, of St. Giles’s, Cripplegate, whose family\r\nhad owned grazing land in the country, and who himself throve as a meat\r\nsalesman in London.  James Foe went to Cripplegate Church, where the\r\nminister was Dr. Annesley.  But in 1662, a year after the birth of Daniel\r\nFoe, Dr. Annesley was one of the three thousand clergymen who were driven\r\nout of their benefices by the Act of Uniformity.  James Foe was then one\r\nof the congregation that followed him into exile, and looked up to him as\r\nspiritual guide when he was able to open a meeting-house in Little St.\r\nHelen’s.  Thus Daniel Foe, not yet De Foe, was trained under the\r\ninfluence of Dr. Annesley, and by his advice sent to the Academy at\r\nNewington Green, where Charles Morton, a good Oxford scholar, trained\r\nyoung men for the pulpits of the Nonconformists.  In later days, when\r\ndriven to America by the persecution of opinion, Morton became\r\nVice-President of Harvard College.  Charles Morton sought to include in\r\nhis teaching at Newington Green a training in such knowledge of current\r\nhistory as would show his boys the origin and meaning of the\r\ncontroversies of the day in which, as men, they might hereafter take\r\ntheir part.  He took pains, also, to train them in the use of English.\r\n“We were not,” Defoe said afterwards, “destitute of language, but we were\r\nmade masters of English; and more of us excelled in that particular than\r\nof any school at that time.”\r\n\r\nDaniel Foe did not pass on into the ministry for which he had been\r\ntrained.  He said afterwards, in his “Review,” “It was my disaster first\r\nto be set apart for, and then to be set apart from, the honour of that\r\nsacred employ.”  At the age of about nineteen he went into business as a\r\nhose factor in Freeman’s Court, Cornhill.  He may have bought succession\r\nto a business, or sought to make one in a way of life that required no\r\ncapital.  He acted simply as broker between the manufacturer and the\r\nretailer.  He remained at the business in Freeman’s Court for seven\r\nyears, subject to political distractions.  In 1683, still in the reign of\r\nCharles the Second, Daniel Foe, aged twenty-two, published a pamphlet\r\ncalled “Presbytery Roughdrawn.”  Charles died on the 6th of February,\r\n1685.  On the 14th of the next June the Duke of Monmouth landed at Lyme\r\nwith eighty-three followers, hoping that Englishmen enough would flock\r\nabout his standard to overthrow the Government of James the Second, for\r\nwhose exclusion, as a Roman Catholic, from the succession to the throne\r\nthere had been so long a struggle in his brother’s reign.  Daniel Foe\r\ntook leave of absence from his business in Freeman’s Court, joined\r\nMonmouth, and shared the defeat at Sedgmoor on the 6th of July.  Judge\r\nJeffreys then made progress through the West, and Daniel Foe escaped from\r\nhis clutches.  On the 15th of July Monmouth was executed.  Daniel Foe\r\nfound it convenient at that time to pay personal attention to some\r\nbusiness affairs in Spain.  His name suggests an English reading of a\r\nSpanish name, Foà, and more than once in his life there are indications\r\nof friends in Spain about whom we know nothing.  Daniel Foe went to Spain\r\nin the time of danger to his life, for taking part in the rebellion of\r\nthe Duke of Monmouth, and when he came back he wrote himself De Foe.  He\r\nmay have heard pedigree discussed among his Spanish friends; he may have\r\nwished to avoid drawing attention to a name entered under the letter F in\r\na list of rebels.  He may have played on the distinction between himself\r\nand his father, still living, that one was Mr. Foe, the other Mr. D. Foe.\r\nHe may have meant to write much, and wishing to be a friend to his\r\ncountry, meant also to deprive punsters of the opportunity of calling him\r\na Foe.  Whatever his chief reason for the change, we may be sure that it\r\nwas practical.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1687, James the Second issued a Declaration for Liberty of\r\nConscience in England, by which he suspended penal laws against all Roman\r\nCatholics and Nonconformists, and dispensed with oaths and tests\r\nestablished by the law.  This was a stretch of the king’s prerogative\r\nthat produced results immediately welcome to the Nonconformists, who sent\r\nup addresses of thanks.  Defoe saw clearly that a king who is thanked for\r\noverruling an unwelcome law has the whole point conceded to him of right\r\nto overrule the law.  In that sense he wrote, “A Letter containing some\r\nReflections on His Majesty’s Declaration for Liberty of Conscience,” to\r\nwarn the Nonconformists of the great mistake into which some were\r\nfalling.  “Was ever anything,” he asked afterwards, “more absurd than\r\nthis conduct of King James and his party, in wheedling the Dissenters;\r\ngiving them liberty of conscience by his own arbitrary dispensing\r\nauthority, and his expecting they should be content with their religious\r\nliberty at the price of the Constitution?”  In the letter itself he\r\npointed out that “the king’s suspending of laws strikes at the root of\r\nthis whole Government, and subverts it quite.  The Lords and Commons have\r\nsuch a share in it, that no law can be either made, repealed, or, which\r\nis all one, suspended, but by their consent.”\r\n\r\nIn January, 1688, Defoe having inherited the freedom of the City of\r\nLondon, took it up, and signed his name in the Chamberlain’s book, on the\r\n26th of that month, without the “de,” “Daniel Foe.”  On the 5th of\r\nNovember, 1688, there was another landing, that of William of Orange, in\r\nTorbay, which threatened the government of James the Second.  Defoe again\r\nrode out, met the army of William at Henley-on-Thames, and joined its\r\nsecond line as a volunteer.  He was present when it was resolved, on the\r\n13th of February, 1689, that the flight of James had been an abdication;\r\nand he was one of the mounted citizens who formed a guard of honour when\r\nWilliam and Mary paid their first visit to Guildhall.\r\n\r\nDefoe was at this time twenty-eight years old, married, and living in a\r\nhouse at Tooting, where he had also been active in foundation of a\r\nchapel.  From hose factor he had become merchant adventurer in trade with\r\nSpain, and is said by one writer of his time to have been a “civet-cat\r\nmerchant.”  Failing then in some venture in 1692, he became bankrupt, and\r\nhad one vindictive creditor who, according to the law of those days, had\r\npower to shut him in prison, and destroy all power of recovering his loss\r\nand putting himself straight with the world.  Until his other creditors\r\nhad conquered that one enemy, and could give him freedom to earn money\r\nagain and pay his debts—when that time came he proved his sense of\r\nhonesty to much larger than the letter of the law—Defoe left London for\r\nBristol, and there kept out of the way of arrest.  He was visible only on\r\nSunday, and known, therefore, as “the Sunday Gentleman.”  His lodging was\r\nat the Red Lion Inn, in Castle Street.  The house, no longer an inn,\r\nstill stands, as numbers 80 and 81 in that street.  There Defoe wrote\r\nthis “Essay on Projects.”  He was there until 1694, when he received\r\noffers that would have settled him prosperously in business at Cadiz, but\r\nhe held by his country.  The cheek on free action was removed, and the\r\nGovernment received with favour a project of his, which is not included\r\nin the Essay, “for raising money to supply the occasions of the war then\r\nnewly begun.”  He had also a project for the raising of money to supply\r\nhis own occasions by the establishment of pantile works, which proved\r\nsuccessful.  Defoe could not be idle.  In a desert island he would, like\r\nhis Robinson Crusoe, have spent time, not in lamentation, but in steady\r\nwork to get away.\r\n\r\n                                                                     H. M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR’S PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TO DALBY THOMAS, ESQ.,\r\n\r\n_One of the Commission’s for Managing His majesty’s Duties on Glass_,\r\n_&c._\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nTHIS preface comes directed to you, not as commissioner, &c., under whom\r\nI have the honour to serve his Majesty, nor as a friend, though I have\r\ngreat obligations of that sort also, but as the most proper judge of the\r\nsubjects treated of, and more capable than the greatest part of mankind\r\nto distinguish and understand them.\r\n\r\nBooks are useful only to such whose genius are suitable to the subject of\r\nthem; and to dedicate a book of projects to a person who had never\r\nconcerned himself to think that way would be like music to one that has\r\nno ear.\r\n\r\nAnd yet your having a capacity to judge of these things no way brings you\r\nunder the despicable title of a projector, any more than knowing the\r\npractices and subtleties of wicked men makes a man guilty of their\r\ncrimes.\r\n\r\nThe several chapters of this book are the results of particular thoughts\r\noccasioned by conversing with the public affairs during the present war\r\nwith France.  The losses and casualties which attend all trading nations\r\nin the world, when involved in so cruel a war as this, have reached us\r\nall, and I am none of the least sufferers; if this has put me, as well as\r\nothers, on inventions and projects, so much the subject of this book, it\r\nis no more than a proof of the reason I give for the general projecting\r\nhumour of the nation.\r\n\r\nOne unhappiness I lie under in the following book, viz.: That having kept\r\nthe greatest part of it by me for near five years, several of the\r\nthoughts seem to be hit by other hands, and some by the public, which\r\nturns the tables upon me, as if I had borrowed from them.\r\n\r\nAs particularly that of the seamen, which you know well I had contrived\r\nlong before the Act for registering seamen was proposed.  And that of\r\neducating women, which I think myself bound to declare, was formed long\r\nbefore the book called “Advice to the Ladies” was made public; and yet I\r\ndo not write this to magnify my own invention, but to acquit myself from\r\ngrafting on other people’s thoughts.  If I have trespassed upon any\r\nperson in the world, it is upon yourself, from whom I had some of the\r\nnotions about county banks, and factories for goods, in the chapter of\r\nbanks; and yet I do not think that my proposal for the women or the\r\nseamen clashes at all, either with that book, or the public method of\r\nregistering seamen.\r\n\r\nI have been told since this was done that my proposal for a commission of\r\ninquiries into bankrupt estates is borrowed from the Dutch; if there is\r\nanything like it among the Dutch, it is more than ever I knew, or know\r\nyet; but if so, I hope it is no objection against our having the same\r\nhere, especially if it be true that it would be so publicly beneficial as\r\nis expressed.\r\n\r\nWhat is said of friendly societies, I think no man will dispute with me,\r\nsince one has met with so much success already in the practice of it.  I\r\nmean the Friendly Society for Widows, of which you have been pleased to\r\nbe a governor.\r\n\r\nFriendly societies are very extensive, and, as I have hinted, might be\r\ncarried on to many particulars.  I have omitted one which was mentioned\r\nin discourse with yourself, where a hundred tradesmen, all of several\r\ntrades, agree together to buy whatever they want of one another, and\r\nnowhere else, prices and payments to be settled among themselves; whereby\r\nevery man is sure to have ninety-nine customers, and can never want a\r\ntrade; and I could have filled up the book with instances of like nature,\r\nbut I never designed to fire the reader with particulars.\r\n\r\nThe proposal of the pension office you will soon see offered to the\r\npublic as an attempt for the relief of the poor; which, if it meets with\r\nencouragement, will every way answer all the great things I have said of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI had wrote a great many sheets about the coin, about bringing in plate\r\nto the Mint, and about our standard; but so many great heads being upon\r\nit, with some of whom my opinion does not agree, I would not adventure to\r\nappear in print upon that subject.\r\n\r\nWays and means also I have laid by on the same score: only adhering to\r\nthis one point, that be it by taxing the wares they sell, be it by taxing\r\nthem in stock, be it by composition—which, by the way, I believe is the\r\nbest—be it by what way soever the Parliament please, the retailers are\r\nthe men who seem to call upon us to be taxed; if not by their own\r\nextraordinary good circumstances, though that might bear it, yet by the\r\ncontrary in all other degrees of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nBesides, the retailers are the only men who could pay it with least\r\ndamage, because it is in their power to levy it again upon their\r\ncustomers in the prices of their goods, and is no more than paying a\r\nhigher rent for their shops.\r\n\r\nThe retailers of manufactures, especially so far as relates to the inland\r\ntrade, have never been taxed yet, and their wealth or number is not\r\neasily calculated.  Trade and land has been handled roughly enough, and\r\nthese are the men who now lie as a reserve to carry on the burden of the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThese are the men who, were the land tax collected as it should be, ought\r\nto pay the king more than that whole Bill ever produced; and yet these\r\nare the men who, I think I may venture to say, do not pay a twentieth\r\npart in that Bill.\r\n\r\nShould the king appoint a survey over the assessors, and indict all those\r\nwho were found faulty, allowing a reward to any discoverer of an\r\nassessment made lower than the literal sense of the Act implies, what a\r\nregister of frauds and connivances would be found out!\r\n\r\nIn a general tax, if any should be excused, it should be the poor, who\r\nare not able to pay, or at least are pinched in the necessary parts of\r\nlife by paying.  And yet here a poor labourer, who works for twelve pence\r\nor eighteen pence a day, does not drink a pot of beer but pays the king a\r\ntenth part for excise; and really pays more to the king’s taxes in a year\r\nthan a country shopkeeper, who is alderman of the town, worth perhaps two\r\nor three thousand pounds, brews his own beer, pays no excise, and in the\r\nland-tax is rated it may be at £100, and pays £1 4s. per annum, but\r\nought, if the Act were put in due execution, to pay £36 per annum to the\r\nking.\r\n\r\nIf I were to be asked how I would remedy this, I would answer, it should\r\nbe by some method in which every man may be taxed in the due proportion\r\nto his estate, and the Act put in execution, according to the true intent\r\nand meaning of it, in order to which a commission of assessment should be\r\ngranted to twelve men, such as his Majesty should be well satisfied of,\r\nwho should go through the whole kingdom, three in a body, and should make\r\na new assessment of personal estates, not to meddle with land.\r\n\r\nTo these assessors should all the old rates, parish books, poor rates,\r\nand highway rates, also be delivered; and upon due inquiry to be made\r\ninto the manner of living, and reputed wealth of the people, the stock or\r\npersonal estate of every man should be assessed, without connivance; and\r\nhe who is reputed to be worth a thousand pounds should be taxed at a\r\nthousand pounds, and so on; and he who was an overgrown rich tradesman of\r\ntwenty or thirty thousand pounds estate should be taxed so, and plain\r\nEnglish and plain dealing be practised indifferently throughout the\r\nkingdom; tradesmen and landed men should have neighbours’ fare, as we\r\ncall it, and a rich man should not be passed by when a poor man pays.\r\n\r\nWe read of the inhabitants of Constantinople, that they suffered their\r\ncity to be lost for want of contributing in time for its defence, and\r\npleaded poverty to their generous emperor when he went from house to\r\nhouse to persuade them; and yet when the Turks took it, the prodigious\r\nimmense wealth they found in it, made them wonder at the sordid temper of\r\nthe citizens.\r\n\r\nEngland (with due exceptions to the Parliament, and the freedom wherewith\r\nthey have given to the public charge) is much like Constantinople; we are\r\ninvolved in a dangerous, a chargeable, but withal a most just and\r\nnecessary war, and the richest and moneyed men in the kingdom plead\r\npoverty; and the French, or King James, or the devil may come for them,\r\nif they can but conceal their estates from the public notice, and get the\r\nassessors to tax them at an under rate.\r\n\r\nThese are the men this commission would discover; and here they should\r\nfind men taxed at £500 stock who are worth £20,000.  Here they should\r\nfind a certain rich man near Hackney rated to-day in the tax-book at\r\n£1,000 stock, and to-morrow offering £27,000 for an estate.\r\n\r\nHere they should find Sir J— C— perhaps taxed to the king at £5,000\r\nstock, perhaps not so much, whose cash no man can guess at; and\r\nmultitudes of instances I could give by name without wrong to the\r\ngentlemen.\r\n\r\nAnd, not to run on in particulars, I affirm that in the land-tax ten\r\ncertain gentlemen in London put together did not pay for half so much\r\npersonal estate, called stock, as the poorest of them is reputed really\r\nto possess.\r\n\r\nI do not inquire at whose door this fraud must lie; it is none of my\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nI wish they would search into it whose power can punish it.  But this,\r\nwith submission, I presume to say: The king is thereby defrauded and\r\nhorribly abused, the true intent and meaning of Acts of Parliament\r\nevaded, the nation involved in debt by fatal deficiencies and interests,\r\nfellow-subjects abused, and new inventions for taxes occasioned.\r\n\r\nThe last chapter in this book is a proposal about entering all the seamen\r\nin England into the king’s pay—a subject which deserves to be enlarged\r\ninto a book itself; and I have a little volume of calculations and\r\nparticulars by me on that head, but I thought them too long to publish.\r\nIn short, I am persuaded, was that method proposed to those gentlemen to\r\nwhom such things belong, the greatest sum of money might be raised by it,\r\nwith the least injury to those who pay it, that ever was or will be\r\nduring the war.\r\n\r\nProjectors, they say, are generally to be taken with allowance of\r\none-half at least; they always have their mouths full of millions, and\r\ntalk big of their own proposals.  And therefore I have not exposed the\r\nvast sums my calculations amount to; but I venture to say I could procure\r\na farm on such a proposal as this at three millions per annum, and give\r\nvery good security for payment—such an opinion I have of the value of\r\nsuch a method; and when that is done, the nation would get three more by\r\npaying it, which is very strange, but might easily be made out.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter of academies I have ventured to reprove the vicious custom\r\nof swearing.  I shall make no apology for the fact, for no man ought to\r\nbe ashamed of exposing what all men ought to be ashamed of practising.\r\nBut methinks I stand corrected by my own laws a little, in forcing the\r\nreader to repeat some of the worst of our vulgar imprecations, in reading\r\nmy thoughts against it; to which, however, I have this to reply:\r\n\r\nFirst, I did not find it easy to express what I mean without putting down\r\nthe very words—at least, not so as to be very intelligible.\r\n\r\nSecondly, why should words repeated only to expose the vice, taint the\r\nreader more than a sermon preached against lewdness should the\r\nassembly?—for of necessity it leads the hearer to the thoughts of the\r\nfact.  But the morality of every action lies in the end; and if the\r\nreader by ill-use renders himself guilty of the fact in reading, which I\r\ndesigned to expose by writing, the fault is his, not mine.\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured everywhere in this book to be as concise as possible,\r\nexcept where calculations obliged me to be particular; and having avoided\r\nimpertinence in the book, I would avoid it too, in the preface, and\r\ntherefore shall break off with subscribing myself,\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\n                    Your most obliged, humble servant\r\n\r\n                                                                     D. F.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR’S INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nNECESSITY, which is allowed to be the mother of invention, has so\r\nviolently agitated the wits of men at this time that it seems not at all\r\nimproper, by way of distinction, to call it the Projecting Age.  For\r\nthough in times of war and public confusions the like humour of invention\r\nhas seemed to stir, yet, without being partial to the present, it is, I\r\nthink, no injury to say the past ages have never come up to the degree of\r\nprojecting and inventing, as it refers to matters of negotiation and\r\nmethods of civil polity, which we see this age arrived to.\r\n\r\nNor is it a hard matter to assign probable causes of the perfection in\r\nthis modern art.  I am not of their melancholy opinion who ascribe it to\r\nthe general poverty of the nation, since I believe it is easy to prove\r\nthe nation itself, taking it as one general stock, is not at all\r\ndiminished or impoverished by this long, this chargeable war, but, on the\r\ncontrary, was never richer since it was inhabited.\r\n\r\nNor am I absolutely of the opinion that we are so happy as to be wiser in\r\nthis age than our forefathers; though at the same time I must own some\r\nparts of knowledge in science as well as art have received improvements\r\nin this age altogether concealed from the former.\r\n\r\nThe art of war, which I take to be the highest perfection of human\r\nknowledge, is a sufficient proof of what I say, especially in conducting\r\narmies and in offensive engines.  Witness the now ways of rallies,\r\nfougades, entrenchments, attacks, lodgments, and a long _et cetera_ of\r\nnew inventions which want names, practised in sieges and encampments;\r\nwitness the new forts of bombs and unheard-of mortars, of seven to ten\r\nton weight, with which our fleets, standing two or three miles off at\r\nsea, can imitate God Almighty Himself and rain fire and brimstone out of\r\nheaven, as it were, upon towns built on the firm land; witness also our\r\nnew-invented child of hell, the machine which carries thunder, lightning,\r\nand earthquakes in its bowels, and tears up the most impregnable\r\nfortification.\r\n\r\nBut if I would search for a cause from whence it comes to pass that this\r\nage swarms with such a multitude of projectors more than usual,\r\nwho—besides the innumerable conceptions, which die in the bringing forth,\r\nand (like abortions of the brain) only come into the air and dissolve—do\r\nreally every day produce new contrivances, engines, and projects to get\r\nmoney, never before thought of; if, I say, I would examine whence this\r\ncomes to pass, it must be thus:\r\n\r\nThe losses and depredations which this war brought with it at first were\r\nexceeding many, suffered chiefly by the ill-conduct of merchants\r\nthemselves, who did not apprehend the danger to be really what it was:\r\nfor before our Admiralty could possibly settle convoys, cruisers, and\r\nstations for men-of-war all over the world, the French covered the sea\r\nwith their privateers and took an incredible number of our ships.  I have\r\nheard the loss computed, by those who pretended they were able to guess,\r\nat above fifteen millions of pounds sterling, in ships and goods, in the\r\nfirst two or three years of the war—a sum which, if put into French,\r\nwould make such a rumbling sound of great numbers as would fright a weak\r\naccountant out of his belief, being no less than one hundred and ninety\r\nmillions of _livres_.  The weight of this loss fell chiefly on the\r\ntrading part of the nation, and, amongst them, on the merchants; and\r\namongst them, again, upon the most refined capacities, as the insurers,\r\n&c.  And an incredible number of the best merchants in the kingdom sunk\r\nunder the load, as may appear a little by a Bill which once passed the\r\nHouse of Commons for the relief of merchant-insurers, who had suffered by\r\nthe war with France.  If a great many fell, much greater were the number\r\nof those who felt a sensible ebb of their fortunes, and with difficulty\r\nbore up under the loss of great part of their estates.  These, prompted\r\nby necessity, rack their wits for new contrivances, new inventions, new\r\ntrades, stocks, projects, and anything to retrieve the desperate credit\r\nof their fortunes.  That this is probable to be the cause will appear\r\nfurther thus.  France (though I do not believe all the great outcries we\r\nmake of their misery and distress—if one-half of which be true, they are\r\ncertainly the best subjects in the world) yet without question has felt\r\nits share of the losses and damages of the war; but the poverty there\r\nfalling chiefly on the poorer sort of people, they have not been so\r\nfruitful in inventions and practices of this nature, their genius being\r\nquite of another strain.  As for the gentry and more capable sort, the\r\nfirst thing a Frenchman flies to in his distress is the army; and he\r\nseldom comes back from thence to get an estate by painful industry, but\r\neither has his brains knocked out or makes his fortune there.\r\n\r\nIf industry be in any business rewarded with success it is in the\r\nmerchandising part of the world, who indeed may more truly be said to\r\nlive by their wits than any people whatsoever.  All foreign negotiation,\r\nthough to some it is a plain road by the help of custom, yet is in its\r\nbeginning all project, contrivance, and invention.  Every new voyage the\r\nmerchant contrives is a project; and ships are sent from port to port, as\r\nmarkets and merchandises differ, by the help of strange and universal\r\nintelligence—wherein some are so exquisite, so swift, and so exact, that\r\na merchant sitting at home in his counting-house at once converses with\r\nall parts of the known world.  This and travel make a true-bred merchant\r\nthe most intelligent man in the world, and consequently the most capable,\r\nwhen urged by necessity, to contrive new ways to live.  And from hence, I\r\nhumbly conceive, may very properly be derived the projects, so much the\r\nsubject of the present discourse.  And to this sort of men it is easy to\r\ntrace the original of banks, stocks, stock-jobbing, assurances, friendly\r\nsocieties, lotteries, and the like.\r\n\r\nTo this may be added the long annual inquiry in the House of Commons for\r\nways and means, which has been a particular movement to set all the heads\r\nof the nation at work; and I appeal, with submission, to the gentlemen of\r\nthat honourable House, if the greatest part of all the ways and means out\r\nof the common road of land taxes, polls, and the like, have not been\r\nhanded to them from the merchant, and in a great measure paid by them\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nHowever, I offer this but as an essay at the original of this prevailing\r\nhumour of the people; and as it is probable, so it is also possible to be\r\notherwise, which I submit to future demonstration.\r\n\r\nOf the several ways this faculty of projecting have exerted itself, and\r\nof the various methods, as the genius of the authors has inclined, I have\r\nbeen a diligent observer and, in most, an unconcerned spectator, and\r\nperhaps have some advantage from thence more easily to discover the _faux\r\npas_ of the actors.  If I have given an essay towards anything new, or\r\nmade discovery to advantage of any contrivance now on foot, all men are\r\nat the liberty to make use of the improvement; if any fraud is\r\ndiscovered, as now practised, it is without any particular reflection\r\nupon parties or persons.\r\n\r\nProjects of the nature I treat about are doubtless in general of public\r\nadvantage, as they tend to improvement of trade, and employment of the\r\npoor, and the circulation and increase of the public stock of the\r\nkingdom; but this is supposed of such as are built on the honest basis of\r\ningenuity and improvement, in which, though I will allow the author to\r\naim primarily at his own advantage, yet with the circumstances of public\r\nbenefit added.\r\n\r\nWherefore it is necessary to distinguish among the projects of the\r\npresent times between the honest and the dishonest.\r\n\r\nThere are, and that too many, fair pretences of fine discoveries, new\r\ninventions, engines, and I know not what, which—being advanced in notion,\r\nand talked up to great things to be performed when such and such sums of\r\nmoney shall be advanced, and such and such engines are made—have raised\r\nthe fancies of credulous people to such a height that, merely on the\r\nshadow of expectation, they have formed companies, chose committees,\r\nappointed officers, shares, and books, raised great stocks, and cried up\r\nan empty notion to that degree that people have been betrayed to part\r\nwith their money for shares in a new nothing; and when the inventors have\r\ncarried on the jest till they have sold all their own interest, they\r\nleave the cloud to vanish of itself, and the poor purchasers to quarrel\r\nwith one another, and go to law about settlements, transferrings, and\r\nsome bone or other thrown among them by the subtlety of the author to lay\r\nthe blame of the miscarriage upon themselves.  Thus the shares at first\r\nbegin to fall by degrees, and happy is he that sells in time; till, like\r\nbrass money, it will go at last for nothing at all.  So have I seen\r\nshares in joint-stocks, patents, engines, and undertakings, blown up by\r\nthe air of great words, and the name of some man of credit concerned, to\r\n£100 for a five-hundredth part or share (some more), and at last dwindle\r\naway till it has been stock-jobbed down to £10, £12, £9, £8 a share, and\r\nat last no buyer (that is, in short, the fine new word for\r\nnothing-worth), and many families ruined by the purchase.  If I should\r\nname linen manufactures, saltpetre-works, copper mines, diving engines,\r\ndipping, and the like, for instances of this, I should, I believe, do no\r\nwrong to truth, or to some persons too visibly guilty.\r\n\r\nI might go on upon this subject to expose the frauds and tricks of\r\nstock-jobbers, engineers, patentees, committees, with those Exchange\r\nmountebanks we very properly call brokers, but I have not gaul enough for\r\nsuch a work; but as a general rule of caution to those who would not be\r\ntricked out of their estates by such pretenders to new inventions, let\r\nthem observe that all such people who may be suspected of design have\r\nassuredly this in their proposal: your money to the author must go before\r\nthe experiment.  And here I could give a very diverting history of a\r\npatent-monger whose cully was nobody but myself, but I refer it to\r\nanother occasion.\r\n\r\nBut this is no reason why invention upon honest foundations and to fair\r\npurposes should not be encouraged; no, nor why the author of any such\r\nfair contrivances should not reap the harvest of his own ingenuity.  Our\r\nActs of Parliament for granting patents to first inventors for fourteen\r\nyears is a sufficient acknowledgment of the due regard which ought to be\r\nhad to such as find out anything which may be of public advantage; new\r\ndiscoveries in trade, in arts and mysteries, of manufacturing goods, or\r\nimprovement of land, are without question of as great benefit as any\r\ndiscoveries made in the works of nature by all the academies and royal\r\nsocieties in the world.\r\n\r\nThere is, it is true, a great difference between new inventions and\r\nprojects, between improvement of manufactures or lands (which tend to the\r\nimmediate benefit of the public, and employing of the poor), and projects\r\nframed by subtle heads with a sort of a _deceptio visus_ and legerdemain,\r\nto bring people to run needless and unusual hazards: I grant it, and give\r\na due preference to the first.  And yet success has so sanctified some of\r\nthose other sorts of projects that it would be a kind of blasphemy\r\nagainst fortune to disallow them.  Witness Sir William Phips’s voyage to\r\nthe wreck; it was a mere project; a lottery of a hundred thousand to one\r\nodds; a hazard which, if it had failed, everybody would have been ashamed\r\nto have owned themselves concerned in; a voyage that would have been as\r\nmuch ridiculed as Don Quixote’s adventure upon the windmill.  Bless us!\r\nthat folks should go three thousand miles to angle in the open sea for\r\npieces of eight!  Why, they would have made ballads of it, and the\r\nmerchants would have said of every unlikely adventure, “It, was like\r\nPhips’s wreck-voyage.”  But it had success, and who reflects upon the\r\nproject?\r\n\r\n   “Nothing’s so partial as the laws of fate,\r\n   Erecting blockheads to suppress the great.\r\n   Sir Francis Drake the Spanish plate-fleet won;\r\n   He had been a pirate if he had got none.\r\n   Sir Walter Raleigh strove, but missed the plate,\r\n   And therefore died a traitor to the State.\r\n   Endeavour bears a value more or less,\r\n   Just as ’tis recommended by success:\r\n   The lucky coxcomb ev’ry man will prize,\r\n   And prosp’rous actions always pass for wise.”\r\n\r\nHowever, this sort of projects comes under no reflection as to their\r\nhonesty, save that there is a kind of honesty a man owes to himself and\r\nto his family that prohibits him throwing away his estate in\r\nimpracticable, improbable adventures; but still some hit, even of the\r\nmost unlikely, of which this was one of Sir William Phips, who brought\r\nhome a cargo of silver of near £200,000 sterling, in pieces of eight,\r\nfished up out of the open sea, remote from any shore, from an old Spanish\r\nship which had been sunk above forty years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF PROJECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN I speak of writing a History of Projects, I do not mean either of\r\nthe introduction of, or continuing, necessary inventions, or the\r\nimprovement of arts and sciences before known, but a short account of\r\nprojects and projecting, as the word is allowed in the general\r\nacceptation at this present time; and I need not go far back for the\r\noriginal of the practice.\r\n\r\nInvention of arts, with engines and handicraft instruments for their\r\nimprovement, requires a chronology as far back as the eldest son of Adam,\r\nand has to this day afforded some new discovery in every age.\r\n\r\nThe building of the Ark by Noah, so far as you will allow it a human\r\nwork, was the first project I read of; and, no question, seemed so\r\nridiculous to the graver heads of that wise, though wicked, age that poor\r\nNoah was sufficiently bantered for it: and, had he not been set on work\r\nby a very peculiar direction from heaven, the good old man would\r\ncertainly have been laughed out of it as a most senseless ridiculous\r\nproject.\r\n\r\nThe building of Babel was a right project; for indeed the true definition\r\nof a project, according to modern acceptation, is, as is said before, a\r\nvast undertaking, too big to be managed, and therefore likely enough to\r\ncome to nothing.  And yet, as great as they are, it is certainly true of\r\nthem all, even as the projectors propose: that, according to the old\r\ntale, if so many eggs are hatched, there will be so many chickens, and\r\nthose chickens may lay so many eggs more, and those eggs produce so many\r\nchickens more, and so on.  Thus it was most certainly true that if the\r\npeople of the Old World could have built a house up to heaven, they\r\nshould never be drowned again on earth, and they only had forgot to\r\nmeasure the height; that is, as in other projects, it only miscarried, or\r\nelse it would have succeeded.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, when all is done, that very building, and the incredible height\r\nit was carried, is a demonstration of the vast knowledge of that infant\r\nage of the world, who had no advantage of the experiments or invention of\r\nany before themselves.\r\n\r\n   “Thus when our fathers, touched with guilt,\r\n   That huge stupendous staircase built;\r\n   We mock, indeed, the fruitless enterprise\r\n   (For fruitless actions seldom pass for wise),\r\n   But were the mighty ruins left, they’d show\r\n   To what degree that untaught age did know.”\r\n\r\nI believe a very diverting account might be given of this, but I shall\r\nnot attempt it.  Some are apt to say with Solomon, “No new thing happens\r\nunder the sun; but what is, has been:” yet I make no question but some\r\nconsiderable discovery has been made in these latter ages, and inventions\r\nof human origin produced, which the world was ever without before, either\r\nin whole or in part; and I refer only to two cardinal points, the use of\r\nthe loadstone at sea, and the use of gunpowder and guns: both which, as\r\nto the inventing part, I believe the world owes as absolutely to those\r\nparticular ages as it does the working in brass and iron to Tubal Cain,\r\nor the inventing of music to Jubal, his brother.  As to engines and\r\ninstruments for handicraftsmen, this age, I daresay, can show such as\r\nnever were so much as thought of, much less imitated before; for I do not\r\ncall that a real invention which has something before done like it—I\r\naccount that more properly an improvement.  For handicraft instruments, I\r\nknow none owes more to true genuine contrivance, without borrowing from\r\nany former use, than a mechanic engine contrived in our time called a\r\nknitting-frame, which, built with admirable symmetry, works really with a\r\nvery happy success, and may be observed by the curious to have a more\r\nthan ordinary composition; for which I refer to the engine itself, to be\r\nseen in every stocking-weaver’s garret.\r\n\r\nI shall trace the original of the projecting humour that now reigns no\r\nfarther back than the year 1680, dating its birth as a monster then,\r\nthough by times it had indeed something of life in the time of the late\r\ncivil war.  I allow, no age has been altogether without something of this\r\nnature, and some very happy projects are left to us as a taste of their\r\nsuccess; as the water-houses for supplying of the city of London with\r\nwater, and, since that, the New River—both very considerable\r\nundertakings, and perfect projects, adventured on the risk of success.\r\nIn the reign of King Charles I. infinite projects were set on foot for\r\nraising money without a Parliament: oppressing by monopolies and privy\r\nseals; but these are excluded our scheme as irregularities, for thus the\r\nFrench are as fruitful in projects as we; and these are rather stratagems\r\nthan projects.  After the Fire of London the contrivance of an engine to\r\nquench fires was a project the author was said to get well by, and we\r\nhave found to be very useful.  But about the year 1680 began the art and\r\nmystery of projecting to creep into the world.  Prince Rupert, uncle to\r\nKing Charles II., gave great encouragement to that part of it that\r\nrespects engines and mechanical motions; and Bishop Wilkins added as much\r\nof the theory to it as writing a book could do.  The prince has left us a\r\nmetal called by his name; and the first project upon that was, as I\r\nremember, casting of guns of that metal and boring them—done both by a\r\npeculiar method of his own, and which died with him, to the great loss of\r\nthe undertaker, who to that purpose had, with no small charge, erected a\r\nwater-mill at Hackney Marsh, known by the name of the Temple Mill, which\r\nmill very happily performed all parts of the work; and I have seen some\r\nof those guns on board the Royal Charles, a first-rate ship, being of a\r\nreddish colour, different either from brass or copper.  I have heard some\r\nreasons of state assigned why that project was not permitted to go\r\nforward; but I omit them, because I have no good authority for them.\r\nAfter this we saw a floating-machine, to be wrought with horses, for the\r\ntowing of great ships both against wind and tide; and another for the\r\nraising of ballast, which, as unperforming engines, had the honour of\r\nbeing made, exposed, tried, and laid by before the prince died.\r\n\r\nIf thus we introduce it into the world under the conduct of that prince,\r\nwhen he died it was left a hopeless brat, and had hardly any hand to own\r\nit, till the wreck-voyage before noted, performed so happily by Captain\r\nPhips, afterwards Sir William, whose strange performance set a great many\r\nheads on work to contrive something for themselves.  He was immediately\r\nfollowed by my Lord Mordant, Sir John Narborough, and others from several\r\nparts, whose success made them soon weary of the work.\r\n\r\nThe project of the Penny Post, so well known and still practised, I\r\ncannot omit, nor the contriver, Mr. Dockwra, who has had the honour to\r\nhave the injury done him in that affair repaired in some measure by the\r\npublic justice of the Parliament.  And, the experiment proving it to be a\r\nnoble and useful design, the author must be remembered, wherever mention\r\nis made of that affair, to his very great reputation.\r\n\r\nIt was, no question, a great hardship for a man to be master of so fine a\r\nthought, that had both the essential ends of a project in it (public good\r\nand private want), and that the public should reap the benefit and the\r\nauthor be left out; the injustice of which, no doubt, discouraged many a\r\ngood design.  But since an alteration in public circumstances has\r\nrecovered the lost attribute of justice, the like is not to be feared.\r\nAnd Mr. Dockwra has had the satisfaction to see the former injury\r\ndisowned, and an honourable return made, even by them who did not the\r\ninjury, in bare respect to his ingenuity.\r\n\r\nA while before this several people, under the patronage of some great\r\npersons, had engaged in planting of foreign colonies (as William Penn,\r\nthe Lord Shaftesbury, Dr. Cox, and others) in Pennsylvania, Carolina,\r\nEast and West Jersey, and the like places, which I do not call projects,\r\nbecause it was only prosecuting what had been formerly begun.  But here\r\nbegan the forming of public joint-stocks, which, together with the East\r\nIndia, African, and Hudson’s Bay Companies, before established, begot a\r\nnew trade, which we call by a new name stock-jobbing, which was at first\r\nonly the simple occasional transferring of interest and shares from one\r\nto another, as persons alienated their estates; but by the industry of\r\nthe Exchange brokers, who got the business into their hands, it became a\r\ntrade, and one perhaps managed with the greatest intrigue, artifice, and\r\ntrick that ever anything that appeared with a face of honesty could be\r\nhandled with; for while the brokers held the box, they made the whole\r\nExchange the gamesters, and raised and lowered the prices of stocks as\r\nthey pleased, and always had both buyers and sellers who stood ready\r\ninnocently to commit their money to the mercy of their mercenary tongues.\r\nThis upstart of a trade, having tasted the sweetness of success which\r\ngenerally attends a novel proposal, introduces the illegitimate wandering\r\nobject I speak of, as a proper engine to find work for the brokers.  Thus\r\nstock-jobbing nursed projecting, and projecting, in return, has very\r\ndiligently pimped for its foster-parent, till both are arrived to be\r\npublic grievances, and indeed are now almost grown scandalous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF PROJECTORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAN is the worst of all God’s creatures to shift for himself; no other\r\nanimal is ever starved to death; nature without has provided them both\r\nfood and clothes, and nature within has placed an instinct that never\r\nfails to direct them to proper means for a supply; but man must either\r\nwork or starve, slave or die.  He has indeed reason given him to direct\r\nhim, and few who follow the dictates of that reason come to such unhappy\r\nexigences; but when by the errors of a man’s youth he has reduced himself\r\nto such a degree of distress as to be absolutely without three\r\nthings—money, friends, and health—he dies in a ditch, or in some worse\r\nplace, a hospital.\r\n\r\nTen thousand ways there are to bring a man to this, and but very few to\r\nbring him out again.\r\n\r\nDeath is the universal deliverer, and therefore some who want courage to\r\nbear what they see before them, hang themselves for fear; for certainly\r\nself-destruction is the effect of cowardice in the highest extreme.\r\n\r\nOthers break the bounds of laws to satisfy that general law of nature,\r\nand turn open thieves, house-breakers, highwaymen, clippers, coiners,\r\n&c., till they run the length of the gallows, and get a deliverance the\r\nnearest way at St. Tyburn.\r\n\r\nOthers, being masters of more cunning than their neighbours, turn their\r\nthoughts to private methods of trick and cheat, a modern way of thieving\r\nevery jot as criminal, and in some degree worse than the other, by which\r\nhonest men are gulled with fair pretences to part from their money, and\r\nthen left to take their course with the author, who skulks behind the\r\ncurtain of a protection, or in the Mint or Friars, and bids defiance as\r\nwell to honesty as the law.\r\n\r\nOthers, yet urged by the same necessity, turn their thoughts to honest\r\ninvention, founded upon the platform of ingenuity and integrity.\r\n\r\nThese two last sorts are those we call projectors; and as there was\r\nalways more geese than swans, the number of the latter are very\r\ninconsiderable in comparison of the former; and as the greater number\r\ndenominates the less, the just contempt we have of the former sort\r\nbespatters the other, who, like cuckolds, bear the reproach of other\r\npeople’s crimes.\r\n\r\nA mere projector, then, is a contemptible thing, driven by his own\r\ndesperate fortune to such a strait that he must be delivered by a\r\nmiracle, or starve; and when he has beat his brains for some such miracle\r\nin vain, he finds no remedy but to paint up some bauble or other, as\r\nplayers make puppets talk big, to show like a strange thing, and then cry\r\nit up for a new invention, gets a patent for it, divides it into shares,\r\nand they must be sold.  Ways and means are not wanting to swell the new\r\nwhim to a vast magnitude; thousands and hundreds of thousands are the\r\nleast of his discourse, and sometimes millions, till the ambition of some\r\nhonest coxcomb is wheedled to part with his money for it, and then\r\n(_nascitur ridiculus mus_) the adventurer is left to carry on the\r\nproject, and the projector laughs at him.  The diver shall walk at the\r\nbottom of the Thames, the saltpetre maker shall build Tom T—d’s pond into\r\nhouses, the engineers build models and windmills to draw water, till\r\nfunds are raised to carry it on by men who have more money than brains,\r\nand then good-night patent and invention; the projector has done his\r\nbusiness and is gone.\r\n\r\nBut the honest projector is he who, having by fair and plain principles\r\nof sense, honesty, and ingenuity brought any contrivance to a suitable\r\nperfection, makes out what he pretends to, picks nobody’s pocket, puts\r\nhis project in execution, and contents himself with the real produce as\r\nthe profit of his invention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF BANKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBANKS, without question, if rightly managed are, or may be, of great\r\nadvantage, especially to a trading people, as the English are; and, among\r\nmany others, this is one particular case in which that benefit appears:\r\nthat they bring down the interest of money, and take from the goldsmiths,\r\nscriveners, and others, who have command of running cash, their most\r\ndelicious trade of making advantage of the necessities of the merchant in\r\nextravagant discounts and premiums for advance of money, when either\r\nlarge customs or foreign remittances call for disbursements beyond his\r\ncommon ability; for by the easiness of terms on which the merchant may\r\nhave money, he is encouraged to venture further in trade than otherwise\r\nhe would do.  Not but that there are other great advantages a Royal Bank\r\nmight procure in this kingdom, as has been seen in part by this; as\r\nadvancing money to the Exchequer upon Parliamentary funds and securities,\r\nby which in time of a war our preparations for any expedition need not be\r\nin danger of miscarriage for want of money, though the taxes raised be\r\nnot speedily paid, nor the Exchequer burthened with the excessive\r\ninterests paid in former reigns upon anticipations of the revenue; landed\r\nmen might be supplied with moneys upon securities on easier terms, which\r\nwould prevent the loss of multitudes of estates, now ruined and devoured\r\nby insolent and merciless mortgagees, and the like.  But now we unhappily\r\nsee a Royal Bank established by Act of Parliament, and another with a\r\nlarge fund upon the Orphans’ stock; and yet these advantages, or others,\r\nwhich we expected, not answered, though the pretensions in both have not\r\nbeen wanting at such time as they found it needful to introduce\r\nthemselves into public esteem, by giving out prints of what they were\r\nrather able to do than really intended to practise.  So that our having\r\ntwo banks at this time settled, and more erecting, has not yet been able\r\nto reduce the interest of money, not because the nature and foundation of\r\ntheir constitution does not tend towards it, but because, finding their\r\nhands full of better business, they are wiser than by being slaves to old\r\nobsolete proposals to lose the advantage of the great improvement they\r\ncan make of their stock.\r\n\r\nThis, however, does not at all reflect on the nature of a bank, nor of\r\nthe benefit it would be to the public trading part of the kingdom,\r\nwhatever it may seem to do on the practice of the present.  We find four\r\nor five banks now in view to be settled.  I confess I expect no more from\r\nthose to come than we have found from the past, and I think I make no\r\nbroach on either my charity or good manners in saying so; and I reflect\r\nnot upon any of the banks that are or shall be established for not doing\r\nwhat I mention, but for making such publications of what they would do.\r\nI cannot think any man had expected the Royal Bank should lend money on\r\nmortgages at 4 per cent. (nor was it much the better for them to make\r\npublication they would do so from the beginning of January next after\r\ntheir settlement), since to this day, as I am informed, they have not\r\nlent one farthing in that manner.\r\n\r\nOur banks are indeed nothing but so many goldsmiths’ shops, where the\r\ncredit being high (and the directors as high) people lodge their money;\r\nand they—the directors, I mean—make their advantage of it.  If you lay it\r\nat demand, they allow you nothing; if at time, 3 per cent.; and so would\r\nany goldsmith in Lombard Street have done before.  But the very banks\r\nthemselves are so awkward in lending, so strict, so tedious, so\r\ninquisitive, and withal so public in their taking securities, that men\r\nwho are anything tender won’t go to them; and so the easiness of\r\nborrowing money, so much designed, is defeated.  For here is a private\r\ninterest to be made, though it be a public one; and, in short, it is only\r\na great trade carried on for the private gain of a few concerned in the\r\noriginal stock; and though we are to hope for great things, because they\r\nhave promised them, yet they are all future that we know of.\r\n\r\nAnd yet all this while a bank might be very beneficial to this kingdom;\r\nand this might be so, if either their own ingenuity or public authority\r\nwould oblige them to take the public good into equal concern with their\r\nprivate interest.\r\n\r\nTo explain what I mean; banks, being established by public authority,\r\nought also, as all public things are, to be under limitations and\r\nrestrictions from that authority; and those limitations being regulated\r\nwith a proper regard to the ease of trade in general, and the improvement\r\nof the stock in particular, would make a bank a useful, profitable thing\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\nFirst, a bank ought to be of a magnitude proportioned to the trade of the\r\ncountry it is in, which this bank is so far from that it is no more to\r\nthe whole than the least goldsmith’s cash in Lombard Street is to the\r\nbank, from whence it comes to pass that already more banks are\r\ncontriving.  And I question not but banks in London will ere long be as\r\nfrequent as lotteries; the consequence of which, in all probability, will\r\nbe the diminishing their reputation, or a civil war with one another.  It\r\nis true, the Bank of England has a capital stock; but yet, was that stock\r\nwholly clear of the public concern of the Government, it is not above a\r\nfifth part of what would be necessary to manage the whole business of the\r\ntown—which it ought, though not to do, at least to be able to do.  And I\r\nsuppose I may venture to say above one-half of the stock of the present\r\nbank is taken up in the affairs of the Exchequer.\r\n\r\nI suppose nobody will take this discourse for an invective against the\r\nBank of England.  I believe it is a very good fund, a very useful one,\r\nand a very profitable one.  It has been useful to the Government, and it\r\nis profitable to the proprietors; and the establishing it at such a\r\njuncture, when our enemies were making great boasts of our poverty and\r\nwant of money, was a particular glory to our nation, and the city in\r\nparticular.  That when the Paris Gazette informed the world that the\r\nParliament had indeed given the king grants for raising money in funds to\r\nbe paid in remote years, but money was so scarce that no anticipations\r\ncould be procured; that just then, besides three millions paid into the\r\nExchequer that spring on other taxes by way of advance, there was an\r\noverplus-stock to be found of £1,200,000 sterling, or (to make it speak\r\nFrench) of above fifteen millions, which was all paid voluntarily into\r\nthe Exchequer.  Besides this, I believe the present Bank of England has\r\nbeen very useful to the Exchequer, and to supply the king with\r\nremittances for the payment of the army in Flanders, which has also, by\r\nthe way, been very profitable to itself.  But still this bank is not of\r\nthat bulk that the business done here requires, nor is it able, with all\r\nthe stock it has, to procure the great proposed benefit, the lowering the\r\ninterest of money: whereas all foreign banks absolutely govern the\r\ninterest, both at Amsterdam, Genoa, and other places.  And this defect I\r\nconceive the multiplicity of banks cannot supply, unless a perfect\r\nunderstanding could be secured between them.\r\n\r\nTo remedy this defect, several methods might be proposed.  Some I shall\r\ntake the freedom to hint at:—\r\n\r\nFirst, that the present bank increase their stock to at least five\r\nmillions sterling, to be settled as they are already, with some small\r\nlimitations to make the methods more beneficial.\r\n\r\nFive millions sterling is an immense sum; to which add the credit of\r\ntheir cash, which would supply them with all the overplus-money in the\r\ntown, and probably might amount to half as much more; and then the credit\r\nof running bills, which by circulating would, no question, be an\r\nequivalent to the other half: so that in stock, credit, and bank-bills\r\nthe balance of their cash would be always ten millions sterling—a sum\r\nthat everybody who can talk of does not understand.\r\n\r\nBut then to find business for all this stock, which, though it be a\r\nstrange thing to think of, is nevertheless easy when it comes to be\r\nexamined.  And first for the business; this bank should enlarge the\r\nnumber of their directors, as they do of their stock, and should then\r\nestablish several sub-committees, composed of their own members, who\r\nshould have the directing of several offices relating to the distinct\r\nsorts of business they referred to, to be overruled and governed by the\r\ngovernor and directors in a body, but to have a conclusive power as to\r\ncontracts.  Of these there should be—\r\n\r\nOne office for loan of money for customs of goods, which by a plain\r\nmethod might be so ordered that the merchant might with ease pay the\r\nhighest customs down, and so, by allowing the bank 4 per cent. advance,\r\nbe first sure to secure the £10 per cent. which the king allows for\r\nprompt payment at the Custom House, and be also freed from the\r\ntroublesome work of finding bondsmen and securities for the money—which\r\nhas exposed many a man to the tyranny of extents, either for himself or\r\nhis friend, to his utter ruin, who under a more moderate prosecution had\r\nbeen able to pay all his debts, and by this method has been torn to\r\npieces and disabled from making any tolerable proposal to his creditors.\r\nThis is a scene of large business, and would, in proportion, employ a\r\nlarge cash, and it is the easiest thing in the world to make the bank the\r\npaymaster of all the large customs, and yet the merchant have so\r\nhonourable a possession of his goods, as may be neither any diminution to\r\nhis reputation or any hindrance to their sale.\r\n\r\nAs, for example, suppose I have 100 hogsheads of tobacco to import, whose\r\ncustoms by several duties come to £1,000, and want cash to clear them.  I\r\ngo with my bill of loading to the bank, who appoint their officer to\r\nenter the goods and pay the duties, which goods, so entered by the bank,\r\nshall give them title enough to any part, or the whole, without the\r\ntrouble of bills of sale, or conveyances, defeasances, and the like.  The\r\ngoods are carried to a warehouse at the waterside, where the merchant has\r\na free and public access to them, as if in his own warehouse and an\r\nhonourable liberty to sell and deliver either the whole (paying their\r\ndisburse) or a part without it, leaving but sufficient for the payment,\r\nand out of that part delivered, either by notes under the hand of the\r\npurchaser, or any other way, he may clear the same, without any\r\nexactions, but of £4 per cent., and the rest are his own.\r\n\r\nThe ease this would bring to trade, the deliverance it would bring to the\r\nmerchants from the insults of goldsmiths, &c., and the honour it would\r\ngive to our management of public imposts, with the advantages to the\r\nCustom House itself, and the utter destruction of extortion, would be\r\nsuch as would give a due value to the bank, and make all mankind\r\nacknowledge it to be a public good.  The grievance of exactions upon\r\nmerchants in this case is very great, and when I lay the blame on the\r\ngoldsmiths, because they are the principal people made use of in such\r\noccasions, I include a great many other sorts of brokers and\r\nmoney-jobbing artists, who all get a snip out of the merchant.  I myself\r\nhave known a goldsmith in Lombard Street lend a man £700 to pay the\r\ncustoms of a hundred pipes of Spanish wines; the wines were made over to\r\nhim for security by bill of sale, and put into a cellar, of which the\r\ngoldsmith kept the key; the merchant was to pay £6 per cent. interest on\r\nthe bond, and to allow £10 percent. premium for advancing the money.\r\nWhen he had the wines in possession the owner could not send his cooper\r\nto look after them, but the goldsmith’s man must attend all the while,\r\nfor which he would be paid 5s. a day.  If he brought a customer to see\r\nthem, the goldsmith’s man must show them.  The money was lent for two\r\nmonths.  He could not be admitted to sell or deliver a pipe of wine out\r\nsingle, or two or three at a time, as he might have sold them; but on a\r\nword or two spoken amiss to the goldsmith (or which he was pleased to\r\ntake so), he would have none sold but the whole parcel together.  By this\r\nusage the goods lay on hand, and every month the money remained the\r\ngoldsmith demanded a guinea per cent. forbearance, besides the interest,\r\ntill at last by leakage, decay, and other accidents, the wines began to\r\nlessen.  Then the goldsmith begins to tell the merchant he is afraid the\r\nwines are not worth the money he has lent, and demands further security,\r\nand in a little while, growing higher and rougher, he tells him he must\r\nhave his money.  The merchant—too much at his mercy, because he cannot\r\nprovide the money—is forced to consent to the sale; and the goods, being\r\nreduced to seventy pipes sound—wine and four unsound (the rest being sunk\r\nfor filling up), were sold for £13 per pipe the sound, and £3 the\r\nunsound, which amounted to £922 together.\r\n\r\n                                                  £         s.      d.\r\nThe cooper’s bill came to                           30  0       0\r\nThe cellarage a year and a half to                  18  0       0\r\nInterests on the bond to                            63  0       0\r\nThe goldsmith’s men for attendance                   8  0       0\r\nAllowance for advance of the money and              74  0       0\r\nforbearance\r\n                                                   193       0       0\r\nPrincipal money borrowed                           700       0       0\r\n                                                   893       0       0\r\nDue to the merchant                                 29       0       0\r\n                                                   922       0       0\r\n\r\nBy the moderatest computation that can be, these wines cost the merchant\r\nas follows:—\r\n\r\n     _First Cost with Charges on Board_.          £         s.      d.\r\nIn Lisbon 15 mille reis per pipe is 1,500          475       0       0\r\nmille reis; exchange, at 6s. 4d. per mille\r\nrei\r\nFreight to London, then at £3 per ton              150       0       0\r\nAssurance on £500 at 2 per cent.                    10       0       0\r\nPetty charges                                        5       0       0\r\n                                                   640       0       0\r\n\r\nSo that it is manifest by the extortion of this banker, the poor man lost\r\nthe whole capital with freight and charges, and made but £29 produce of a\r\nhundred pipes of wine.\r\n\r\nOne other office of this bank, and which would take up a considerable\r\nbranch of the stock, is for lending money upon pledges, which should have\r\nannexed to it a warehouse and factory, where all sorts of goods might\r\npublicly be sold by the consent of the owners, to the great advantage of\r\nthe owner, the bank receiving £4 per cent. interest., and 2 per cent.\r\ncommission for sale of the goods.\r\n\r\nA third office should be appointed for discounting bills, tallies, and\r\nnotes, by which all tallies of the Exchequer, and any part of the\r\nrevenue, should at stated allowances be ready money to any person, to the\r\ngreat advantage of the Government, and ease of all such as are any ways\r\nconcerned in public undertakings.\r\n\r\nA fourth office for lending money upon land securities at 4 per cent.\r\ninterest, by which the cruelty and injustice of mortgagees would be\r\nwholly restrained, and a register of mortgages might be very well kept,\r\nto prevent frauds.\r\n\r\nA fifth office for exchanges and foreign correspondences.\r\n\r\nA sixth for inland exchanges, where a very large field of business lies\r\nbefore them.\r\n\r\nUnder this head it will not be improper to consider that this method will\r\nmost effectually answer all the notions and proposals of county banks;\r\nfor by this office they would be all rendered useless and unprofitable,\r\nsince one bank of the magnitude I mention, with a branch of its office\r\nset apart for that business, might with ease manage all the inland\r\nexchange of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nBy which such a correspondence with all the trading towns in England\r\nmight be maintained, as that the whole kingdom should trade with the\r\nbank.  Under the direction of this office a public cashier should be\r\nappointed in every county, to reside in the capital town as to trade (and\r\nin some counties more), through whose hands all the cash of the revenue\r\nof the gentry and of trade should be returned on the bank in London, and\r\nfrom the bank again on their cashier in every respective county or town,\r\nat the small exchange of 0.5 per cent., by which means all loss of money\r\ncarried upon the road, to the encouragement of robbers and ruining of the\r\ncountry, who are sued for those robberies, would be more effectually\r\nprevented than by all the statutes against highwaymen that are or can be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nAs to public advancings of money to the Government, they may be left to\r\nthe directors in a body, as all other disputes and contingent cases are;\r\nand whoever examines these heads of business apart, and has any judgment\r\nin the particulars, will, I suppose, allow that a stock of ten millions\r\nmay find employment in them, though it be indeed a very great sum.\r\n\r\nI could offer some very good reasons why this way of management by\r\nparticular offices for every particular sort of business is not only the\r\neasiest, but the safest, way of executing an affair of such variety and\r\nconsequence; also I could state a method for the proceedings of those\r\nprivate offices, their conjunction with and dependence on the general\r\ncourt of the directors, and how the various accounts should centre in one\r\ngeneral capital account of stock, with regulations and appeals; but I\r\nbelieve them to be needless—at least, in this place.\r\n\r\nIf it be objected here that it is impossible for one joint-stock to go\r\nthrough the whole business of the kingdom, I answer, I believe it is not\r\neither impossible or impracticable, particularly on this one account:\r\nthat almost all the country business would be managed by running bills,\r\nand those the longest abroad of any, their distance keeping them out, to\r\nthe increasing the credit, and consequently the stock of the bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Multiplicity of Banks_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is touched at in the foregoing part of this chapter refers to one\r\nbank royal to preside, as it were, over the whole cash of the kingdom:\r\nbut because some people do suppose this work fitter for many banks than\r\nfor one, I must a little consider that head.  And first, allowing those\r\nmany banks could, without clashing, maintain a constant correspondence\r\nwith one another, in passing each other’s bills as current from one to\r\nanother, I know not but it might be better performed by many than by one;\r\nfor as harmony makes music in sound, so it produces success in business.\r\n\r\nA civil war among merchants is always the rain of trade: I cannot think a\r\nmultitude of banks could so consist with one another in England as to\r\njoin interests and uphold one another’s credit, without joining stocks\r\ntoo; I confess, if it could be done, the convenience to trade would be\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nIf I were to propose which way these banks should be established, I\r\nanswer, allowing a due regard to some gentlemen who have had thoughts of\r\nthe same (whose methods I shall not so much as touch upon, much less\r\ndiscover; my thoughts run upon quite different methods, both for the fund\r\nand the establishment).\r\n\r\nEvery principal town in England is a corporation, upon which the fund may\r\nbe settled, which will sufficiently answer the difficult and chargeable\r\nwork of suing for a corporation by patent or Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\nA general subscription of stock being made, and by deeds of settlement\r\nplaced in the mayor and aldermen of the city or corporation for the time\r\nbeing, in trust, to be declared by deeds of uses, some of the directors\r\nbeing always made members of the said corporation, and joined in the\r\ntrust; the bank hereby becomes the public stock of the town (something\r\nlike what they call the _rentes_ of the town-house in France), and is\r\nmanaged in the name of the said corporation, to whom the directors are\r\naccountable, and they back again to the general court.\r\n\r\nFor example: suppose the gentlemen or tradesmen of the county of Norfolk,\r\nby a subscription of cash, design to establish a bank.  The subscriptions\r\nbeing made, the stock is paid into the chamber of the city of Norwich,\r\nand managed by a court of directors, as all banks are, and chosen out of\r\nthe subscribers, the mayor only of the city to be always one; to be\r\nmanaged in the name of the corporation of the city of Norwich, but for\r\nthe uses in a deed of trust to be made by the subscribers, and mayor and\r\naldermen, at large mentioned.  I make no question but a bank thus settled\r\nwould have as firm a foundation as any bank need to have, and every way\r\nanswer the ends of a corporation.\r\n\r\nOf these sorts of banks England might very well establish fifteen, at the\r\nseveral towns hereafter mentioned.  Some of which, though they are not\r\nthe capital towns of the counties, yet are more the centre of trade,\r\nwhich in England runs in veins, like mines of metal in the earth:\r\n\r\n  Canterbury.  Salisbury.  Exeter.  Bristol.  Worcester.  Shrewsbury.\r\n  Manchester.  Newcastle-upon-Tyne.  Leeds, or Halifax, or York.  Warwick\r\n  or Birmingham.  Oxford or Reading.  Bedford.  Norwich.  Colchester.\r\n\r\nEvery one of these banks to have a cashier in London, unless they could\r\nall have a general correspondence and credit with the bank royal.\r\n\r\nThese banks in their respective counties should be a general staple and\r\nfactory for the manufactures of the said county, where every man that had\r\ngoods made, might have money at a small interest for advance, the goods\r\nin the meantime being sent forward to market, to a warehouse for that\r\npurpose erected in London, where they should be disposed of to all the\r\nadvantages the owner could expect, paying only 1 per cent. commission.\r\nOr if the maker wanted credit in London either for Spanish wool, cotton,\r\noil, or any goods, while his goods were in the warehouse of the said\r\nbank, his bill should be paid by the bank to the full value of his goods,\r\nor at least within a small matter.  These banks, either by correspondence\r\nwith each other, or an order to their cashier in London, might with ease\r\nso pass each other’s bills that a man who has cash at Plymouth, and wants\r\nmoney at Berwick, may transfer his cash at Plymouth to Newcastle in\r\nhalf-an-hour’s time, without either hazard, or charge, or time, allowing\r\nonly 0.5 per cent. exchange; and so of all the most distant parts of the\r\nkingdom.  Or if he wants money at Newcastle, and has goods at Worcester\r\nor at any other clothing town, sending his goods to be sold by the\r\nfactory of the bank of Worcester, he may remit by the bank to Newcastle,\r\nor anywhere else, as readily as if his goods were sold and paid for and\r\nno exactions made upon him for the convenience he enjoys.\r\n\r\nThis discourse of banks, the reader is to understand, to have no relation\r\nto the present posture of affairs, with respect to the scarcity of\r\ncurrent money, which seems to have put a stop to that part of a stock we\r\ncall credit, which always is, and indeed must be, the most essential part\r\nof a bank, and without which no bank can pretend to subsist—at least, to\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nA bank is only a great stock of money put together, to be employed by\r\nsome of the subscribers, in the name of the rest, for the benefit of the\r\nwhole.  This stock of money subsists not barely on the profits of its own\r\nstock (for that would be inconsiderable), but upon the contingencies and\r\naccidents which multiplicity of business occasions.  As, for instance, a\r\nman that comes for money, and knows he may have it to-morrow; perhaps he\r\nis in haste, and won’t take it to-day: only, that he may be sure of it\r\nto-morrow, he takes a memorandum under the hand of the officer, that he\r\nshall have it whenever he calls for it, and this memorandum we call a\r\nbill.  To-morrow, when he intended to fetch his money, comes a man to him\r\nfor money, and, to save himself the labour of telling, he gives him the\r\nmemorandum or bill aforesaid for his money; this second man does as the\r\nfirst, and a third does as he did, and so the bill runs about a mouth,\r\ntwo or three.  And this is that we call credit, for by the circulation of\r\na quantity of these bills, the bank enjoys the full benefit of as much\r\nstock in real value as the suppositious value of the bills amounts to;\r\nand wherever this credit fails, this advantage fails; for immediately all\r\nmen come for their money, and the bank must die of itself: for I am sure\r\nno bank, by the simple improvement of their single stock, can ever make\r\nany considerable advantage.\r\n\r\nI confess, a bank who can lay a fund for the security of their bills,\r\nwhich shall produce first an annual profit to the owner, and yet make\r\ngood the passant bill, may stand, and be advantageous, too, because there\r\nis a real and a suppositious value both, and the real always ready to\r\nmake good the suppositious: and this I know no way to bring to pass but\r\nby land, which, at the same time that it lies transferred to secure the\r\nvalue of every bill given out, brings in a separate profit to the owner;\r\nand this way no question but the whole kingdom might be a bank to itself,\r\nthough no ready money were to be found in it.\r\n\r\nI had gone on in some sheets with my notion of land being the best bottom\r\nfor public banks, and the easiness of bringing it to answer all the ends\r\nof money deposited with double advantage, but I find myself happily\r\nprevented by a gentleman who has published the very same, though since\r\nthis was wrote; and I was always master of so much wit as to hold my\r\ntongue while they spoke who understood the thing better than myself.\r\n\r\nMr. John Asgill, of Lincoln’s Inn, in a small tract entitled, “Several\r\nAssertions proved, in order to create another Species of Money than Gold\r\nand Silver,” has so distinctly handled this very case, with such strength\r\nof argument, such clearness of reason, such a judgment, and such a style,\r\nas all the ingenious part of the world must acknowledge themselves\r\nextremely obliged to him for that piece.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of which book I laid by all that had been written by me on\r\nthat subject, for I had much rather confess myself incapable of handling\r\nthat point like him, than have convinced the world of it by my\r\nimpertinence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE HIGHWAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is a prodigious charge the whole nation groans under for the repair of\r\nhighways, which, after all, lie in a very ill posture too.  I make no\r\nquestion but if it was taken into consideration by those who have the\r\npower to direct it, the kingdom might be wholly eased of that burden, and\r\nthe highways be kept in good condition, which now lie in a most shameful\r\nmanner in most parts of the kingdom, and in many places wholly\r\nunpassable, from whence arise tolls and impositions upon passengers and\r\ntravellers, and, on the other hand, trespasses and encroachments upon\r\nlands adjacent, to the great damage of the owners.\r\n\r\nThe rate for the highways is the most arbitrary and unequal tax in the\r\nkingdom: in some places two or three rates of sixpence per pound in the\r\nyear; in others the whole parish cannot raise wherewith to defray the\r\ncharge, either by the very bad condition of the road or distance of\r\nmaterials; in others the surveyors raise what they never expend; and the\r\nabuses, exactions, connivances, frauds, and embezzlements are\r\ninnumerable.\r\n\r\nThe Romans, while they governed this island, made it one of their\r\nprincipal cares to make and repair the highways of the kingdom, and the\r\nchief roads we now use are of their marking out; the consequence of\r\nmaintaining them was such, or at least so esteemed, that they thought it\r\nnot below them to employ their legionary troops in the work; and it was\r\nsometimes the business of whole armies, either when in winter quarters or\r\nin the intervals of truce or peace with the natives.  Nor have the Romans\r\nleft us any greater tokens of their grandeur and magnificence than the\r\nruins of those causeways and street-ways which are at this day to be seen\r\nin many parts of the kingdom, some of which have by the visible remains\r\nbeen discovered to traverse the whole kingdom, and others for more than a\r\nhundred miles are to be traced from colony to colony, as they had\r\nparticular occasion.  The famous highway or street called Watling Street,\r\nwhich some will tell you began at London Stone, and passing that very\r\nstreet in the City which we to this day call by that name, went on west\r\nto that spot where Tyburn now stands, and then turned north-west in so\r\nstraight a line to St. Albans that it is now the exactest road (in one\r\nline for twenty miles) in the kingdom; and though disused now as the\r\nchief, yet is as good, and, I believe, the best road to St. Albans, and\r\nis still called the Streetway.  From whence it is traced into Shropshire,\r\nabove a hundred and sixty miles, with a multitude of visible antiquities\r\nupon it, discovered and described very accurately by Mr. Cambden.  The\r\nFosse, another Roman work, lies at this day as visible, and as plain a\r\nhigh causeway, of above thirty feet broad, ditched on either side, and\r\ncoped and paved where need is—as exact and every jot as beautiful as the\r\nking’s new road through Hyde Park, in which figure it now lies from near\r\nMarshfield to Cirencester, and again from Cirencester to the Hill, three\r\nmiles on this side Gloucester, which is not less than twenty-six miles,\r\nand is made use of as the great road to those towns, and probably has\r\nbeen so for a thousand years with little repairs.\r\n\r\nIf we set aside the barbarity and customs of the Romans as heathens, and\r\ntake them as a civil government, we must allow they were the pattern of\r\nthe whole world for improvement and increase of arts and learning,\r\ncivilising and methodising nations and countries conquered by their\r\nvalour; and if this was one of their great cares, that consideration\r\nought to move something.  But to the great example of that generous\r\npeople I will add three arguments:—\r\n\r\n1.  It is useful, and that as it is convenient for carriages, which in a\r\ntrading country is a great help to negotiation, and promotes universal\r\ncorrespondence, without which our inland trade could not be managed.  And\r\nunder this head I could name a thousand conveniences of a safe, pleasant,\r\nwell-repaired highway, both to the inhabitant and the traveller, but I\r\nthink it is needless.\r\n\r\n2.  It is easy.  I question not to make it appear it is easy to put all\r\nthe highroads, especially in England, in a noble figure; large, dry, and\r\nclean; well drained, and free from floods, unpassable sloughs, deep\r\ncart-ruts, high ridges, and all the inconveniences they now are full of;\r\nand, when once done, much easier still to be maintained so.\r\n\r\n3.  It may be cheaper, and the whole assessment for the repairs of\r\nhighways for ever be dropped or applied to other uses for the public\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\nHere I beg the reader’s favour for a small digression.\r\n\r\nI am not proposing this as an undertaker, or setting a price to the\r\npublic for which I will perform it, like one of the projectors I speak\r\nof, but laying open a project for the performance, which, whenever the\r\npublic affairs will admit our governors to consider of, will be found so\r\nfeasible that no question they may find undertakers enough for the\r\nperformance; and in this undertaking age I do not doubt but it would be\r\neasy at any time to procure persons at their own charge to perform it for\r\nany single county, as a pattern and experiment for the whole kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is as follows:—First, that an Act of Parliament be made with\r\nliberty for the undertakers to dig and trench, to cut down hedges and\r\ntrees, or whatever is needful for ditching, draining and carrying off\r\nwater, cleaning, enlarging and levelling the roads, with power to lay\r\nopen or enclose lands; to encroach into lands; dig, raise, and level\r\nfences; plant and pull up hedges or trees (for the enlarging, widening,\r\nand draining the highways), with power to turn either the roads or\r\nwatercourses, rivers and brooks, as by the directors of the works shall\r\nbe found needful, always allowing satisfaction to be first made to the\r\nowners of such lands (either by assigning to them equivalent lands or\r\npayment in money, the value to be adjusted by two indifferent persons to\r\nbe named by the Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper for the time being), and\r\nno watercourse to be turned from any water-mill without satisfaction\r\nfirst made both to the landlord and tenant.\r\n\r\nBut before I proceed, I must say a word or two to this article.\r\n\r\nThe chief, and almost the only, cause of the deepness and foulness of the\r\nroads is occasioned by the standing water, which (for want of due care to\r\ndraw it off by scouring and opening ditches and drains, and other\r\nwatercourses, and clearing of passages) soaks into the earth, and softens\r\nit to such a degree that it cannot bear the weight of horses and\r\ncarriages; to prevent which, the power to dig, trench, and cut down, &c.,\r\nmentioned above will be of absolute necessity.  But because the liberty\r\nseems very large, and some may think it is too great a power to be\r\ngranted to any body of men over their neighbours, it is answered:—\r\n\r\n1.  It is absolutely necessary, or the work cannot be done, and the doing\r\nof the work is of much greater benefit than the damage can amount to.\r\n\r\n2.  Satisfaction to be made to the owner (and that first, too, before the\r\ndamage be done) is an unquestionable equivalent; and both together, I\r\nthink, are a very full answer to any objection in that case.\r\n\r\nBesides this Act of Parliament, a commission must be granted to fifteen\r\nat least, in the name of the undertakers, to whom every county shall have\r\npower to join ten, who are to sit with the said fifteen so often and so\r\nlong as the said fifteen do sit for affairs relating to that county,\r\nwhich fifteen, or any seven of them, shall be directors of the works, to\r\nbe advised by the said ten, or any five of them, in matters of right and\r\nclaim, and the said ten to adjust differences in the countries, and to\r\nhave right by process to appeal in the name either of lords of manors, or\r\nprivileges of towns or corporations, who shall be either damaged or\r\nencroached upon by the said work.  All appeals to be heard and determined\r\nimmediately by the said Lord Chancellor, or commission from him, that the\r\nwork may receive no interruption.\r\n\r\nThis commission shall give power to the said fifteen to press waggons,\r\ncarts, and horses, oxen and men, and detain them to work a certain\r\nlimited time, and within certain limited space of miles from their own\r\ndwellings, and at a certain rate of payment.  No men, horses, or carts to\r\nbe pressed against their consent during the times of hay-time or harvest,\r\nor upon market-days, if the person aggrieved will make affidavit he is\r\nobliged to be with his horses or carts at the said markets.\r\n\r\nIt is well known to all who have any knowledge of the condition the\r\nhighways in England now lie in that in most places there is a convenient\r\ndistance land left open for travelling, either for driving of cattle, or\r\nmarching of troops of horse, with perhaps as few lanes or defiles as in\r\nany countries.  The cross-roads, which are generally narrow, are yet\r\nbroad enough in most places for two carriages to pass; but, on the other\r\nhand, we have on most of the highroads a great deal, if waste land thrown\r\nin (as it were, for an overplus to the highway), which, though it be used\r\nof course by cattle and travellers on occasion, is indeed no benefit at\r\nall either to the traveller as a road or to the poor as a common, or to\r\nthe lord of the manor as a waste; upon it grows neither timber nor grass,\r\nin any quantity answerable to the land, but, though to no purpose, is\r\ntrodden down, poached, and overrun by drifts of cattle in the winter, or\r\nspoiled with the dust in the summer.  And this I have observed in many\r\nparts of England to be as good land as any of the neighbouring\r\nenclosures, as capable of improvement, and to as good purpose.\r\n\r\nThese lands only being enclosed and manured, leaving the roads to\r\ndimensions without measure sufficient, are the fund upon which I build\r\nthe prodigious stock of money that must do this work.  These lands (which\r\nI shall afterwards make an essay to value), being enclosed, will be\r\neither saleable to raise money, or fit to exchange with those gentlemen\r\nwho must part with some land where the ways are narrow, always reserving\r\na quantity of these lands to be let out to tenants, the rent to be paid\r\ninto the public stock or bank of the undertakers, and to be reserved for\r\nkeeping the ways in the same repair, and the said bank to forfeit the\r\nlands if they are not so maintained.\r\n\r\nAnother branch of the stock must be hands (for a stock of men is a stock\r\nof money), to which purpose every county, city, town, and parish shall be\r\nrated at a set price, equivalent to eight years’ payment, for the repair\r\nof highways, which each county, &c., shall raise, not by assessment in\r\nmoney, but by pressing of men, horses, and carriages for the work (the\r\nmen, horses, &c., to be employed by the directors); in which case all\r\ncorporal punishments—as of whippings, stocks, pillories, houses of\r\ncorrection, &c.—might be easily transmitted to a certain number of days’\r\nwork on the highways, and in consideration of this provision of men the\r\ncountry should for ever after be acquitted of any contribution, either in\r\nmoney or work, for repair of the highways—building of bridges excepted.\r\n\r\nThere lie some popular objections against this undertaking; and the first\r\nis (the great controverted point of England) enclosure of the common,\r\nwhich tends to depopulation, and injures the poor.\r\n\r\n2.  Who shall be judges or surveyors of the work, to oblige the\r\nundertakers to perform to a certain limited degree?\r\n\r\nFor the first, “the enclosure of the common”—a clause that runs as far as\r\nto an encroachment upon Magna Charta, and a most considerable branch of\r\nthe property of the poor—I answer it thus:—\r\n\r\n1.  The lands we enclose are not such as from which the poor do indeed\r\nreap any benefit—or, at least, any that is considerable.\r\n\r\n2.  The bank and public stock, who are to manage this great undertaking,\r\nwill have so many little labours to perform and offices to bestow, that\r\nare fit only for labouring poor persons to do, as will put them in a\r\ncondition to provide for the poor who are so injured, that can work; and\r\nto those who cannot, may allow pensions for overseeing, supervising, and\r\nthe like, which will be more than equivalent.\r\n\r\n3.  For depopulations, the contrary should be secured, by obliging the\r\nundertakers, at such and such certain distances, to erect cottages, two\r\nat least in a place (which would be useful to the work and safety of the\r\ntraveller), to which should be an allotment of land, always sufficient to\r\ninvite the poor inhabitant, in which the poor should be tenant for life\r\ngratis, doing duty upon the highway as should be appointed, by which, and\r\nmany other methods, the poor should be great gainers by the proposal,\r\ninstead of being injured.\r\n\r\n4.  By this erecting of cottages at proper distances a man might travel\r\nover all England as through a street, where he could never want either\r\nrescue from thieves or directions for his way.\r\n\r\n5.  This very undertaking, once duly settled, might in a few years so\r\norder it that there should be no poor for the common; and, if so, what\r\nneed of a common for the poor?  Of which in its proper place.\r\n\r\nAs to the second objection, “Who should oblige the undertakers to the\r\nperformance?”  I answer—\r\n\r\n1.  Their Commission and charter should become void, and all their stock\r\nforfeit, and the lands enclosed and unsold remain as a pledge, which\r\nwould be security sufficient.\r\n\r\n2.  The ten persons chosen out of every county should have power to\r\ninspect and complain, and the Lord Chancellor, upon such complaint, to\r\nmake a survey, and to determine by a jury, in which case, on default,\r\nthey shall be obliged to proceed.\r\n\r\n3.  The lands settled on the bank shall be liable to be extended for the\r\nuses mentioned, if the same at any time be not maintained in the\r\ncondition at first provided, and the bank to be amerced upon complaint of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThese and other conditions, which on a legal settlement to be made by\r\nwiser heads than mine might be thought on, I do believe would form a\r\nconstitution so firm, so fair, and so equally advantageous to the\r\ncountry, to the poor, and to the public, as has not been put in practice\r\nin these later ages of the world.  To discourse of this a little in\r\ngeneral, and to instance in a place perhaps that has not its fellow in\r\nthe kingdom—the parish of Islington, in Middlesex.  There lies through\r\nthis large parish the greatest road in England, and the most frequented,\r\nespecially by cattle for Smithfield market; this great road has so many\r\nbranches, and lies for so long a way through the parish, and withal has\r\nthe inconvenience of a clayey ground, and no gravel at hand, that,\r\nmodestly speaking, the parish is not able to keep it in repair; by which\r\nmeans several cross-roads in the parish lie wholly unpassable, and carts\r\nand horses (and men too) have been almost buried in holes and sloughs;\r\nand the main road itself has for many years lain in a very ordinary\r\ncondition, which occasioned several motions in Parliament to raise a toll\r\nat Highgate for the performance of what it was impossible the parish\r\nshould do, and yet was of so absolute necessity to be done.  And is it\r\nnot very probable the parish of Islington would part with all the waste\r\nland upon their roads, to be eased of the intolerable assessment for\r\nrepair of the highway, and answer the poor, who reap but a small benefit\r\nfrom it, some other way?  And yet I am free to affirm that for a grant of\r\nwaste and almost useless land, lying open to the highway (those lands to\r\nbe improved, as they might easily be), together with the eight years’\r\nassessment to be provided in workmen, a noble, magnificent causeway might\r\nbe erected, with ditches on either side, deep enough to receive the\r\nwater, and drains sufficient to carry it off, which causeway should be\r\nfour feet high at least, and from thirty to forty feet broad, to reach\r\nfrom London to Barnet, paved in the middle, to keep it coped, and so\r\nsupplied with gravel and other proper materials as should secure it from\r\ndecay with small repairing.\r\n\r\nI hope no man would be so weak now as to imagine that by lands lying open\r\nto the road, to be assigned to the undertakers, I should mean that all\r\nFinchley Common should be enclosed and sold for this work; but, lest\r\nsomebody should start such a preposterous objection, I think it is not\r\nimproper to mention, that wherever a highway is to be carried over a\r\nlarge common, forest, or waste, without a hedge on either hand for a\r\ncertain distance, there the several parishes shall allot the directors a\r\ncertain quantity of the common, to lie parallel with the road, at a\r\nproportioned number of feet to the length and breadth of the said\r\nroad—consideration also to be had to the nature of the ground; or else,\r\ngiving them only room for the road directly shall suffer them to inclose\r\nin any one spot so much of the said common as shall be equivalent to the\r\nlike quantity of land lying by the road.  Thus where the land is good and\r\nthe materials for erecting a causeway near, the less land may serve; and\r\non the contrary, the more; but in general allowing them the quantity of\r\nland proportioned to the length of the causeway, and forty rods in\r\nbreadth: though where the land is poor, as on downs and plains, the\r\nproportion must be considered to be adjusted by the country.\r\n\r\nAnother point for the dimensions of roads should be adjusted; and the\r\nbreadth of them, I think, cannot be less than thus:\r\n\r\nFrom London every way ten miles the high post-road to be built full forty\r\nfeet in breadth and four feet high, the ditches eight feet broad and six\r\nfeet deep, and from thence onward thirty feet, and so in proportion.\r\n\r\nCross-roads to be twenty feet broad, and ditches proportioned; no lanes\r\nand passes less than nine feet without ditches.\r\n\r\nThe middle of the high causeways to be paved with stone, chalk, or\r\ngravel, and kept always two feet higher than the sides, that the water\r\nmight have a free course into the ditches; and persons kept in constant\r\nemploy to fill up holes, let out water, open drains, and the like, as\r\nthere should be occasion—a proper work for highwaymen and such\r\nmalefactors, as might on those services be exempted from the gallows.\r\n\r\nIt may here be objected that eight years’ assessment to be demanded down\r\nis too much in reason to expect any of the poorer sort can pay; as, for\r\ninstance, if a farmer who keeps a team of horse be at the common\r\nassessment to work a week, it must not be put so hard upon any man as to\r\nwork eight weeks together.  It is easy to answer this objection.\r\n\r\nSo many as are wanted, must be had; if a farmer’s team cannot be spared\r\nwithout prejudice to him so long together, he may spare it at sundry\r\ntimes, or agree to be assessed, and pay the assessment at sundry\r\npayments; and the bank may make it as easy to them as they please.\r\n\r\nAnother method, however, might be found to fix this work at once.  As\r\nsuppose a bank be settled for the highways of the county of Middlesex,\r\nwhich as they are, without doubt, the most used of any in the kingdom, so\r\nalso they require the more charge, and in some parts lie in the worst\r\ncondition of any in the kingdom.\r\n\r\nIf the Parliament fix the charge of the survey of the highways upon a\r\nbank to be appointed for that purpose for a certain term of years, the\r\nbank undertaking to do the work, or to forfeit the said settlement.\r\n\r\nAs thus: suppose the tax on land and tenements for the whole county of\r\nMiddlesex does, or should be so ordered as it might, amount to £20,000\r\nper annum more or less, which it now does, and much more, including the\r\nwork of the farmers’ teams, which must be accounted as money, and is\r\nequivalent to it, with some allowance to be rated for the city of London,\r\n&c., who do enjoy the benefit, and make the most use of the said roads,\r\nboth for carrying of goods and bringing provisions to the city, and\r\ntherefore in reason ought to contribute towards the highways (for it is a\r\nmost unequal thing that the road from Highgate to Smithfield Market, by\r\nwhich the whole city is, in a manner, supplied with live cattle, and the\r\nroad by those cattle horribly spoiled, should lie all upon that one\r\nparish of Islington to repair); wherefore I will suppose a rate for the\r\nhighways to be gathered through the city of London of £10,000 per annum\r\nmore, which may be appointed to be paid by carriers, drovers, and all\r\nsuch as keep teams, horses, or coaches, and the like, or many ways, as is\r\nmost equal and reasonable; the waste lands in the said county, which by\r\nthe consent of the parishes, lords of the manors, and proprietors shall\r\nbe allowed to the undertakers, when inclosed and let out, may (the land\r\nin Middlesex generally letting high) amount to £5,000 per annum more.\r\nIf, then, an Act of Parliament be procured to settle the tax of £30,000\r\nper annum for eight years, most of which will be levied in workmen and\r\nnot in money, and the waste lands for ever, I dare be bold to offer that\r\nthe highways for the whole county of Middlesex should be put into the\r\nfollowing form, and the £5,000 per annum land be bound to remain as a\r\nsecurity to maintain them so, and the county be never burdened with any\r\nfurther tax for the repair of the highways.\r\n\r\nAnd that I may not propose a matter in general, like begging the\r\nquestion, without demonstration, I shall enter into the particulars how\r\nit may be performed, and that under these following heads of articles:\r\n\r\n1.  What I propose to do to the highways.\r\n\r\n2.  What the charge will be.\r\n\r\n3.  How to be raised.\r\n\r\n4.  What security for performance.\r\n\r\n5.  What profit to the undertaker.\r\n\r\n1.  _What I propose to do to the highways_.—I answer first, not repair\r\nthem; and yet secondly, not alter them—that is, not alter the course they\r\nrun; but perfectly build them as a fabric.  And, to descend to the\r\nparticulars, it is first necessary to note which are the roads I mean,\r\nand their dimensions.\r\n\r\nFirst, the high post-roads, and they are for the county of Middlesex as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n        From London to               Miles.\r\nStaines, which is                        15\r\nColebrook is from Hounslow                5\r\nUxbridge                                 15\r\nBushey, the Old Street-way               10\r\nBarnet, or near it                        9\r\nWaltham Cross, in Ware Road              11\r\nBow                                       2\r\n                                         67\r\n\r\nBesides these, there, are cross-roads, bye-roads, and lanes, which must\r\nalso be looked after; and that some of them may be put into condition,\r\nothers may be wholly slighted and shut up, or made drift-ways,\r\nbridle-ways, or foot-ways, as may be thought convenient by the counties.\r\n\r\nThe cross-roads of most repute are as follows:\r\n\r\n      From                           To                         Miles.\r\nLondon            Hackney, Old Ford, and Bow                         5\r\nHackney           Dalston and Islington                              2\r\nDitto             Hornsey, Muswell Hill, to Whetstone                8\r\nTottenham         The Chase, Southgate, &c., called Green            6\r\n                  Lanes\r\nEnfield Wash      Enfield Town, Whetstone, Totteridge, to           10\r\n                  Edgworth\r\nLondon            Hampstead, Hendon, and Edgworth                    8\r\nEdgworth          Stanmore, to Pinner, to Uxbridge                   8\r\nLondon            Harrow and Pinner Green                           11\r\nDitto             Chelsea, Fulham                                    4\r\nBrentford         Thistleworth, Twittenham, and Kingston             6\r\nKingston          Staines, Colebrook, and Uxbridge                  17\r\nDitto             Chertsey Bridge                                    5\r\n                                                                    90\r\n                                            Overplus miles          50\r\n                                                                   140\r\n\r\nAnd because there may be many parts of the crossroads which cannot be\r\naccounted in the number abovementioned, or may slip my knowledge or\r\nmemory, I allow an overplus of 50 miles, to be added to the 90 miles\r\nabove, which together make the cross-roads of Middlesex to be 140 miles.\r\n\r\nFor the bye-lanes such as may be slighted need nothing but to be ditched\r\nup; such as are for private use of lands, for carrying off corn, and\r\ndriving cattle, are to be looked after by private hands.\r\n\r\nBut of the last sort, not to be accounted by particulars, in the small\r\ncounty of Middlesex we cannot allow less in cross-bye-lanes, from village\r\nto village, and from dwelling-houses which stand out of the way to the\r\nroads, than 1,000 miles.\r\n\r\nSo in the whole county I reckon up—\r\n\r\n                                    Miles.\r\nOf the high post-road                   67\r\nOf cross-roads less public             140\r\nOf bye-lanes and passes              1,000\r\n                                     1,207\r\n\r\nThese are the roads I mean, and thus divided under their several\r\ndenominations.\r\n\r\nTo the question, what I would do to them I answer—\r\n\r\n(1).  For the sixty-seven miles of high post-road I propose to throw up a\r\nfirm strong causeway well-bottomed, six feet high in the middle and four\r\nfeet on the side, faced with brick or stone, and crowned with gravel,\r\nchalk, or stone, as the several counties they are made through will\r\nafford, being forty-four feet in breadth, with ditches on either side\r\neight feet broad and four feet deep; so the whole breadth will be sixty\r\nfeet, if the ground will permit.\r\n\r\nAt the end of every two miles, or such like convenient distances, shall\r\nbe a cottage erected, with half an acre of ground allowed, which shall be\r\ngiven gratis, with one shilling per week wages, to such poor man of the\r\nparish as shall be approved, who shall, once at least every day, view his\r\nwalk, to open passages for the water to run into the ditches, to fill up\r\nholes or soft places.\r\n\r\nTwo riders shall be allowed to be always moving the rounds, to view\r\neverything out of repair, and make report to the directors, and to see\r\nthat the cottagers do their duty.\r\n\r\n(2).  For the 140 miles of cross-road a like causeway to be made, but of\r\ndifferent dimensions—the breadth twenty feet, if the ground will allow\r\nit; the ditches four feet broad, three feet deep; the height in the\r\nmiddle three feet, and on the sides one foot, or two where it may be\r\nneedful; to be also crowned with gravel, and one shilling per week to be\r\nallowed to the poor of every parish, the constables to be bound to find a\r\nman to walk on the highway every division for the same purpose as the\r\ncottagers do on the greater roads.\r\n\r\nPosts to be set up at every turning to note whither it goes, for the\r\ndirection of strangers, and how many miles distant.\r\n\r\n(3).  For the 1,000 miles of bye-lanes, only good and sufficient care to\r\nkeep them in repair as they are, and to carry the water off by clearing\r\nand cutting the ditches, and laying materials where they are wanted.\r\n\r\nThis is what I propose to do to them, and what, if once performed, I\r\nsuppose all people would own to be an undertaking both useful and\r\nhonourable.\r\n\r\n2.  The second question I propose to give an account of is, _What the\r\ncharge will be_, which I account thus.\r\n\r\nThe work of the great causeway I propose, shall not cost less than ten\r\nshillings per foot (supposing materials to be bought, carriage, and men’s\r\nlabour to be all hired), which for sixty-seven miles in length is no less\r\nthan the sum of £176,880; as thus:\r\n\r\nEvery mile accounted at 1,760 yards, and three feet to the yard, is 5,280\r\nfeet, which at ten shillings per foot is £2,640 per mile, and that,\r\nagain, multiplied by sixty-seven, makes the sum of £176,880, into which I\r\ninclude the charge of water-courses, mills to throw off water where\r\nneedful, drains, &c.\r\n\r\nTo this charge must be added, ditching to inclose land for thirty\r\ncottages, and building thirty cottages at £40 each, which is £1,200.\r\n\r\nThe work of the smaller causeway I propose to finish at the rate of a\r\nshilling per foot, which being for 149 miles in length, at 5,280 feet per\r\nmile, amounts to £36,960.\r\n\r\nDitching, draining, and repairing 1,000 miles, Supposed at three\r\nshillings per rod, as for 320,000 rods, is £48,000, which, added to the\r\ntwo former accounts, is thus:\r\n\r\n                                                  £\r\nThe high post-roads, or the great causeway        178,080\r\nThe small causeway                                 36,960\r\nBye-lanes, &c.                                     48,000\r\n                                                 £263,040\r\n\r\nIf I were to propose some measures for the easing this charge, I could\r\nperhaps lay a scheme down how it may be performed for less than one-half\r\nof this charge.\r\n\r\nAs first, by a grant of the court at the Old Bailey whereby all such\r\ncriminals as are condemned to die for smaller crimes may, instead of\r\ntransportation, be ordered a year’s work on the highways; others, instead\r\nof whippings, a proportioned time, and the like; which would, by a\r\nmoderate computation, provide us generally a supply of 200 workmen, and\r\ncoming in as fast as they go off; and let the overseers alone to make\r\nthem work.\r\n\r\nSecondly, by an agreement with the Guinea Company to furnish 200 negroes,\r\nwho are generally persons that do a great deal of work; and all these are\r\nsubsisted very reasonably out of a public storehouse.\r\n\r\nThirdly, by carts and horses to be bought, not hired, with a few able\r\ncarters; and to the other a few workmen that have judgment to direct the\r\nrest, and thus I question not the great causeway shall be done for four\r\nshillings per foot charge; but of this by-the-bye.\r\n\r\nFourthly, a liberty to ask charities and benevolences to the work.\r\n\r\n3.  To the question, _How this money shall be raised_.  I think if the\r\nParliament settle the tax on the county for eight years at £30,000 per\r\nannum, no man need ask how it shall be raised . . .  It will be easy\r\nenough to raise the money; and no parish can grudge to pay a little\r\nlarger rate for such a term, on condition never to be taxed for the\r\nhighways any more.\r\n\r\nEight years’ assessment at £30,000 per annum is enough to afford to\r\nborrow the money by way of anticipation, if need be; the fund being\r\nsecured by Parliament, and appropriated to that use and no other.\r\n\r\n4.  As to _What security for performance_.\r\n\r\nThe lands which are inclosed may be appropriated by the same Act of\r\nParliament to the bank and undertakers, upon condition of performance,\r\nand to be forfeit to the use of the several parishes to which they\r\nbelong, in case upon presentation by the grand juries, and reasonable\r\ntime given, any part of the roads in such and such parishes be not kept\r\nand maintained in that posture they are proposed to be.  Now the lands\r\nthus settled are an eternal security to the country for the keeping the\r\nroads in repair; because, they will always be of so much value over the\r\nneedful charge as will make it worth while to the undertakers to preserve\r\ntheir title to them; and the tenure of them being so precarious as to be\r\nliable to forfeiture on default, they will always be careful to uphold\r\nthe causeways.\r\n\r\nLastly, _What profit to the undertakers_.  For we must allow them to\r\ngain, and that considerably, or no man would undertake such a work.\r\n\r\nTo this I propose: first, during the work, allow them out of the stock\r\n£3,000 per annum for management.\r\n\r\nAfter the work is finished, so much of the £5,000 per annum as can be\r\nsaved, and the roads kept in good repair, let be their own; and if the\r\nlands secured be not of the value of £5,000 a year, let so much of the\r\neight years’ tax be set apart as may purchase land to make them up; if\r\nthey come to more, let the benefit be to the adventurers.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected here that a tax of £30,000 for eight years will come\r\nin as fast as it can well be laid out, and so no anticipations will be\r\nrequisite; for the whole work proposed cannot be probably finished in\r\nless time; and, if so,\r\n\r\nThe charge of the county amounts to        £240,000\r\nThe lands saved eight years’ revenue         40,000\r\n                                           £280,000\r\n\r\nwhich is £13,000 more than the charge; and if the work be done so much\r\ncheaper, as is mentioned, the profit to the undertaker will be\r\nunreasonable.\r\n\r\nTo this I say I would have the undertakers bound to accept the salary of\r\n£3,000 per annum for management, and if a whole year’s tax can be spared,\r\neither leave it unraised upon the country, or put it in bank to be\r\nimproved against any occasion—of building, perhaps, a great bridge; or\r\nsome very wet season or frost may so damnify the works as to make them\r\nrequire more than ordinary repair.  But the undertakers should make no\r\nprivate advantage of such an overplus; there might be ways enough found\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nAnother objection lies against the possibility of inclosing the lands\r\nupon the waste, which generally belongs to some manor, whose different\r\ntenures may be so cross, and so otherwise encumbered, that even the lords\r\nof those manors, though they were willing, could not convey them.\r\n\r\nThis may be answered in general, that an Act of Parliament is omnipotent\r\nwith respect to titles and tenures of land, and can empower lords and\r\ntenants to consent to what else they could not; as to particulars, they\r\ncannot be answered till they are proposed; but there is no doubt but an\r\nAct of Parliament may adjust it all in one head.\r\n\r\nWhat a kingdom would England be if this were performed in all the\r\ncounties of it!  And yet I believe it is feasible, even in the worst.  I\r\nhave narrowly deserved all the considerable ways in that unpassable\r\ncounty of Sussex, which (especially in some parts in the wild, as they\r\nvery properly call it, of the county) hardly admits the country people to\r\ntravel to markets in winter, and makes corn dear at market because it\r\ncannot be brought, and cheap at the farmer’s house because he cannot\r\ncarry it to market; yet even in that county would I undertake to carry on\r\nthis proposal, and that to great advantage, if backed with the authority\r\nof an Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\nI have seen in that horrible country the road, sixty to a hundred yards\r\nbroad, lie from side to side all poached with cattle, the land of no\r\nmanner of benefit, and yet no going with a horse, but at every step up to\r\nthe shoulders, full of sloughs and holes, and covered with standing\r\nwater.  It costs them incredible sums of money to repair them; and the\r\nvery places that are mended would fright a young traveller to go over\r\nthem.  The Romans mastered this work, and by a firm causeway made a\r\nhighway quite through this deep country, through Darkin in Surrey to\r\nStansted, and thence to Okeley, and so on to Arundel; its name tells us\r\nwhat it was made of (for it was called Stone Street), and many visible\r\nparts of it remain to this day.\r\n\r\nNow would any lord of a manor refuse to allow forty yards in breadth out\r\nof that road I mentioned, to have the other twenty made into a firm,\r\nfair, and pleasant causeway over that wilderness of a country?\r\n\r\nOr would not any man acknowledge that putting this country into a\r\ncondition for carriages and travellers to pass would be a great work?\r\nThe gentlemen would find the benefit of it in the rent of their land and\r\nprice of their timber; the country people would find the difference in\r\nthe sale of their goods, which now they cannot carry beyond the first\r\nmarket town, and hardly thither; and the whole county would reap an\r\nadvantage a hundred to one greater than the charge of it.  And since the\r\nwant we feel of any convenience is generally the first motive to\r\ncontrivance for a remedy, I wonder no man over thought of some expedient\r\nfor so considerable a defect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF ASSURANCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nASSURANCES among merchants, I believe, may plead prescription, and have\r\nbeen of use time out of mind in trade, though perhaps never so much a\r\ntrade as now.\r\n\r\nIt is a compact among merchants.  Its beginning being an accident to\r\ntrade, and arose from the disease of men’s tempers, who, having run\r\nlarger adventures in a single bottom than afterwards they found\r\nconvenient, grew fearful and uneasy; and discovering their uneasiness to\r\nothers, who perhaps had no effects in the same vessel, they offer to bear\r\npart of the hazard for part of the profit: convenience made this a\r\ncustom, and custom brought it into a method, till at last it becomes a\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nI cannot question the lawfulness of it, since all risk in trade is for\r\ngain, and when I am necessitated to have a greater cargo of goods in such\r\nor such a bottom than my stock can afford to lose, another may surely\r\noffer to go a part with me; and as it is just if I give another part of\r\nthe gain, he should run part of the risk, so it is as just that if he\r\nruns part of my risk, he should have part of the gain.  Some object the\r\ndisparity of the premium to the hazard, when the insurer runs the risk of\r\n£100 on the seas from Jamaica to London for 40s., which, say they, is\r\npreposterous and unequal.  Though this objection is hardly worth\r\nanswering to men of business, yet it looks something fair to them that\r\nknow no better; and for the information of such, I trouble the reader\r\nwith a few heads:\r\n\r\nFirst, they must consider the insurer is out no stock.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it is but one risk the insurer runs; whereas the assured has\r\nhad a risk out, a risk of debts abroad, a risk of a market, and a risk of\r\nhis factor, and has a risk of a market to come, and therefore ought to\r\nhave an answerable profit.\r\n\r\nThirdly, if it has been a trading voyage, perhaps the adventurer has paid\r\nthree or four such premiums, which sometimes make the insurer clear more\r\nby a voyage than the merchant.  I myself have paid £100 insurances in\r\nthose small premiums on a voyage I have not gotten £50 by; and I suppose\r\nI am not the first that has done so either.\r\n\r\nThis way of assuring has also, as other arts of trade have, suffered some\r\nimprovement (if I may be allowed that term) in our age; and the first\r\nstep upon it was an insurance office for houses, to insure them from\r\nfire.  Common fame gives the project to Dr. Barebone—a man, I suppose,\r\nbetter known as a builder than a physician.  Whether it were his, or\r\nwhose it was, I do not inquire; it was settled on a fund of ground rents,\r\nto answer in case of loss, and met with very good acceptance.\r\n\r\nBut it was soon followed by another, by way of friendly society, where\r\nall who subscribe pay their quota to build up any man’s house who is a\r\ncontributor, if it shall happen to be burnt.  I won’t decide which is the\r\nbest, or which succeeded best, but I believe the latter brings in most\r\nmoney to the contriver.\r\n\r\nOnly one benefit I cannot omit which they reap from these two societies\r\nwho are not concerned in either; that if any fire happen, whether in\r\nhouses insured or not insured, they have each of them a set of lusty\r\nfellows, generally watermen, who being immediately called up, wherever\r\nthey live, by watchmen appointed, are, it must be confessed, very active\r\nand diligent in helping to put out the fire.\r\n\r\nAs to any further improvement to be made upon assurances in trade, no\r\nquestion there may; and I doubt not but on payment of a small duty to the\r\ngovernment the king might be made the general insurer of all foreign\r\ntrade, of which more under another head.\r\n\r\nI am of the opinion also that an office of insurance erected to insure\r\nthe titles of lands, in an age where they are so precarious as now, might\r\nbe a project not unlikely to succeed, if established on a good fund.  But\r\nI shall say no more to that, because it seems to be a design in hand by\r\nsome persons in town, and is indeed no thought of my own.\r\n\r\nInsuring of life I cannot admire; I shall say nothing to it but that in\r\nItaly, where stabbing and poisoning is so much in vogue, something may be\r\nsaid for it, and on contingent annuities; and yet I never knew the thing\r\nmuch approved of on any account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF FRIENDLY SOCIETIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER branch of insurance is by contribution, or (to borrow the term\r\nfrom that before mentioned) friendly societies; which is, in short, a\r\nnumber of people entering into a mutual compact to help one another in\r\ncase any disaster or distress fall upon them.\r\n\r\nIf mankind could agree, as these might be regulated, all things which\r\nhave casualty in them might be secured.  But one thing is particularly\r\nrequired in this way of assurances: none can be admitted but such whose\r\ncircumstances are (at least, in some degree) alike, and so mankind must\r\nbe sorted into classes; and as their contingencies differ, every\r\ndifferent sort may be a society upon even terms; for the circumstances of\r\npeople, as to life, differ extremely by the age and constitution of their\r\nbodies and difference of employment—as he that lives on shore against him\r\nthat goes to sea, or a young man against an old man, or a shopkeeper\r\nagainst a soldier, are unequal.  I do not pretend to determine the\r\ncontroverted point of predestination, the foreknowledge and decrees of\r\nProvidence.  Perhaps, if a man be decreed to be killed in the trenches,\r\nthe same foreknowledge ordered him to list himself a soldier, that it\r\nmight come to pass, and the like of a seaman.  But this I am sure,\r\nspeaking of second causes, a seaman or a soldier are subject to more\r\ncontingent hazards than other men, and therefore are not upon equal terms\r\nto form such a society; nor is an annuity on the life of such a man worth\r\nso much as it is upon other men: therefore if a society should agree\r\ntogether to pay the executor of every member so much after the decease of\r\nthe said member, the seamen’s executors would most certainly have an\r\nadvantage, and receive more than they pay.  So that it is necessary to\r\nsort the world into parcels—seamen with seamen, soldiers with soldiers,\r\nand the like.\r\n\r\nNor is this a new thing; the friendly society must not pretend to assume\r\nto themselves the contrivance of the method, or think us guilty of\r\nborrowing from them, when we draw this into other branches; for I know\r\nnothing is taken from them but the bare words, “friendly society,” which\r\nthey cannot pretend to be any considerable piece of invention either.\r\n\r\nI can refer them to the very individual practice in other things, which\r\nclaims prescription beyond the beginning of the last age, and that is in\r\nour marshes and fens in Essex, Kent, and the Isle of Ely; where great\r\nquantities of land being with much pains and a vast charge recovered out\r\nof the seas and rivers, and maintained with banks (which they call\r\nwalls), the owners of those lands agree to contribute to the keeping up\r\nthose walls and keeping out the sea, which is all one with a friendly\r\nsociety; and if I have a piece of land in any level or marsh, though it\r\nbounds nowhere on the sea or river, yet I pay my proportion to the\r\nmaintenance of the said wall or bank; and if at any time the sea breaks\r\nin, the damage is not laid upon the man in whose land the breach\r\nhappened, unless it was by his neglect, but it lies on the whole land,\r\nand is called a “level lot.”\r\n\r\nAgain, I have known it practised in troops of horse, especially when it\r\nwas so ordered that the troopers mounted themselves; where every private\r\ntrooper has agreed to pay, perhaps, 2d. per diem out of his pay into a\r\npublic stock, which stock was employed to remount any of the troop who by\r\naccident should lose his horse.\r\n\r\nAgain, the sailors’ contribution to the Chest at Chatham is another\r\nfriendly society, and more might be named.\r\n\r\nTo argue against the lawfulness of this would be to cry down common\r\nequity as well as charity: for as it is kind that my neighbour should\r\nrelieve me if I fall into distress or decay, so it is but equal he should\r\ndo so if I agreed to have done the same for him; and if God Almighty has\r\ncommanded us to relieve and help one another in distress, surely it must\r\nbe commendable to bind ourselves by agreement to obey that command; nay,\r\nit seems to be a project that we are led to by the divine rule, and has\r\nsuch a latitude in it that for aught I know, as I said, all the disasters\r\nin the world might be prevented by it, and mankind be secured from all\r\nthe miseries, indigences, and distresses that happen in the world.  In\r\nwhich I crave leave to be a little particular.\r\n\r\nFirst general peace might be secured all over the world by it, if all the\r\npowers agreed to suppress him that usurped or encroached upon his\r\nneighbour.  All the contingencies of life might be fenced against by this\r\nmethod (as fire is already), as thieves, floods by land, storms by sea,\r\nlosses of all sorts, and death itself, in a manner, by making it up to\r\nthe survivor.\r\n\r\nI shall begin with the seamen; for as their lives are subject to more\r\nhazards than others, they seem to come first in view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of Seamen_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSailors are _les enfants perdus_, “the forlorn hope of the world;” they\r\nare fellows that bid defiance to terror, and maintain a constant war with\r\nthe elements; who, by the magic of their art, trade in the very confines\r\nof death, and are always posted within shot, as I may say, of the grave.\r\nIt is true, their familiarity with danger makes them despise it (for\r\nwhich, I hope, nobody will say they are the wiser); and custom has so\r\nhardened them that we find them the worst of men, though always in view\r\nof their last moment.\r\n\r\nI have observed one great error in the custom of England relating to\r\nthese sort of people, and which this way of friendly society would be a\r\nremedy for:\r\n\r\nIf a seaman who enters himself, or is pressed into, the king’s service be\r\nby any accident wounded or disabled, to recompense him for the loss, he\r\nreceives a pension during life, which the sailors call “smart-money,” and\r\nis proportioned to their hurt, as for the loss of an eye, arm, leg, or\r\nfinger, and the like: and as it is a very honourable thing, so it is but\r\nreasonable that a poor man who loses his limbs (which are his estate) in\r\nthe service of the Government, and is thereby disabled from his labour to\r\nget his bread, should be provided for, and not suffer to beg or starve\r\nfor want of those limbs he lost in the service of his country.\r\n\r\nBut if you come to the seamen in the merchants’ service, not the least\r\nprovision is made: which has been the loss of many a good ship, with many\r\na rich cargo, which would otherwise have been saved.\r\n\r\nAnd the sailors are in the right of it, too.  For instance, a merchant\r\nship coming home from the Indies, perhaps very rich, meets with a\r\nprivateer (not so strong but that she might fight him and perhaps get\r\noff); the captain calls up his crew, tells them, “Gentlemen, you see how\r\nit is; I don’t question but we may clear ourselves of this caper, if you\r\nwill stand by me.”  One of the crew, as willing to fight as the rest, and\r\nas far from a coward as the captain, but endowed with a little more wit\r\nthan his fellows, replies, “Noble captain, we are all willing to fight,\r\nand don’t question but to beat him off; but here is the case: if we are\r\ntaken, we shall be set on shore and then sent home, and lose perhaps our\r\nclothes and a little pay; but if we fight and beat the privateer, perhaps\r\nhalf a score of us may be wounded and lose our limbs, and then we are\r\nundone and our families.  If you will sign an obligation to us that the\r\nowners or merchants shall allow a pension to such as are maimed, that we\r\nmay not fight for the ship, and go a-begging ourselves, we will bring off\r\nthe ship or sink by her side; otherwise I am not willing to fight, for my\r\npart.”  The captain cannot do this; so they strike, and the ship and\r\ncargo are lost.\r\n\r\nIf I should turn this supposed example into a real history, and name the\r\nship and the captain that did so, it would be too plain to be\r\ncontradicted.\r\n\r\nWherefore, for the encouragement of sailors in the service of the\r\nmerchant, I would have a friendly society erected for seamen; wherein all\r\nsailors or seafaring men, entering their names, places of abode, and the\r\nvoyages they go upon at an office of insurance for seamen, and paying\r\nthere a certain small quarterage of 1s. per quarter, should have a sealed\r\ncertificate from the governors of the said office for the articles\r\nhereafter mentioned:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf any such seaman, either in fight or by any other accident at sea, come\r\nto be disabled, he should receive from the said office the following sums\r\nof money, either in pension for life, or ready money, as he pleased:\r\n\r\n  For the loss of       £                or\r\n                                £ per annum for life\r\nAn eye                    25                         2\r\nBoth eyes                100                         8\r\nOne leg                   50                         4\r\nBoth legs                 80                         6\r\nRight hand                80                         6\r\nLeft hand                 50                         4\r\nRight arm                100                         8\r\nLeft arm                  80                         6\r\nBoth hands               160                        12\r\nBoth arms                200                        16\r\n\r\nAny broken arm, or leg, or thigh, towards the cure £10\r\n\r\nIf taken by the Turks, £50 towards his ransom.\r\n\r\nIf he become infirm and unable to go to sea or maintain himself by age or\r\nsickness £6 per annum.\r\n\r\nTo their wives if they are killed or drowned £50\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nIn consideration of this, every seaman subscribing to the society shall\r\nagree to pay to the receipt of the said office his quota of the sum to be\r\npaid whenever, and as often as, such claims are made, the claims to be\r\nentered into the office and upon sufficient proof made, the governors to\r\nregulate the division and publish it in print.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose 4,000 seamen subscribe to this society, and after\r\nsix months—for no man should claim sooner than six months—a merchant’s\r\nship having engaged a privateer, there comes several claims together, as\r\nthus—\r\n\r\nA was wounded and lost one leg                                £50\r\nB blown up with powder, and has lost an eye                    25\r\nC had a great shot took off his arm                           100\r\nD with a splinter had an eye struck out                        25\r\nE was killed with a great shot; to be paid to his wife         50\r\n                                                             £250\r\n\r\nThe governors hereupon settle the claims of these persons, and make\r\npublication “that whereas such and such seamen, members of the society,\r\nhave in an engagement with a French privateer been so and so hurt, their\r\nclaims upon the office, by the rules and agreement of the said office,\r\nbeing adjusted by the governors, amounts to £250, which, being equally\r\ndivided among the subscribers, comes to 1s. 3d. each, which all persons\r\nthat are subscribers to the said office are desired to pay in for their\r\nrespective subscriptions, that the said wounded persons may be relieved\r\naccordingly, as they expect to be relieved if the same or the like\r\ncasualty should befall them.”\r\n\r\nIt is but a small matter for a man to contribute, if he gave 1s. 3d. out\r\nof his wages to relieve five wounded men of his own fraternity; but at\r\nthe same time to be assured that if he is hurt or maimed he shall have\r\nthe same relief, is a thing so rational that hardly anything but a\r\nhare-brained follow, that thinks of nothing, would omit entering himself\r\ninto such an office.\r\n\r\nI shall not enter further into this affair, because perhaps I may give\r\nthe proposal to some persons who may set it on foot, and then the world\r\nmay see the benefit of it by the execution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.—FOR WIDOWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same method of friendly society, I conceive, would be a very proper\r\nproposal for widows.\r\n\r\nWe have abundance of women, who have been bred well and lived well,\r\nruined in a few years, and perhaps left young with a houseful of children\r\nand nothing to support them, which falls generally upon the wives of the\r\ninferior clergy, or of shopkeepers and artificers.\r\n\r\nThey marry wives with perhaps £300 to £1,000 portion, and can settle no\r\njointure upon them.  Either they are extravagant and idle, and waste it;\r\nor trade decays; or losses or a thousand contingencies happen to bring a\r\ntradesman to poverty, and he breaks.  The poor young woman, it may be,\r\nhas three or four children, and is driven to a thousand shifts, while he\r\nlies in the Mint or Friars under the dilemma of a statute of bankruptcy;\r\nbut if he dies, then she is absolutely undone, unless she has friends to\r\ngo to.\r\n\r\nSuppose an office to be erected, to be called an office of insurance for\r\nwidows, upon the following conditions:\r\n\r\nTwo thousand women, or their husbands for them, enter their names into a\r\nregister to be kept for that purpose, with the names, age, and trade of\r\ntheir husbands, with the place of their abode, paying at the time of\r\ntheir entering 5s. down with 1s. 4d. per quarter, which is to the setting\r\nup and support of an office with clerks and all proper officers for the\r\nsame; for there is no maintaining such without charge.  They receive\r\nevery one of them a certificate sealed by the secretary of the office,\r\nand signed by the governors, for the articles hereafter mentioned:\r\n\r\nIf any one of the women become a widow at any time after six months from\r\nthe date of her subscription, upon due notice given, and claim made at\r\nthe office in form as shall be directed, she shall receive within six\r\nmouths after such claim made the sum of £500 in money without any\r\ndeductions, saving some small fees to the officers, which the trustees\r\nmust settle, that they may be known.\r\n\r\nIn consideration of this, every woman so subscribing obliges herself to\r\npay, as often as any member of the society becomes a widow, the due\r\nproportion or share, allotted to her to pay towards the £500 for the said\r\nwidow, provided her share does not exceed the sum of 5s.\r\n\r\nNo seamen’s or soldiers’ wives to be accepted into such a proposal as\r\nthis, on the account before mentioned, because the contingencies of their\r\nlives are not equal to others—unless they will admit this general\r\nexception, supposing they do not die out of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nIt might also be an exception that if the widow that claimed had really,\r\n_bonâ fide_, left her by her husband to her own use, clear of all debts\r\nand legacies, £2,000, she should have no claim, the intent being to aid\r\nthe poor, not add to the rich.  But there lie a great many objections\r\nagainst such an article, as—\r\n\r\n1.  It may tempt some to forswear themselves.\r\n\r\n2.  People will order their wills so as to defraud the exception.\r\n\r\nOne exception must be made, and that is, either very unequal matches (as\r\nwhen a woman of nineteen marries an old man of seventy), or women who\r\nhave infirm husbands—I mean, known and publicly so; to remedy which two\r\nthings are to be done:\r\n\r\n1.  The office must have moving officers without doors, who shall inform\r\nthemselves of such matters, and if any such circumstances appear, the\r\noffice should have fourteen days’ time to return their money and declare\r\ntheir subscriptions void.\r\n\r\n2.  No woman whose husband had any visible distemper should claim under a\r\nyear after her subscription.\r\n\r\nOne grand objection against this proposal is, how you will oblige people\r\nto pay either their subscription or their quarterage.\r\n\r\nTo this I answer, by no compulsion (though that might be performed too),\r\nbut altogether voluntary; only with this argument to move it, that if\r\nthey do not continue their payments, they lose the benefit of their past\r\ncontributions.\r\n\r\nI know it lies as a fair objection against such a project as this, that\r\nthe number of claims are so uncertain that nobody knows what they engage\r\nin when they subscribe, for so many may die annually out of two thousand\r\nas may make my payment £20 or £25 per annum; and if a woman happen to pay\r\nthat for twenty years, though she receives the £500 at last, she is a\r\ngreat loser; but if she dies before her husband, she has lessened his\r\nestate considerably, and brought a great loss upon him.\r\n\r\nFirst, I say to this that I would have such a proposal as this be so fair\r\nand so easy, that if any person who had subscribed found the payments too\r\nhigh and the claims fall too often, it should be at their liberty at any\r\ntime, upon notice given, to be released, and stand obliged no longer;\r\nand, if so, _volenti non fit injuria_.  Every one knows best what their\r\nown circumstances will bear.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, because death is a contingency no man can directly\r\ncalculate, and all that subscribe must take the hazard; yet that a\r\nprejudice against this notion may not be built on wrong grounds, let us\r\nexamine a little the probable hazard, and see how many shall die annually\r\nout of 2,000 subscribers, accounting by the common proportion of burials\r\nto the number of the living.\r\n\r\nSir William Petty, in his political arithmetic, by a very ingenious\r\ncalculation, brings the account of burials in London to be one in forty\r\nannually, and proves it by all the proper rules of proportioned\r\ncomputation; and I will take my scheme from thence.\r\n\r\nIf, then, one in forty of all the people in England die, that supposes\r\nfifty to die every year out of our two thousand subscribers; and for a\r\nwoman to contribute 5s. to every one, would certainly be to agree to pay\r\n£12 10s. per annum. upon her husband’s life, to receive £500 when he\r\ndied, and lose it if she died first; and yet this would not be a hazard\r\nbeyond reason too great for the gain.\r\n\r\nBut I shall offer some reasons to prove this to be impossible in our\r\ncase: first, Sir William Petty allows the city of London to contain about\r\na million of people, and our yearly bill of mortality never yet amounted\r\nto 25,000 in the most sickly years we have had (plague years excepted);\r\nsometimes but to 20,000, which is but one in fifty.  Now it is to be\r\nconsidered here that children and ancient people make up, one time with\r\nanother, at least one-third of our bills of mortality, and our assurances\r\nlie upon none but the middling age of the people, which is the only age\r\nwherein life is anything steady; and if that be allowed, there cannot die\r\nby his computation above one in eighty of such people every year; but\r\nbecause I would be sure to leave room for casualty, I will allow one in\r\nfifty shall die out of our number subscribed.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it must be allowed that our payments falling due only on the\r\ndeath of husbands, this one in fifty must not be reckoned upon the two\r\nthousand, for it is to be supposed at least as many women shall die as\r\nmen, and then there is nothing to pay; so that one in fifty upon one\r\nthousand is the most that I can suppose shall claim the contribution in a\r\nyear, which is twenty claims a year at 5s. each, and is £5 per annum.\r\nAnd if a woman pays this for twenty years, and claims at last, she is\r\ngainer enough, and no extraordinary loser if she never claims at all.\r\nAnd I verily believe any office might undertake to demand at all\r\nadventures not above £6 per annum, and secure the subscriber £500 in case\r\nshe come to claim as a widow.\r\n\r\nI forbear being more particular on this thought, having occasion to be\r\nlarger in other prints, the experiment being resolved upon by some\r\nfriends who are pleased to think this too useful a project not to be put\r\nin execution, and therefore I refer the reader to the public practice of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI have named these two cases as special experiments of what might be done\r\nby assurances in way of friendly society; and I believe I might, without\r\narrogance, affirm that the same thought might be improved into methods\r\nthat should prevent the general misery and poverty of mankind, and at\r\nonce secure us against beggars, parish poor, almshouses, and hospitals;\r\nand by which not a creature so miserable or so poor but should claim\r\nsubsistence as their due, and not ask it of charity.\r\n\r\nI cannot believe any creature so wretchedly base as to beg of mere\r\nchoice, but either it must proceed from want or sordid prodigious\r\ncovetousness; and thence I affirm there can be no beggar but he ought to\r\nbe either relieved or punished, or both.  If a man begs for more\r\ncovetousness without want, it is a baseness of soul so extremely sordid\r\nas ought to be used with the utmost contempt, and punished with the\r\ncorrection due to a dog.  If he begs for want, that want is procured by\r\nslothfulness and idleness, or by accident; if the latter, he ought to be\r\nrelieved; if the former, he ought to be punished for the cause, but at\r\nthe same time relieved also, for no man ought to starve, let his crime be\r\nwhat it will.\r\n\r\nI shall proceed, therefore, to a scheme by which all mankind, be he never\r\nso mean, so poor, so unable, shall gain for himself a just claim to a\r\ncomfortable subsistence whosoever age or casualty shall reduce him to a\r\nnecessity of making use of it.  There is a poverty so far from being\r\ndespicable that it is honourable, when a man by direct casualty, sudden\r\nProvidence, and without any procuring of his own, is reduced to want\r\nrelief from others, as by fire, shipwreck, loss of limbs, and the like.\r\n\r\nThese are sometimes so apparent that they command the charity of others;\r\nbut there are also many families reduced to decay whose conditions are\r\nnot so public, and yet their necessities as great.  Innumerable\r\ncircumstances reduce men to want; and pressing poverty obliges some\r\npeople to make their cases public, or starve; and from thence came the\r\ncustom of begging, which sloth and idleness has improved into a trade.\r\nBut the method I propose, thoroughly put in practice, would remove the\r\ncause, and the effect would cease of course.\r\n\r\nWant of consideration is the great reason why people do not provide in\r\ntheir youth and strength for old age and sickness; and the ensuing\r\nproposal is, in short, only this—that all persons in the time of their\r\nhealth and youth, while they are able to work and spare it, should lay up\r\nsome small inconsiderable part of their gettings as a deposit in safe\r\nhands, to lie as a store in bank to relieve them, if by age or accident\r\nthey come to be disabled, or incapable to provide for themselves; and\r\nthat if God so bless them that they nor theirs never come to need it, the\r\noverplus may be employed to relieve such as shall.\r\n\r\nIf an office in the same nature with this were appointed in every county\r\nin England, I doubt not but poverty might easily be prevented, and\r\nbegging wholly suppressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROPOSAL IS FOR A PENSION OFFICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHAT an office be erected in some convenient place, where shall be a\r\nsecretary, a clerk, and a searcher, always attending.\r\n\r\nThat all sorts of people who are labouring people and of honest repute,\r\nof what calling or condition soever, men or women (beggars and soldiers\r\nexcepted), who, being sound of their limbs and under fifty years of age,\r\nshall come to the said office and enter their names, trades, and places\r\nof abode into a register to be kept for that purpose, and shall pay down\r\nat the time of the said entering the sum of sixpence, and from thence one\r\nshilling per quarter, shall every one have an assurance under the seal of\r\nthe said office for these following conditions:\r\n\r\n1.  Every such subscriber, if by any casualty (drunkenness and quarrels\r\nexcepted) they break their limbs, dislocate joints, or are dangerously\r\nmaimed or bruised, able surgeons appointed for that purpose shall take\r\nthem into their care, and endeavour their cure gratis.\r\n\r\n2.  If they are at any time dangerously sick, on notice given to the said\r\noffice able physicians shall be appointed to visit them, and give their\r\nprescriptions gratis.\r\n\r\n3.  If by sickness or accident, as aforesaid, they lose their limbs or\r\neyes, so as to be visibly disabled to work, and are otherwise poor and\r\nunable to provide for themselves, they shall either be cured at the\r\ncharge of the office, or be allowed a pension for subsistence during\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n4.  If they become lame, aged, bedrid, or by real infirmity of body are\r\nunable to work, and otherwise incapable to provide for themselves, on\r\nproof made that it is really and honestly so they shall be taken into a\r\ncollege or hospital provided for that purpose, and be decently maintained\r\nduring life.\r\n\r\n5.  If they are seamen, and die abroad on board the merchants’ ships they\r\nwere employed in, or are cast away and drowned, or taken and die in\r\nslavery, their widows shall receive a pension during their widowhood.\r\n\r\n6.  If they were tradesmen and paid the parish rates, if by decay and\r\nfailure of trade they break and are put in prison for debt, they shall\r\nreceive a pension for subsistence during close imprisonment.\r\n\r\n7.  If by sickness or accidents they are reduced to extremities of\r\npoverty for a season, on a true representation to the office they shall\r\nbe relieved as the governors shall see cause.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that in the fourth article such as by sickness and age\r\nare disabled from work, and poor, shall be taken into the house and\r\nprovided for; whereas in the third article they who are blind or have\r\nlost limbs, &c., shall have pensions allowed them.\r\n\r\nThe reason of this difference is this:\r\n\r\nA poor man or woman that has lost his hand, or leg, or sight, is visibly\r\ndisabled, and we cannot be deceived; whereas other infirmities are not so\r\neasily judged of, and everybody would be claiming a pension, when but few\r\nwill demand being taken into a hospital but such as are really in want.\r\n\r\nAnd that this might be managed with such care and candour as a design\r\nwhich carries so good a face ought to be, I propose the following method\r\nfor putting it into practice:\r\n\r\nI suppose every undertaking of such a magnitude must have some principal\r\nagent to push it forward, who must manage and direct everything, always\r\nwith direction of the governors.\r\n\r\nAnd first I will suppose one general office erected for the great\r\nparishes of Stepney and Whitechapel; and as I shall lay down afterwards\r\nsome methods to oblige all people to come in and subscribe, so I may be\r\nallowed to suppose here that all the inhabitants of those two large\r\nparishes (the meaner labouring sort, I mean) should enter their names,\r\nand that the number of them should be 100,000, as I believe they would be\r\nat least.\r\n\r\nFirst, there should be named fifty of the principal inhabitants of the\r\nsaid parishes (of which the church-wardens for the time being, and all\r\nthe justices of the peace dwelling in the bounds of the said parish, and\r\nthe ministers resident for the time being, to be part) to be governors of\r\nthe said office.\r\n\r\nThe said fifty to be first nominated by the Lord Mayor of London for the\r\ntime being, and every vacancy to be supplied in ten days at farthest by\r\nthe majority of voices of the rest.\r\n\r\nThe fifty to choose a committee of eleven, to sit twice a week, of whom\r\nthree to be a quorum; with a chief governor, a deputy-governor, and a\r\ntreasurer.\r\n\r\nIn the office, a secretary with clerks of his own, a registrar and two\r\nclerks, four searchers, a messenger (one in daily attendance under\r\nsalary), a physician, a surgeon, and four visitors.\r\n\r\nIn the hospital, more or less (according to the number of people\r\nentertained), a housekeeper, a steward, nurses, a porter, and a chaplain.\r\n\r\nFor the support of this office, and that the deposit money might go to\r\nnone but the persons and uses for whom it is paid, and that it might not\r\nbe said officers and salaries was the chief end of the undertaking (as in\r\nmany a project it has been), I propose that the manager or undertaker,\r\nwhom I mentioned before, be the secretary, who shall have a clerk allowed\r\nhim, whose business it shall be to keep the register, take the entries,\r\nand give out the tickets (sealed by the governors and signed by himself),\r\nand to enter always the payment of quarterage of every subscriber.  And\r\nthat there may be no fraud or connivance, and too great trust be not\r\nreposed in the said secretary, every subscriber who brings his quarterage\r\nis to put it into a great chest, locked up with eleven locks, every\r\nmember of the committee to keep a key, so that it cannot be opened but in\r\nthe presence of them all; and every time a subscriber pays his\r\nquarterage, the secretary shall give him a sealed ticket thus [Christmas\r\n96] which shall be allowed as the receipt of quarterage for that quarter.\r\n\r\n_Note_.—The reason why every subscriber shall take a receipt or ticket\r\nfor his quarterage is because this must be the standing law of the\r\noffice—that if any subscribers fail to pay their quarterage, they shall\r\nnever claim after it until double so much be paid, nor not at all that\r\nquarter, whatever befalls them.\r\n\r\nThe secretary should be allowed to have 2d. for every ticket of entry he\r\ngives out, and ld. for every receipt he gives for quarterage, to be\r\naccounted for as follows:\r\n\r\nOne-third to himself in lieu of salary, he being to pay three clerks out\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nOne-third to the clerks and other officers among them.\r\n\r\nAnd one-third to defray the incident charge of the office.\r\n\r\n          _Thus calculated_.                     Per annum.\r\n                                             £          _s._    _d._\r\n100,000 subscribers paying 1d. each            1,666       3       4\r\nevery quarter is\r\n                             One-third\r\nTo the secretary per annum and three             555       7       9\r\nclerks\r\n                             One-third\r\n                          £ per\r\n                          annum.\r\nTo a registrar                     100\r\nTo a clerk                          50\r\nTo four searchers                  100\r\nTo a physician                     100\r\nTo a surgeon                       100\r\nTo four visitors                   100\r\n                                                 550       0       0\r\n               One-third to incident charges, such as\r\nTo ten committee-men,              260\r\n5s. each sitting, twice\r\nper week is\r\nTo a clerk of                       50\r\ncommittees\r\nTo a messenger                      40\r\nA house for the office              40\r\nA house for the                    100\r\nhospital\r\nContingencies                       70\r\n15_s._ 7_d._                                     560      15       7\r\n                                              £1,666       3       4\r\n\r\nAll the charge being thus paid out of such a trifle as ld. per quarter,\r\nthe next consideration is to examine what the incomes of this\r\nsubscription may be, and in time what may be the demands upon it.\r\n\r\n                                                £           s.      d.\r\nIf 100,000 persons subscribe, they pay           2,500       0       0\r\ndown at their entering each 6d., which\r\nis\r\nAnd the first year’s payment is in stock        20,000       0       0\r\nat 1s. per quarter\r\nIt must be allowed that under three                175       0       0\r\nmonths the subscriptions will not be\r\nwell complete; so the payment of\r\nquarterage shall not begin but from the\r\nday after the books are full, or shut\r\nup; and from thence one year is to pass\r\nbefore any claim can be made; and the\r\nmoney coming in at separate times, I\r\nsuppose no improvement upon it for the\r\nfirst year, except of the £2,500, which,\r\nlent to the king on some good fund at £7\r\nper cent. interest, advances the first\r\nyear\r\nThe quarterage of the second year,              19,800       0       0\r\nabating for 1,000 claims\r\nAnd the interest of the first year’s             1,774      10       0\r\nmoney at the end of the second year,\r\nlent to the king, as aforesaid, at 7 per\r\ncent. interest, is\r\nThe quarterage of the third year,               19,400       0       0\r\nabating for claims\r\nThe interest of former cash to the end           3,284       8       0\r\nof the third year\r\n                    Income of three years      £66,933      18       0\r\n\r\n_Note_.—Any persons may pay 2s. up to 5s. quarterly, if they please, and\r\nupon a claim will be allowed in proportion.\r\n\r\nTo assign what shall be the charge upon this, where contingency has so\r\ngreat a share, is not to be done; but by way of political arithmetic a\r\nprobable guess may be made.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that the pensions I propose to be paid to persons\r\nclaiming by the third, fifth, and sixth articles are thus: every person\r\nwho paid 1s. quarterly shall receive 12d. weekly, and so in proportion\r\nevery 12d. paid quarterly by any one person to receive so many shillings\r\nweekly, if they come to claim a pension.\r\n\r\nThe first year no claim is allowed; so the bank has in stock completely\r\n£22,500.  From thence we are to consider the number of claims.\r\n\r\nSir William Petty, in his “Political Arithmetic,” supposes not above one\r\nin forty to die per annum out of the whole number of people; and I can by\r\nno means allow that the circumstances of our claims will be as frequent\r\nas death, for these reasons:\r\n\r\n1.  Our subscriptions respect all persons grown and in the prime of their\r\nage; past the first, and providing against the last, part of danger (Sir\r\nWilliam’s account including children and old people, which always make up\r\none-third of the bills of mortality).\r\n\r\n2.  Our claims will fall thin at first for several years; and let but the\r\nmoney increase for ten years, as it does in the account for three years,\r\nit would be almost sufficient to maintain the whole number.\r\n\r\n3.  Allow that casualty and poverty are our debtor side; health,\r\nprosperity, and death are the creditor side of the account; and in all\r\nprobable accounts those three articles will carry off three fourth-parts\r\nof the number, as follows: If one in forty shall die annually (as no\r\ndoubt they shall, and more), that is 2,500 a year, which in twenty years\r\nis 50,000 of the number; I hope I may be allowed one-third to be out of\r\ncondition to claim, apparently living without the help of charity, and\r\none third in health and body, and able to work; which, put together, make\r\n83,332; so it leaves 16,668 to make claims of charity and pensions in the\r\nfirst twenty years, and one-half of them must, according to Sir William\r\nPetty, die on our hands in twenty years; so there remains but 8,334.\r\n\r\nBut to put it out of doubt, beyond the proportion to be guessed at, I\r\nwill allow they shall fall thus:\r\n\r\nThe first year, we are to note, none can claim;

and yet here are sundry articles to be considered on\r\nboth sides of the account that will necessarily increase the stock and\r\ndiminish the charge:\r\n\r\nFirst, in the five years’ time 6,200              3,400       0      0\r\nhaving claimed charity, the number being\r\nabated for in the reckoning above for\r\nstock, it may be allowed new\r\nsubscriptions will be taken in to keep\r\nthe number full, which in five years\r\namounts to\r\nTheir sixpences is                                  115       0      0\r\n                                                 £3,555       0      0\r\nWhich added to £115,889 15s. 6d. augments       119,444      15      6\r\nbe stock to\r\nSix thousand two hundred persons claiming         4,000       0      0\r\nhelp, which falls, to be sure, on the\r\naged and infirm, I think, at a modest\r\ncomputation, in five years’ time 500 of\r\nthem may be dead, which, without allowing\r\nannually, we take at an abatement of\r\n£4,000 out of the charge\r\nWhich reduces the charge to                      23,500       0      0\r\n\r\nBesides this, the interest of the quarterage, which is supposed in the\r\nformer account to lie dead till the year is out, which cast up from\r\nquarter to quarter, allowing it to be put out quarterly, as it may well\r\nbe, amounts to, by computation for five years, £5,250.\r\n\r\nFrom the fifth year, as near as can be computed, the number of pensioners\r\nbeing so great, I make no doubt but they shall die off the hands of the\r\nundertaker as fast as they shall fall in, excepting, so much difference\r\nas the payment of every year, which the interest of the stock shall\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\n                              _For example_:\r\n\r\n                                               £          _s._    _d._\r\nAt the end of the fifth year the stock          94,629      15       6\r\nin hand\r\nThe payment of the sixth year                   20,000       0       0\r\nInterest of the stock                            5,408       4       0\r\n                                              £120,037      19       6\r\nAllow an overplus charge for keeping in         10,000       0       0\r\nthe house, which will be dearer than\r\npensions, £10,000 per annum\r\nCharge of the sixth year                        22,500       0       0\r\nBalance in cash                                 87,537      19       6\r\n                                              £120,037      19       6\r\n\r\nThis also is to be allowed—that all those persons who are kept by the\r\noffice in the house shall have employment provided for them, whereby no\r\npersons shall be kept idle, the works to be suited to every one’s\r\ncapacity without rigour, only some distinction to those who are most\r\nwilling to work; the profits of the said work to the stock of the house.\r\n\r\nBesides this, there may great and very profitable methods be found out to\r\nimprove the stock beyond the settled interest of 7 per cent., which\r\nperhaps may not always be to be had, for the Exchequer is not always\r\nborrowing money; but a bank of £80,000, employed by faithful hands, need\r\nnot want opportunities of great, and very considerable improvement.\r\n\r\nAlso it would be a very good object for persons who die rich to leave\r\nlegacies to, which in time might be very well supposed to raise a\r\nstanding revenue to it.\r\n\r\nI will not say but various contingencies may alter the charge of this\r\nundertaking, and swell the claims beyond proportion further than I extend\r\nit; but all that, and much more, is sufficiently answered in the\r\ncalculations by above £80,000 in stock to provide for it.\r\n\r\nAs to the calculation being made on a vast number of subscribers, and\r\nmore than, perhaps, will be allowed likely to subscribe, I think the\r\nproportion may hold good in a few as well as in a great many; and perhaps\r\nif 20,000 subscribed, it might be as effectual. I am indeed willing to\r\nthink all men should have sense enough to see the usefulness of such a\r\ndesign, and be persuaded by their interest to engage in it; but some men\r\nhave less prudence than brutes, and will make no provision against age\r\ntill it comes; and to deal with such, two ways might be used by authority\r\nto compel them.\r\n\r\n1.  The churchwardens and justices of peace should send the beadle of the\r\nparish, with an officer belonging to this office, about to the poorer\r\nparishioners to tell them that, since such honourable provision is made\r\nfor them to secure themselves in old age from poverty and distress, they\r\nshould expect no relief from the parish if they refused to enter\r\nthemselves, and by sparing so small a part of their earnings to prevent\r\nfuture misery.\r\n\r\n2.  The churchwardens of every parish might refuse the removal of persons\r\nand families into their parish but upon their having entered into this\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n3.  All persons should be publicly desired to forbear giving anything to\r\nbeggars, and all common beggars suppressed after a certain time; for this\r\nwould effectually suppress beggary at last.\r\n\r\nAnd, to oblige the parishes to do this on behalf of such a project, the\r\ngovernor of the house should secure the parish against all charges coming\r\nupon them from any person who did subscribe and pay the quarterage, and\r\nthat would most certainly oblige any parish to endeavour that all the\r\nlabouring meaner people in the parish should enter their names; for in\r\ntime it would most certainly take all the poor in the parish off of their\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nI know that by law no parish can refuse to relieve any person or family\r\nfallen into distress; and therefore to send them word they must expect no\r\nrelief, would seem a vain threatening.  But thus far the parish may do:\r\nthey shall be esteemed as persons who deserve no relief, and shall be\r\nused accordingly; for who indeed would ever pity that man in his distress\r\nwho at the expense of two pots of beer a month might have prevented it,\r\nand would not spare it?\r\n\r\nAs to my calculations, on which I do not depend either, I say this: if\r\nthey are probable, and that in five years’ time a subscription of a\r\nhundred thousand persons would have £87,537 19s. 6d. in cash, all charges\r\npaid, I desire any one but to reflect what will not such a sum do.  For\r\ninstance, were it laid out in the Million Lottery tickets, which are now\r\nsold at £6 each, and bring in £1 per annum for fifteen years, every\r\n£1,000 so laid out pays back in time £2,500, and that time would be as\r\nfast as it would be wanted, and therefore be as good as money; or if laid\r\nout in improving rents, as ground-rents with buildings to devolve in\r\ntime, there is no question but a revenue would be raised in time to\r\nmaintain one-third part of the number of subscribers, if they should come\r\nto claim charity.\r\n\r\nAnd I desire any man to consider the present state of this kingdom, and\r\ntell me, if all the people of England, old and young, rich and poor, were\r\nto pay into one common bank 4s. per annum a head, and that 4s. duly and\r\nhonestly managed, whether the overplus paid by those who die off, and by\r\nthose who never come to want, would not in all probability maintain all\r\nthat should be poor, and for ever banish beggary and poverty out of the\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF WAGERING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAGERING, as now practised by politics and contracts, is become a branch\r\nof assurances; it was before more properly a part of gaming, and as it\r\ndeserved, had but a very low esteem; but shifting sides, and the war\r\nproviding proper subjects, as the contingencies of sieges, battles,\r\ntreaties, and campaigns, it increased to an extraordinary reputation, and\r\noffices were erected on purpose which managed it to a strange degree and\r\nwith great advantage, especially to the office-keepers; so that, as has\r\nbeen computed, there was not less gaged on one side and other, upon the\r\nsecond siege of Limerick, than two hundred thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nHow it is managed, and by what trick and artifice it became a trade, and\r\nhow insensibly men were drawn into it, an easy account may be given.\r\n\r\nI believe novelty was the first wheel that set it on work, and I need\r\nmake no reflection upon the power of that charm: it was wholly a new\r\nthing, at least upon the Exchange of London; and the first occasion that\r\ngave it a room among public discourse, was some persons forming wagers on\r\nthe return and success of King James, for which the Government took\r\noccasion to use them as they deserved.\r\n\r\nI have heard a bookseller in King James’s time say, “That if he would\r\nhave a book sell, he would have it burnt by the hand of the common\r\nhangman;” the man, no doubt, valued his profit above his reputation; but\r\npeople are so addicted to prosecute a thing that seems forbid, that this\r\nvery practice seemed to be encouraged by its being contraband.\r\n\r\nThe trade increased, and first on the Exchange and then in coffee-houses\r\nit got life, till the brokers, those vermin of trade, got hold of it, and\r\nthen particular offices were set apart for it, and an incredible resort\r\nthither was to be seen every day.\r\n\r\nThese offices had not been long in being, but they were thronged with\r\nsharpers and setters as much as the groom-porters, or any gaming-ordinary\r\nin town, where a man had nothing to do but to make a good figure and\r\nprepare the keeper of the office to give him a credit as a good man, and\r\nthough he had not a groat to pay, he should take guineas and sign\r\npolities, till he had received, perhaps, £300 or £400 in money, on\r\ncondition to pay great odds, and then success tries the man; if he wins\r\nhis fortune is made; if not, he’s a better man than he was before by just\r\nso much money, for as to the debt, he is your humble servant in the\r\nTemple or Whitehall.\r\n\r\nBut besides those who are but the thieves of the trade, there is a method\r\nas effectual to get money as possible, managed with more appearing\r\nhonesty, but no less art, by which the wagerer, in confederacy with the\r\noffice-keeper, shall lay vast sums, great odds, and yet be always sure to\r\nwin.\r\n\r\nFor example: A town in Flanders, or elsewhere, during the war is\r\nbesieged; perhaps at the beginning of the siege the defence is vigorous,\r\nand relief probable, and it is the opinion of most people the town will\r\nhold out so long, or perhaps not be taken at all: the wagerer has two or\r\nthree more of his sort in conjunction, of which always the office-keeper\r\nis one; and they run down all discourse of the taking the town, and offer\r\ngreat odds it shall not be taken by such a day.  Perhaps this goes on a\r\nweek, and then the scale turns; and though they seem to hold the same\r\nopinion still, yet underhand the office-keeper has orders to take all the\r\nodds which by their example was before given against the taking the town;\r\nand so all their first-given odds are easily secured, and yet the people\r\nbrought into a vein of betting against the siege of the town too.  Then\r\nthey order all the odds to be taken as long as they will run, while they\r\nthemselves openly give odds, and sign polities, and oftentimes take their\r\nown money, till they have received perhaps double what they at first\r\nlaid.  Then they turn the scale at once, and cry down the town, and lay\r\nthat it shall be taken, till the length of the first odds is fully run;\r\nand by this manage, if the town be taken they win perhaps two or three\r\nthousand pounds, and if it be not taken, they are no losers neither.\r\n\r\nIt is visible by experience, not one town in ten is besieged but it is\r\ntaken.  The art of war is so improved, and our generals are so wary, that\r\nan army seldom attempts a siege, but when they are almost sure to go on\r\nwith it; and no town can hold out if a relief cannot be had from abroad.\r\n\r\nNow, if I can by first laying £500 to £200 with A, that the town shall\r\nnot be taken, wheedle in B to lay me £5,000 to £2,000 of the same; and\r\nafter that, by bringing down the vogue of the siege, reduce the wagers to\r\neven-hand, and lay £2,000 with C that the town shall not be taken; by\r\nthis method, it is plain—\r\n\r\nIf the town be not taken, I win £2,200 and lose £2,000.\r\n\r\nIf the town be taken, I win £5,000 and lose £2,500.\r\n\r\nThis is gaming by rule, and in such a knot it is impossible to lose; for\r\nif it is in any man’s or company of men’s power, by any artifice to alter\r\nthe odds, it is in their power to command the money out of every man’s\r\npocket, who has no more wit than to venture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF FOOLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF all persons who are objects of our charity, none move my compassion\r\nlike those whom it has pleased God to leave in a full state health and\r\nstrength, but deprived of reason to act for themselves.  And it is, in my\r\nopinion, one of the greatest scandals upon the understanding of others to\r\nmock at those who want it.  Upon this account I think the hospital we\r\ncall Bedlam to be a noble foundation, a visible instance of the sense our\r\nancestors had of the greatest unhappiness which can befall humankind;\r\nsince as the soul in man distinguishes him from a brute, so where the\r\nsoul is dead (for so it is as to acting) no brute so much a beast as a\r\nman.  But since never to have it, and to have lost it, are synonymous in\r\nthe effect, I wonder how it came to pass that in the settlement of that\r\nhospital they made no provision for persons born without the use of their\r\nreason, such as we call fools, or, more properly, naturals.\r\n\r\nWe use such in England with the last contempt, which I think is a strange\r\nerror, since though they are useless to the commonwealth, they are only\r\nso by God’s direct providence, and no previous fault.\r\n\r\nI think it would very well become this wise age to take care of such; and\r\nperhaps they are a particular rent-charge on the great family of mankind,\r\nleft by the Maker of us all, like a younger brother, who though the\r\nestate be given from him, yet his father expected the heir should take\r\nsome care of him.\r\n\r\nIf I were to be asked, Who ought in particular to be charged with this\r\nwork? I would answer in general those who have a portion of understanding\r\nextraordinary.  Not that I would lay a tax upon any man’s brains, or\r\ndiscourage wit by appointing wise men to maintain fools; but, some\r\ntribute is due to God’s goodness for bestowing extraordinary gifts; and\r\nwho can it be better paid to than such as suffer for want of the same\r\nbounty?\r\n\r\nFor the providing, therefore, some subsistence for such that natural\r\ndefects may not be exposed:\r\n\r\nIt is proposed that a fool-house be erected, either by public authority,\r\nor by the city, or by an Act of Parliament, into which all that are\r\nnaturals or born fools, without respect or distinction, should be\r\nadmitted and maintained.\r\n\r\nFor the maintenance of this, a small stated contribution, settled by the\r\nauthority of an Act of Parliament, without any damage to the persons\r\npaying the same, might be very easily raised by a tax upon learning, to\r\nbe paid by the authors of books:\r\n\r\nEvery book that shall be printed in folio, from 40 sheets           £5\r\nand upwards, to pay at the licensing (for the whole\r\nimpression)\r\nUnder 40 sheets                                                   40s.\r\nEvery quarto                                                      20s.\r\nEvery octavo of 10 sheets and upward                              20s.\r\nEvery octavo under 10 sheets, and every bound book in 12mo        10s.\r\nEvery stitched pamphlet                                            2s.\r\n\r\n                     Reprinted copies the same rates.\r\n\r\nThis tax to be paid into the Chamber of London for the space of twenty\r\nyears, would, without question, raise a fund sufficient to build and\r\npurchase a settlement for this house.\r\n\r\nI suppose this little tax being to be raised at so few places as the\r\nprinting-presses, or the licensers of books, and consequently the charge\r\nbut very small in gathering, might bring in about £1,500 per annum for\r\nthe term of twenty years, which would perform the work to the degree\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\nThe house should be plain and decent (for I don’t think the ostentation\r\nof buildings necessary or suitable to works of charity), and be built\r\nsomewhere out of town for the sake of the air.\r\n\r\nThe building to cost about £1,000, or, if the revenue exceed, to cost\r\n£2,000 at most, and the salaries mean in proportion.\r\n\r\nIn the House.

But\r\nsince an Act of Parliament is necessary to be had for the collecting this\r\nduty, and that taxes for keeping of fools would be difficultly obtained,\r\nwhile they are so much wanted for wise men, I would propose to raise the\r\nmoney by voluntary charity, which would be a work that would leave more\r\nhonour to the undertakers than feasts and great shows, which our public\r\nbodies too much diminish their stocks with.\r\n\r\nBut to pass all suppositious ways, which are easily thought of, but\r\nhardly procured, I propose to maintain fools out of our own folly.  And\r\nwhereas a great deal of money has been thrown about in lotteries, the\r\nfollowing proposal would very easily perfect our work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHARITY-LOTTERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat a lottery be set up by the authority of the Lord Mayor and Court of\r\nAldermen, for a hundred thousand tickets, at twenty shillings each, to be\r\ndrawn by the known way and method of drawing lotteries, as the\r\nmillion-lottery was drawn, in which no allowance to be made to anybody,\r\nbut the fortunate to receive the full sum of one hundred thousand pounds\r\nput in, without discount, and yet this double advantage to follow:\r\n\r\n1.  That an immediate sum of one hundred thousand pounds shall be raised\r\nand paid into the Exchequer for the public use.\r\n\r\n2.  A sum of above twenty thousand pounds be gained, to be put into the\r\nhands of known trustees, to be laid out in a charity for the maintenance\r\nof the poor.\r\n\r\nThat as soon as the money shall be come in, it shall be paid into the\r\nExchequer, either on some good fund, if any suitable, or on the credit of\r\nthe Exchequer; and that when the lottery is drawn, the fortunate to\r\nreceive tallies or bills from the Exchequer for their money, payable at\r\nfour years.\r\n\r\nThe Exchequer receives this money, and gives out tallies according to the\r\nprizes, when it is drawn, all payable at four years; and the interest of\r\nthis money for four years is struck in tallies proportioned to the\r\nmaintenance; which no parish would refuse that subsisted them wholly\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nI make no question but that if such a hospital was erected within a mile\r\nor two of the city, one great circumstance would happen, viz., that the\r\ncommon sort of people, who are very much addicted to rambling in the\r\nfields, would make this house the customary walk, to divert themselves\r\nwith the objects to be seen there, and to make what they call sport with\r\nthe calamity of others, as is now shamefully allowed in Bedlam.\r\n\r\nTo prevent this, and that the condition of such, which deserves pity, not\r\ncontempt, might not be the more exposed by this charity, it should be\r\nordered: that the steward of the house be in commission of the peace\r\nwithin the precincts of the house only, and authorised to punish by\r\nlimited fines or otherwise any person that shall offer any abuse to the\r\npoor alms-people, or shall offer to make sport at their condition.\r\n\r\nIf any person at reading of this should be so impertinent as to ask to\r\nwhat purpose I would appoint a chaplain in a hospital of fools, I could\r\nanswer him very well by saying, for the use of the other persons,\r\nofficers, and attendants in the house.  But besides that, pray, why not a\r\nchaplain for fools, as well as for knaves, since both, though in a\r\ndifferent manner, are incapable of reaping any benefit by religion,\r\nunless by some invisible influence they are made docile; and since the\r\nsame secret power can restore these to their reason, as must make the\r\nother sensible, pray why not a chaplain?  Idiots indeed were denied the\r\ncommunion in the primitive churches, but I never read they were not to be\r\nprayed for, or were not admitted to hear.\r\n\r\nIf we allow any religion, and a Divine Supreme Power, whose influence\r\nworks invisibly on the hearts of men (as he must be worse than the people\r\nwe talk of, who denies it), we must allow at the same time that Power can\r\nrestore the reasoning faculty to an idiot, and it is our part to use the\r\nproper means of supplicating Heaven to that end, leaving the disposing\r\npart to the issue of unalterable Providence.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of Providence has not left us without examples of some of the\r\nmost stupid natural idiots in the world who have been restored to their\r\nreason, or, as one would think, had reason infused after a long life of\r\nidiotism; perhaps, among other wise ends, to confute that sordid\r\nsupposition that idiots have no souls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF BANKRUPTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS chapter has some right to stand next to that of fools, for besides\r\nthe common acceptation of late, which makes every unfortunate man a fool,\r\nI think no man so much made a fool of as a bankrupt.\r\n\r\nIf I may be allowed so much liberty with our laws, which are generally\r\ngood, and above all things are tempered with mercy, lenity, and freedom,\r\nthis has something in it of barbarity; it gives a loose to the malice and\r\nrevenge of the creditor, as well as a power to right himself, while it\r\nleaves the debtor no way to show himself honest.  It contrives all the\r\nways possible to drive the debtor to despair, and encourages no new\r\nindustry, for it makes him perfectly incapable of anything but starving.\r\n\r\nThis law, especially as it is now frequently executed, tends wholly to\r\nthe destruction of the debtor, and yet very little to the advantage of\r\nthe creditor.\r\n\r\n1.  The severities to the debtor are unreasonable, and, if I may so say,\r\na little inhuman, for it not only strips him of all in a moment, but\r\nrenders him for ever incapable of helping himself, or relieving his\r\nfamily by future industry.  If he escapes from prison, which is hardly\r\ndone too, if he has nothing left, he must starve or live on charity; if\r\nhe goes to work no man dare pay him his wages, but he shall pay it again\r\nto the creditors; if he has any private stock left for a subsistence he\r\ncan put it nowhere; every man is bound to be a thief and take it from\r\nhim; if he trusts it in the hands of a friend he must receive it again as\r\na great courtesy, for that friend is liable to account for it.  I have\r\nknown a poor man prosecuted by a statute to that degree that all he had\r\nleft was a little money which he knew not where to hide; at last, that he\r\nmight not starve, he gives it to his brother who had entertained him; the\r\nbrother, after he had his money quarrels with him to get him out of his\r\nhouse, and when he desires him to let him have the money lent him, gives\r\nhim this for answer, I cannot pay you safely, for there is a statute\r\nagainst you; which run the poor man to such extremities that he destroyed\r\nhimself.  Nothing is more frequent than for men who are reduced by\r\nmiscarriage in trade to compound and set up again and get good estates;\r\nbut a statute, as we call it, for ever shuts up all doors to the debtor’s\r\nrecovery, as if breaking were a crime so capital that he ought to be cast\r\nout of human society and exposed to extremities worse than death.  And,\r\nwhich will further expose the fruitless severity of this law, it is easy\r\nto make it appear that all this cruelty to the debtor is so far,\r\ngenerally speaking, from advantaging the creditors, that it destroys the\r\nestate, consumes it in extravagant charges, and unless the debtor be\r\nconsenting, seldom makes any considerable dividends.  And I am bold to\r\nsay there is no advantage made by the prosecuting of a statute with\r\nseverity, but what might be doubly made by methods more merciful.  And\r\nthough I am not to prescribe to the legislators of the nation, yet by way\r\nof essay I take leave to give my opinion and my experience in the\r\nmethods, consequences, and remedies of this law.\r\n\r\nAll people know, who remember anything of the times when that law was\r\nmade, that the evil it was pointed at was grown very rank, and breaking\r\nto defraud creditors so much a trade, that the parliament had good reason\r\nto set up a fury to deal with it; and I am far from reflecting on the\r\nmakers of that law, who, no question, saw it was necessary at that time.\r\nBut as laws, though in themselves good, are more or less so, as they are\r\nmore or less seasonable, squared, and adapted to the circumstances and\r\ntime of the evil they are made against; so it were worth while (with\r\nsubmission) for the same authority to examine:\r\n\r\n1.  Whether the length of time since that act was made has not given\r\nopportunity to debtors,\r\n\r\n  (1)  To evade the force of the act by ways and shifts to avoid the\r\n  power of it, and secure their estates out of the reach of it.\r\n\r\n  (2)  To turn the point of it against those whom it was made to relieve.\r\n  Since we see frequently now that bankrupts desire statutes, and procure\r\n  them to be taken out against themselves.\r\n\r\n2.  Whether the extremities of this law are not often carried on beyond\r\nthe true intent and meaning of the act itself by persons who, besides\r\nbeing creditors, are also malicious, and gratify their private revenge by\r\nprosecuting the offender, to the ruin of his family.\r\n\r\nIf these two points are to be proved, then I am sure it will follow that\r\nthis act is now a public grievance to the nation, and I doubt not but\r\nwill be one time or other repealed by the same wise authority which made\r\nit.\r\n\r\n1.  Time and experience has furnished the debtors with ways and means to\r\nevade the force of this statute, and to secure their estate against the\r\nreach of it, which renders it often insignificant, and consequently, the\r\nknave against whom the law was particularly bent gets off, while he only\r\nwho fails of mere necessity, and whose honest principle will not permit\r\nhim to practise those methods, is exposed to the fury of this act.  And\r\nas things are now ordered, nothing is more easy than for a man to order\r\nhis estate so that a statute shall have no power over it, or at least but\r\na little.\r\n\r\nIf the bankrupt be a merchant, no statute can reach his effects beyond\r\nthe seas; so that he has nothing to secure but his books, and away he\r\ngoes into the Friars.  If a Shopkeeper, he has more difficulty: but that\r\nis made easy, for there are men and carts to be had whose trade it is,\r\nand who in one night shall remove the greatest warehouse of goods or\r\ncellar of wines in the town and carry them off into those nurseries of\r\nrogues, the Mint and Friars; and our constables and watch, who are the\r\nallowed magistrates of the night, and who shall stop a poor little\r\nlurking thief, that it may be has stole a bundle of old clothes, worth\r\nfive shilling, shall let them all pass without any disturbance, and\r\nhundred honest men robbed of their estates before their faces, to the\r\neternal infamy of the justice of the nation.\r\n\r\nAnd were a man but to hear the discourse among the inhabitants of those\r\ndens of thieves, when they first swarm about a new-comer to comfort him,\r\nfor they are not all hardened to a like degree at once.  “Well,” says the\r\nfirst, “come, don’t be concerned, you have got a good parcel of goods\r\naway I promise you, you need not value all the world.”  “All! would I had\r\ndone so,” says another, “I’d a laughed at all my creditors.”  “Ay,” says\r\nthe young proficient in the hardened trade, “but my creditors!”  “Hang\r\nthe creditors!” says a third; “why, there’s such a one, and such a one,\r\nthey have creditors too, and they won’t agree with them, and here they\r\nlive like gentlemen, and care not a farthing for them.  Offer your\r\ncreditors half a crown in the pound, and pay it them in old debts, and if\r\nthey won’t take it let them alone; they’ll come after you, never fear\r\nit.”  “Oh! but a statute,” says he again.  “Oh! but the devil,” cries the\r\nMinter.  “Why, ’tis the statutes we live by,” say they; “why, if it were\r\nnot for statutes, creditors would comply, and debtors would compound, and\r\nwe honest fellows here of the Mint would be starved.  Prithee, what need\r\nyou care for a statute?  A thousand statutes can’t reach you here.”  This\r\nis the language of the country, and the new-comer soon learns to speak\r\nit; for I think I may say, without wronging any man, I have known many a\r\nman go in among them honest, that is, without ill design, but I never\r\nknew one come away so again.  Then comes a graver sort among this black\r\ncrew (for here, as in hell, are fiends of degrees and different\r\nmagnitude), and he falls into discourse with the new-comer, and gives him\r\nmore solid advice.  “Look you, sir, I am concerned to see you melancholy;\r\nI am in your circumstance too, and if you’ll accept of it, I’ll give you\r\nthe best advice I can,” and so begins the grave discourse.\r\n\r\nThe man is in too much trouble not to want counsel, so he thanks him, and\r\nhe goes on:—“Send a summons to your creditors, and offer them what you\r\ncan propose in the pound (always reserving a good stock to begin the\r\nworld again), which if they will take, you are a free man, and better\r\nthan you were before; if they won’t take it, you know the worst of it,\r\nyou are on the better side of the hedge with them: if they will not take\r\nit, but will proceed to a statute, you have nothing to do but to oppose\r\nforce with force; for the laws of nature tell you, you must not starve;\r\nand a statute is so barbarous, so unjust, so malicious a way of\r\nproceeding against a man, that I do not think any debtor obliged to\r\nconsider anything but his own preservation, when once they go on with\r\nthat.”  “For why,” says the old studied wretch, “should the creditors\r\nspend your estate in the commission, and then demand the debt of you too?\r\nDo you owe anything to the commission of the statute?”  “No,” says he.\r\n“Why, then,” says he, “I warrant their charges will come to £200 out of\r\nyour estate, and they must have 10s. a day for starving you and your\r\nfamily.  I cannot see why any man should think I am bound in conscience\r\nto pay the extravagance of other men.  If my creditors spend £500 in\r\ngetting in my estate by a statute, which I offered to surrender without\r\nit, I’ll reckon that £500 paid them, let them take it among them, for\r\nequity is due to a bankrupt as well as to any man, and if the laws do not\r\ngive it us, we must take it.”\r\n\r\nThis is too rational discourse not to please him, and he proceeds by this\r\nadvice; the creditors cannot agree, but take out a statute; and the man\r\nthat offered at first it may be 10s. in the pound, is kept in that cursed\r\nplace till he has spent it all and can offer nothing, and then gets away\r\nbeyond sea, or after a long consumption gets off by an act of relief to\r\npoor debtors, and all the charges of the statute fall among the\r\ncreditors.  Thus I knew a statute taken out against a shopkeeper in the\r\ncountry, and a considerable parcel of goods too seized, and yet the\r\ncreditors, what with charges and two or three suits at law, lost their\r\nwhole debts and 8s. per pound contribution money for charges, and the\r\npoor debtor, like a man under the surgeon’s hand, died in the operation.\r\n\r\n2.  Another evil that time and experience has brought to light from this\r\nact is, when the debtor himself shall confederate with some particular\r\ncreditor to take out a statute, and this is a masterpiece of plot and\r\nintrigue.  For perhaps some creditor honestly received in the way of\r\ntrade a large sum of money of the debtor for goods sold him when he was\r\n_sui juris_, and he by consent shall own himself a bankrupt before that\r\ntime, and the statute shall reach back to bring in an honest man’s\r\nestate, to help pay a rogue’s debt.  Or a man shall go and borrow a sum\r\nof money upon a parcel of goods, and lay them to pledge; he keeps the\r\nmoney, and the statute shall fetch away the goods to help forward the\r\ncomposition.  These are tricks I can give too good an account of, having\r\nmore than once suffered by the experiment.  I could give a scheme, of\r\nmore ways, but I think it is needless to prove the necessity of laying\r\naside that law, which is pernicious to both debtor and creditor, and\r\nchiefly hurtful to the honest man whom it was made to preserve.\r\n\r\nThe next inquiry is, whether the extremities of this law are not often\r\ncarried on beyond the true intent and meaning of the act itself, for\r\nmalicious and private ends to gratify passion and revenge?\r\n\r\nI remember the answer a person gave me, who had taken out statutes\r\nagainst several persons, and some his near relations, who had failed in\r\nhis debt; and when I was one time dissuading him from prosecuting a man\r\nwho owed me money as well as him, I used this argument with him:—“You\r\nknow the man has nothing left to pay.”  “That’s true,” says he; “I know\r\nthat well enough.”  “To what purpose, then,” said I, “will you prosecute\r\nhim?”  “Why, revenge is sweet,” said he.  Now a man that will prosecute a\r\ndebtor, not as a debtor, but by way of revenge, such a man is, I think,\r\nnot intentionally within the benefit of our law.\r\n\r\nIn order to state the case right, there are four sorts of people to be\r\nconsidered in this discourse; and the true case is how to distinguish\r\nthem,\r\n\r\n1.  There is the honest debtor, who fails by visible necessity, losses,\r\nsickness, decay of trade, or the like.\r\n\r\n2.  The knavish, designing, or idle, extravagant debtor, who fails\r\nbecause either he has run out his estate in excesses, or on purpose to\r\ncheat and abuse his creditors.\r\n\r\n3.  There is the moderate creditor, who seeks but his own, but will omit\r\nno lawful means to gain it, and yet will hear reasonable and just\r\narguments and proposals.\r\n\r\n4.  There is the rigorous severe creditor, that values not whether the\r\ndebtor be honest man or knave, able or unable, but will have his debt,\r\nwhether it be to be had or no, without mercy, without compassion, full of\r\nill language, passion, and revenge.\r\n\r\nHow to make a law to suit to all these is the case.  That a necessary\r\nfavour might be shown to the first, in pity and compassion to the\r\nunfortunate, in commiseration of casualty and poverty, which no man is\r\nexempt from the danger of.  That a due rigour and restraint be laid upon\r\nthe second, that villainy and knavery might not be encouraged by a law.\r\nThat a due care be taken of the third, that men’s estates may as far as\r\ncan be secured to them.  And due limits set to the last, that no man may\r\nhave an unlimited power over his fellow-subjects, to the ruin of both\r\nlife and estate.\r\n\r\nAll which I humbly conceive might be brought to pass by the following\r\nmethod, to which I give the title of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Court of Inquiries_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis court should consist of a select number of persons, to be chosen\r\nyearly out of the several wards of the City by the Lord Mayor and Court\r\nof Aldermen, and out of the several Inns of Court by the Lord Chancellor,\r\nor Lord Keeper, for the time being, and to consist of,\r\n\r\nA President,                        } To be chosen by the rest, and\r\n                                    named every year also.\r\nA Secretary,\r\n\r\nA Treasurer,\r\nA judge of causes for the proof of debts.\r\nFifty-two citizens, out of every ward two; of which number to be\r\ntwelve merchants.\r\nTwo lawyers (barristers at least) out of each of the Inns of Court.\r\n\r\nThat a Commission of Inquiry into bankrupts’ estates be given to these,\r\nconfirmed and settled by Act of Parliament, with power to hear, try, and\r\ndetermine causes as to proof of debts, and disputes in accounts between\r\ndebtor and creditor, without appeal.\r\n\r\nThe office for this court to be at Guildhall, where clerks should be\r\nalways attending, and a quorum of the commissioners to sit _de die in\r\ndiem_, from three to six o’clock in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nTo this court every man who finds himself pressed by his affairs, so that\r\nhe cannot carry on his business, shall apply himself as follows:—\r\n\r\nHe shall go to the secretary’s office, and give in his name, with this\r\nshort petition:—\r\n\r\n    To the Honourable the President and Commissioners of His Majesty’s\r\n    Court of Inquiries.  The humble petition of A. B., of the Parish of —\r\n    in the —\r\n\r\n    Haberdasher.\r\n\r\n    Showeth\r\n\r\n    That your petitioner being unable to carry on his business, by reason\r\n    of great losses and decay of trade, and being ready and willing to\r\n    make a full and entire discovery of his whole estate, and to deliver\r\n    up the same to your honours upon oath, as the law directs for the\r\n    satisfaction of his creditors, and having to that purpose entered his\r\n    name into the books of your office on the — of this instant.\r\n\r\n    Your petitioner humbly prays the protection of this Honourable Court.\r\n\r\n                                                  And shall ever pray, &c.\r\n\r\nThe secretary is to lay this petition before the commissioners, who shall\r\nsign it of course; and the petitioner shall have an officer sent home\r\nwith him immediately, who shall take possession of his house and goods,\r\nand an exact inventory of everything therein shall be taken at his\r\nentrance by other officers also, appointed by the court; according to\r\nwhich inventory the first officer and the bankrupt also shall be\r\naccountable.\r\n\r\nThis officer shall supersede even the Sheriff in possession, excepting by\r\nan extent for the king; only with this provision:—\r\n\r\nThat if the Sheriff be in possession by warrant on judgment obtained by\r\ndue course of law, and without fraud or deceit, and, _bonâ fide_, in\r\npossession before the debtor entered his name in the office, in such case\r\nthe plaintiff to have a double dividend allotted to his debt; for it was\r\nthe fault of the debtor to let execution come upon his goods before he\r\nsought for protection; but this not to be allowed upon judgment\r\nconfessed.\r\n\r\nIf the Sheriff be in possession by _fieri facias_ for debt immediately\r\ndue to the king, the officer, however, shall quit his possession to the\r\ncommissioners, and they shall see the king’s debt fully satisfied before\r\nany division be made to the creditors.\r\n\r\nThe officers in this case to take no fee from the bankrupt, nor to use\r\nany indecent or uncivil behaviour to the family (which is a most\r\nnotorious abuse now permitted to the sheriff’s officers), whose fees I\r\nhave known, on small executions, on pretence of civility, amount to as\r\nmuch as the debt, and yet behave themselves with unsufferable insolence\r\nall the while.\r\n\r\nThis officer being in possession, the goods may be removed, or not\r\nremoved; the shop shut up or not shut up; as the bankrupt upon his\r\nreasons given to the commissioners may desire.\r\n\r\nThe inventory being taken, the bankrupt shall have fourteen days’ time,\r\nand more if desired, upon showing good reasons to the commissioners, to\r\nsettle his books and draw up his accounts; and then shall deliver up all\r\nhis books, together with a full and true account of his whole estate,\r\nreal and personal, to which account he shall make oath, and afterwards to\r\nany particular of it, if the commissioners require.\r\n\r\nAfter this account given in, the commissioners shall have power to\r\nexamine upon oath all his servants, or any other person; and if it\r\nappears that he has concealed anything, in breach of his oath, to punish\r\nhim, as is hereafter specified.\r\n\r\nUpon a fair and just surrender of all his estate and effects, _bonâ\r\nfide_, according to the true intent and meaning of the act, the\r\ncommissioners shall return to him in money, or such of his goods as he\r\nshall choose, at a value by a just appraisement, £5 per cent. of all the\r\nestate he surrendered, together with a full and free discharge from all\r\nhis creditors.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the estate of the debtor to be fairly and equally\r\ndivided among the creditors, who are to apply themselves to the\r\ncommissioners.  The commissioners to make a necessary inquiry into the\r\nnature and circumstances of the debts demanded, that no pretended debt be\r\nclaimed for the private account of the debtor; in order to which inquiry\r\nthey shall administer the following oath to the creditor, for the proof\r\nof the debt.\r\n\r\n    I, A. B., do solemnly swear and attest that the account hereto\r\n    annexed is true and right, and every article therein rightly and\r\n    truly stated and charged in the names of the persons to whom they\r\n    belong; and that there is no person or name named, concealed, or\r\n    altered in the said account by me, or by my knowledge, order, or\r\n    consent.  And that the said — does really and _bonâ fide_ owe and\r\n    stand indebted to me for my own proper account the full sum of —\r\n    mentioned in the said account, and that for a fair and just value\r\n    made good to him, as by the said account expressed; and also that I\r\n    have not made or known of any private contract, promise, or agreement\r\n    between him the said — (or any body for him) and me, or any person\r\n    whatsoever.\r\n\r\n                                                           So help me God.\r\n\r\nUpon this oath, and no circumstances to render the person suspected, the\r\ncreditor shall have an unquestioned right to his dividend, which shall be\r\nmade without the delays and charges that attend the commissions of\r\nbankrupts.  For,\r\n\r\n1.  The goods of the debtor shall upon the first meeting of the creditors\r\nbe either sold in parcels, as they shall agree, or divided among them in\r\ndue proportion to their debts.\r\n\r\n2.  What debts are standing out, the debtors shall receive summonses from\r\nthe commissioners, to pay by a certain time limited; and in the meantime\r\nthe secretary is to transmit accounts to the persons owing it, appointing\r\nthem a reasonable time to consent or disprove the account.\r\n\r\nAnd every six months a just dividend shall be made among the creditors of\r\nthe money received; and so, if the effects lie abroad, authentic\r\nprocurations shall be signed by the bankrupt to the commissioners, who\r\nthereupon correspond with the persons abroad, in whose hands such effects\r\nare, who are to remit the same as the commissioners order; the dividend\r\nto be made, as before, every six months, or oftener, if the court see\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nIf any man thinks the bankrupt has so much favour by these articles, that\r\nthose who can dispense with an oath have an opportunity to cheat their\r\ncreditors, and that hereby too much encouragement is given to men to turn\r\nbankrupt; let them consider the easiness of the discovery, the difficulty\r\nof a concealment, and the penalty on the offender.\r\n\r\n1.  I would have a reward of 30 per cent. be provided to be paid to any\r\nperson who should make discovery of any part of the bankrupt’s estate\r\nconcealed by him, which would make discoveries easy and frequent.\r\n\r\n2.  Any person who should claim any debt among the creditors, for the\r\naccount of the bankrupt, or his wife or children, or with design to\r\nrelieve them out of it, other or more than is, _bonâ fide_, due to him\r\nfor value received, and to be made out; or any person who shall receive\r\nin trust, or by deed of gift, any part of the goods or other estate of\r\nthe bankrupt, with design to preserve them for the use of the said\r\nbankrupt, or his wife or children, or with design to conceal them from\r\nthe creditors, shall forfeit for every such act £500, and have his name\r\npublished as a cheat, and a person not fit to be credited by any man.\r\nThis would make it very difficult for the bankrupt to conceal anything.\r\n\r\n3.  The bankrupt having given his name, and put the officer into\r\npossession, shall not remove out of the house any of his books; but\r\nduring the fourteen days’ time which he shall have to settle the accounts\r\nshall every night deliver the books into the hands of the officer; and\r\nthe commissioners shall have liberty, if they please, to take the books\r\nthe first day, and cause duplicates to be made, and then to give them\r\nback to the bankrupt to settle the accounts.\r\n\r\n4.  If it shall appear that the bankrupt has given in a false account,\r\nhas concealed any part of his goods or debts, in breach of his oath, he\r\nshall be set in the pillory at his own door, and be imprisoned during\r\nlife without bail.\r\n\r\n5.  To prevent the bankrupt concealing any debts abroad, it should be\r\nenacted that the name of the bankrupt being entered at the office, where\r\nevery man might search gratis, should be publication enough; and that\r\nafter such entry, no discharge from the bankrupt should be allowed in\r\naccount to any man, but whoever would adventure to pay any money to the\r\nsaid bankrupt or his order should be still debtor to the estate, and pay\r\nit again to the commissioners.\r\n\r\nAnd whereas wiser heads than mine must be employed to compose this law,\r\nif ever it be made, they will have time to consider of more ways to\r\nsecure the estate for the creditors, and, if possible, to tie the hands\r\nof the bankrupt yet faster.\r\n\r\nThis law, if ever such a happiness should arise to this kingdom, would be\r\na present remedy for a multitude of evils which now we feel, and which\r\nare a sensible detriment to the trade of this nation.\r\n\r\n1.  With submission, I question not but it would prevent a great number\r\nof bankrupts, which now fall by divers causes.  For,\r\n\r\n  (1.)  It would effectually remove all crafty designed breakings, by\r\n  which many honest men are ruined.  And\r\n\r\n  (2.)  Of course ’twould prevent the fall of those tradesmen who are\r\n  forced to break by the knavery of such.\r\n\r\n2.  It would effectually suppress all those sanctuaries and refuges of\r\nthieves, the Mint, Friars, Savoy, Rules, and the like; and that these two\r\nways:—\r\n\r\n  (1.)  Honest men would have no need of it, here being a more safe,\r\n  easy, and more honourable way to get out of trouble.\r\n\r\n  (2.)  Knaves should have no protection from those places, and the Act\r\n  be fortified against those places by the following clauses, which I\r\n  have on purpose reserved to this head.\r\n\r\nSince the provision this court of inquiries makes for the ease and\r\ndeliverance of every debtor who is honest is so considerable, ’tis most\r\ncertain that no man but he who has a design to cheat his creditors will\r\nrefuse to accept of the favour; and therefore it should be enacted,\r\n\r\nThat if any man who is a tradesman or merchant shall break or fail, or\r\nshut up shop, or leave off trade, and shall not either pay or secure to\r\nhis creditors their full and whole debts, twenty shillings in the pound,\r\nwithout abatement or deduction; or shall convey away their books or\r\ngoods, in order to bring their creditors to any composition; or shall not\r\napply to this office as aforesaid, shall be guilty of felony, and upon\r\nconviction of the same shall suffer as a felon, without benefit of\r\nclergy.\r\n\r\nAnd if any such person shall take sanctuary either in the Mint, Friars,\r\nor other pretended privilege place, or shall convey thither any of their\r\ngoods as aforesaid, to secure them from their creditors, upon complaint\r\nthereof made to any of His Majesty’s Justices of the Peace, they shall\r\nimmediately grant warrants to the constable, &c., to search for the said\r\npersons and goods, who shall be aided and assisted by the trained bands,\r\nif need be, without any charge to the creditors, to search for, and\r\ndiscover the said persons and goods; and whoever were aiding in the\r\ncarrying in the said goods, or whoever knowingly received either the\r\ngoods or the person, should be also guilty of felony.\r\n\r\nFor as the indigent debtor is a branch of the commonwealth which deserves\r\nits care, so the wilful bankrupt is one of the worst sort of thieves.\r\nAnd it seems a little unequal that a poor fellow who for mere want steals\r\nfrom his neighbour some trifle shall be sent out of the kingdom, and\r\nsometimes out of the world, while a sort of people who defy justice, and\r\nviolently resist the law, shall be suffered to carry men’s estates away\r\nbefore their faces, and no officers to be found who dare execute the law\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\nAny man would be concerned to hear with what scandal and reproach\r\nforeigners do speak of the impotence of our constitution in this point;\r\nthat in a civilised Government, as ours is, the strangest contempt of\r\nauthority is shown that can be instanced in the world.\r\n\r\nI may be a little the warmer on this head, on account that I have been a\r\nlarger sufferer by such means than ordinary.  But I appeal to all the\r\nworld as to the equity of the case.  What the difference is between\r\nhaving my house broken up in the night to be robbed, and a man coming in\r\ngood credit, and with a proffer of ready money in the middle of the day,\r\nand buying £500 of goods, and carrying them directly from my warehouse\r\ninto the Mint, and the next day laugh at me, and bid me defiance; yet\r\nthis I have seen done.  I think ’tis the justest thing in the world that\r\nthe last should be esteemed the greater thief, and deserves most to be\r\nhanged.\r\n\r\nI have seen a creditor come with his wife and children, and beg of the\r\ndebtor only to let him have part of his own goods again, which he had\r\nbought, knowing and designing to break.  I have seen him with tears and\r\nentreaties petition for his own, or but some of it, and be taunted and\r\nsworn at, and denied by a saucy insolent bankrupt.  That the poor man has\r\nbeen wholly ruined by the cheat.  It is by the villainy of such many an\r\nhonest man is undone, families starved and sent a begging, and yet no\r\npunishment prescribed by our laws for it.\r\n\r\nBy the aforesaid commission of inquiry all this might be most effectually\r\nprevented, an honest, indigent tradesman preserved, knavery detected and\r\npunished; Mints, Friars, and privilege-places suppressed, and without\r\ndoubt a great number of insolencies avoided and prevented; of which many\r\nmore particulars might be insisted upon, but I think these may be\r\nsufficient to lead anybody into the thought; and for the method, I leave\r\nit to the wise heads of the nation, who know better than I how to state\r\nthe law to the circumstances of the crime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF ACADEMIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have in England fewer of these than in any part of the world, at least\r\nwhere learning is in so much esteem.  But to make amends, the two great\r\nseminaries we have are, without comparison, the greatest, I won’t say the\r\nbest, in the world; and though much might be said here concerning\r\nuniversities in general, and foreign academies in particular, I content\r\nmyself with noting that part in which we seem defective.  The French, who\r\njustly value themselves upon erecting the most celebrated academy of\r\nEurope, owe the lustre of it very much to the great encouragement the\r\nkings of France have given to it.  And one of the members making a speech\r\nat his entrance tells you that it is not the least of the glories of\r\ntheir invincible monarch to have engrossed all the learning of the world\r\nin that sublime body.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar study of the academy of Paris has been to refine and correct\r\ntheir own language, which they have done to that happy degree that we see\r\nit now spoken in all the courts of Christendom, as the language allowed\r\nto be most universal.\r\n\r\nI had the honour once to be a member of a small society, who seemed to\r\noffer at this noble design in England.  But the greatness of the work,\r\nand the modesty of the gentlemen concerned, prevailed with them to desist\r\nan enterprise which appeared too great for private hands to undertake.\r\nWe want, indeed, a Richelieu to commence such a work.  For I am persuaded\r\nwere there such a genius in our kingdom to lead the way, there would not\r\nwant capacities who could carry on the work to a glory equal to all that\r\nhas gone before them.  The English tongue is a subject not at all less\r\nworthy the labour of such a society than the French, and capable of a\r\nmuch greater perfection.  The learned among the French will own that the\r\ncomprehensiveness of expression is a glory in which the English tongue\r\nnot only equals but excels its neighbours; Rapin, St. Evremont, and the\r\nmost eminent French authors have acknowledged it.  And my lord Roscommon,\r\nwho is allowed to be a good judge of English, because he wrote it as\r\nexactly as any ever did, expresses what I mean in these lines:—\r\n\r\n   “For who did ever in French authors see\r\n   The comprehensive English energy?\r\n   The weighty bullion of one sterling line,\r\n   Drawn to French wire would through whole pages shine.”\r\n\r\n“And if our neighbours will yield us, as their greatest critic has done,\r\nthe preference for sublimity and nobleness of style, we will willingly\r\nquit all pretensions to their insignificant gaiety.”\r\n\r\nIt is great pity that a subject so noble should not have some as noble to\r\nattempt it.  And for a method, what greater can be set before us than the\r\nacademy of Paris?  Which, to give the French their due, stands foremost\r\namong all the great attempts in the learned part of the world.\r\n\r\nThe present King of England, of whom we have seen the whole world writing\r\npanegyrics and encomiums, and whom his enemies, when their interest does\r\nnot silence them, are apt to say more of than ourselves; as in the war he\r\nhas given surprising instances of a greatness of spirit more than common:\r\nso in peace, I daresay, with submission, he shall never have an\r\nopportunity to illustrate his memory more than by such a foundation.  By\r\nwhich he shall have opportunity to darken the glory of the French king in\r\npeace, as he has by his daring attempts in the war.\r\n\r\nNothing but pride loves to be flattered, and that only as it is a vice\r\nwhich blinds us to our own imperfections.  I think princes as\r\nparticularly unhappy in having their good actions magnified as their evil\r\nactions covered.  But King William, who has already won praise by the\r\nsteps of dangerous virtue, seems reserved for some actions which are\r\nabove the touch of flattery, whose praise is in themselves.\r\n\r\nAnd such would this be.  And because I am speaking of a work which seems\r\nto be proper only for the hand of the king himself, I shall not presume\r\nto carry on this chapter to the model, as I have done in other subjects.\r\nOnly thus far:\r\n\r\nThat a society be erected by the king himself, if his Majesty thought\r\nfit, and composed of none but persons of the first figure in learning;\r\nand it were to be wished our gentry were so much lovers of learning that\r\nbirth might always be joined with capacity.\r\n\r\nThe work of this society should be to encourage polite learning, to\r\npolish and refine the English tongue, and advance the so much neglected\r\nfaculty of correct language, to establish purity and propriety of style,\r\nand to purge it from all the irregular additions that ignorance and\r\naffectation have introduced; and all those innovations in speech, if I\r\nmay call them such, which some dogmatic writers have the confidence to\r\nfoster upon their native language, as if their authority were sufficient\r\nto make their own fancy legitimate.\r\n\r\nBy such a society I daresay the true glory of our English style would\r\nappear; and among all the learned part of the world be esteemed, as it\r\nreally is, the noblest and most comprehensive of all the vulgar languages\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nInto this society should be admitted none but persons eminent for\r\nlearning, and yet none, or but very few, whose business or trade was\r\nlearning.  For I may be allowed, I suppose, to say we have seen many\r\ngreat scholars mere learned men, and graduates in the last degree of\r\nstudy, whose English has been far from polite, full of stiffness and\r\naffectation, hard words, and long unusual coupling of syllables and\r\nsentences, which sound harsh and untuneable to the ear, and shock the\r\nreader both in expression and understanding.\r\n\r\nIn short, there should be room in this society for neither clergyman,\r\nphysician, nor lawyer.  Not that I would put an affront upon the learning\r\nof any of those honourable employments, much less upon their persons.\r\nBut if I do think that their several professions do naturally and\r\nseverally prescribe habits of speech to them peculiar to their practice,\r\nand prejudicial to the study I speak of, I believe I do them no wrong.\r\nNor do I deny but there may be, and now are, among some of all those\r\nprofessions men of style and language, great masters of English, whom few\r\nmen will undertake to correct; and where such do at any time appear,\r\ntheir extraordinary merit should find them a place in this society; but\r\nit should be rare, and upon very extraordinary occasions that such be\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\nI would therefore have this society wholly composed of gentlemen; whereof\r\ntwelve to be of the nobility, if possible, and twelve private gentlemen,\r\nand a class of twelve to be left open for mere merit, let it be found in\r\nwho or what sort it would, which should lie as the crown of their study,\r\nwho have done something eminent to deserve it.  The voice of this society\r\nshould be sufficient authority for the usage of words, and sufficient\r\nalso to expose the innovations of other men’s fancies; they should\r\npreside with a sort of judicature over the learning of the age, and have\r\nliberty to correct and censure the exorbitance of writers, especially of\r\ntranslators.  The reputation of this society would be enough to make them\r\nthe allowed judges of style and language, and no author would have the\r\nimpudence to coin without their authority.  Custom, which is now our best\r\nauthority for words, would always have its original here, and not be\r\nallowed without it.  There should be no more occasion to search for\r\nderivations and constructions, and ’twould be as criminal then to coin\r\nwords as money.\r\n\r\nThe exercises of this society would be lectures on the English tongue,\r\nessays on the nature, original, usage, authorities, and differences of\r\nwords, or the propriety, parity, and cadence of style, and of the\r\npoliteness and manner in writing; reflections upon irregular usages, and\r\ncorrections of erroneous customs in words; and, in short, everything that\r\nwould appear necessary to the bringing our English tongue to a due\r\nperfection, and our gentlemen to a capacity of writing like themselves;\r\nto banish pride and pedantry, and silence the impudence and impertinence\r\nof young authors, whose ambition is to be known, though it be by their\r\nfolly.\r\n\r\nI ask leave here for a thought or two about that inundation custom has\r\nmade upon our language and discourse by familiar swearing; and I place it\r\nhere, because custom has so far prevailed in this foolish vice that a\r\nman’s discourse is hardly agreeable without it; and some have taken upon\r\nthem to say it is pity it should not be lawful, it is such a grace in a\r\nman’s speech, and adds so much vigour to his language.\r\n\r\nI desire to be understood right, and that by swearing I mean all those\r\ncursory oaths, curses, execrations, imprecations, asseverations, and by\r\nwhatsoever other names they are distinguished, which are used in\r\nvehemence of discourse, in the mouths almost of all men more or less, of\r\nwhat sort soever.\r\n\r\nI am not about to argue anything of their being sinful and unlawful, as\r\nforbid by divine rules; let the parson alone to tell you that, who has,\r\nno question, said as much to as little purpose in this case as in any\r\nother.  But I am of the opinion that there is nothing so impertinent, so\r\ninsignificant, so senseless, and foolish as our vulgar way of discourse\r\nwhen mixed with oaths and curses, and I would only recommend a little\r\nconsideration to our gentlemen, who have sense and wit enough, and would\r\nbe ashamed to speak nonsense in other things, but value themselves upon\r\ntheir parts, I would but ask them to put into writing the commonplaces of\r\ntheir discourse, and read them over again, and examine the English, the\r\ncadence, the grammar of them; then let then turn them into Latin, or\r\ntranslate them into any other language, and but see what a jargon and\r\nconfusion of speech they make together.\r\n\r\nSwearing, that lewdness of the tongue, that scum and excrement of the\r\nmouth, is of all vices the most foolish and senseless.  It makes a man’s\r\nconversation unpleasant, his discourse fruitless, and his language\r\nnonsense.\r\n\r\nIt makes conversation unpleasant, at least to those who do not use the\r\nsame foolish way of discourse, and, indeed, is an affront to all the\r\ncompany who swear not as he does; for if I swear and curse in company I\r\neither presume all the company likes it or affront them who do not.\r\n\r\nThen it is fruitless; for no man is believed a jot the more for all the\r\nasseverations, damnings, and swearings he makes.  Those who are used to\r\nit themselves do not believe a man the more because they know they are so\r\ncustomary that they signify little to bind a man’s intention, and they\r\nwho practise them not have so mean an opinion of those that do as makes\r\nthem think they deserve no belief.\r\n\r\nThen, they are the spoilers and destroyers of a man’s discourse, and turn\r\nit into perfect nonsense; and to make it out I must descend a little to\r\nparticulars, and desire the reader a little to foul his mouth with the\r\nbrutish, sordid, senseless expressions which some gentlemen call polite\r\nEnglish, and speaking with a grace.\r\n\r\nSome part of them indeed, though they are foolish enough, as effects of a\r\nmad, inconsiderate rage, are yet English; as when a man swears he will do\r\nthis or, that, and it may be adds, “God damn him he will;” that is, “God\r\ndamn him if he don’t.”  This, though it be horrid in another sense, yet\r\nmay be read in writing, and is English: but what language is this?\r\n\r\n“Jack, God damn me, Jack, how dost do?  How hast thou done this long\r\ntime, by God?”  And then they kiss; and the other, as lewd as himself,\r\ngoes on:—\r\n\r\n“Dear Tom, I am glad to see thee with all my heart, let me die.  Come,\r\nlet us go take a bottle, we must not part so; pr’ythee let’s go and be\r\ndrunk by God.”\r\n\r\nThis is some of our new florid language, and the graces and delicacies of\r\nstyle, which if it were put into Latin, I would fain know which is the\r\nprincipal verb.\r\n\r\nBut for a little further remembrance of this impertinence, go among the\r\ngamesters, and there nothing is more frequent than, “God damn the dice,”\r\nor “God damn the bowls.”\r\n\r\nAmong the sportsmen it is, “God damn the hounds,” when they are at a\r\nfault; or, “God damn the horse,” if he baulks a leap.  They call men\r\n“sons of —,” and “dogs,” and innumerable instances may be given of the\r\nlike gallantry of language, grown now so much a custom.\r\n\r\nIt is true, custom is allowed to be our best authority for words, and it\r\nis fit it should be so; but reason must be the judge of sense in\r\nlanguage, and custom can never prevail over it.  Words, indeed, like\r\nceremonies in religion, may be submitted to the magistrate; but sense,\r\nlike the essentials, is positive, unalterable, and cannot be submitted to\r\nany jurisdiction; it is a law to itself; it is ever the same; even an Act\r\nof Parliament cannot alter it.\r\n\r\nWords, and even usages in style, may be altered by custom, and\r\nproprieties in speech differ according to the several dialects of the\r\ncountry, and according to the different manner in which several languages\r\ndo severally express themselves.\r\n\r\nBut there is a direct signification of words, or a cadence in expression,\r\nwhich we call speaking sense; this, like truth, is sullen and the same,\r\never was and will be so, in what manner, and in what language soever it\r\nis expressed.  Words without it are only noise, which any brute can make\r\nas well as we, and birds much better; for words without sense make but\r\ndull music.  Thus a man may speak in words, but perfectly unintelligible\r\nas to meaning; he may talk a great deal, but say nothing.  But it is the\r\nproper position of words, adapted to their significations, which makes\r\nthem intelligible, and conveys the meaning of the speaker to the\r\nunderstanding of the hearer; the contrary to which we call nonsense; and\r\nthere is a superfluous crowding in of insignificant words, more than are\r\nneedful to express the thing intended, and this is impertinence; and that\r\nagain, carried to an extreme, is ridiculous.\r\n\r\nThus when our discourse is interlined with needless oaths, curses, and\r\nlong parentheses of imprecations, and with some of very indirect\r\nsignification, they become very impertinent; and these being run to the\r\nextravagant degree instanced in before, become perfectly ridiculous and\r\nnonsense, and without forming it into an argument, it appears to be\r\nnonsense by the contradictoriness; and it appears impertinent by the\r\ninsignificancy of the expression.\r\n\r\nAfter all, how little it becomes a gentleman to debauch his mouth with\r\nfoul language, I refer to themselves in a few particulars.\r\n\r\nThis vicious custom has prevailed upon good manners too far; but yet\r\nthere are some degrees to which it has not yet arrived.\r\n\r\nAs, first, the worst slaves to this folly will neither teach it to nor\r\napprove of it in their children.  Some of the most careless will indeed\r\nnegatively teach it by not reproving them for it; but sure no man ever\r\nordered his children to be taught to curse or swear.\r\n\r\n2.  The grace of swearing has not obtained to be a mode yet among the\r\nwomen: “God damn ye” does not fit well upon a female tongue; it seems to\r\nbe a masculine vice, which the women are not arrived to yet; and I would\r\nonly desire those gentlemen who practice it themselves to hear a woman\r\nswear: it has no music at all there, I am sure; and just as little does\r\nit become any gentleman, if he would suffer himself to be judged by all\r\nthe laws of sense or good manners in the world.\r\n\r\nIt is a senseless, foolish, ridiculous practice; it is a mean to no\r\nmanner of end; it is words spoken which signify nothing; it is folly\r\nacted for the sake of folly, which is a thing even the devil himself\r\ndon’t practice.  The devil does evil, we say, but it is for some design,\r\neither to seduce others, or, as some divines say, from a principle of\r\nenmity to his Maker.  Men steal for gain, and murder to gratify their\r\navarice or revenge; whoredoms and ravishments, adulteries and sodomy, are\r\ncommitted to please a vicious appetite, and have always alluring objects;\r\nand generally all vices have some previous cause, and some visible\r\ntendency.  But this, of all vicious practices, seems the most nonsensical\r\nand ridiculous; there is neither pleasure nor profit, no design pursued,\r\nno lust gratified, but is a mere frenzy of the tongue, a vomit of the\r\nbrain, which works by putting a contrary upon the course of nature.\r\n\r\nAgain, other vices men find some reason or other to give for, or excuses\r\nto palliate.  Men plead want to extenuate theft, and strong provocations\r\nto excuse murders, and many a lame excuse they will bring for whoring;\r\nbut this sordid habit even those that practise it will own to be a crime,\r\nand make no excuse for it; and the most I could ever hear a man say for\r\nit was that he could not help it.\r\n\r\nBesides, as it is an inexcusable impertinence, so it is a breach upon\r\ngood manners and conversation, for a man to impose the clamour of his\r\noaths upon the company he converses with; if there be any one person in\r\nthe company that does not approve the way, it is an imposing upon him\r\nwith a freedom beyond civility.\r\n\r\nTo suppress this, laws, Acts of Parliament, and proclamations are baubles\r\nand banters, the laughter of the lewd party, and never had, as I could\r\nperceive, any influence upon the practice; nor are any of our magistrates\r\nfond or forward of putting them in execution.\r\n\r\nIt must be example, not penalties, must sink this crime; and if the\r\ngentlemen of England would once drop it as a mode, the vice is so foolish\r\nand ridiculous in itself, it would soon grow odious and out of fashion.\r\n\r\nThis work such an academy might begin, and I believe nothing would so\r\nsoon explode the practice as the public discouragement of it by such a\r\nsociety; where all our customs and habits, both in speech and behaviour,\r\nshould receive an authority.  All the disputes about precedency of wit,\r\nwith the manners, customs, and usages of the theatre, would be decided\r\nhere; plays should pass here before they were acted, and the critics\r\nmight give their censures and damn at their pleasure; nothing would ever\r\ndie which once received life at this original.  The two theatres might\r\nend their jangle, and dispute for priority no more; wit and real worth\r\nshould decide the controversy, and here should be the infallible judge.\r\n\r\n   The strife would then be only to do well,\r\n   And he alone be crowned who did excel.\r\n   Ye call them Whigs, who from the church withdrew,\r\n   But now we have our stage dissenters too,\r\n   Who scruple ceremonies of pit and box,\r\n   And very few are sound and orthodox,\r\n   But love disorder so, and are so nice,\r\n   They hate conformity, though ’tis in vice.\r\n   Some are for patent hierarchy; and some,\r\n   Like the old Gauls, seek out for elbow room;\r\n   Their arbitrary governors disown,\r\n   And build a conventicle stage of their own.\r\n   Fanatic beaux make up the gaudy show,\r\n   And wit alone appears incognito.\r\n   Wit and religion suffer equal fate;\r\n   Neglect of both attends the warm debate.\r\n   For while the parties strive and countermine,\r\n   Wit will as well as piety decline.\r\n\r\nNext to this, which I esteem as the most noble and most useful proposal\r\nin this book, I proceed to academies for military studies, and because I\r\ndesign rather to express my meaning than make a large book, I bring them\r\nall into one chapter.\r\n\r\nI allow the war is the best academy in the world, where men study by\r\nnecessity and practice by force, and both to some purpose, with duty in\r\nthe action, and a reward in the end; and it is evident to any man who\r\nknows the world, or has made any observations on things, what an\r\nimprovement the English nation has made during this seven years’ war.\r\n\r\nBut should you ask how clear it first cost, and what a condition England\r\nwas in for a war at first on this account—how almost all our engineers\r\nand great officers were foreigners, it may put us in mind how necessary\r\nit is to have our people so practised in the arts of war that they may\r\nnot be novices when they come to the experiment.\r\n\r\nI have heard some who were no great friends to the Government take\r\nadvantage to reflect upon the king, in the beginning of his wars in\r\nIreland, that he did not care to trust the English, but all his great\r\nofficers, his generals, and engineers were foreigners.  And though the\r\ncase was so plain as to need no answer, and the persons such as deserved\r\nnone, yet this must be observed, though it was very strange: that when\r\nthe present king took possession of this kingdom, and, seeing himself\r\nentering upon the bloodiest war this age has known, began to regulate his\r\narmy, he found but very few among the whole martial part of the nation\r\nfit to make use of for general officers, and was forced to employ\r\nstrangers, and make them Englishmen (as the Counts Schomberg, Ginkel,\r\nSolms, Ruvigny, and others); and yet it is to be observed also that all\r\nthe encouragement imaginable was given to the English gentlemen to\r\nqualify themselves, by giving no less than sixteen regiments to gentlemen\r\nof good families who had never been in any service and knew but very\r\nlittle how to command them.  Of these, several are now in the army, and\r\nhave the rewards suitable to their merit, being major-generals,\r\nbrigadiers, and the like.\r\n\r\nIf, then, a long peace had so reduced us to a degree of ignorance that\r\nmight have been dangerous to us, had we not a king who is always followed\r\nby the greatest masters in the world, who knows what peace and different\r\ngovernors may bring us to again?\r\n\r\nThe manner of making war differs perhaps as much as anything in the\r\nworld; and if we look no further back than our civil wars, it is plain a\r\ngeneral then would hardly be fit to be a colonel now, saving his capacity\r\nof improvement.  The defensive art always follows the offensive; and\r\nthough the latter has extremely got the start of the former in this age,\r\nyet the other is mightily improving also.\r\n\r\nWe saw in England a bloody civil war, where, according to the old temper\r\nof the English, fighting was the business.  To have an army lying in such\r\na post as not to be able to come at them was a thing never heard of in\r\nthat war; even the weakest party would always come out and fight (Dunbar\r\nfight, for instance); and they that were beaten to-day would fight again\r\nto-morrow, and seek one another out with such eagerness, as if they had\r\nbeen in haste to have their brains knocked out.  Encampments,\r\nintrenchments, batteries, counter-marchings, fortifying of camps, and\r\ncannonadings were strange and almost unknown things; and whole campaigns\r\nwere passed over, and hardly any tents made use of.  Battles, surprises,\r\nstorming of towns, skirmishes, sieges, ambuscades, and beating up\r\nquarters was the news of every day.  Now it is frequent to have armies of\r\nfifty thousand men of a side stand at bay within view of one another, and\r\nspend a whole campaign in dodging (or, as it is genteelly called,\r\nobserving) one another, and then march off into winter quarters.  The\r\ndifference is in the maxims of war, which now differ as much from what\r\nthey were formerly as long perukes do from piqued beards, or as the\r\nhabits of the people do now from what they then were.  The present maxims\r\nof the war are:\r\n\r\n    “Never fight without a manifest advantage.”\r\n\r\n    “And always encamp so as not to be forced to it.”\r\n\r\nAnd if two opposite generals nicely observe both these rules, it is\r\nimpossible they should ever come to fight.\r\n\r\nI grant that this way of making war spends generally more money and less\r\nblood than former wars did; but then it spins wars out to a greater\r\nlength; and I almost question whether, if this had been the way of\r\nfighting of old, our civil war had not lasted till this day.  Their maxim\r\nwas:\r\n\r\n    “Wherever you meet your enemy, fight him.”\r\n\r\nBut the case is quite different now; and I think it is plain in the\r\npresent war that it is not he who has the longest sword, so much as he\r\nwho has the longest purse, will hold the war out best.  Europe is all\r\nengaged in the war, and the men will never be exhausted while either\r\nparty can find money; but he who finds himself poorest must give out\r\nfirst; and this is evident in the French king, who now inclines to peace,\r\nand owns it, while at the same time his armies are numerous and whole.\r\nBut the sinews fail; he finds his exchequer fail, his kingdom drained,\r\nand money hard to come at: not that I believe half the reports we have\r\nhad of the misery and poverty of the French are true; but it is manifest\r\nthe King of France finds, whatever his armies may do, his money won’t\r\nhold out so long as the Confederates, and therefore he uses all the means\r\npossible to procure a peace, while he may do it with the most advantage.\r\n\r\nThere is no question but the French may hold the war out several years\r\nlonger; but their king is too wise to let things run to extremity.  He\r\nwill rather condescend to peace upon hard terms now than stay longer, if\r\nhe finds himself in danger to be forced to worse.\r\n\r\nThis being the only digression I design to be guilty of, I hope I shall\r\nbe excused it.\r\n\r\nThe sum of all is this: that, since it is so necessary to be in a\r\ncondition for war in a time of peace, our people should be inured to it.\r\nIt is strange that everything should be ready but the soldier: ships are\r\nready, and our trade keeps the seamen always taught, and breeds up more;\r\nbut soldiers, horsemen, engineers, gunners, and the like must be bred and\r\ntaught; men are not born with muskets on their shoulders, nor\r\nfortifications in their heads; it is not natural to shoot bombs and\r\nundermine towns: for which purpose I propose a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Royal Academy for Military Exercises_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe founder the king himself; the charge to be paid by the public, and\r\nsettled by a revenue from the Crown, to be paid yearly.\r\n\r\nI propose this to consist of four parts:\r\n\r\n1.  A college for breeding up of artists in the useful practice of all\r\nmilitary exercises; the scholars to be taken in young, and be maintained,\r\nand afterwards under the king’s care for preferment, as their merit and\r\nHis Majesty’s favour shall recommend them; from whence His Majesty would\r\nat all times be furnished with able engineers, gunners, fire-masters.\r\nbombardiers, miners, and the like.\r\n\r\nThe second college for voluntary students in the same exercises; who\r\nshould all upon certain limited conditions be entertained, and have all\r\nthe advantages of the lectures, experiments, and learning of the college,\r\nand be also capable of several titles, profits, and settlements in the\r\nsaid college, answerable to the Fellows in the Universities.\r\n\r\nThe third college for temporary study, into which any person who is a\r\ngentleman and an Englishman, entering his name and conforming to the\r\norders of the house, shall be entertained like a gentleman for one whole\r\nyear gratis, and taught by masters appointed out of the second college.\r\n\r\nThe fourth college, of schools only, where all persons whatsoever for a\r\nsmall allowance shall be taught and entered in all the particular\r\nexercises they desire; and this to be supplied by the proficients of the\r\nfirst college.\r\n\r\nI could lay out the dimensions and necessary incidents of all this work,\r\nbut since the method of such a foundation is easy and regular from the\r\nmodel of other colleges, I shall only state the economy of the house.\r\n\r\nThe building must be very large, and should rather be stately and\r\nmagnificent in figure than gay and costly in ornament: and I think such a\r\nhouse as Chelsea College, only about four times as big, would answer it;\r\nand yet, I believe, might be finished for as little charge as has been\r\nlaid out in that palace-like hospital.\r\n\r\nThe first college should consist of one general, five colonels, twenty\r\ncaptains.\r\n\r\nBeing such as graduates by preferment, at first named by the founder; and\r\nafter the first settlement to be chosen out of the first or second\r\ncolleges; with apartments in the college, and salaries.\r\n\r\n                    £ per ann.\r\nThe general                  300\r\nThe colonels                 100\r\nThe captains                  60\r\n\r\n2,000 scholars, among whom shall be the following degrees:\r\n\r\n                            allowed £ per ann.\r\nGovernors              100                      10\r\nDirectors              200                       5\r\nExempts                200                       5\r\nProficients            500\r\nJuniors              1,000\r\n\r\nThe general to be named by the founder, out of the colonels; the colonels\r\nto be named by the general, out of the captains; the captains out of the\r\ngovernors; the governors from the directors; and the directors from the\r\nexempts; and so on.\r\n\r\nThe juniors to be divided into ten schools; the schools to be thus\r\ngoverned: every school has\r\n\r\n100 juniors, in 10 classes.\r\nEvery class to have 2 directors.\r\n100 classes of juniors is               1,000\r\nEach class 2 directors                    200\r\n                                        1,200\r\n\r\nThe proficients to be divided into five schools:\r\n\r\nEvery school to have ten classes of 10 each.\r\nEvery class 2 governors.\r\n50 classes of proficients is                   500\r\nEach class 2 governors is                      100\r\n                                               600\r\n\r\nThe exempts to be supernumerary, having a small allowance, and maintained\r\nin the college till preferment offer.\r\n\r\nThe second college to consist of voluntary students, to be taken in,\r\nafter a certain degree of learning, from among the proficients of the\r\nfirst, or from any other schools, after such and such limitations of\r\nlearning; who study at their own charge, being allowed certain\r\nprivileges; as—\r\n\r\nChambers rent-free on condition of residence.\r\n\r\nCommons gratis, for certain fixed terms.\r\n\r\nPreferment, on condition of a term of years’ residence.\r\n\r\nUse of libraries, instruments, and lectures of the college.\r\n\r\nThis college should have the following preferments, with salaries\r\n\r\n                                               £ per ann.\r\nA governor                                              200\r\nA president                                             100\r\n50 college-majors                                        50\r\n200 proficients                                          10\r\n500 voluntary students, without allowance.\r\n\r\nThe third and fourth colleges, consisting only of schools for temporary\r\nstudy, may be thus:\r\n\r\nThe third—being for gentlemen to learn the necessary arts and exercises\r\nto qualify them for the service of their country, and entertaining them\r\none whole year at the public charge—may be supposed to have always one\r\nthousand persons on its hands, and cannot have less than 100 teachers,\r\nwhom I would thus order:\r\n\r\nEvery teacher shall continue at least one year, but by allowance two\r\nyears at most; shall have £20 per annum extraordinary allowance; shall be\r\nbound to give their constant attendance; and shall have always five\r\ncollege-majors of the second college to supervise them, who shall command\r\na month, and then be succeeded by five others, and, so on—£10 per annum\r\nextraordinary to be paid them for their attendance.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen who practise to be put to no manner of charge, but to be\r\nobliged strictly to the following articles:\r\n\r\n1.  To constant residence, not to lie out of the house without leave of\r\nthe college-major.\r\n\r\n2.  To perform all the college exercises, as appointed by the masters,\r\nwithout dispute.\r\n\r\n3.  To submit to the orders of the house.\r\n\r\nTo quarrel or give ill-language should be a crime to be punished by way\r\nof fine only, the college-major to be judge, and the offender be put into\r\ncustody till he ask pardon of the person wronged; by which means every\r\ngentleman who has been affronted has sufficient satisfaction.\r\n\r\nBut to strike challenge, draw, or fight, should be more severely\r\npunished; the offender to be declared no gentleman, his name posted up at\r\nthe college-gate, his person expelled the house, and to be pumped as a\r\nrake if ever he is taken within the college-walls.\r\n\r\nThe teachers of this college to be chosen, one half out of the exempts of\r\nthe first college, and the other out of the proficients of the second.\r\n\r\nThe fourth college, being only of schools, will be neither chargeable nor\r\ntroublesome, but may consist of as many as shall offer themselves to be\r\ntaught, and supplied with teachers from the other schools.\r\n\r\nThe proposal, being of so large an extent, must have a proportionable\r\nsettlement for its maintenance; and the benefit being to the whole\r\nkingdom, the charge will naturally lie upon the public, and cannot well\r\nbe less, considering the number of persons to be maintained, than as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\n                            FIRST COLLEGE.\r\n                                                          £ per ann.\r\nThe general                                                        300\r\n5 colonels at £100 per ann. each                                   500\r\n20 captains at 60 ,,                                             1,200\r\n100 governors at 10 ,,                                           1,000\r\n200 directors at 5 ,,                                            1,000\r\n200 exempts at 5 ,,                                              1,000\r\n2,000 heads for subsistence, at £20 per head per                40,000\r\nann., including provision, and all the officers’\r\nsalaries in the house, as butlers, cooks, purveyors,\r\nnurses, maids, laundresses, stewards, clerks,\r\nservants, chaplains, porters, and attendants, which\r\nare numerous.\r\n                           SECOND COLLEGE.\r\nA governor                                                         200\r\nA president                                                        100\r\n50 college-majors at £50 per ann. each                           2,500\r\n200 proficients at 10                                            2,000\r\nCommons for 500 students during times of exercises at            2,500\r\n£5 per ann. each\r\n200 proficients’ subsistence, reckoning as above                 4,000\r\n                            THIRD COLLEGE.\r\nThe gentlemen here are maintained as gentlemen, and             25,000\r\nare to have good tables, who shall therefore have an\r\nallowance at the rate of £25 per head, all officers\r\nto be maintained out of it; which is\r\n100 teachers, salary and subsistence ditto                       4,500\r\n50 college-majors at £10 per ann. is                               500\r\n                                         Annual charge          86,300\r\nThe building to cost                                            50,000\r\nFurniture, beds, tables, chairs, linen, &c.                     10,000\r\nBooks, instruments, and utensils for experiments                 2,000\r\n                      So the immediate charge would be          62,000\r\nThe annual charge                                               86,300\r\nTo which add the charges of exercises and experiments            3,700\r\n                                                                90,000\r\n\r\nThe king’s magazines to furnish them with 500 barrels of gunpowder per\r\nannum for the public uses of exercises and experiments.\r\n\r\nIn the first of these colleges should remain the governing part, and all\r\nthe preferments to be made from thence, to be supplied in course from the\r\nother; the general of the first to give orders to the other, and be\r\nsubject only to the founder.\r\n\r\nThe government should be all military, with a constitution for the same\r\nregulated for that purpose, and a council to hear and determine the\r\ndifferences and trespasses by the college laws.\r\n\r\nThe public exercises likewise military, and all the schools be\r\ndisciplined under proper officers, who are so in turn or by order of the\r\ngeneral, and continue but for the day.\r\n\r\nThe several classes to perform several studies, and but one study to a\r\ndistinct class, and the persons, as they remove from one study to\r\nanother, to change their classes, but so as that in the general exercises\r\nall the scholars may be qualified to act all the several parts as they\r\nmay be ordered.\r\n\r\nThe proper studies of this college should be the following:\r\n\r\nGeometry.                Bombarding.\r\nAstronomy.               Gunnery.\r\nHistory.                 Fortification.\r\nNavigation.              Encamping.\r\nDecimal arithmetic.      Intrenching.\r\nTrigonometry.            Approaching.\r\nDialing.                 Attacking.\r\nGauging.                 Delineation.\r\nMining.                  Architecture.\r\nFireworking.             Surveying.\r\n\r\nAnd all arts or sciences appendices to such as these, with exercises for\r\nthe body, to which all should be obliged, as their genius and capacities\r\nled them, as:\r\n\r\n1.  Swimming; which no soldier, and, indeed, no man whatever, ought to be\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\n2.  Handling all sorts of firearms.\r\n\r\n3.  Marching and counter-marching in form.\r\n\r\n4.  Fencing and the long-staff.\r\n\r\n5.  Riding and managing, or horsemanship.\r\n\r\n6.  Running, leaping, and wrestling.\r\n\r\nAnd herewith should also be preserved and carefully taught all the\r\ncustoms, usages, terms of war, and terms of art used in sieges, marches\r\nof armies and encampments, that so a gentleman taught in this college\r\nshould be no novice when he comes into the king’s armies, though he has\r\nseen no service abroad.  I remember the story of an English gentleman, an\r\nofficer at the siege of Limerick, in Ireland, who, though he was brave\r\nenough upon action, yet for the only matter of being ignorant in the\r\nterms of art, and knowing not how to talk camp language, was exposed to\r\nbe laughed at by the whole army for mistaking the opening of the\r\ntrenches, which he thought had been a mine against the town.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of these colleges would be as well worth publishing as\r\nthe acts of the Royal Society.  To which purpose the house must be built\r\nwhere they may have ground to cast bombs, to raise regular works, as\r\nbatteries, bastions, half-moons, redoubts, horn-works, forts, and the\r\nlike; with the convenience of water to draw round such works, to exercise\r\nthe engineers in all the necessary experiments of draining and mining\r\nunder ditches.  There must be room to fire great shot at a distance, to\r\ncannonade a camp, to throw all sorts of fireworks and machines that are,\r\nor shall be, invented; to open trenches, form camps, &c.\r\n\r\nTheir public exercises will be also very diverting, and more worth while\r\nfor any gentleman to see than the sights or shows which our people in\r\nEngland are so fond of.\r\n\r\nI believe as a constitution might be formed from these generals, this\r\nwould be the greatest, the gallantest and the most useful foundation in\r\nthe world.  The English gentry would be the best qualified, and\r\nconsequently best accepted abroad, and most useful at home of any people\r\nin the world; and His Majesty should never more be exposed to the\r\nnecessity of employing foreigners in the posts of trust and service in\r\nhis armies.\r\n\r\nAnd that the whole kingdom might in some degree be better qualified for\r\nservice, I think the following project would be very useful:\r\n\r\nWhen our military weapon was the long-bow, at which our English nation in\r\nsome measure excelled the whole world, the meanest countryman was a good\r\narcher; and that which qualified them so much for service in the war was\r\ntheir diversion in times of peace, which also had this good effect—that\r\nwhen an army was to be raised they needed no disciplining: and for the\r\nencouragement of the people to an exercise so publicly profitable an Act\r\nof Parliament was made to oblige every parish to maintain butts for the\r\nyouth in the country to shoot at.\r\n\r\nSince our way of fighting is now altered, and this destructive engine the\r\nmusket is the proper arms for the soldier, I could wish the diversion\r\nalso of the English would change too, that our pleasures and profit might\r\ncorrespond.  It is a great hindrance to this nation, especially where\r\nstanding armies are a grievance, that if ever a war commence, men must\r\nhave at least a year before they are thought fit to face an enemy, to\r\ninstruct them how to handle their arms; and new-raised men are called raw\r\nsoldiers.  To help this—at least, in some, measure—I would propose that\r\nthe public exercises of our youth should by some public encouragement\r\n(for penalties won’t do it) be drawn off from the foolish boyish sports\r\nof cocking and cricketing, and from tippling, to shooting with a firelock\r\n(an exercise as pleasant as it is manly and generous) and swimming, which\r\nis a thing so many ways profitable, besides its being a great\r\npreservative of health, that methinks no man ought to be without it.\r\n\r\n1.  For shooting, the colleges I have mentioned above, having provided\r\nfor the instructing the gentry at the king’s charge, that the gentry, in\r\nreturn of a favour, should introduce it among the country people, which\r\nmight easily be done thus:\r\n\r\nIf every country gentleman, according to his degree, would contribute to\r\nset-up a prize to be shot for by the town he lives in or the\r\nneighbourhood, about once a year, or twice a year, or oftener, as they\r\nthink fit; which prize not single only to him who shoots nearest, but\r\naccording to the custom of shooting.\r\n\r\nThis would certainly set all the young men in England a-shooting, and\r\nmake them marksmen; for they would be always practising, and making\r\nmatches among themselves too, and the advantage would be found in a war;\r\nfor, no doubt, if all the soldiers in a battalion took a true level at\r\ntheir enemy there would be much more execution done at a distance than\r\nthere is; whereas it has been known how that a battalion of men has\r\nreceived the fire of another battalion, and not lost above thirty or\r\nforty men; and I suppose it will not easily be forgotten how, at the\r\nbattle of Agrim, a battalion of the English army received the whole fire\r\nof an Irish regiment of Dragoons, but never knew to this day whether they\r\nhad any bullets or no; and I need appeal no further than to any officer\r\nthat served in the Irish war, what advantages the English armies made of\r\nthe Irish being such wonderful marksmen.\r\n\r\nUnder this head of academies I might bring in a project for an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Academy for Women_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have often thought of it as one of the most barbarous customs in the\r\nworld, considering us as a civilised and a Christian country, that we\r\ndeny the advantages of learning to women.  We reproach the sex every day\r\nwith folly and impertinence, while I am confident, had they the\r\nadvantages of education equal to us, they would be guilty of less than\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nOne would wonder indeed how it should happen that women are conversable\r\nat all, since they are only beholding to natural parts for all their\r\nknowledge.  Their youth is spent to teach them to stitch and sew, or make\r\nbaubles.  They are taught to read indeed, and perhaps to write their\r\nnames, or so, and that is the height of a woman’s education.  And I would\r\nbut ask any who slight the sex for their understanding, What is a man (a\r\ngentleman, I mean) good for that is taught no more?\r\n\r\nI need not give instances, or examine the character of a gentleman with a\r\ngood estate, and of a good family, and with tolerable parts, and examine\r\nwhat figure he makes for want of education.\r\n\r\nThe soul is placed in the body like a rough diamond, and must be\r\npolished, or the lustre of it will never appear.  And it is manifest that\r\nas the rational soul distinguishes us from brutes, so education carries\r\non the distinction, and makes some less brutish than others.  This is too\r\nevident to need any demonstration.  But why, then, should women be denied\r\nthe benefit of instruction?  If knowledge and understanding had been\r\nuseless additions to the sex, God Almighty would never have given them\r\ncapacities, for He made nothing needless: besides, I would ask such what\r\nthey can see in ignorance that they should think it a necessary ornament\r\nto a woman.  Or, How much worse is a wise woman than a fool? or, What has\r\nthe woman done to forfeit the privilege of being taught?  Does she plague\r\nus with her pride and impertinence?  Why did we not let her learn, that\r\nshe might have had more wit?  Shall we upbraid women with folly, when it\r\nis only the error of this inhuman custom that hindered them being made\r\nwiser?\r\n\r\nThe capacities of women are supposed to be greater and their senses\r\nquicker than those of the men; and what they might be capable of being\r\nbred to is plain from some instances of female wit which this age is not\r\nwithout, which upbraids us with injustice, and looks as if we denied\r\nwomen the advantages of education for fear they should vie with the men\r\nin their improvements.\r\n\r\nTo remove this objection, and that women might have at least a needful\r\nopportunity of education in all sorts of useful learning, I propose the\r\ndraft of an academy for that purpose.\r\n\r\nI know it is dangerous to make public appearances of the sex; they are\r\nnot either to be confined or exposed: the first will disagree with their\r\ninclinations, and the last with their reputations; and therefore it is\r\nsomewhat difficult; and I doubt a method proposed by an ingenious lady,\r\nin a little book called, “Advice to the Ladies,” would be found\r\nimpracticable.  For, saving my respect to the sex, the levity which\r\nperhaps is a little peculiar to them (at least in their youth) will not\r\nbear the restraint; and I am satisfied nothing but the height of bigotry\r\ncan keep up a nunnery.  Women are extravagantly desirous of going to\r\nheaven, and will punish their pretty bodies to get thither; but nothing\r\nelse will do it, and even in that case sometimes it falls out that nature\r\nwill prevail.\r\n\r\nWhen I talk therefore of an academy for women I mean both the model, the\r\nteaching, and the government different from what is proposed by that\r\ningenious lady, for whose proposal I have a very great esteem, and also a\r\ngreat opinion of her wit; different, too, from all sorts of religious\r\nconfinement, and, above all, from vows of celibacy.\r\n\r\nWherefore the academy I propose should differ but little from public\r\nschools, wherein such ladies as were willing to study should have all the\r\nadvantages of learning suitable to their genius.\r\n\r\nBut since some severities of discipline more than ordinary would be\r\nabsolutely necessary to preserve the reputation of the house, that\r\npersons of quality and fortune might not be afraid to venture their\r\nchildren thither, I shall venture to make a small scheme by way of essay.\r\n\r\nThe house I would have built in a form by itself, as well as in a place\r\nby itself.\r\n\r\nThe building should be of three plain fronts, without any jettings or\r\nbearing-work, that the eye might at a glance see from one coin to the\r\nother; the gardens walled in the same triangular figure, with a large\r\nmoat, and but one entrance.\r\n\r\nWhen thus every part of the situation was contrived as well as might be\r\nfor discovery, and to render intriguing dangerous, I would have no\r\nguards, no eyes, no spies set over the ladies, but shall expect them to\r\nbe tried by the principles of honour and strict virtue.\r\n\r\nAnd if I am asked why, I must ask pardon of my own sex for giving this\r\nreason for it:\r\n\r\nI am so much in charity with women, and so well acquainted with men, that\r\nit is my opinion there needs no other care to prevent intriguing than to\r\nkeep the men effectually away.  For though inclination, which we prettily\r\ncall love, does sometimes move a little too visibly in the sex, and\r\nfrailty often follows, yet I think verily custom, which we miscall\r\nmodesty, has so far the ascendant over the sex that solicitation always\r\ngoes before it.\r\n\r\n   “Custom with women, ’stead of virtue, rules;\r\n   It leads the wisest, and commands the fools;\r\n   For this alone, when inclinations reign,\r\n   Though virtue’s fled, will acts of vice restrain.\r\n   Only by custom ’tis that virtue lives,\r\n   And love requires to be asked before it gives.\r\n   For that which we call modesty is pride:\r\n   They scorn to ask, and hate to be denied.\r\n   ’Tis custom thus prevails upon their want;\r\n   They’ll never beg what, asked, they easily grant.\r\n   And when the needless ceremony’s over,\r\n   Themselves the weakness of the sex discover.\r\n   If, then, desires are strong, and nature free,\r\n   Keep from her men and opportunity.\r\n   Else ’twill be vain to curb her by restraint;\r\n   But keep the question off, you keep the saint.”\r\n\r\nIn short, let a woman have never such a coming principle, she will let\r\nyou ask before she complies—at least, if she be a woman of any honour.\r\n\r\nUpon this ground I am persuaded such measures might be taken that the\r\nladies might have all the freedom in the world within their own walls,\r\nand yet no intriguing, no indecencies, nor scandalous affairs happen; and\r\nin order to this, the following customs and laws should be observed in\r\nthe colleges, of which I would propose one at least in every county in\r\nEngland, and about ten for the city of London.\r\n\r\nAfter the regulation of the form of the building as before;\r\n\r\n1.  All the ladies who enter into the house should set their hands to the\r\norders of the house, to signify their consent to submit to them.\r\n\r\n2.  As no woman should be received but who declared herself willing, and\r\nthat it was the act of her choice to enter herself, so no person should\r\nbe confined to continue there a moment longer than the same voluntary\r\nchoice inclined her.\r\n\r\n3.  The charges of the house being to be paid by the ladies, every one\r\nthat entered should have only this incumbrance—that she should pay for\r\nthe whole year, though her mind should change as to her continuance.\r\n\r\n4.  An Act of Parliament should make it felony, without clergy, for any\r\nman to enter by force or fraud into the house, or to solicit any woman,\r\nthough it were to marry, while she was in the house.  And this law would\r\nby no means be severe, because any woman who was willing to receive the\r\naddresses of a man might discharge herself of the house when she pleased;\r\nand, on the contrary, any woman who had occasion might discharge herself\r\nof the impertinent addresses of any person she had an aversion to by\r\nentering into the house.\r\n\r\nIn this house the persons who enter should be taught all sorts of\r\nbreeding suitable to both their genius and their quality, and, in\r\nparticular, music and dancing, which it would be cruelty to bar the sex\r\nof, because they are their darlings; but, besides this, they should be\r\ntaught languages, as particularly French and Italian; and I would venture\r\nthe injury of giving a woman more tongues than one.\r\n\r\nThey should, as a particular study, be taught all the graces of speech,\r\nand all the necessary air of conversation, which our common education is\r\nso defective in that I need not expose it.  They should be brought to\r\nread books, and especially history, and so to read as to make them\r\nunderstand the world, and be able to know and judge of things when they\r\nhear of them.\r\n\r\nTo such whose genius would lead them to it I would deny no sort of\r\nlearning: but the chief thing in general is to cultivate the\r\nunderstandings of the sex, that they may be capable of all sorts of\r\nconversation; that, their parts and judgments being improved, they may be\r\nas profitable in their conversation as they are pleasant.\r\n\r\nWomen, in my observation, have little or no difference in them but as\r\nthey are, or are not, distinguished by education.  Tempers indeed may in\r\nsome degree influence them, but the main distinguishing part is their\r\nbreeding.\r\n\r\nThe whole sex are generally quick and sharp; I believe I may be allowed\r\nto say generally so; for you rarely see them lumpish and heavy when they\r\nare children, as boys will often be.  If a woman be well bred, and taught\r\nthe proper management of her natural wit, she proves generally very\r\nsensible and retentive; and, without partiality, a woman of sense and\r\nmanners is the finest and most delicate part of God’s creation, the glory\r\nof her Maker, and the great instance of His singular regard to man (His\r\ndarling creature), to whom He gave the best gift either God could bestow\r\nor man receive; and it is the most sordid piece of folly and ingratitude\r\nin the world to withhold from the sex the due lustre which the advantages\r\nof education gives to the natural beauty of their minds.\r\n\r\nA woman well bred and well taught, furnished with the additional\r\naccomplishments of knowledge and behaviour, is a creature without\r\ncomparison; her society is the emblem of sublimer enjoyments; her person\r\nis angelic, and her conversation heavenly; she is all softness and\r\nsweetness, peace, love, wit, and delight; she is every way suitable to\r\nthe sublimest wish, and the man that has such a one to his portion has\r\nnothing to do but to rejoice in her, and be thankful.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, suppose her to be the very same woman, and rob her of\r\nthe benefit of education, and it follows thus:\r\n\r\nIf her temper be good, want of education makes her soft and easy.\r\n\r\nHer wit, for want of teaching, makes her impertinent and talkative.\r\n\r\nHer knowledge, for want of judgment and experience, makes her fanciful\r\nand whimsical.\r\n\r\nIf her temper be bad, want of breeding makes her worse, and she grows\r\nhaughty, insolent, and loud.\r\n\r\nIf she be passionate, want of manners makes her termagant and a scold,\r\nwhich is much at one with lunatic.\r\n\r\nIf she be proud, want of discretion (which still is breeding) makes her\r\nconceited, fantastic, and ridiculous.\r\n\r\nAnd from these she degenerates to be turbulent, clamorous, noisy, nasty,\r\nand “the devil.”\r\n\r\nMethinks mankind for their own sakes (since, say what we will of the\r\nwomen, we all think fit one time or other to be concerned with them)\r\nshould take some care to breed them up to be suitable and serviceable, if\r\nthey expected no such thing as delight from them.  Bless us! what care do\r\nwe take to breed up a good horse, and to break him well!  And what a\r\nvalue do we put upon him when it is done!—and all because he should be\r\nfit for our use.  And why not a woman?—since all her ornaments and\r\nbeauty, without suitable behaviour, is a cheat in nature, like the false\r\ntradesman who puts the best of his goods uppermost, that the buyer may\r\nthink the rest are of the same goodness.\r\n\r\nBeauty of the body, which is the women’s glory, seems to be now unequally\r\nbestowed, and nature (or, rather, Providence) to lie under some scandal\r\nabout it, as if it was given a woman for a snare to men, and so make a\r\nkind of a she-devil of her: because, they say, exquisite beauty is rarely\r\ngiven with wit, more rarely with goodness of temper, and never at all\r\nwith modesty.  And some, pretending to justify the equity of such a\r\ndistribution, will tell us it is the effect of the justice of Providence\r\nin dividing particular excellences among all His creatures, “Share and\r\nshare alike, as it were,” that all might for something or other be\r\nacceptable to one another, else some would be despised.\r\n\r\nI think both these notions false; and yet the last, which has the show of\r\nrespect to Providence, is the worst; for it supposes Providence to be\r\nindigent and empty, as if it had not wherewith to furnish all the\r\ncreatures it had made, but was fain to be parsimonious in its gifts, and\r\ndistribute them by piece-meal, for fear of being exhausted.\r\n\r\nIf I might venture my opinion against an almost universal notion, I would\r\nsay most men mistake the proceedings of Providence in this case, and all\r\nthe world at this day are mistaken in their practice about it.  And,\r\nbecause the assertion is very bold, I desire to explain myself.\r\n\r\nThat Almighty First Cause which made us all is certainly the fountain of\r\nexcellence, as it is of being, and by an invisible influence could have\r\ndiffused equal qualities and perfections to all the creatures it has\r\nmade, as the sun does its light, without the least ebb or diminution to\r\nHimself; and has given indeed to every individual sufficient to the\r\nfigure His providence had designed him in the world.\r\n\r\nI believe it might be defended if I should say that I do suppose God has\r\ngiven to all mankind equal gifts and capacities, in that He has given\r\nthem all souls equally capable; and that the whole difference in mankind\r\nproceeds either from accidental difference in the make of their bodies,\r\nor from the foolish difference of education.\r\n\r\n1.  _From accidental difference in bodies_.—I would avoid discoursing\r\nhere of the philosophical position of the soul in the body: but if it be\r\ntrue, as philosophers do affirm, that the understanding and memory is\r\ndilated or contracted according to the accidental dimensions of the organ\r\nthrough which it is conveyed, then, though God has given a soul as\r\ncapable to me as another, yet if I have any natural defect in those parts\r\nof the body by which the soul should act, I may have the same soul\r\ninfused as another man, and yet he be a wise man and I a very fool.  For\r\nexample, if a child naturally have a defect in the organ of hearing, so\r\nthat he could never distinguish any sound, that child shall never be able\r\nto speak or read, though it have a soul capable of all the\r\naccomplishments in the world.  The brain is the centre of the soul’s\r\nactings, where all the distinguishing faculties of it reside; and it is\r\nobservable, a man who has a narrow contracted head, in which there is not\r\nroom for the due and necessary operations of nature by the brain, is\r\nnever a man of very great judgment; and that proverb, “A great head and\r\nlittle wit,” is not meant by nature, but is a reproof upon sloth; as if\r\none should, by way of wonder say, “Fie, fie, you that have a great head\r\nhave but little wit; that’s strange! that must certainly be your own\r\nfault.”  From this notion I do believe there is a great matter in the\r\nbreed of men and women; not that wise men shall always get wise children:\r\nbut I believe strong and healthy bodies have the wisest children; and\r\nsickly, weakly bodies affect the wits as well as the bodies of their\r\nchildren.  We are easily persuaded to believe this in the breeds of\r\nhorses, cocks, dogs, and other creatures; and I believe it is as visible\r\nin men.\r\n\r\nBut to come closer to the business; the great distinguishing difference\r\nwhich is seen in the world between men and women is in their education;\r\nand this is manifested by comparing it with the difference between one\r\nman or woman and another.\r\n\r\nAnd herein it is that I take upon me to make such a bold assertion, that\r\nall the world are mistaken in their practice about women: for I cannot\r\nthink that God Almighty ever made them so delicate, so glorious\r\ncreatures, and furnished them with such charms, so agreeable and so\r\ndelightful to mankind, with souls capable of the same accomplishments\r\nwith men, and all to be only stewards of our houses, cooks, and slaves.\r\n\r\nNot that I am for exalting the female government in the least: but, in\r\nshort, I would have men take women for companions, and educate them to be\r\nfit for it.  A woman of sense and breeding will scorn as much to encroach\r\nupon the prerogative of the man as a man of sense will scorn to oppress\r\nthe weakness of the woman.  But if the women’s souls were refined and\r\nimproved by teaching, that word would be lost; to say, “the weakness of\r\nthe sex,” as to judgment, would be nonsense; for ignorance and folly\r\nwould be no more to be found among women than men.  I remember a passage\r\nwhich I heard from a very fine woman; she had wit and capacity enough, an\r\nextraordinary shape and face, and a great fortune, but had been\r\ncloistered up all her time, and, for fear of being stolen, had not had\r\nthe liberty of being taught the common necessary knowledge of women’s\r\naffairs; and when she came to converse in the world her natural wit made\r\nher so sensible of the want of education that she gave this short\r\nreflection on herself:\r\n\r\n“I am ashamed to talk with my very maids,” says she, “for I don’t know\r\nwhen they do right or wrong: I had more need go to school than be\r\nmarried.”\r\n\r\nI need not enlarge on the loss the defect of education is to the sex, nor\r\nargue the benefit of the contrary practice; it is a thing will be more\r\neasily granted than remedied: this chapter is but an essay at the thing,\r\nand I refer the practice to those happy days, if ever they shall be, when\r\nmen shall be wise enough to mend it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF A COURT MERCHANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nI ASK pardon of the learned gentlemen of the long robe if I do them any\r\nwrong in this chapter, having no design to affront them when I say that\r\nin matters of debate among merchants, when they come to be argued by\r\nlawyers at the bar, they are strangely handled.  I myself have heard very\r\nfamous lawyers make sorry work of a cause between the merchant and his\r\nfactor; and when they come to argue about exchanges, discounts, protests,\r\ndemurrages, charter-parties, freights, port-charges, assurances,\r\nbarratries, bottomries, accounts current, accounts in commission, and\r\naccounts in company, and the like, the solicitor has not been able to\r\ndraw a brief, nor the counsel to understand it.  Never was young parson\r\nmore put to it to make out his text when he is got into the pulpit\r\nwithout his notes than I have seen a counsel at the bar when he would\r\nmake out a cause between two merchants.  And I remember a pretty history\r\nof a particular case, by way of instance, when two merchants, contending\r\nabout a long factorage account, that had all the niceties of\r\nmerchandising in it, and labouring on both sides to instruct their\r\ncounsel, and to put them in when they were out, at last they found them\r\nmake such ridiculous stuff of it that they both threw up the cause and\r\nagreed to a reference, which reference in one week, without any charge,\r\nended all the dispute, which they had spent a great deal of money in\r\nbefore to no purpose.\r\n\r\nNay, the very judges themselves (no reflection upon their learning) have\r\nbeen very much at a loss in giving instructions to a jury, and juries\r\nmuch more to understand them; for, when all is done, juries, which are\r\nnot always, nor often indeed, of the wisest men, are, to be sure, in\r\numpires in causes so nice that the very lawyer and judge can hardly\r\nunderstand them.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of merchants are accompanied with such variety of\r\ncircumstances, such new and unusual contingencies, which change and\r\ndiffer in every age, with a multitude of niceties and punctilios (and\r\nthose, again, altering as the customs and usages of countries and states\r\ndo alter), that it has been found impracticable to make any laws that\r\ncould extend to all cases.  And our law itself does tacitly acknowledge\r\nits own imperfection in this case, by allowing the custom of merchants to\r\npass as a kind of law in cases of difficulty.\r\n\r\nWherefore it seems to me a most natural proceeding that such affairs\r\nshould be heard before, and judged by, such as by known experience and\r\nlong practice in the customs and usages of foreign negotiation are of\r\ncourse the most capable to determine the same.\r\n\r\nBesides the reasonableness of the argument there are some cases in our\r\nlaws in which it is impossible for a plaintiff to make out his case, or a\r\ndefendant to make out his plea; as, in particular, when his proofs are\r\nbeyond seas (for no protests, certifications, or procurations are allowed\r\nin our courts as evidence); and the damages are infinite and\r\nirretrievable by any of the proceedings of our laws.\r\n\r\nFor the answering all these circumstances, a court might be erected by\r\nauthority of Parliament, to be composed of six judges commissioners, who\r\nshould have power to hear and decide as a court of equity, under the\r\ntitle of a “Court Merchant.”\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of this court should be short, the trials speedy, the\r\nfees easy, that every man might have immediate remedy where wrong is\r\ndone.  For in trials at law about merchants’ affairs the circumstances of\r\nthe case are often such as the long proceedings of courts of equity are\r\nmore pernicious than in other cases; because the matters to which they\r\nare generally relating are under greater contingencies than in other\r\ncases, as effects in hands abroad, which want orders, ships, and seamen\r\nlying at demurrage and in pay, and the like.\r\n\r\nThese six judges should be chosen of the most eminent merchants of the\r\nkingdom, to reside in London, and to have power by commission to summon a\r\ncouncil of merchants, who should decide all cases on the hearing, of both\r\nparties, with appeal to the said judges.\r\n\r\nAlso to delegate by commission petty councils of merchants in the most\r\nconsiderable ports of the kingdom for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nThe six judges themselves to be only judges of appeal; all trials to be\r\nheard before the council of merchants by methods and proceedings singular\r\nand concise.\r\n\r\nThe council to be sworn to do justice, and to be chosen annually out of\r\nthe principal merchants of the city.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings here should be without delay; the plaintiff to exhibit\r\nhis grievance by way of brief, and the defendant to give in his answer,\r\nand a time of hearing to be appointed immediately.\r\n\r\nThe defendant by motion shall have liberty to put off hearing upon\r\nshowing good cause, not otherwise.\r\n\r\nAt hearing, every man to argue his own cause if he pleases, or introduce\r\nany person to do it for him.\r\n\r\nAttestations and protests from foreign parts, regularly procured and\r\nauthentically signified in due form, to pass in evidence; affidavits in\r\ndue form likewise attested and done before proper magistrates within the\r\nking’s dominions, to be allowed as evidence.\r\n\r\nThe party grieved may appeal to the six judges, before whom they shall\r\nplead by counsel, and from their judgment to have no appeal.\r\n\r\nBy this method infinite controversies would be avoided and disputes\r\namicably ended, a multitude of present inconveniences avoided, and\r\nmerchandising matters would in a merchant-like manner be decided by the\r\nknown customs and methods of trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF SEAMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is observable that whenever this kingdom is engaged in a war with any\r\nof its neighbours two great inconveniences constantly follow: one to the\r\nking and one to trade.\r\n\r\n1.  That to the king is, that he is forced to press seamen for the\r\nmanning of his navy, and force them involuntarily into the service: which\r\nway of violently dragging men into the fleet is attended with sundry ill\r\ncircumstances, as:\r\n\r\n(1.)  Our naval preparations are retarded, and our fleets always late for\r\nwant of men, which has exposed them not a little, and been the ruin of\r\nmany a good and well-laid expedition.\r\n\r\n(2.)  Several irregularities follow, as the officers taking money to\r\ndismiss able seamen, and filling up their complement with raw and\r\nimproper persons.\r\n\r\n(3.)  Oppressions, quarrellings, and oftentimes murders, by the rashness\r\nof press-masters and the obstinacy of some unwilling to go.\r\n\r\n(4.)  A secret aversion to the service from a natural principle, common\r\nto the English nation, to hate compulsion.\r\n\r\n(5.)  Kidnapping people out of the kingdom, robbing houses, and picking\r\npockets, frequently practised under pretence of pressing, as has been\r\nvery much used of late.\r\n\r\nWith various abuses of the like nature, some to the king, and some to the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n2.  To trade.  By the extravagant price set on wages for seamen, which\r\nthey impose on the merchant with a sort of authority, and he is obliged\r\nto give by reason of the scarcity of men, and that not from a real want\r\nof men (for in the height of a press, if a merchant-man wanted men, and\r\ncould get a protection for them, he might have any number immediately,\r\nand none without it, so shy were they of the public service).\r\n\r\nThe first of these things has cost the king above three millions sterling\r\nsince the war, in these three particulars:\r\n\r\n1.  Charge of pressing on sea and on shore, and in small craft employed\r\nfor that purpose.\r\n\r\n2.  Ships lying in harbour for want of men, at a vast charge of pay and\r\nvictuals for those they had.\r\n\r\n3.  Keeping the whole navy in constant pay and provisions all the winter,\r\nfor fear of losing the men against summer, which has now been done\r\nseveral years, besides bounty money and other expenses to court and\r\noblige the seamen.\r\n\r\nThe second of these (viz., the great wages paid by the merchant) has cost\r\ntrade, since the war, above twenty millions sterling.  The coal trade\r\ngives a specimen of it, who for the first three years of the war gave £9\r\na voyage to common seamen, who before sailed for 36s.; which, computing\r\nthe number of ships and men used in the coal trade, and of voyages made,\r\nat eight hands to a vessel, does, modestly accounting, make £89,600\r\ndifference in one year in wages to seamen in the coal trade only.\r\n\r\nFor other voyages the difference of sailors’ wages is 50s, per month and\r\n55s. per month to foremast-men, who before went for 26s. per month;\r\nbesides subjecting the merchant to the insolence of the seamen, who are\r\nnot now to be pleased with any provisions, will admit no half-pay, and\r\ncommand of the captains even what they please; nay, the king himself can\r\nhardly please them.\r\n\r\nFor cure of these inconveniences it is the following project is proposed,\r\nwith which the seamen can have no reason to be dissatisfied, nor are not\r\nat all injured; and yet the damage sustained will be prevented, and an\r\nimmense sum of money spared, which is now squandered away by the\r\nprofuseness and luxury of the seamen.  For if prodigality weakens the\r\npublic wealth of the kingdom in general, then are the seamen but ill\r\ncommonwealths-men, who are not visibly the richer for the prodigious sums\r\nof money paid them either by the king or the merchant.\r\n\r\nThe project is this: that by an Act of Parliament an office or court be\r\nerected, within the jurisdiction of the Court of Admiralty, and subject\r\nto the Lord High Admiral, or otherwise independent, and subject only to a\r\nparliamentary authority, as the commission for taking and stating the\r\npublic accounts.\r\n\r\nIn this court or office, or the several branches of it (which, to that\r\nend, shall be subdivided and placed in every sea-port in the kingdom),\r\nshall be listed and entered into immediate pay all the seamen in the\r\nkingdom, who shall be divided into colleges or chambers of sundry\r\ndegrees, suitable to their several capacities, with pay in proportion to\r\ntheir qualities; as boys, youths, servants, men able and raw, midshipmen,\r\nofficers, pilots, old men, and pensioners.\r\n\r\nThe circumstantials of this office:\r\n\r\n1.  No captain or master of any ship or vessel should dare to hire or\r\ncarry to sea with him any seamen but such as he shall receive from the\r\noffice aforesaid.\r\n\r\n2.  No man whatsoever, seaman or other, but applying himself to the said\r\noffice to be employed as a sailor, should immediately enter into pay, and\r\nreceive for every able seaman 24s. per month, and juniors in proportion;\r\nto receive half-pay while unemployed, and liberty to work for themselves:\r\nonly to be at call of the office, and leave an account where to be found.\r\n\r\n3.  No sailor could desert, because no employment would be to be had\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n4.  All ships at their clearing at the Custom House should receive a\r\nticket to the office for men, where would be always choice rather than\r\nscarcity, who should be delivered over by the office to the captain or\r\nmaster without any trouble or delay; all liberty of choice to be allowed\r\nboth to master and men, only so as to give up all disputes to the\r\nofficers appointed to decide.\r\n\r\n_Note_.—By this would be avoided the great charge captains and owners are\r\nat to keep men on board before they are ready to go; whereas now the care\r\nof getting men will be over, and all come on board in one day: for, the\r\ncaptain carrying the ticket to the office, he may go and choose his men\r\nif he will; otherwise they will be sent on board to him, by tickets sent\r\nto their dwellings to repair on board such a ship.\r\n\r\n5.  For all these men that the captain or master of the ship takes he\r\nshall pay the office, not the seamen, 28s. per month (which 4s. per month\r\noverplus of wages will be employed to pay the half-pay to the men out of\r\nemploy), and so in proportion of wages for juniors.\r\n\r\n6.  All disputes concerning the mutinying of mariners, or other matters\r\nof debate between the captains and men, to be tried by way of appeal in a\r\ncourt for that purpose to be erected, as aforesaid.\r\n\r\n7.  All discounting of wages and time, all damages of goods, averages,\r\nstopping of pay, and the like, to be adjusted by stated and public rules\r\nand laws in print, established by the same Act of Parliament, by which\r\nmeans all litigious suits in the Court of Admiralty (which are infinite)\r\nwould be prevented.\r\n\r\n8.  No ship that is permitted to enter at the Custom House and take in\r\ngoods should ever be refused men, or delayed in the delivering them above\r\nfive days after a demand made and a ticket from the Custom House\r\ndelivered (general cases, as arrests and embargoes, excepted).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Consequences of this Method_.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  By this means the public would have no want of seamen, and all the\r\ncharges and other inconveniences of pressing men would be prevented.\r\n\r\n2.  The intolerable oppression upon trade, from the exorbitance of wages\r\nand insolence of mariners, would be taken off.\r\n\r\n3.  The following sums of money should be paid to the office, to lie in\r\nbank as a public fund for the service of the nation, to be disposed of by\r\norder of Parliament, and not otherwise; a committee being a ways\r\nsubstituted in the intervals of the session to audit the accounts, and a\r\ntreasury for the money, to be composed of members of the House, and to be\r\nchanged every session of Parliament:\r\n\r\n(1).  Four shillings per month wages advanced by the merchants to the\r\noffice for the men, more than the office pays them.\r\n\r\n(2).  In consideration of the reducing men’s wages, and consequently\r\nfreights, to the former prices (or near them), the owners of ships or\r\nmerchants shall pay at the importation of all goods forty shillings per\r\nton freight, to be stated upon all goods and ports in proportion;\r\nreckoning it on wine tonnage from Canaries as the standard, and on\r\nspecial freights in proportion to the freight formerly paid, and half the\r\nsaid price in times of peace.\r\n\r\n_Note_.—This may well be done, and no burden; for if freights are reduced\r\nto their former prices (or near it), as they will be if wages are so too,\r\nthen the merchant may well pay it: as, for instance, freight from Jamaica\r\nto London, formerly at £6 10s. per ton, now at £18 and £20; from\r\nVirginia, at £5 to £6 10s., now at £14, £16, and £17; from Barbadoes, at\r\n£6, now at £16; from Oporto, at £2, now at £6; and the like.\r\n\r\nThe payment of the above-said sums being a large bank for a fund, and it\r\nbeing supposed to be in fair hands and currently managed, the merchants\r\nshall further pay upon all goods shipped out, and shipped on board from\r\nabroad, for and from any port of this kingdom, £4 per cent. on the real\r\nvalue, _bonâ fide_; to be sworn to if demanded.  In consideration whereof\r\nthe said office shall be obliged to pay and make good all losses,\r\ndamages, averages, and casualties whatsoever, as fully as by the custom\r\nof assurances now is done, without any discounts, rebates, or delays\r\nwhatsoever; the said £4 per cent. to be stated on the voyage to the\r\nBarbadoes, and enlarged or taken off, in proportion to the voyage, by\r\nrules and laws to be printed and publicly known.\r\n\r\nReserving only, that then, as reason good, the said office shall have\r\npower to direct ships of all sorts, how and in what manner, and how long\r\nthey shall sail with or wait for convoys; and shall have power (with\r\nlimitations) to lay embargoes on ships, in order to compose fleets for\r\nthe benefit of convoys.\r\n\r\nThese rules, formerly noted, to extend to all trading by sea, the\r\ncoasting and home-fishing trade excepted; and for them it should be\r\nordered—\r\n\r\nFirst, for coals; the colliers being provided with men at 28s. per month,\r\nand convoys in sufficient number, and proper stations from Tynemouth Bar\r\nto the river, so as they need not go in fleets, but as wind and weather\r\npresents, run all the way under the protection of the men-of-war, who\r\nshould be continually cruising from station to station, they would be\r\nable to perform their voyage, in as short time as formerly, and at as\r\ncheap pay, and consequently could afford to sell their coals at 17s. per\r\nchaldron, as well as formerly at 15s.\r\n\r\nWherefore there should be paid into the treasury appointed at Newcastle,\r\nby bond to be paid where they deliver, 10s. per chaldron, Newcastle\r\nmeasure; and the stated price at London to be 27s. per chaldron in the\r\nPool, which is 30s. at the buyer’s house; and is so far from being dear,\r\na time of war especially, as it is cheaper than ever was known in a war;\r\nand the officers should by proclamation confine the seller to that price.\r\n\r\nIn consideration also of the charge of convoys, the ships bringing coals\r\nshall all pay £1 per cent. on the value of the ship, to be agreed on at\r\nthe office; and all convoy-money exacted by commanders of ships shall be\r\nrelinquished, and the office to make good all losses of ships, not goods,\r\nthat shall be lost by enemies only.\r\n\r\nThese heads, indeed, are such as would need some explication, if the\r\nexperiment were to be made; and, with submission, would reduce the seamen\r\nto better circumstances; at least, it would have them in readiness for\r\nany public service much easier than by all the late methods of\r\nencouragement by registering seamen, &c.\r\n\r\nFor by this method all the seamen in the kingdom should be the king’s\r\nhired servants, and receive their wages from him, whoever employed them;\r\nand no man could hire or employ them but from him.  The merchant should\r\nhire them of the king, and pay the king for them; nor would there be a\r\nseaman in England out of employ—which, by the way, would prevent their\r\nseeking service abroad.  If they were not actually at sea they would\r\nreceive half-pay, and might be employed in works about the yards, stores,\r\nand navy, to keep all things in repair.\r\n\r\nIf a fleet or squadron was to be fitted out they would be manned in a\r\nweek’s time, for all the seamen in England would be ready.  Nor would\r\nthey be shy of the service; for it is not an aversion to the king’s\r\nservice, nor it is not that the duty is harder in the men-of-war than the\r\nmerchant-men, nor it is not fear of danger which makes our seamen lurk\r\nand hide and hang back in a time of war, but it is wages is the matter:\r\n24s. per month in the king’s service, and 40s. to 50s. per month from the\r\nmerchant, is the true cause; and the seaman is in the right of it, too;\r\nfor who would serve his king and country, and fight, and be knocked on\r\nthe head at 24s. per month that can have 50s. without that hazard?  And\r\ntill this be remedied, in vain are all the encouragements which can be\r\ngiven to seamen; for they tend but to make them insolent, and encourage\r\ntheir extravagance.\r\n\r\nNor would this proceeding be any damage to the seamen in general; for\r\n24s. per month wages, and to be kept in constant service (or half-pay\r\nwhen idle), is really better to the seaman than 45s. per month, as they\r\nnow take it, considering how long they often lie idle on shore out of\r\npay; for the extravagant price of seamen’s wages, though it has been an\r\nintolerable burden to trade, has not visibly enriched the sailors, and\r\nthey may as well be content with 24s. per month now as formerly.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, trade would be sensibly revived by it, the intolerable\r\nprice of freights would be reduced, and the public would reap an immense\r\nbenefit by the payments mentioned in the proposal; as—\r\n\r\n1.  4s. per month upon the wages of all the seamen employed by the\r\nmerchant (which if we allow 200,000 seamen always in employ, as there\r\ncannot be less in all the ships belonging to England) is £40,000 per\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n2.  40s. per ton freight upon all goods imported.\r\n\r\n3.  4 per cent. on the value of all goods exported or imported.\r\n\r\n4. 10s. per chaldron upon all the coals shipped at Newcastle, and 1 per\r\ncent. on the ships which carry them.\r\n\r\nWhat these four articles would pay to the Exchequer yearly it would be\r\nvery difficult to calculate, and I am too near the end of this book to\r\nattempt it: but I believe no tax ever given since this war has come near\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt is true, out of this the public would be to pay half-pay to the seamen\r\nwho shall be out of employ, and all the losses, and damages on goods and\r\nships; which, though it might be considerable, would be small, compared\r\nto the payment aforesaid: for as the premium of 4 per cent. is but small,\r\nso the safety lies upon all men being bound to insure.  For I believe any\r\none will grant me this: it is not the smallness of a premium ruins the\r\ninsurer, but it is the smallness of the quantity he insures; and I am not\r\nat all ashamed to affirm that, let but a premium of £4 per cent. be paid\r\ninto one man’s hand for all goods imported and exported, and any man may\r\nbe the general insurer of the kingdom, and yet that premium can never\r\nhurt the merchant either.\r\n\r\nSo that the vast revenue this would raise would be felt nowhere: neither\r\npoor nor rich would pay the more for coals; foreign goods would be\r\nbrought home cheaper, and our own goods carried to market cheaper; owners\r\nwould get more by ships, merchants by goods; and losses by sea would be\r\nno loss at all to anybody, because repaid by the public stock.\r\n\r\nAnother unseen advantage would arise by it: we should be able to outwork\r\nall our neighbours, even the Dutch themselves, by sailing as cheap and\r\ncarrying goods as cheap in a time of war as in peace—an advantage which\r\nhas more in it than is easily thought of, and would have a noble\r\ninfluence upon all our foreign trade.  For what could the Dutch do in\r\ntrade if we could carry our goods to Cadiz at 50s. per ton freight, and\r\nthey give £8 or £10 and the like in other places?  Whereby we could be\r\nable to sell cheaper or get more than our neighbours.\r\n\r\nThere are several considerable clauses might be added to this proposal\r\n(some of great advantage to the general trade of the kingdom, some to\r\nparticular trades, and more to the public), but I avoid being too\r\nparticular in things which are but the product of my own private opinion.\r\n\r\nIf the Government should ever proceed to the experiment, no question but\r\nmuch more than has been hinted at would appear; nor do I see any great\r\ndifficulty in the attempt, or who would be aggrieved at it; and there I\r\nleave it, rather wishing than expecting to see it undertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPON a review of the several chapters of this book I find that, instead\r\nof being able to go further, some things may have suffered for want of\r\nbeing fully expressed; which if any person object against, I only say, I\r\ncannot now avoid it.  I have endeavoured to keep to my title, and offered\r\nbut an essay; which any one is at liberty to go on with as they please,\r\nfor I can promise no supplement.  As to errors of opinion, though I am\r\nnot yet convinced of any, yet I nowhere pretend to infallibility.\r\nHowever, I do not willingly assert anything which I have not good grounds\r\nfor.  If I am mistaken, let him that finds the error inform the world\r\nbetter, and never trouble himself to animadvert upon this, since I assure\r\nhim I shall not enter into any pen-and-ink contest on the matter.\r\n\r\nAs to objections which may lie against any of the proposals made in this\r\nbook, I have in some places mentioned such as occurred to my thoughts.  I\r\nshall never assume that arrogance to pretend no other or further\r\nobjections may be raised; but I do really believe no such objection can\r\nbe raised as will overthrow any scheme here laid down so as to render the\r\nthing impracticable.  Neither do I think but that all men will\r\nacknowledge most of the proposals in this book would be of as great, and\r\nperhaps greater, advantage to the public than I have pretended to.\r\n\r\nAs for such who read books only to find out the author’s _faux pas_, who\r\nwill quarrel at the meanness of style, errors of pointing, dulness of\r\nexpression, or the like, I have but little to say to them.  I thought I\r\nhad corrected it very carefully, and yet some mispointings and small\r\nerrors have slipped me, which it is too late to help.  As to language, I\r\nhave been rather careful to make it speak English suitable to the manner\r\nof the story than to dress it up with exactness of style, choosing rather\r\nto have it free and familiar, according to the nature of essays, than to\r\nstrain at a perfection of language which I rather wish for than pretend\r\nto be master of.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n Printed by Cassell and Company, Limited, La Bella Sauvage, London, E.C.",
