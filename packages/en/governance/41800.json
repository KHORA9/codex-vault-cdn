The story of New Zealand's progress\r\nsince 1814 has been one of splendid emulation tempered by vicissitude.\r\nThere have been dark days, days of doubt, of devastation by war, but\r\nnever a period when our people lost heart or renounced their national\r\nfaith. No attempt has been here made to tell the whole of that story.\r\nAll that I have tried to do is to get back to the beginning of things,\r\nto the birth of law and order, to the genesis of the day when we were\r\nable to say to the Mother Land, \"We will build you a Dreadnought, and\r\nyet another if needs must.\" The Treaty of Waitangi has been frequently\r\nderided and denounced, but it was in very truth the foundation of our\r\nnationhood. When we consider what Britain would have lost in material\r\nwealth, in loyalty, in strategetical advantage; when we reflect what\r\nit would have cost to have conquered the country by force of arms,\r\nthen it is that we can see in clearer perspective the wisdom of Lord\r\nNormanby's policy, the breadth of his statesmanship, and we are the\r\nbetter able to appreciate the triumph in diplomacy which that treaty\r\nrepresents.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the lapse of seventy-three years has robbed us of all\r\nwho were actively concerned in its consummation, and equally\r\nunfortunately they have left few records behind them. There are\r\ngrey-headed men and aged women alive to-day who were children at the\r\ntime, but so far as I know there is only one with us now who was\r\nactually present at the signing of the treaty. Old Rahira te Hua, the\r\ndaughter of one of the great Hongi's slaves, who has seen ninety-three\r\nsummers pass, still carries in her weakening memory some misty\r\nrecollections of that day fraught with such far-reaching consequences\r\nto both races. The opportunity for obtaining personal testimony of\r\nwhat happened is thus irretrievably gone. I have, therefore, had to\r\nrely for my information almost entirely upon official documents,\r\nsupplemented by such fugitive memoranda as may have been left by the\r\nfew concerned, who happen to have placed their opinions or impressions\r\non record. The gathering together of this widely-scattered material,\r\nthe moulding of it into a connected narrative, has had its pleasurable\r\nas well as its anxious moments, for the subject has not been without\r\nits perplexities, ambiguities, and contradictions. All of these I have\r\nsought to sift with justice and treat with perfect impartiality. Where\r\nI have met with conflicting statements it has been my endeavour to so\r\npresent the position that the reader will be able to form his own\r\nconclusions, and where I have expressed my personal opinions they have\r\nonly been such opinions as appeared to me to be justified by the facts\r\nof the case. Whatever impression the reading of this narrative may\r\nleave with those who peruse it, I for one cannot lay down my pen from\r\nits writing without affirming that two things appear to me to be\r\nestablished--that Britain has no reason to be ashamed of the manner in\r\nwhich she obtained the sovereignty of New Zealand, and in the light of\r\nsubsequent events she has no reason to regret it. I have not attempted\r\nto arraign or to defend the various, real or alleged, breaches of the\r\ntreaty committed by our Governors or Governments. That phase of the\r\nsubject is necessarily so controversial in character, that to do it\r\njustice would require a volume of its own, the need for which has to\r\nsome extent been obviated by the publication in 1888 of his\r\n_Aureretanga_, by Mr. G. W. Rusden, in which that vigorous writer\r\ndeals exhaustively with at least the Maori side of the case. The\r\nTreaty of Waitangi, the first diplomatic arrangement of the kind\r\nentered into between Britain and a savage race, was a wise, politic,\r\nand humane measure, the justice of which has been vindicated with the\r\nlapse of time. In the expressive language of a native address to Lord\r\nRanfurly, \"This treaty has been rained upon by the rain, it has been\r\nexposed to the blast of the storm, but the words are still clear, they\r\ncannot be obliterated.\"\r\n\r\nLet us hope that no attempt will ever be made to violate either its\r\nletter or its spirit.\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n \"ENNISMORE,\"\r\n BOULCOTT STREET, WELLINGTON,\r\n _April 30, 1913_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the compilation of this work I have necessarily been placed\r\nunder obligations to a number of gentlemen, whose services I now\r\ndesire to acknowledge.\r\n\r\nI am especially indebted to Mr. Charles Wilson, Librarian to the New\r\nZealand Parliament, for the privilege of freely examining the rare\r\nofficial papers I desired to consult.

But the nearness of these Islands to the\r\nBritish settlements of New South Wales and Van Dieman's Land has also\r\nled to their being resorted to as an asylum for fugitive British\r\nconvicts, and such persons having associated with men left in New\r\nZealand by whale-ships and other vessels, have formed a Society which\r\nindispensably requires the check of some contending authority. Her\r\nMajesty's Government have therefore deemed it expedient to station at\r\nNew Zealand an officer, with the character and powers of a British\r\nConsul, and I have the satisfaction to acquaint you that the Queen has\r\nbeen graciously pleased to select you for that appointment.\" So wrote\r\nViscount Palmerston, Foreign Secretary in Lord Melbourne's Cabinet, on\r\nAugust 13, 1839, to Captain William Hobson, R.N., and this letter may\r\nbe taken as the first satisfactory evidence we have that the British\r\nGovernment had at last decided to accept their long-evaded\r\nresponsibility in connection with New Zealand. Ever since the day when\r\nCaptain Cook took possession of the country in the name and for the\r\nuse of King George III., these islands had been allowed by succeeding\r\nBritish Governments to remain a neglected geographical quantity, and\r\nthis very neglect had now robbed the nation of the title which Cook\r\nhad by his splendid enterprise secured for it.\r\n\r\nThe Law of Nations has well defined the principle that before a\r\ncountry becomes entitled to claim sovereignty in any part of the globe\r\n\"by right of discovery\" it is not sufficient that the mariners of that\r\ncountry should sail forth and discover new lands; but there must be\r\nsome effective act immediately following, such as systematic\r\noccupation, in order to bind other peoples to respect the discovering\r\nnation's claim.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the century which had elapsed between the\r\ntime of Cook's proclamation to the world and the day when the\r\nMelbourne Cabinet decided that Britain must assume in earnest her\r\nresponsibilities in the South Pacific there had not only been no\r\nsystematic occupation of New Zealand by Britain, but rather a\r\nsystematic renunciation of the nation's intention in that direction.\r\nThe Duke of Wellington had petulantly declared that England had\r\ncolonies enough, and Minister after Minister who had presided over the\r\nColonial Office had in deeds, if not in words, endorsed this policy of\r\nanti-Imperialism. There were at this time none amongst the British\r\nstatesmen blessed with that broader grasp, that wider vision of an\r\nEmpire \"extending over every sea, swaying many diverse races, and\r\ncombining many diverse forms of religion,\" which afterwards animated\r\nthe colonial policy of Lord John Russell.[1] The courage and capacity\r\nwhich that planter of Imperial outposts declared were necessary to\r\nbuild such an Empire--to effect such a wholesome blending of\r\npeoples--were wanting, and there was even an imminent danger that in\r\nthis negatory attitude towards colonising other Powers would come to\r\nregard Britain not as an equal, nor with the fear that an equal can\r\ninspire, but as a timorous weakling, a nation destitute of enterprise,\r\nthe product of a waning courage and of a pusillanimous hand.\r\n\r\nThus it came about that when in 1839 the Ministry of Lord Melbourne\r\nfound themselves coerced by circumstances into recognising the need\r\nfor systematic colonisation, they discovered themselves destitute of\r\nwhat most people believed they possessed--a title to sovereignty in\r\nNew Zealand \"by right of discovery.\"\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the British nation had not, however, been as idle as the\r\nBritish statesman, and inherent enterprise, combined with an inherent\r\nlove of adventure, had sown and matured the seed which continuous\r\nMinistries had persistently declined to nourish. The elements which\r\nhad contributed to the irregular settlement of New Zealand were\r\nfaithfully recorded in Lord Palmerston's letter to Captain Hobson, and\r\na more unpropitious beginning for any colony could scarcely be\r\nimagined. The number of British subjects who, up to 1839, had resorted\r\nto New Zealand for the purposes of legitimate and respectable trade\r\nwere comparatively few, but it is estimated that even earlier than\r\nthis there were over five hundred escaped convicts living along the\r\nsea coast in and around the Bay of Islands, the point at which\r\nsettlement had, up to that time, chiefly congregated. Of those\r\ndirectly and indirectly concerned in the whaling industry there must\r\nhave been a considerable number, for it is officially recorded that in\r\nthe year 1836 no less than one hundred and fifty-one vessels had\r\nvisited the Bay of Islands alone, and the proportion was even larger\r\nin the first half of the succeeding year.\r\n\r\nThe combination of whaler and convict was not one calculated to\r\nstrengthen the morality of the community, and so large a leaven of the\r\nlawless class, together with the insatiable desire of the natives to\r\nprocure muskets, had the effect of creating a state of society which,\r\nin the words of the Foreign Secretary, \"indispensably required the\r\ncheck of some contending authority.\" In the absence of any such\r\nauthority the more respectable settlers at the Bay of Islands had\r\norganised themselves into a self-constituted Association, into whose\r\nhands was committed the administration of a rude justice, which\r\nrecognised a liberal application of tar and feathers as meet\r\npunishment for some of the offences against society. A steadying\r\ninfluence had also been supplied by the appointment at intervals since\r\n1814 of gentlemen empowered to act as Justices of the Peace, their\r\nauthority being derived from a Commission issued by the Governor of\r\nNew South Wales, and, if illegal, was on more than one occasion acted\r\nupon with salutary effect.[2]\r\n\r\nAlthough it has been a popular sport on the part of many writers to\r\nthrow darts of sarcasm at the labours of the Missionaries, they, too,\r\nmust be accounted a tremendous influence for good, not so much,\r\nperhaps, in checking the licentiousness of the Europeans, as in\r\npreventing the natives from becoming contaminated by it. Destructive\r\ninternecine wars had been waging \"with fiendish determination\" for\r\nmany years under the conquering leadership of Hongi, Te Wherowhero, Te\r\nWaharoa and Te Rauparaha, by which whole districts had been\r\ndepopulated, and tribe after tribe practically annihilated. Still the\r\nMaori people were a numerous, virile and warlike race, capable of\r\ndeeds of blackest barbarism, or equally adaptable to the softening\r\ninfluences of Christianity and civilisation.\r\n\r\nSo far as the darker side of their history is concerned, we have it on\r\nthe irreproachable authority of the Rev. Samuel Marsden that the\r\ntragedies in which the natives made war upon the Europeans were in\r\nalmost every instance merely acts of retaliation for earlier\r\noutrages.[3] The killing of Marian du Fresne and the massacre on\r\nboard the _Boyd_ were unquestionably so; and the dread of the\r\nnatives which for several years after these events almost suspended\r\nthe sea trade with New Zealand was the natural fruit of that cruelty\r\nwhich trusting Maori seamen had suffered at the hands of unscrupulous\r\ncaptains, who had either inveigled them or forced them on board their\r\nwhalers. Dark as the history of New Zealand was during these Alsatian\r\ndays, there is no chapter quite so dark, or which redounds less to the\r\ncredit of the white race, than the story of the sea-going natives who\r\nwere taken away from these sunny shores,[4] and abandoned in foreign\r\ncountries, or driven at the end of the lash to tasks far beyond their\r\nphysical strength, resulting in the premature death of many, while the\r\npoison of undying hatred entered into the souls of the survivors.\r\n\r\nThe position on shore was scarcely less disgraceful, for the natives\r\nresident in the seaward _pas_ were cruelly ill-treated by the\r\ncrews of the European vessels who visited them; and it is stated in\r\nthe records of the Church Missionary Society that within the first two\r\nor three years of the arrival of the Missionaries not less than one\r\nthousand Maoris had been murdered by Europeans, the natives unhappily\r\nnot infrequently visiting upon the innocent who came within their\r\nreach revenge for crimes perpetrated by the guilty who had evaded\r\ntheir vengeance.\r\n\r\nBut apart from the commission of actual outrage there was debauchery\r\nof several kinds, and always of a pronounced type. \"They lead a most\r\nreckless life, keeping grog shops, selling spirituous liquors to both\r\nEuropeans and natives, living with the native females in a most\r\ndiscreditable way, so that the natives have told me to teach my own\r\ncountrymen first before I taught them. They have called us a nation of\r\ndrunkards from their seeing a majority of Europeans of that stamp in\r\nNew Zealand.\" Such was the testimony of an erstwhile Missionary, Mr.\r\nJohn Flatt, when giving evidence before the House of Lords regarding\r\nthe northern portion of the colony; and not less unsatisfactory was\r\nthe position in the South Island, where the whalers were the\r\npreponderating section of the white population.\r\n\r\nAt both Cloudy Bay and Queen Charlotte Sound there was, in 1837, a\r\nconsiderable white settlement, each man being a law unto himself,\r\nexcept in so far as he was under the dominion of the head man of the\r\nstation. This at least was the opinion formed by Captain Hobson when\r\nvisiting those parts in H.M.S. _Rattlesnake_. In describing the\r\nresult of his enquiries to Governor Bourke, he dismissed the\r\nprobability of these settlements being attacked by the natives,\r\nbecause they were so confederated by their employment; but he\r\nsignificantly added: \"The only danger they have to apprehend is from\r\nthemselves, and that is in a great measure neutralised by the\r\ncontending influences of their own reckless and desperate character.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. Stack, then labouring in the north, in writing home to\r\nthe parent Society, complained bitterly of the unprincipled white men\r\nwho had escaped from the chain gangs at Sydney, and who had recently\r\nshown themselves so desperate that two were seized and taken to Sydney\r\nto be tried at the Assizes on a charge of attempted robbery and\r\nmurder.[5] Mr. Stack pleaded for the intervention of the British\r\nGovernment, which he hoped would not leave the country at the mercy of\r\nthe escaped convicts, or the natives to the influence of a commerce\r\ncarried on with so many circumstances destructive to the moral health\r\nof the people, that if unchecked, would effectually do the work of\r\ndepopulation. \"We have no law or justice,\" wrote Mr. Stack, \"no\r\npunishment for crime but private revenge.\"\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the year 1840 Kororareka, the settlement at the\r\nBay of Islands which had the greatest right to claim the dignity of a\r\ntownship, contained about three hundred inhabitants of all ages,\r\nexclusive of the numerous sailors, whose nightly revels constituted the\r\nonly interruption to the peace and harmony which generally prevailed.\r\nThese gentry resorted in great numbers to the native village at the\r\ninner anchorage, where the principal chief carried on the lucrative\r\nbusiness of grog-selling, besides another of a still more discreditable\r\nkind, for the convenience of his reckless customers--French, English,\r\nand American. \"Here,\" according to Dr. Jameson, \"might be seen the\r\ncurious spectacle of a still savage chief enriching himself at the\r\nexpense of individuals who, although belonging to the most civilised\r\nand powerful nations in the world, were reduced to a lower degree of\r\nbarbarism by the influence of their unbridled licentiousness.\"\r\n\r\nContact with such social degenerates was not calculated to inspire the\r\nnatives with a high ideal of European morality, nor with a conspicuous\r\nexample of rectitude; but where the influences destructive of decency\r\nand order were less virulent the Missionaries had a more hopeful tale\r\nto tell. \"The door is opening before us in every direction, and the\r\npeople are pressing and entreating us to enter. Had we only more help,\r\nwhere we have now a hundred natives under our care, we would soon have\r\na thousand.\" Such was the report of the Rev. Mr. Turner, one of the\r\nWesleyan Missionaries[6] at Hokianga, in urging his Society to send\r\nmore workers to this corner of the human vineyard. The attendance and\r\nattention of the natives at Divine worship were regular and fixed,\r\nwhile it is recorded that their responses to the reading of the Litany\r\nwere particularly devout.\r\n\r\nThe sincerity of many of these early converts was one of the most\r\nremarkable features of the evangelising of the Maori; and the Rev. Dr.\r\nBeecham, in giving evidence before the Lords' Committee in 1838,\r\nquoted this eloquent passage from one of the letters of the Rev. Mr.\r\nHobbs to illustrate the warmth of Maori piety. \"The beauty of the\r\nLiturgy, as translated by our brethren at the Bay of Islands into the\r\nNative tongue, is most exquisite, and to me hardly loses any of the\r\nforce of original composition, and, I have no doubt, has been made a\r\ngreat blessing unto many by putting words of prayer into their mouths,\r\nand thus teaching them to pray. Many times has my heart gloried within\r\nme while repeating the 'Te Deum Laudamus,' and especially that part--\r\n\r\n  _Tapu tapu tapu rawa E Ihowa te Atua o nga mano tuauriuri whaioio_,\r\n\r\nthat is--\r\n\r\n  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabaoth,\r\n\r\nand hear them respond--\r\n\r\n  _E kiki ana te Rangi me te whenua i te kahanga o tou kororia_\r\n\r\n  Heaven and Earth are full of the majesty of Thy Glory.\r\n\r\n\"I have been informed,\" continued Dr. Beecham, \"by those who have\r\nwitnessed the celebration of public worship in the principal church at\r\nMangungu, that to hear 700 or 800 of the Christian natives correctly\r\nand promptly utter the responses, and then sing the praises of the\r\nTrue God, is highly affecting. Another feature of their character is\r\ntheir strict observance of daily social prayer. At dawn of day all the\r\ninhabitants of the villages assemble together in the chapel at the\r\nsound of the bell, or some piece of metal used as a substitute, to\r\nread the scriptures and to pray. The same order is observed in the\r\nevening. When the evening approaches the whole of the population moves\r\nto the house of God, and close the day with devotions. Their reverence\r\nfor the Sabbath is remarkable. Those who come from a distance to\r\nattend Divine worship at Mangungu do not travel on the Sunday, but on\r\nthe Saturday, and return on the Monday. They refrain from all work on\r\nthe Lord's Day. So strict are their views on the sanctity of the\r\nSabbath they do not even prepare their food on that day. The arrival\r\nof a vessel is always a matter of considerable excitement to the\r\nnatives of New Zealand, but if a vessel arrives on the Sunday no stir\r\nis made.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to find any description quite so touching\r\nconcerning the religious observances of the _Pakehas_, whose\r\nirreverence more than once roused the righteous indignation of the\r\nRev. Mr. Marsden.\r\n\r\nAlthough the British authorities had as yet taken no decisive step\r\ntowards acquiring sovereignty in New Zealand, it cannot be said that\r\nthe state of society in the country had entirely escaped their notice.\r\nEspecially were the successive Governors of New South Wales vigilant\r\nin keeping Ministers posted as to passing events. Many must have been\r\ntheir anxious moments, for they being the nearest representatives of\r\nthe Crown were naturally most solicitous for the conduct and fate of\r\ntheir countrymen. As far back as 1814 Governor Macquarie had declared\r\nNew Zealand to be a part of that colony, and it was thought that the\r\njurisdiction of the Supreme Court had also been extended to this\r\ncountry. These proceedings were, however, almost a nullity, for had\r\nthey been formal and constitutional--which they were not--the\r\npractical difficulties in the way of bringing offenders to justice\r\nwere so great that the attempt was only made in a few isolated and\r\nextreme instances.\r\n\r\nThis state of official negation continued until the tidings of the\r\npart played by Captain Stewart and his brig _Elizabeth_ in Te\r\nRauparaha's Akaroa raid reached Sydney. Then Governor Darling and his\r\nsuccessor, Sir Richard Bourke, realised that this game of glorified\r\nbluff could not go on indefinitely. The strongest possible\r\nrepresentations were accordingly made to the Home authorities, and\r\nthese representations were followed by a pathetic petition from the\r\nnatives to King William IV., which was transmitted to Sir Richard\r\nBourke through Mr. Yate, one of the principal members of the Church\r\nMissionary Society's staff then labouring in the colony.\r\n\r\nThe leading chiefs of the northern part of the Islands had long ere\r\nthis realised the ineffectiveness of their tribal system to cope with\r\nthe altered state of society. The Missionaries on their part watched\r\nwith anxiety the unhappy trend of affairs, knowing that if some more\r\nenlightened course was not given to events, a serious collision would\r\nin all probability arise between the two races, which could scarcely\r\nterminate otherwise than in the extermination or expulsion of the one\r\nor the other.\r\n\r\nBeing fully persuaded that to maintain the chiefs and their tribes as\r\nan independent people was the most effective safeguard against foreign\r\naggression, they saw with deepest regret the intestine warfare which\r\nwas going on amongst the natives, thinning their ranks, and rendering\r\nthem every day less able to resist the pretensions of a foreign power.\r\nStung by a sense of failure, and excited by a rumour that the French\r\nwere at hand, the chiefs placed themselves under Missionary direction\r\nand addressed themselves to the King in the following diplomatic\r\nterms[7]:--\r\n\r\n\r\n TO KING WILLIAM, THE GRACIOUS CHIEF OF ENGLAND\r\n\r\n KING WILLIAM--We, the chiefs of New Zealand assembled at\r\n this place, called the Kerikeri, write to thee, for we hear that thou\r\n art the great Chief of the other side of the water, since the many\r\n ships which come to our land are from thee.\r\n\r\n We are a people without possessions. We have nothing but timber,\r\n flax, pork and potatoes, we sell these things, however, to your\r\n people, and then we see the property of Europeans. It is only thy\r\n land which is liberal towards us. From thee also come the\r\n Missionaries who teach us to believe on Jehovah God, and on Jesus\r\n Christ His Son.\r\n\r\n We have heard that the tribe of Marian[8] is at hand coming to take\r\n away our land, therefore we pray thee to become our friend and\r\n guardian of these Islands, lest through the teazing of other tribes\r\n should come war to us, and lest strangers should come and take away\r\n our land. And if any of thy people should be troublesome or vicious\r\n towards us (for some persons are living here who have run away from\r\n ships), we pray thee to be angry with them that they may be obedient,\r\n lest the anger of the people of this land fall upon them.\r\n\r\n This letter is from us the chiefs of the natives of New Zealand:\r\n\r\n  WARERAHI, chief of Paroa.\r\n  REWA,         \"    Waimate.\r\n  PATUONE,      \"    Hokianga.\r\n  NĒNE,      \"    Hokianga.\r\n  KEKEAO,       \"    Ahuahu.\r\n  TITORE,       \"    Kororareka.\r\n  TAMARANGA,    \"    Taiamai.\r\n  RIPE,         \"    Mapere.\r\n  HARA,         \"    Ohaeawai.\r\n  ATUAHAERE,    \"    Kaikohe.\r\n  MOETARA,      \"    Pakanae.\r\n  MATANGI,      \"    Waima.\r\n  TAUNUI,       \"    Utakura.\r\n\r\nThe accumulating reports of increasing disorder, the strenuous\r\nrecommendations of Governor Bourke, added to the touching appeal of\r\nthe chiefs, at length moved the Colonial Office to acquiesce in the\r\ncontention that some one should be sent to New Zealand directly\r\ncharged with the duty of representing the British Crown. In replying\r\nto the Native petition, Lord Goderich,[9] who was then at the Colonial\r\nOffice, after expressing the gratification the petition had afforded\r\nthe King, accordingly intimated that it had been decided to appoint as\r\nBritish Resident Mr. James Busby, whose duty it would be to\r\ninvestigate all complaints which might be made to him. \"It will also\r\nbe his endeavour,\" wrote his Lordship, \"to prevent the arrival amongst\r\nyou of men who have been guilty of crimes in their own country, and\r\nwho may effect their escape from the place to which they have been\r\nbanished, as likewise to apprehend such persons of this description\r\nwho may be found at present at large. In return for the anxious desire\r\nwhich will be manifested by the British Resident to afford his\r\nprotection to the inhabitants of New Zealand, against any acts of\r\noutrage which may be attempted against them by British subjects, it is\r\nconfidently expected by His Majesty that on your part you will render\r\nto the British Resident that assistance and support which are\r\ncalculated to promote the objects of his appointment, and to extend to\r\nyour country all the benefits which it is capable of receiving from\r\nits friendship and alliance with Great Britain.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Busby, who had thus been chosen for the responsible task of\r\nguarding both British and Native interests, was the son of a\r\nsuccessful civil engineer in Australia, but it is doubtful whether he\r\nhad passed through the administrative experience necessary to fit him\r\nin all respects for his arduous post.[10] His position was rendered\r\nstill more difficult by reason of the fact that, much as Ministers\r\nmight have wished to do so, it had been found impossible to sweep away\r\nthe constitutional difficulties which faced them on every side. Indeed\r\nso hampered was the situation by the circumstance that Britain had not\r\nacquired, or claimed Sovereign rights in New Zealand, that when\r\nGovernor Bourke came to direct Mr. Busby upon the scope of his office,\r\nhe was compelled to lay greater stress upon the things he could not\r\ndo, than upon the powers he was at liberty to exercise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUSSELL.\r\n\r\nFormerly Kororareka.]\r\n\r\nMr. Busby was instructed to leave Sydney by H.M.S. _Imogene_,\r\ncommanded by Captain Blackwood, and on arrival at the Bay of Islands\r\nhe was to present to the chiefs the King's reply to their petition,\r\n\"with as much formality as circumstances may permit.\" This instruction\r\nMr. Busby used his best endeavours to obey, for after a stormy passage\r\nacross the Tasman Sea he reached the Bay of Islands on Sunday, May 5,\r\n1833. Here he at once made arrangements with the settlers and\r\nMissionaries to invest his landing with an importance which was its\r\ndue; but continued storms made it impossible to perform any kind of\r\nopen-air ceremony with comfort and dignity until the 17th. On that\r\nday, however, the weather had moderated, and at an early hour\r\npreparations were afoot for the inevitable feast, a proclivity to\r\nwhich both Maori and European appear equally addicted. At a later hour\r\nMr. Busby, accompanied by the first lieutenant of the _Imogene_,\r\nlanded under a salute of seven guns, and no sooner had he set foot on\r\nshore than he was claimed by the old chief, Tohitapu, as his\r\n_Pakeha_. A cordial greeting awaited the Resident by the\r\nMissionaries, to whose village at Paihia, but a short distance off,\r\nthe party at once adjourned. Here three hoary-headed chiefs delivered\r\nspeeches of welcome, a _haka_ was danced, and still more speeches were\r\nmade in honour of a stranger whose coming was regarded as the event of\r\nfirst importance since the landing of Samuel Marsden seventeen years\r\nbefore. With these evidences of native hospitality at an end, the\r\nformal proceedings were commenced in front of the little mission\r\nchapel round which the people crowded in motley throng, shouting songs\r\nof welcome, and discharging fitful volleys of musketry. By dint of\r\nlively exertion order was at length restored, and standing at a table,\r\nwith Captain Blackwood on his right and Mr. Henry Williams, who\r\ninterpreted, on his left, Mr. Busby read the King's reply to the\r\npeople's Petition for protection. The reading of this document was\r\nlistened to with profound respect by the Europeans, who rose and\r\nuncovered their heads, while the natives hung upon the words of Mr.\r\nWilliams as he explained the professions of the King's good-will, of\r\nthe sincerity of which Mr. Busby was a living evidence. Then followed\r\nMr. Busby's own address, which was listened to by the wondering crowd\r\nwith no less rapt attention:\r\n\r\n MY FRIENDS--You will perceive by the letter which I have\r\n been honoured with the commands of the King of Great Britain to\r\n deliver to you, that it is His Majesty's most anxious wish that the\r\n most friendly feeling should subsist between his subjects and\r\n yourselves, and how much he regrets that you should have cause to\r\n complain of the conduct of any of his subjects. To foster and\r\n maintain this friendly feeling, to prevent as much as possible the\r\n recurrence of those misunderstandings and quarrels which have\r\n unfortunately taken place, and to give a greater assurance of safety\r\n and just dealing both to his own subjects and the people of New\r\n Zealand in their commercial transactions with each other, these are\r\n the purposes for which His Majesty has sent me to reside amongst you,\r\n and I hope and trust that when any opportunities of doing a service\r\n to the people of this country shall arise I shall be able to prove to\r\n you how much it is my own desire to be the friend of those amongst\r\n whom I am come to reside. It is the custom of His Majesty the King of\r\n Great Britain to send one or more of his servants to reside as his\r\n representatives in all those countries in Europe and America with\r\n which he is on terms of friendship, and in sending one of his\r\n servants to reside amongst the chiefs of New Zealand, they ought to\r\n be sensible not only of the advantages which will result to the\r\n people of New Zealand by extending their commercial intercourse with\r\n the people of England, but of the honour the King of a great and\r\n powerful nation like Great Britain has done their country in adopting\r\n it into the number of those countries with which he is in friendship\r\n and alliance. I am, however, commanded to inform you that in every\r\n country to which His Majesty sends his servants to reside as his\r\n representatives, their persons and their families, and all that\r\n belongs to them are considered sacred. Their duty is the cultivation\r\n of peace and friendship and goodwill, and not only the King of Great\r\n Britain, but the whole civilised world would resent any violence\r\n which his representative might suffer in any of the countries to\r\n which they are sent to reside in his name. I have heard that the\r\n chiefs and people of New Zealand have proved the faithful friends of\r\n those who have come among them to do them good, and I therefore trust\r\n myself to their protection and friendship with confidence. All good\r\n Englishmen are desirous that the New Zealanders should be a rich and\r\n happy people, and it is my wish when I shall have erected my house\r\n that all the chiefs will come and visit me and be my friends. We will\r\n then consult together by what means they can make their country a\r\n flourishing country, and their people a rich and wise people like the\r\n people of Great Britain. At one time Great Britain differed but\r\n little from what New Zealand is now. The people had no large houses\r\n nor good clothing nor good food. They painted their bodies and\r\n clothed themselves with the skins of wild beasts; every chief went to\r\n war with his neighbour, and the people perished in the wars of their\r\n chiefs even as the people of New Zealand do now. But after God sent\r\n His Son into the world to teach mankind that all the tribes of the\r\n earth are brethren, and that they ought not to hate and destroy, but\r\n to love and do good to one another, and when the people of England\r\n learned His words of wisdom, they ceased to go to war against each\r\n other, and all the tribes became one people. The peaceful inhabitants\r\n of the country began to build large houses because there was no enemy\r\n to pull them down. They cultivated their land and had abundance of\r\n bread, because no hostile tribe entered into their fields to destroy\r\n the fruit of their labours. They increased the numbers of their\r\n cattle because no one came to drive them away. They also became\r\n industrious and rich, and had all good things they desired. Do you\r\n then, O chiefs and tribes of New Zealand, desire to become like the\r\n people of England? Listen first to the Word of God which He has put\r\n into the hearts of His servants the missionaries to come here and\r\n teach you. Learn that it is the will of God that you should all love\r\n each other as brethren, and when wars shall cease among you then\r\n shall your country flourish. Instead of the roots of the fern you\r\n shall eat bread, because the land shall be tilled without fear, and\r\n its fruits shall be eaten in peace. When there is an abundance of\r\n bread we shall labour to preserve flax and timber and provisions for\r\n the ships which come to trade, and the ships that come to trade will\r\n bring clothing and all other things which you desire. Thus you become\r\n rich, for there are no riches without labour, and men will not labour\r\n unless there is peace, that they may enjoy the fruits of their\r\n labour.\r\n\r\nThe Resident's address was received with an outburst of wild applause,\r\nand soon the smoke of discharging muskets again hung heavy on the\r\nmorning air. But there was still other diversion for the natives, to\r\nwhom the proceedings had proved a great novelty. The mental feast\r\nwhich was to provide them with food for discussion for many days was\r\nnow supplanted by a more material repast, at which fifty settlers were\r\nentertained at Mr. Williams's house, while the Maoris were fed with a\r\nsumptuousness that made memorable to them the coming and the\r\ninstallation of the first British Resident.\r\n\r\nAs an adjunct to his slender authority, Mr. Busby had been informed by\r\nGovernor Bourke that Sir John Gore, the Vice-Admiral commanding the\r\nIndian Squadron of the Navy, would be instructed to permit his ships\r\nto call in at New Zealand ports as frequently as possible, and offer\r\nhim what support they could during these fitful visits. But upon\r\nneither naval nor civil power was Mr. Busby to rely overmuch. He was\r\nto depend for his authority rather upon his moral influence and his\r\nco-operation with the Missionaries, to whom he went specially\r\naccredited.\r\n\r\nMr. Busby has frequently been made the butt of the humorist, because\r\nhis bark was necessarily worse than his bite. The Maori cynic of his\r\nday chuckled as he dubbed him \"_He manuwa pu kore_\" (\"A\r\nman-of-war without guns\"), and many a playful jest has since been made\r\nat his expense, all of which is both unfair and ungenerous to Mr.\r\nBusby. The difficulty in the way of investing him with legal power was\r\nthus tersely explained by Sir Richard Bourke during the course of his\r\ninitial instructions to the Resident:\r\n\r\n You are aware that you cannot be clothed with any legal power or\r\n jurisdiction, by virtue of which you might be enabled to arrest\r\n British subjects offending against British or Colonial law in New\r\n Zealand. It was proposed to supply this want of power and to provide\r\n further enforcement of the criminal law as it exists amongst\r\n ourselves, and further to adapt it to the new and peculiar exigencies\r\n of the country to which you are going, by means of a Colonial Act of\r\n Council grafted on a statute of the Imperial Parliament.\r\n Circumstances which I am not at present competent to explain have\r\n prevented the enactment of the Statute in question.[11] You can\r\n therefore rely but little on the force of law, and must lay the\r\n foundation of your measures upon the influence which you shall obtain\r\n over the Native Chiefs. Something, however, may be effected under the\r\n law as it stands at present. By the 9th Geo. IV., cap. 83, sec. A,\r\n the Supreme Courts of N. S. Wales and Van Dieman's Land have power to\r\n enquire of, hear and determine, all offences committed in N.Z. by the\r\n Master and crew of any British ship or vessel, or by any British\r\n subject living there, and persons convicted of such offences may be\r\n punished as if the offence has been committed in England.... If\r\n therefore you should at any time have the means of sending to this\r\n colony any one or more persons capable of lodging an information\r\n before the proper authorities here, of an offence committed in N.Z.\r\n you will, if you think the case of sufficient magnitude and\r\n importance, send a detailed report of the transaction to the Colonial\r\n Secretary by such persons who will be required to depose to the facts\r\n sufficient to support an information upon which a bench Warrant may\r\n be obtained from the Supreme Court for the apprehension of the\r\n offender, and transmitted to you for execution. You will perceive at\r\n once that this process, which is at best a prolix and inconvenient\r\n operation and may incur some considerable expense, will be totally\r\n useless unless you should have some well-founded expectation of\r\n securing the offender upon or after the arrival of the warrant, and\r\n of being able to effect his conveyance here for trial, and that you\r\n have provided the necessary evidence to ensure his conviction.\r\n\r\nShorn of everything which suggested practical power, except the name\r\nof British Resident, Mr. Busby soon found himself in no very enviable\r\nposition. He was ignored by the whites and laughed at by the natives.\r\nTo add still further to his difficulties he was slow to recognise that\r\nthe Missionaries in the long years of their labour had naturally\r\nacquired more influence with the natives than he could possibly have,\r\nand he was reluctant to achieve his object by appearing to play a\r\nsubordinate part to them. He had been explicitly instructed to seek\r\ntheir hearty co-operation, and take every advantage of the high\r\nrespect in which they were held by the natives. It was not long,\r\nhowever, before he began to develop ideas of his own and to formulate\r\na policy which he could not enforce, because it was at variance with\r\nthat of the Missions.\r\n\r\nHe had also been accredited to the thirteen chiefs who had signed the\r\nmemorial to the King in the previous year, and had been advised to\r\nseek their assistance in arresting those offenders whom he had power\r\nto transmit to Sydney for trial. The number of such persons whom he\r\nmight have apprehended now totalled, we are assured, to several\r\nhundreds; but the process was, as Sir Richard Bourke had suggested, so\r\nobviously \"prolix and inconvenient,\" that Mr. Busby exercised to the\r\nfull the measure of discretion given him by the Governor, and left\r\nthem severely alone.[12]\r\n\r\nAccording to Captain Fitzroy, who visited the Bay of Islands during\r\nthe cruise of H.M.S. _Beagle_ in 1835, he preferred to fold his\r\nhands and allow events to shape their own course. \"He chose to tell\r\nevery one who went to him that he had no authority; that he was not\r\neven allowed to act as a Magistrate, and that he could do nothing. The\r\nconsequence was that whenever anything did occur, those who were\r\naggrieved went to the Missionaries. Mr. Busby might have very\r\nconsiderable power, because the Missionaries have such influence over\r\nthe whole body of natives they could support him. If Mr. Busby wanted\r\na person taken up he had only to express his wish to the Missionaries,\r\nand the natives would have done it for them, but he was slow to act in\r\nthat way. He was sent there in a high character, and was accredited to\r\nthe Missionaries, and had he communicated with them freely and allowed\r\nthem to be cognisant of, if not the agents in all that took place,\r\nwhile he remained as the head, and the understanding had been that\r\nall that the Missionaries did was done in concert with Mr. Busby, and\r\nall that eventuated was from him as the head, his influence would have\r\nbeen far too great for any individuals in that part of the Islands to\r\nresist. By dividing the two influences Mr. Busby lost his power of\r\npreventing mischief. He remained on tolerably good terms with them,\r\nbut separated himself in an unnecessary degree from them, and thought\r\nhe might differ from them sometimes, even to taking a precisely\r\nopposite course of conduct to that which they recommended. The\r\nconsequences were that while the natives retained their opinion of the\r\nMissionaries, they found that the Resident was a nonentity, and that\r\nhe was there to look on and nothing more.\"\r\n\r\nAs illustrating the class of difference which sometimes arose between\r\nthe Resident and the Missionaries, and which must have appreciably\r\nhampered the activities of both, Captain Fitzroy stated to the\r\nCommittee of the House of Lords that when he was at the Bay of Islands\r\nin 1835 there was then a serious difference between the real and the\r\nnominal head of the community, with respect to the stopping or\r\ndiscouraging the sale of ardent spirits. The Missionaries wanted to\r\ncarry into effect a regulation similar to one established in the\r\nSociety Islands, namely, that no spirits should be imported into the\r\ncountry. Mr. Busby would not be a party to such a rule, contending\r\nthat it was an unnecessary measure; while the Missionaries, on the\r\nother hand, were unanimous in declaring it was one of the most useful\r\nprecautions they could take, but no amount of argument could induce\r\nMr. Busby to co-operate with them.[13]\r\n\r\nMr. Busby at all times expressed the most profound respect for the\r\nMissionaries and veneration for their labours. He also cheerfully\r\nacknowledged that if the British Government expected them to accord\r\ntheir influence to its Representative they must be given a specified\r\nshare in the government of the country. But when it came to a point of\r\ndifference, he plainly let it be known that he considered himself\r\npossessed of a sounder judgment than they. After detailing to Governor\r\nBourke a discussion in which he claimed to have got the better of the\r\nMissionaries, he wrote: \"I thought they would naturally conclude in\r\nfuture that it was possible for the conclusions of a single mind, when\r\ndirected to one object, to be more correct than the collective\r\nopinions of many persons whose minds are altogether engrossed with the\r\nmultitude of details which fill up the attention of men, occupied as\r\nthey are, leaving neither leisure nor capacity for more enlarged and\r\ncomprehensive views.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Busby might have said more in fewer words, but he could scarcely\r\nhave depreciated the mental powers of the Missionaries in a more\r\ndelightfully prolix sentence. Skilfully, however, as the sting was\r\nsheathed within a cloud of words, the barb came through, with the not\r\nunnatural result that he had to confess the Missionaries afterwards\r\nneither respected his opinions nor appeared anxious to co-operate with\r\nhim in what he described as \"the furtherance of matters connected with\r\nthe King's service in this country.\"\r\n\r\nThough severely handicapped by his inability to coordinate his ideas\r\nwith those of the Missionaries, or to sink his individuality before\r\ntheirs, it does not follow that Mr. Busby was entirely idle. He lent\r\nhimself with considerable industry to the task of placing the\r\nshipping of the country upon a basis more satisfactory than it had up\r\nto that time been. At the date of his arrival there were a number of\r\nNew Zealand owned craft trading on our coasts, and several vessels\r\nwere building on the Hokianga River. Sailing as these vessels were\r\nunder no recognised register, and without the protection of the\r\nBritish ensign, which they were prohibited from hoisting, they were\r\nliable to seizure at any time by any enterprising pirate.[14] Equally\r\nimpossible was it for these owners to register their craft in New\r\nZealand, for there was as yet no acknowledged flag of the nation.\r\n\r\nThese facts were made the subject of representation by Mr. Busby to\r\nthe Governor of New South Wales, who accorded a hearty approval to his\r\nsuggestion that the commerce of the country warranted some protection\r\nof this nature. Flags of three separate designs were accordingly\r\nentrusted to Captain Lambert of H.M.S. _Alligator_, who brought\r\nthem from Sydney and submitted them to the chiefs for approval.\r\n\r\nThis event took place at Waitangi, on March 20, 1834, the natives\r\nhaving been gathered from all the surrounding _pas_ into a large\r\nmarquee erected in front of the British Residency, and gaily decorated\r\nwith flags from the _Alligator_. Wisely or unwisely the\r\nproceedings were not conducted upon the democratic basis of our\r\npresent-day politics; for upon some principle which has not been made\r\nclear the tent was divided by a barrier into two areas, into one of\r\nwhich only the _rangatiras_ were admitted, and to them the right\r\nof selection was confined. No debate was permitted, but Mr. Busby read\r\nto the chiefs a speech in which he dwelt upon the advantages to be\r\nanticipated from the adoption of a national flag, and then invited\r\nthem to take a vote for the choice of design.\r\n\r\nThis mode of procedure created considerable dissatisfaction amongst\r\nthe plutocracy of the tribes, who resented the doubtful privilege of\r\nbeing permitted to look on without the consequential right to\r\nexercise their voice. The stifling of discussion also tended to breed\r\ndistrust in the minds of some of the chiefs, to whom the settlement of\r\nso important a matter without a _korero_[15] was a suspicious\r\ninnovation. Two of the head men declined to record their votes,\r\nbelieving that under a ceremony conducted in such a manner there must\r\nbe concealed some sinister motive. Despite these protests, the British\r\nResident and Captain Lambert had their way, and at the conclusion of\r\nMr. Busby's address, the flags were displayed and the electors invited\r\nto vote. The great warrior chief Hongi, acting as poll-clerk, took\r\ndown in writing the preference of each chief. Twelve votes were\r\nrecorded for the most popular ensign, ten for the next in favour, and\r\nsix only for the third. It was then found that the choice of the\r\nmajority had fallen upon the flag with a white ground divided by St.\r\nGeorge's Cross, the upper quarter of which was again divided by St.\r\nGeorge's cross, a white star on a blue field appearing in each of the\r\nsmaller squares.[16]\r\n\r\nThe election over, the rejected flags were close furled, and the\r\nselected ensign flung out to the breeze beside the Union Jack of Old\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIn the name of the chiefs Mr. Busby declared the ensign to be the\r\nnational flag of New Zealand. As the symbol of the new-born nation was\r\nrun up upon the halyards, it was received with a salute of twenty-one\r\nguns from the warship _Alligator_, and by cheers from her\r\nofficers and the goodly crowd of sailors, settlers, and Missionaries\r\nwho had assembled to participate in the ceremony.\r\n\r\nAs is usual with most such functions where Britons are concerned, the\r\nevent was celebrated by a feast. The Europeans were regaled at a cold\r\nluncheon at Mr. Busby's house, while the Maoris had pork, potatoes,\r\nand _kororirori_[17] served upon the lawn in front of the Residency,\r\nwhich delicacies they devoured _sans_ knives _sans_ forks.\r\n\r\nThese proceedings subsequently received on behalf of the British\r\nGovernment the entire approbation of Lord Aberdeen;[18] and the\r\ncountenance thus lent to what at the time was regarded as no more than\r\na protection to the commerce of the country was discovered to have a\r\nmost important bearing upon the question of Britain's sovereignty over\r\nthese islands.\r\n\r\nThough Mr. Busby found himself destitute of legal power or military\r\nforce to make good his authority, and equally lacking in the tact\r\nnecessary to secure by policy what he could not achieve by any other\r\nmeans, he was sincerely and even enthusiastically loyal to the main\r\nprinciple underlying his office--the preservation of British\r\ninterests. Thus when the tidings came that Baron de Thierry intended\r\nto set up his kingdom at Hokianga, he took immediate and, as far as\r\nlay in his power, effective steps to defeat what he regarded as a\r\nwanton piece of French aggression.\r\n\r\nBaron de Thierry was not a Frenchman in the narrow sense of the term,\r\nand his foreign associations were more imaginary than real. He was the\r\nson of a French noble refugee who had fled his country and had resided\r\nin England for many years. The Baron had been educated at Cambridge,\r\nhad acquired English sympathies, and had been an officer in the 23rd\r\nLancers, so that he was in sentiment if not by birth a subject of the\r\nKing. When Hongi, the great Nga-Puhi chief, visited Cambridge in\r\ncompany with his compatriot Waikato and Mr. Kendall, to assist\r\nProfessor Lee in the compilation of the Maori vocabulary, the Baron\r\nmet the warrior chief, and became fired with the romance of the\r\nPacific. There was much that was quixotic in his scheme of becoming a\r\npotentate amongst the savages of the South Seas, and it is possible it\r\nwas not altogether devoid of benevolence.[19] There is at least reason\r\nto believe that Baron de Thierry had persuaded himself that he also\r\nhad a mission for the uplifting of the benighted, and that when he\r\narranged with Mr. Kendall to purchase him an area of land at Hokianga\r\nwhereon he proposed to set up his \"kingdom,\" he did so more in the\r\nspirit of philanthropy than of mercenary adventure. The area alleged\r\nto be purchased by Mr. Kendall on behalf of the Baron was the\r\nconsiderable one of 40,000 acres, and the price paid was the\r\ninconsiderable one of 36 axes. The transaction was accompanied by the\r\nusual misunderstanding as to the real nature of the deal, the Baron\r\ndeclaring that the axes were payment in full, the natives contending\r\nthey were but a deposit, or at the best payment for a much smaller\r\narea.\r\n\r\nThe chiefs treated his \"sovereign rights and powers\" with undisguised\r\nderision. They disavowed his territorial claims because they were made\r\nregardless of the fundamental principle underlying the Maori law of\r\nproperty--that all the people who have an interest in the land must\r\nconsent to its sale. Subsequently the matter was compromised by Tamati\r\nWaaka Nēne conceding him a small area,[20] to which he retired\r\ndestitute of retainers, and surrounded only by the members of his own\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThe story of the Baron's landing in 1837, with much pomp and\r\ncircumstance, under a salute of twenty-one guns, his dispute regarding\r\nKendall's purchase, his final disappearance into obscurity, are,\r\nhowever, of secondary importance to our purpose. What is of vital\r\ninterest is that the announcement in 1835 of his approaching advent\r\ngalvanised the British Resident and the native chiefs into a state of\r\nanxious activity. Living as they were on the confines of civilisation,\r\ntheir information concerning events outside their own little world was\r\nnecessarily of the scantiest. Their fears were thus often greater than\r\ntheir knowledge of the facts, and so in this emergency they had no\r\ndifficulty in persuading themselves that an invasion by the French was\r\nat hand.\r\n\r\nAs a counterblast, Mr. Busby counselled that the chiefs should\r\nimmediately crystallise the position taken up by Britain--that New\r\nZealand was not a British possession--by unequivocally declaring their\r\nown independence. His policy was approved, and for the purpose of\r\ngiving effect to it, thirty-five chiefs assembled at Mr. Busby's house\r\nat Waitangi, where in the presence of the resident Missionaries and\r\nmerchants they evolved the following declaration,[21] which brought\r\ninto existence the much-questioned and questionable authority known as\r\nThe Confederated Tribes of New Zealand.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to trace the Roman hand of the Resident throughout\r\nthe document, especially as the Maori had no word in their language to\r\nexpress the idea of sovereignty; but it is only just to remark that in\r\na subsequent despatch Mr. Busby drew the attention of Governor Bourke\r\nto the fact that the concluding paragraph, both in language and\r\nsentiment, originated with the chiefs:\r\n\r\n\r\n DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE OF NEW ZEALAND\r\n\r\n (1) We, the hereditary chiefs and head of the tribes of the Northern\r\n parts of New Zealand, being assembled at \"Waitangi\" in the Bay of\r\n Islands on this 28th day of October 1835, declare the independence of\r\n our country, which is hereby constituted and declared to be an\r\n independent state, under the designation of the United tribes of New\r\n Zealand.\r\n\r\n (2) All Sovereign powers and authority within the territories of the\r\n United tribes of New Zealand is hereby declared to reside entirely\r\n and exclusively in the hereditary chiefs and heads of the tribes in\r\n their collective capacity, who also declare that they will not permit\r\n any legislative authority separate from themselves in their\r\n collective capacity to exist, nor any function of Government to be\r\n exercised within the said territories unless by persons appointed by\r\n them and acting under the authority of laws regularly enacted by them\r\n in Congress assembled.\r\n\r\n (3) The hereditary chiefs and heads of the tribes agree to meet in\r\n Congress at Waitangi, in the autumn of each year, for the purpose of\r\n framing laws for the dispensation of justice, the preservation of\r\n peace and good order, and the regulation of trade, and they cordially\r\n invite the Southern tribes to lay aside their private animosities,\r\n and to consult the safety and welfare of our common country by\r\n joining the confederation of the United tribes.\r\n\r\n (4) They also agree to send a copy of this declaration to His Majesty\r\n the King of England, to thank him for his acknowledgment of their\r\n flag, and in return for the friendship and protection they have shown\r\n and are prepared to show to such of his subjects as have settled in\r\n their country, or resorted to its shores for the purpose of trade,\r\n they entreat that he will continue to be the parent of their infant\r\n State, and that he will become its protector from all attempts upon\r\n its independence.\r\n\r\n AGREED unanimously on this 28th day of October 1835 in the\r\n presence of His Britannic Majesty's Resident.\r\n\r\n _English Witnesses_:\r\n\r\n  HENRY WILLIAMS, Missionary C.M.S.\r\n  GEORGE CLARKE,      \"        \"\r\n  JAMES C.

His\r\nintention is founded on an alleged invitation given to him in England\r\nby Shunghee (Hongi) and other chiefs, none of whom as individuals had\r\nany right to the sovereignty of the country, and consequently\r\npossessed no authority to convey a right of sovereignty to another;\r\nalso upon an alleged purchase made for him in 1822 by a Mr. Kendall of\r\nthree districts on the Hokianga River from three chiefs who had only a\r\npartial property in these districts, parts of which are now settled by\r\nBritish subjects by virtue of purchase from the rightful proprietors.\r\nThe British Resident has also seen an elaborate exposition of his\r\nviews which this person has addressed to the Missionaries of the\r\nC.M.S., in which he makes the most ample promises to all persons,\r\nwhether whites or natives, who will accept his invitation to live\r\nunder his Government, and in which he offers a stipulated salary to\r\neach individual in order to induce him to act as his Magistrate. It is\r\nalso supposed he may have made similar communications to other persons\r\nor classes of His Majesty's subjects, who are hereby invited to make\r\nsuch communications, or any information on this subject they may\r\npossess, known to the British Resident or to Lieutenant MacDonnell.\r\nThe British Resident has too much confidence in the loyalty and good\r\nsense of his countrymen to think it necessary to caution them against\r\nturning a favourable ear to such insidious promises. He firmly\r\nbelieves that the paternal protection of the British Government which\r\nhas never failed any of His Majesty's subjects, however remote, will\r\nnot be withheld from them, should it be necessary to prevent their\r\nlives, liberties, or property from being subjected to the caprice of\r\nany adventurer who may choose to make this country, in which British\r\nsubjects have now by the most lawful means acquired so large a stake,\r\nthe theatre of his ambitious projects; nor in the British Resident's\r\nopinion will His Majesty, after acknowledging the sovereignty of the\r\nNew Zealand chiefs in their collective capacity, by the recognition of\r\ntheir flag, permit his humble and confiding allies to be deprived of\r\ntheir independence upon such pretensions. But although the British\r\nResident is of opinion that such an attempt as is now announced must\r\nultimately fail, he nevertheless conceives that if such a person were\r\nonce allowed to obtain a footing in the country, he might acquire\r\nsuch an influence over the simple-minded natives as would produce\r\neffects which could not be too much deprecated, or too anxiously\r\nprovided against, and he has therefore considered it his duty to\r\nrequest the British settlers of all classes to use all the influence\r\nthey possess with the natives of every rank in order to counteract the\r\nefforts of any emissaries who may have arrived or may arrive amongst\r\nthem, and to inspire both chiefs and people with a spirit of the most\r\ndetermined resistance to the landing of a person on their shores who\r\ncomes with the avowed intention of usurping a sovereignty over them.\r\nThe British Resident will take immediate steps for calling together\r\nthe native chiefs in order to inform them of this attempt upon their\r\nindependence, and to advise them of what is due to themselves and to\r\ntheir country, and of the protection which British subjects are\r\nentitled to at their hands, and he has no doubt that such a\r\nmanifestation will be exhibited of the characteristic spirit, courage,\r\nand independence of the New Zealanders, as will stop at the outset\r\nsuch an attempt upon their liberties, by demonstrating its utter\r\nhopelessness.\"\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat difficult to say, in the absence of contemporary\r\nnewspapers, what impression was created in the public mind by the\r\nResident's proclamation or by the native Declaration of Independence,\r\nbut in due course the latter was, in accordance with the unanimous\r\ndesire of the chiefs, \"laid at the feet of His Majesty,\" and in the\r\nfollowing year--so tardy was communication in those days--it was\r\ncourteously, but guardedly acknowledged by Lord Glenelg, who wrote to\r\nGovernor Bourke:\r\n\r\n\"With reference to the desire which the chiefs have expressed on this\r\noccasion, to maintain a good understanding with His Majesty's\r\nsubjects, it will be proper that they be assured, in His Majesty's\r\nname, that he will not fail to avail himself of every opportunity of\r\nshowing his goodwill, and of affording to those chiefs such support\r\nand protection as may be consistent with a due regard to others, and\r\nto the interests of His Majesty's subjects.\"\r\n\r\nLeft to its own devices, the native Confederation was faced with a\r\ntask that proved altogether too exacting for its resources, and it\r\ncannot be claimed for the new authority that it remodelled the\r\nGovernment or reclaimed the dissolute society by which it was\r\nsurrounded. Had it been possible to restrict the intercourse of the\r\nnatives to the Missionaries and the more respectable portion of the\r\nsettlers, they might, combined with the counsels of the Resident, have\r\nbeen speedily induced to form an effective administration amongst\r\nthemselves, and that important stage once reached, they, with their\r\nquick intelligence, might have easily acquired a working knowledge of\r\nthe higher principles of self-government. But thrust as they were in\r\nthe midst of a strangely confused community, any such limitation was\r\nobviously impossible.\r\n\r\nEven if it had been practicable, the irreconcilable differences which\r\nhad sprung up between the Resident and the Missionaries, of which the\r\nnatives were perfectly cognisant, necessarily detracted from the\r\nbeneficial influence which an official in Mr. Busby's position might,\r\nand ought to have wielded.\r\n\r\nThe absence of the physical force which Mr. Busby pined for was\r\nunmistakably against the due observance of the ordinary decencies of\r\nlife, for the people whom Captain Fitzroy had described as\r\n\"ragamuffins,\" and Captain Hobson had still more emphatically\r\ncondemned as \"abandoned ruffians,\" were scarcely likely to be amenable\r\nto anything more gentle than the grip of the handcuff or the probe of\r\nthe bayonet. It was therefore to but little purpose that the\r\nConfederation should pass ordinances which, if not respected, could\r\nnot be enforced.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of the Confederation accumulated with the increase of\r\ntrade and population, both of which were growing rapidly. In the year\r\n1836 no fewer than 93 British, 54 American, and 3 French ships put in\r\nat the Bay of Islands. The irregular settlement of white people at\r\nvarious spots along the coast had increased in like manner, until in\r\nthe early part of 1838 a body of no less than 2000 British subjects\r\nhad taken up their permanent abode in New Zealand. The part these\r\npeople were playing in the scheme of civilisation was still small, if\r\nwe are to accept as accurate the verdict of Dr. G. R. Jameson, who in\r\nhis _Travels in New Zealand_ has taken the responsibility of saying\r\nthat from all he had seen and heard respecting the fixed traders, or\r\nthe casual visitors for trade, it could be affirmed in the most\r\npositive terms that not one of them had ever attempted to teach a\r\nnative to read or write, or to communicate to his mind one ray of\r\nChristian knowledge or of moral rectitude. With a few honourable\r\nexceptions they had been in their intercourse with the natives guided\r\nby one ruling impulse--the love of gain. Their predominant aim was\r\never and always to obtain the greatest possible quantity of pigs,\r\npotatoes, flax, maize, labour, or land in exchange for the smallest\r\npossible amount of tobacco, ammunition, and piece-goods.[23]\r\n\r\nIt was not alone, however, by the criminal taint of a large section of\r\nthe population and this excessive hunger for trade that the seeds of\r\ncontinued anarchy were sown. A new evil was at hand which threatened\r\nto sap the independence of the Maori, and reduce them to a condition\r\nof speedy and abject poverty. This was the land hunger which about\r\nthis time seized the white population of Australia. There the opinion\r\nhad gripped the public mind that under the Declaration of Independence\r\nit would be possible to pursue in New Zealand the schemes of land\r\naggregation which Sir George Gipps had checked in New South Wales.\r\nUnder his new land regulations the price of land in that colony had\r\nbeen raised from 3s. to 12s. per acre, and hearing that large areas\r\nwere to be obtained in New Zealand for less than the proverbial song,\r\nthe speculators swarmed over to the Bay of Islands, and in the year\r\n1837 the land fever in all its phases of \"sharking,\" \"jobbing,\" and\r\nlegitimate purchase literally raged throughout the country. \"What gold\r\nwas to the Spaniard in Mexico the land at this period became to the\r\nEnglish in these islands, and as the warlike aborigines most coveted\r\nthe acquisition of firearms, they divested themselves of their only\r\npossessions in order to obtain those deadly instruments, which,\r\ntogether with ardent spirits, were the most potent means for the\r\ndestruction of their race. Almost every captain of a ship arriving in\r\nSydney exhibited a piece of paper with a tattooed native head rudely\r\ndrawn upon it, which he described as the title-deed of an estate\r\nbought for a few muskets, hatchets, or blankets.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral years elapsed before it was possible to reduce these frenzied\r\nbargains to tabulated form, but during the debate on New Zealand\r\naffairs, which occupied the House of Commons for three days in 1845,\r\nthe representative for Westminster, the Hon. Captain Rous, R.N., put\r\nforward the following startling figures as authentic. A Mr. Webster,\r\nan American, he said, claimed to have purchased forty miles of\r\nfrontage on the west side of the river Piako;[24] a Mr. Painham\r\nclaimed nearly the whole of the north coast of the Northern Island.\r\nMr. Wentworth of New South Wales asserted his right to 20,100,000\r\nacres in the Middle Island; Catlin & Co. to 7,000,000; Weller & Co. to\r\n3,557,000; Jones & Co. to 1,930,000; Peacock & Co. to 1,450,000; Green\r\n& Co. to 1,377,000; Guard & Co. to 1,200,000, and the New Zealand\r\nCompany to 20,000,000.\r\n\r\nYet another authority has stated that the whole of the South Island\r\nwas claimed by a Company consisting of four gentlemen, in consideration\r\nof giving the chiefs a few hundred pounds in money and merchandise,\r\nand a life annuity of £100.[25] Another individual, representing a\r\ncommercial firm in Sydney, claimed several hundred thousand acres,\r\nincluding the township of Auckland, for which he paid as compensation\r\none keg of gunpowder. The island of Kapiti was claimed by five\r\ndifferent parties, each declaring they had purchased it, but each\r\nnaming a different price. Some alleged they had paid £100, others\r\ngoods to the value of £30, and so on, the only point of unanimity\r\nbeing that they were each able to produce something that resembled the\r\nsignatures of Te Rauparaha or Te Rangihaeata.\r\n\r\nIn much the same way the district round Porirua was claimed by eight\r\nseparate parties, each contending that Te Rauparaha had sold to them,\r\nand to them alone. Cooper, Holt & Rhodes of Sydney asserted they had\r\npaid merchandise to the value of £150 for a tract of country between\r\nthe Otaki and Waikanae Rivers, running in an easterly direction forty\r\nmiles from the mouth of the river, thirty miles in another direction,\r\nand ten miles along the coast. Mr. John Hughes, also of Sydney,\r\nclaimed in part all the lands of Porirua for a distance of thirty\r\nmiles, bounded by the sea on the one hand, and by the Tararua Range on\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nIn the general censure which followed upon the disclosure of these\r\nunseemly proceedings the Missionaries did not escape criticism, and\r\nare still, at times, subject to severest strictures on this question,\r\nas it affects public morals. Unjust as these strictures frequently are\r\nthe purchase from Hongi, in 1819, of 13,000 acres at Kirikiri for\r\nforty-eight axes, by the Rev. Samuel Marsden,[26] was one amongst\r\nother transactions which on the face of it seems to leave room for the\r\ngravest enquiry as to its propriety.[27]\r\n\r\nIf the Confederation of chiefs had been helpless in the face of social\r\ndisorder, it was still more impotent to cope with the inroads of the\r\nspeculator. The greed for land on the part of the _Pakeha_, and the\r\nhunger for muskets on that of the Maori, rendered futile all attempts\r\nto control the traffic by an already effete administration. The need\r\nfor a wider application of authority and efficient Government at\r\nlength found voice in a petition which was submitted to the King by\r\nthe law-abiding settlers at Kororareka. The settlers, catechists, and\r\nMissionaries to the number of one hundred and ninety-two, headed by\r\nthe Rev. Henry Williams, Chairman of the Church Mission, joined in the\r\nplea for protection.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of their representations they made it clear that the\r\nattempt to evolve order out of chaos had utterly failed; that the\r\nConfederation of Chiefs was impotent in the face of existing evils;\r\nand, praying that His Majesty would graciously regard the peculiarity\r\nof their position, asked that he would afford them such relief as to\r\nhim seemed most expedient.\r\n\r\n\r\n TO THE KING'S MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY\r\n\r\n SIRE--May it please Your Majesty to allow your faithful and\r\n loyal subjects at present residing in New Zealand to approach the\r\n throne, and crave your condescending attention to their petition\r\n which is called forth by their peculiar situation.\r\n\r\n The present crisis of the threatened usurpation of power over New\r\n Zealand by Baron Charles de Thierry, the particulars of which have\r\n been forwarded to Your Majesty's Government by James Busby, Esquire,\r\n the British Resident, strongly urges us to make known our fears and\r\n apprehensions for ourselves and families, and the people amongst whom\r\n we dwell.\r\n\r\n Your humble Petitioners would advert to the serious evils and\r\n perplexing grievances which surround and await them arising for the\r\n most part, if not entirely from some of Your Majesty's subjects, who\r\n fearlessly commit all kinds of depredations upon other of Your\r\n Majesty's subjects who are peaceably disposed. British property in\r\n vessels, as well as on shore, is exposed without redress to every\r\n imaginable risk and plunder, which may be traced to the want of a\r\n power in the land to check and control evils, and preserve order\r\n amongst Your Majesty's subjects.\r\n\r\n Your Petitioners are aware that it is not the desire of Your Majesty\r\n to extend the colonies of Great Britain, but they would call Your\r\n Majesty's attention to the circumstance of several of Your Majesty's\r\n subjects having resided for more than twenty years past, since which\r\n their numbers have accumulated to more than five hundred, north of\r\n the River Thames alone, many of whom are heads of families. The\r\n frequent arrival of persons from England and the adjacent colonies is\r\n a fruitful source of further augmentation. Your Petitioners would\r\n therefore humbly call Your Majesty's attention to the fact that there\r\n is at present a considerable body of Your Majesty's subjects\r\n established in this Island, and that owing to the salubrity of the\r\n climate there is every reason to anticipate a rapidly rising colony\r\n of British subjects. Should this colony continue to advance, no doubt\r\n means would be devised whereby many of its internal expenses would be\r\n met as in other countries. There are numbers of land-holders, and the\r\n Kouri (Kauri) forests have become, for the most part, the private\r\n property of Your Majesty's subjects.\r\n\r\n Your humble Petitioners would also entreat Your Majesty's attention\r\n to the important circumstance that the Bay of Islands has long been\r\n the resort of ships employed in the South Sea fishery and the\r\n Merchant Service, and is in itself a most noble anchorage for all\r\n classes of vessels, and is further highly important in affording\r\n supplies and refreshment to shipping. There are also several other\r\n harbours and anchorage of material importance to the shipping\r\n interests in situations where British subjects have possessions and\r\n property to a large amount. The number of arrivals of vessels in the\r\n Bay of Islands during the last three years has been considerably on\r\n the increase. At one period thirty-six were at anchor, and in the\r\n course of six months ending June 1836 no less than one hundred and\r\n one vessels visited the Bay.\r\n\r\n Your Petitioners would further state that since the increase of the\r\n European population several evils have been growing upon them. The\r\n crews of vessels have frequently been descryed on shore, to the great\r\n detriment of trade, and numberless robberies have been committed on\r\n shipboard and on shore by a lawless band of Europeans, who have not\r\n even scrupled to use firearms to support them in their depredations.\r\n Your humble Petitioners seriously lament that when complaints have\r\n been made to the British Resident of these acts of outrage, he has\r\n expressed his deep regret that he has not yet been furnished with\r\n authority and power to act, not even the authority of a civil\r\n Magistrate to administer an affidavit.\r\n\r\n Your humble Petitioners express with much concern their conviction\r\n that unless Your Majesty's fostering care be extended towards them,\r\n they can only anticipate that both Your Majesty's subjects and also\r\n the aborigines of this land will be liable in an increased degree to\r\n murders, robberies, and every kind of evil.\r\n\r\n Your Petitioners would observe that it has been considered that the\r\n confederate tribes of New Zealand were competent to enact laws for\r\n the proper Government of this land, whereby protection would be\r\n afforded in all cases of necessity; but experience evidently shows\r\n that in the infant state of the country this cannot be accomplished\r\n or expected. It is acknowledged by the chiefs themselves to be\r\n impracticable. Your Petitioners therefore feel persuaded that\r\n considerable time must elapse before the chiefs of this land can be\r\n capable of exercising the duties of an independent Government.\r\n\r\n Your Petitioners would therefore pray that Your Majesty may\r\n graciously regard the peculiarity of their situation, and afford that\r\n relief which may appear most expedient to Your Majesty.\r\n\r\n Relying upon Your Majesty's wisdom and clemency we shall ever pray\r\n Almighty God to behold with favour and preserve our Gracious\r\n Sovereign.\r\n\r\n[1] On one occasion when Lord John Russell was asked by a French\r\nDiplomat how much of Australia Britain claimed, he promptly replied,\r\n\"The whole of it.\"\r\n\r\n[2] As indicating the state into which society had fallen it may be\r\nmentioned that one Master of a trading vessel who had no muskets to\r\nsell, gave a chief a packet of corrosive sublimate wherewith to\r\ndestroy his enemies. To correct this condition of affairs a\r\nproclamation was published in the New South Wales Government\r\n_Gazette_ in 1814 appointing the Rev.

To show that these fears were not altogether unfounded, it may\r\nbe mentioned that the French ship _La Favourite_ anchored in the\r\nBay of Islands the day after the petition was signed.\r\n\r\n[9] He afterwards became Earl of Ripon.\r\n\r\n[10] Mr. Busby's father had been appointed in 1823 as a Mineral\r\nSurveyor and Civil Engineer for the colony of New South Wales, by Earl\r\nBathurst, and Mr. Busby accompanied him as a settler, taking with him\r\ncapital to the extent of about £1000. At the time of his appointment\r\nMr. Busby was Collector of Internal Revenue and a Member of the Land\r\nBoard of New South Wales.\r\n\r\n[11] The Bill was not passed, because it was found that Parliament was\r\nlegislating in a \"foreign country,\" and this it has no power to do.\r\n\r\n[12] Mr. Busby's difficulties in this connection were considerably\r\nincreased by the fact that when British subjects were accused they\r\nfrequently sheltered themselves under the American flag, saying, \"We\r\nare Americans, you have no right to interfere with us.\"--Captain\r\nFitzroy.\r\n\r\n[13] \"After ardent spirits were introduced in the neighbourhood of\r\nHokianga the Christian natives themselves became so sensible of the\r\nevils resulting from the use of them, that under the influence of the\r\nMissionaries the chiefs assembled and agreed to certain regulations,\r\nthe effect of which was to prohibit the introduction and sale of\r\nardent spirits. Those regulations received the sanction of the\r\nGovernor of New South Wales, and were for a time partially carried\r\ninto effect. Our Missionaries have transmitted a copy of the\r\nresolutions adopted at a meeting of the natives at Hokianga for the\r\nformation of a Temperance Society. Those resolutions were signed by\r\nfifteen native chiefs. One chief who was present declined for a time,\r\nbut at length he agreed, and also signed them. Another chief remarked\r\nthat it would be desirable that wine and porter should also be\r\nprohibited, for if they were allowed the English would say when the\r\nrum casks came that they were wine and porter, and by that means\r\nspirits would continue to be smuggled into the river.

The Doctor favoured the one ultimately chosen, and Hau\r\n\"having discovered how my taste lay, paid me the compliment of\r\nadopting it, and canvassed others for their votes also.\" This\r\ninfluence in all probability decided the election. After cession of\r\nsovereignty to the Queen in 1840 this flag was of course superseded by\r\nthe Union Jack as a National ensign. It was then adopted by the Shaw\r\nSavill & Albion Shipping Company, and is now flown by them as their\r\nhouse flag.\r\n\r\n[17] _Kororirori_ was a mixture of flour and water, sweetened\r\nwith sugar, of which the natives had become very fond.

Pomare, who was a great stickler for etiquette, was\r\noffended because he thought he had not been properly invited, and took\r\nthis method of showing his displeasure.

Both the House of Lords and the House of\r\nCommons had entered upon exhaustive enquiries into the subject. The\r\nformer had reported that the responsibility of extending the colonial\r\npossessions of the Crown was one that rested solely with the\r\nGovernment, while the latter had declared in spirited terms that\r\n\"however pressing the nation's need for a vigorous emigration policy,\r\nand whatever action the Government might take to meet that need by\r\nfinding a soil to which its surplus population might retreat, the\r\nHouse would tolerate no scheme which implied violence or fraud in\r\ntaking possession of such territory.\" The reference to \"surplus\r\npopulation\" in the House of Commons' report introduces a new factor\r\ninto the problem. It indicates internal as well as external pressure;\r\nit tells of clamour from the teeming cities, and a rural population\r\ndiscontented with their lot. It suggests that the nation's mind had\r\nmoved faster than the politicians, and that already many of England's\r\nartisans were seeking to escape to some new country where they might\r\nlive under freer conditions. The popular theory of the political\r\neconomists of those days was \"over population,\" and the panacea for\r\nthe existing national poverty was emigration. In spite of the fact\r\nthat people are the most precious asset a country can ever have, both\r\ndoctrines found much favour with the different sections of the\r\ncommunity whose interest they seemed best to serve; the spirit of\r\ncolonisation had got into the air, and the question of finding new\r\nfields for the energies of the \"surplus\" people became a practical\r\nissue which no Government could afford to ignore. The necessity for\r\ndoing something appeared impossible of evasion. Poverty at home and\r\ncrime unchecked abroad clamoured for redress, but just what to do, or\r\nhow to do it, was not easy of decision.\r\n\r\nSir Richard Bourke had told the Government in plainest terms that\r\nunless they were prepared to give the British Resident more power, and\r\npermanently station a ship of war on the coast to support him, it\r\nwould be more in keeping with the dignity of the nation to withdraw\r\nhim altogether. To give him more power was an impossibility, unless\r\nthe Government was prepared to violate the express injunction of the\r\nHouse of Commons and all the precedents by which they had acknowledged\r\nthe independence of the Maoris. It was therefore not practicable to\r\nsupply the existing deficiency by extending the jurisdiction of Mr.\r\nBusby.\r\n\r\nIn their dilemma the Ministers turned for light and leading to the\r\ncomparatively few people then in England who had previous experience\r\nof these far-away islands. Amongst these was Captain Hobson, who in\r\n1837 had been sent over in H.M.S. _Rattlesnake_ pell-mell to\r\nrender what aid he could to British shipping and British interests\r\ngenerally, on news reaching Sydney of serious hostilities between two\r\nof the northern tribes.[28] Captain Hobson had on his return furnished\r\nthe Governor with a report upon the condition of affairs as he found\r\nthem at the settlements he had visited. He had also entered into the\r\ndiscussion of a scheme for the future government of the country, in\r\nwhich he favoured proceeding upon the plan of the Hudson Bay and East\r\nIndia Companies by establishing trading factories in different parts\r\nof the islands, and so fulfilling what he urged had become a solemn\r\nduty to apply a remedy for a growing evil. \"It has occurred to me,\" he\r\nwrote, \"that if factories were established at the Bay of Islands, at\r\nCloudy Bay, and Hokianga, and in other places as the occupation by\r\nBritish subjects proceeds, a sufficient restraint could be\r\nconstitutionally imposed on the licentious whites, without exciting\r\nthe jealousy of the New Zealanders or of any other power. I will not\r\npresume to enter too deeply into the details of such a measure, but\r\nbeg simply to suggest that sections of land be purchased, enclosed,\r\nand placed within the influence of British jurisdiction as\r\ndependencies of this (New South Wales) colony. The heads of factories\r\nshould be Magistrates, and the chief factor should, in addition, be\r\naccredited to the united chiefs of New Zealand as a political agent\r\nand consul. All communications with the British Government should take\r\nplace through the chief factor, with whom alone the local factors\r\nshould correspond. All British subjects should be required to register\r\nthemselves and their landed property at the factories. Two or more\r\nrespectable British residents nearest to each station should hold\r\nCommissions of the Peace to assist the factors. Prisons should be\r\nconstructed within the factories and legally proclaimed in the colony.\r\nA treaty should be concluded with the New Zealand chiefs for the\r\nrecognition of the factories and the protection of British subjects\r\nand property. To meet the expenses which the establishment of a system\r\nof factories upon the principle I have mentioned would necessarily\r\nentail, funds might be obtained from a variety of sources, such as a\r\nsmall fee on the registration of the purchase of land from the\r\nnatives, on the entry and clearance of British shipping, and a small\r\npercentage on goods and produce imported and exported. The great\r\nsecurity which would result from this system would, it is conceived,\r\nreadily dispose the British subjects resident in New Zealand, to\r\nconform to such an impost.\"\r\n\r\nAfter acknowledging the primary need for Imperial legislation to give\r\neffect to his suggested policy, he continues: \"The benefit which may\r\nbe supposed to arise from the establishment of factories in New\r\nZealand is not confined to the mere legal protection they are supposed\r\nto afford; but we may hope they will be the means of introducing\r\namongst the natives a system of civil Government which may hereafter\r\nbe adopted and enlarged upon. Nor is it to be overlooked that in times\r\nof intestine war they will afford a safe retreat to our\r\nfellow-countrymen, who will then become powerful by concentration.\"\r\n\r\nIn the estimation of Sir Richard Bourke, Captain Hobson's scheme\r\ncontained \"suggestions of great value,\" and in transmitting it to the\r\nColonial Office he not only gave it his full endorsement, but\r\njustified it because it was in his opinion \"neither possible nor\r\ndesirable to put a stop to the growing intercourse between the English\r\ncolonies in these seas and New Zealand.\" He also raised his voice\r\nagainst the neutral policy which was being pursued, for while\r\nadmitting the failure of the British Residency, he protested that \"it\r\nwould be difficult for His Majesty's or this Government to act for any\r\nlength of time upon the stern principle of non-interference if the\r\nlives and property of British subjects appeared to be in jeopardy. Any\r\nplan, therefore, by which the intercourse may be sufficiently\r\nregulated, and usurpation, real or apparent, avoided, is well worthy\r\nof serious consideration.\"\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with Captain Hobson's scheme, was sent a letter from\r\nMr. Busby, written while the _Rattlesnake_ was in New Zealand\r\nwaters. In this communication the Resident also endeavoured, for the\r\nguidance of Ministers, to reduce to a system a scheme of government\r\nbased upon his several years' experience of the people and the\r\ncountry. Governor Bourke evidently looked upon it with a less\r\nfavourable eye than he did upon the report of the naval officer, and\r\ncommended it merely as advancing \"suggestions that were not without\r\nvalue.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter must, however, be regarded by all historians as the more\r\nvaluable of the two, for in it will be found the germ of the treaty\r\nwhich was afterwards adopted by both _Pakeha_ and Maori as the\r\nbasis upon which New Zealand was taken into the British Empire; upon\r\nwhich her past progress has been built, and her future prosperity must\r\ndepend.\r\n\r\nIn the previous year (1836) Mr. Busby had made a somewhat similar\r\nsuggestion, founded upon the principle sanctioned by the Treaty of\r\nParis in the case of Great Britain and the Ionian Isles, and also\r\napplied in various instances on Britain's Indian frontier. That\r\nprinciple recognised \"a protecting state administering in chief the\r\naffairs of another State in trust for the inhabitants,\" and this\r\ncondition he claimed could be, with but slight modification, applied\r\nto New Zealand both economically and efficiently. Mr. Busby was by no\r\nmeans of the opinion, afterwards so contemptuously expressed by Sir\r\nGeorge Gipps, that the native Declaration of Independence was \"a paper\r\npellet fired off at Baron de Thierry.\" On the contrary, he attached\r\nconsiderable importance to it, proposing to make it the authority on\r\nwhich the chiefs were entitled to enter into diplomatic relations with\r\nGreat Britain for the cession of their administrative rights.\r\n\r\n\"The chiefs who were parties to the articles of Confederation, and to\r\nthe Declaration of Independence,\" he wrote, \"together with those who\r\nsubsequently adhered to it, include, with very few exceptions, the\r\nwhole of the chiefs of influence in the northern parts of the Islands,\r\nand the adhesion of the remainder could at any time be procured.\r\nWhatever acts approaching to acts of sovereignty or government have\r\nbeen exercised in the country, have been exercised by these chiefs in\r\ntheir individual capacity, as relates to their own people, and in\r\ntheir collective capacity as relates to their negotiations with the\r\nBritish Government, the only Government with which the chiefs or\r\npeople of New Zealand have had any relations of a diplomatic\r\ncharacter. The articles of Confederation having centralised the powers\r\nof sovereignty both _de jure_ and _de facto_ by the several\r\nchiefs, and having established and declared the basis of a\r\nconstitution of government founded upon the union of those powers, I\r\ncannot, I think, greatly err in assuming that the congress of chiefs,\r\nthe depositing of the powers of the State, as declared by its\r\nconstitution, is competent to become a party to a treaty with a\r\nforeign power, and to avail itself of foreign assistance in reducing\r\nthe country under its authority to order, and this principle being\r\nonce admitted all difficulty appears to me to vanish.\"\r\n\r\nIt did not, however, enter into the proposal of Mr. Busby that the\r\nBritish Government should be both in theory and in fact the\r\nadministrative authority. He still contemplated the retention of the\r\nfederated chiefs as the nominal source of power, with himself as its\r\npresiding genius. \"In theory and ostensibly the government would be\r\nthat of the confederated chiefs, but in reality it must necessarily be\r\nthat of the protecting power. The chiefs would meet annually, or\r\noftener, and nominally enact the laws proposed to them, but in truth\r\nthe present race of chiefs could not be entrusted with any discretion\r\nwhatever in the adoption or rejection of any measure that might be\r\nsubmitted to them.\"\r\n\r\nHe proposed to constitute the chiefs guardians of the peace and public\r\nmorals, and to pay them for their services. Schools were to be\r\nestablished, and the Missionaries and catechists were, as far as their\r\nduties would permit, to be appointed Justices of the Peace, whose\r\ndecisions were, if needs must, to be supported by a military force.\r\nEven a periodical newspaper was provided for as a means of\r\n\"instructing the natives in those relative duties of the people and\r\ntheir rulers, which are familiar to all ranks of the population under\r\nestablished Government, but of which the New Zealanders have scarcely\r\nyet formed an idea.\" Revenue was to be raised by an impost on shipping\r\nand a duty upon spirits and tobacco. Indeed, so modest was his\r\ncontemplated civil establishment that he estimated an expenditure of\r\nnot more than £1000 per annum would be sufficient to maintain it in\r\nadequate splendour. All existing land claims were to be settled by an\r\nindependent commission, and after that all titles were to be void\r\nunless procured through the Government, whose special duty it would\r\nbe to see that ample reserves were retained for the natives.\r\n\r\nMr. Busby, in submitting these proposals, ventured to suggest that\r\nthey might be presumed to give an effective degree of protection to\r\nthe British subjects resident in New Zealand, without infringing on\r\nthe rights of the New Zealanders as an independent people and at the\r\nsame time \"satisfy the reasonable scruples of a foreign Government.\"\r\nThis latter condition was one that in maturing their plans the British\r\nCabinet could not leave out of their consideration; for already both\r\nFrance and America were factors to be counted upon in the South\r\nPacific, and might with almost equal justice claim a share in the\r\nsovereignty of the country.\r\n\r\nThe Government were still wrestling with the perplexities of the\r\nposition when the New Zealand Association rose into being, and served\r\nto still further complicate the issues. There was an opinion in\r\npolitical circles, afterwards crystallised into a definite\r\nrecommendation by the House of Lords, that the colonisation of New\r\nZealand was the duty of the State, if it was Britain's duty at all,\r\nbut private enterprise had never been wholly disassociated from the\r\nscheme.[29] As far back as 1825 a New Zealand Company, \"acting with\r\nthe sanction and encouragement of the Government,\" had been formed\r\nunder Lord Durham, and had acquired an estate on the banks of the\r\nHokianga River. This settlement, under Captain Heard, had been of the\r\nmost fugitive character; but the land still remained more or less an\r\nasset, and subsequently was acquired by the New Zealand Association,\r\nfounded in 1837 by the Hon. Francis Baring, M.P. for Sheffield, in\r\nconjunction with other gentlemen prominent in English public life of\r\nthat day. This Association grew out of an enquiry made at the instance\r\nof the House of Commons by a committee called the Committee on\r\nColonial Lands, but the real subject of the enquiry was colonisation.\r\nOne of the principal witnesses was Mr. Edward Gibbon Wakefield, who\r\ngave some account of the then existing state of New Zealand, and spoke\r\nof it as a country extremely eligible for the purpose of British\r\ncolonisation, provided some regular system should be adopted in place\r\nof the lawless practices that were then rampant. In consequence of\r\nthat statement, a member of the committee spoke to him upon the\r\nsubject of colonising New Zealand. Subsequently other gentlemen were\r\nadmitted to their discussions, and as a result of their joint\r\ndeliberations they determined to form an Association for the purpose\r\nof obtaining from Parliament (for Parliamentary aid was considered\r\nessential) some regulation both for the colonisation and the\r\ngovernment of the Islands, to take the place of the irregular\r\npractices that were then on foot.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that in its inception the Association had a\r\nlarge measure of philanthropy underlying its principles, for it was\r\nthe outcome of the unsatisfactory social conditions existing in\r\nEngland at that period. The scheme attracted to its aid men of wealth\r\nand culture, and under the organising genius of Edward Gibbon\r\nWakefield it acquired an influence, both social and political, which\r\nno government could safely regard with indifference.[30]\r\n\r\nTo secure New Zealand as a British possession; to find a profitable\r\ninvestment for British capital; and to provide employment and\r\nopportunity for England's idle labour were the nominal objects for\r\nwhich the Association had been formed. To give these purposes\r\npractical effect the Association had, under the guiding hand of\r\nWakefield, formulated definite theories upon the subject of\r\ncolonisation; and to the end that their ideals might be achieved they\r\nsought the assistance of the Government and the sanction of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nOn a day in June 1837 they secured an interview with the Prime\r\nMinister, Lord Melbourne, whom they found attended by Lord Howick, a\r\nmember of the Government, though not of the Colonial Office, and who\r\nwas present, so they were told, in the character of an adviser on the\r\nsubject, he having paid considerable attention to colonial problems.\r\nThe aims and purposes of the Association were laid before the\r\nMinisters by Mr. Baring, chairman of the society, and the result of\r\nthe deputation was an assurance from the Premier that for himself he\r\nsaw no objection to the scheme of the Association, and that he\r\nperceived in some of their purposes a laudable object, but that not\r\nbeing familiarly conversant with such subjects he did not care to do\r\nmore than to express his general approbation, and to refer the\r\ndeputation for the discussion of all matters of detail to Lord Howick,\r\nwho was well informed on all such questions, and who possessed, in the\r\noffice which he held, as much leisure as would enable him to attend to\r\nthe subject. The committee was highly satisfied with their interview,\r\nand communicated in various ways with Lord Howick upon the details of\r\ntheir plan, amongst other things submitting to him a draft of the Bill\r\nwhich they proposed to introduce into the House of Commons. Lord\r\nHowick examined the Bill, and both in conversation and in writing\r\nsuggested various modifications, which though not universally approved\r\nby the promoters, were adopted in their entirety rather than risk the\r\nloss of that influence which they considered essential to the success\r\nof their plan--the assistance of the Executive Government. The death\r\nof the King, William IV., at this juncture, put a sudden termination\r\nto their political proceedings; but the outlook for their negotiation\r\nappeared so satisfactory that, pending the assembly of the new\r\nParliament, they published an invitation to all persons so disposed to\r\njoin the Association for the purpose of emigrating to New Zealand. The\r\npublication of this resolution drew to their ranks a large body of\r\nwealthy and influential people; and when Parliament met again in\r\nDecember of the same year a very considerable number of persons had\r\nexpressed their intention of settling in the new colony. Accordingly\r\nthe committee, on December 13, again waited on Lord Melbourne with a\r\nview to obtaining his final approval upon the measure which they\r\nproposed to submit to the Commons. As at the previous interview, the\r\nobject of the Association in seeking this second conference was stated\r\nby Mr. Baring, when Lord Melbourne, who appeared to have forgotten\r\nwhat had passed on the former occasion, referred the deputation to\r\nLord Glenelg, who was present as Colonial Minister.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman at once adopted an attitude of hostility to the whole\r\nproposal, his objections being primarily that the jealousy of foreign\r\npowers might be excited by the extension of British colonies; that\r\nEngland had colonies enough; that they were very expensive to govern\r\nand to manage; and that they were not of sufficient value to make it\r\nworth while to increase their number.[31] The rebuttal of these\r\nunexpected objections involved a discussion of over an hour, during\r\nwhich considerable feeling was displayed by some of the gentlemen\r\npresent, who saw in the attitude of the Minister a grim prospect of\r\ntheir scheme being thwarted. Several of these had, during the interval\r\nsince the previous interview, disposed of their property and quitted\r\nprofessions in which they were engaged, with a view to emigrating, and\r\nthey now felt very strongly the position in which they were placed by\r\nthe withdrawal of the Ministerial approval which they believed their\r\nenterprise was to receive. One of these was described to Lord\r\nMelbourne as having wound up his affairs with a view to emigrating,\r\nand as being likely to suffer very seriously from now finding himself\r\nunable to carry his plan into effect. Lord Melbourne, not knowing that\r\nhe was present, said that such an individual must be mad. The\r\ngentleman immediately rose and, facing the Premier, said that he was\r\nthe madman. This created a distinctly dramatic situation, and the\r\nconference was on the point of breaking up in excitement and disorder\r\nwhen Lord Melbourne was reminded of his former sympathetic reception\r\nof the Association's proposals, whereupon he held a further brief\r\nconsultation with the leaders of the deputation, and gave them to\r\nunderstand that the matter would be again considered by the\r\nGovernment, and that if they would wait upon Lord Glenelg in a week's\r\ntime they would get an answer more to their satisfaction. Pursuant to\r\nthat arrangement, the same body of persons waited on the Colonial\r\nSecretary on that day week (Wednesday, December 20), when Lord Glenelg\r\ninformed them that the subject of the colonisation of New Zealand had\r\nbeen reconsidered by the Cabinet, and that circumstances which had\r\noccurred during the interval had induced Ministers to think that their\r\nformer view was not the correct one. What had happened to so influence\r\nthe Ministerial mind was the receipt of those important despatches\r\nfrom Mr. Busby, the British Resident, and from Captain Hobson, in\r\nwhich both these officers urged the need for a more vigorous policy on\r\nthe part of the Colonial Office in its relations with New Zealand. The\r\nopinions of the Government, therefore, now approximated somewhat more\r\nclosely to those of the Association, but there was still some\r\nhesitancy in proceeding by way of Act of Parliament. The Colonial\r\nDepartment, Lord Glenelg said, had fully considered the matter, and\r\nwere satisfied that the measures desired might be carried into\r\ncomplete effect without applying to Parliament at all; and that they\r\nwere consequently prepared, in the exercise of the power of the Crown\r\nvested in the Secretary of State for the Colonial Department, to give\r\nto the Association a Charter of Incorporation, being a Charter of\r\ngovernment similar to those which were granted in the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries to the companies which founded the thirteen\r\ngreat colonies in America. Nine days after this interview the\r\nAssociation received an official letter from Lord Glenelg, reiterating\r\nhis offer of a Charter, and calling upon the committee to form their\r\nmembers into a Joint-Stock Company with a subscribed capital\r\nsufficient to qualify them for the Charter he proposed to issue. This\r\nproposition was wholly unacceptable to the Association for two vital\r\nreasons. They had from the beginning declared that they intended to\r\ntake no private pecuniary interest in the undertaking, and yet in\r\nspite of their care in this direction they had been very untruly\r\ncharged before the public with having no other object than that of\r\nprivate pecuniary gain for themselves. Again some of their most\r\ninfluential leaders were persons, such as distinguished clergymen of\r\nthe Established Church, holding preferment, who were almost\r\ndisqualified by that circumstance from becoming members of a\r\nJoint-Stock Company, and, therefore, it was unanimously resolved that\r\nthe offer of the Colonial Secretary could not be accepted. But though\r\nthis avenue of procedure was closed there was still another open to\r\nthem, and it was determined to procure, if possible, the passage of a\r\nBill through Parliament, based upon the plan which they had originally\r\nplaced before the Government. Such a Bill was brought into the House\r\nof Commons by Mr. Baring, but owing to the opposition of the\r\nMinisters, including Lord Howick,[32] and the widespread impression\r\nthat the Association was nothing better than a land-sharking Company,\r\nthe measure was defeated by a large majority.\r\n\r\nThe discussion which was provoked by this Bill was responsible for\r\nconcentrating public attention upon two points, namely, the objects\r\nwhich animated the Association, and, secondly, the diversity of\r\nopinion which existed on the subject of British sovereignty in New\r\nZealand. One of the most ardent advocates of the Association was the\r\nRev. Dr. Hinds, a clergyman of the Established Church, who had been\r\ngreatly impressed by the social stagnation in England, and who had\r\njoined the committee in the hope of providing some outlet for the\r\ncountry's allegedly \"surplus\" population. Dr. Hinds told the Committee\r\nof the House of Lords in 1838[33] that he considered the colonisation\r\nof New Zealand expedient because of the number of persons of various\r\nclasses in Great Britain who were anxious to settle themselves in a\r\ncolony in New Zealand; persons who from their character, station, and\r\nother considerations, had a claim on the British Parliament to\r\nfacilitate that object. The feeling, he assured their Lordships, in\r\nfavour of such a colony was deep seated and sincere, supporting his\r\ncontention by quoting letters he had received from Scotland,[34]\r\nwhere, he said, existing conditions were clamant for an immediate\r\nremedy. That remedy, he contended, the colonisation of New Zealand\r\nwould supply. \"There is,\" he said, \"an abundance of capital and an\r\nabundance of labour in Great Britain, and the abundance of capital the\r\ncapitalists can hardly employ so as to be sufficiently remunerative by\r\nany investment in this country. At the same time there is a great mass\r\nof the labouring population who can no longer obtain sufficient wages\r\nto keep up what have become the necessaries of life to them. The\r\nproposed colony would therefore be a measure of relief to both the\r\ncapitalists and labourers.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORD NORMANBY.]\r\n\r\nDr. Hinds concluded his instructive picture of social England at that\r\ndate by urging the colonisation of New Zealand on the general ground\r\nthat settlement was already proceeding there along irregular lines,\r\nand without any \"combining principle.\" This fundamental requirement to\r\nall well-ordered societies, he thought, was provided for in the plan\r\nof the Association, and he proceeded to explain in very explicit terms\r\nthe two cardinal points of its constitution--its Government, and the\r\nprinciples which would control its land transactions.\r\n\r\nThe executive authority of the Association was, he said, to be placed\r\nin the hands of a Commission resident in England, which Commission was\r\nto be merely a provisional body to last so long as might be thought\r\nnecessary to set the scheme on foot. It was proposed to delegate to\r\nthese Commissioners the power to make laws, the Crown to determine the\r\nextent of the delegation, and many other important matters. A further\r\npower of delegation was to be given to a Council in New Zealand, but\r\nthe responsibility for all that was done was to rest with the\r\nCommission at home. \"Whatever the powers are, it is only required that\r\nthey should be exercised for a period of twenty-one years, and the\r\nAssociation would not at all object if it should seem desirable to\r\nhave the time shortened. At the end of that term the whole Government\r\nof the colony would revert to the Crown.\"\r\n\r\nIn its land dealings, the element of profit was to be eliminated by\r\nthe fact that the whole of the money derived from the sale of land or\r\nother sources must be spent in the interests of the colony, and no\r\nmember was to derive any advantage therefrom: \"The money for which the\r\nland will be sold by the Commissioners will be a price made up of\r\nseveral sums. It will in the first place contain the sum paid for the\r\nland itself, which I conceive will be a very small proportion. It will\r\ncontain then a sum which will be calculated as sufficient for bringing\r\nout labourers to cultivate the land purchased; that will be the\r\nlargest amount. It is also proposed that there should be a further sum\r\nadded for the purpose of making roads, bridges, and public works, and\r\nit is also proposed that one of the items should be a sum to be\r\nexpended in making provision for the natives, such as procuring them\r\nmedical assistance and some instruction in the arts. The price the\r\nsettlers will pay for the land will be only the price paid for it to\r\nthe natives, and the additions to that sum will be in fact the\r\npurchase money paid for certain benefits which are considered\r\nessential to the prosperity of the colony, more especially for a due\r\nsupply of labour.\"\r\n\r\nThe House of Lords' Committee reported against this scheme on the\r\nbroadly Imperial grounds that the extension of the colonial\r\npossessions of the Crown was a question of public policy with which\r\nthe Government only should deal. The element of private enterprise\r\nwas, in their Lordships' opinion, eminently undesirable, holding with\r\nCaptain Fitzroy, whose personal experience they valued, that\r\n\"colonisation to be useful must be entirely under the control of the\r\nExecutive Government of the Mother Country.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point a new and vigorous opponent directed its energies\r\nagainst the plans of the Association. The Church Missionary Society\r\nhad been watching its proceedings with a jealous eye, and from the\r\nmoment of the Association's inception had adopted an attitude of\r\nhostility towards it. Rightly or wrongly the Society had conceived the\r\nnotion that the colonisation of the country must have a detrimental\r\neffect upon its Missions, and that therefore a sacred duty devolved\r\nupon the Committee to frustrate its consummation if it were at all\r\npossible so to do.\r\n\r\nImmediately following the publication of the Association's prospectus\r\nthe Society had communicated with its Missionaries in New Zealand,\r\ncalling their attention to the scheme, and urging them to furnish the\r\nCommittee with their views upon it, and so assist the parent body in\r\nreaching a conclusion as to its merits. Without waiting for these\r\nreplies the Committee proceeded to deliberate upon the evidence then\r\navailable, and on June 6, 1837, formulated the following resolutions,\r\nwhich they ever afterwards consistently made the basis of their\r\nattitude towards the Association.\r\n\r\n That the New Zealand Association appears to the Committee highly\r\n objectionable on the principle that it proposes to engage the British\r\n Legislature to sanction the disposal of portion of a foreign country\r\n over which it has no claim to sovereignty or jurisdiction whatever.\r\n\r\n That the Association is further objectionable from its involving the\r\n colonisation of New Zealand by Europeans, such colonisation of\r\n countries inhabited by uncivilised tribes having been found by\r\n universal experience to lead to the infliction upon the aborigines of\r\n great wrongs and most severe injuries.\r\n\r\n That the Committee consider the execution of such a scheme as that\r\n contemplated by the Association especially to be deprecated in the\r\n present case, from its unavoidable tendency, in their judgment, to\r\n interrupt if not to defeat, those measures for the religious\r\n improvement and civilisation of the natives of New Zealand, which are\r\n now in favourable progress through the labours of the Missionaries.\r\n\r\n That for the reasons assigned in the preceding resolutions the\r\n Committee are of opinion that all suitable means should be employed\r\n to prevent the plan of the New Zealand Association from being carried\r\n into execution.\r\n\r\nThe Society again made declaration of its views in the following year,\r\nembodying in its annual report (May 1, 1838) a plea for the humane\r\nconsideration of New Zealand's claims, and for their own disinterested\r\nservices to the country:\r\n\r\n Your Committee cannot close this report on the New Zealand Mission\r\n without adverting to the peculiar situation of that country as it is\r\n regarded by the public at large. What events may await this fair\r\n portion of the globe, whether England will regard with a sisterly eye\r\n so beautiful an Island, placed like herself in a commanding position,\r\n well harboured, well wooded, and fertile in resources; whether this\r\n country will stretch forth a friendly and vigorous arm, so that New\r\n Zealand may with her native population adorn the page of future\r\n history as an industrious, well-ordered, and Christian nation, it is\r\n not for the committee of the Church Missionary Society to\r\n anticipate--but this consolation they do possess. They know that the\r\n Society has for the past twenty years done good to the natives,\r\n hoping for nothing again, nothing save the delight of promoting the\r\n Glory of God and good-will among men. The Society has sent forth its\r\n heralds of peace and messengers of salvation, and has thus contracted\r\n such an obligation towards those whom it has sought to benefit that\r\n your Committee are constrained to lift up their voice on behalf of\r\n that Island, and to claim that no measures shall be adopted towards\r\n that interesting country which would involve any violation of the\r\n principles of justice on our part, or the rights and liberties of the\r\n natives of New Zealand.\r\n\r\nThe Society having once determined upon its attitude towards the\r\nAssociation never turned back. Their Secretary, Mr. Dandeson Coates,\r\nbecame a militant force whom they found it difficult to shake off, and\r\ntogether with the enormous influence he was able to wield in religious\r\ncircles, constituted a power that might have made the Government pause\r\nhad they been predisposed to afford the Association the shelter of\r\ntheir wing.\r\n\r\nHarassed by the Church Missionary Society and repulsed by Parliament\r\nthe Association turned to the hope of resuming the negotiations with\r\nthe Government at the point at which they had broken with Lord\r\nGlenelg. In the previous year the Colonial Secretary had, it will be\r\nremembered, reluctantly professed sympathy with the objects of the\r\norganisation up to the point that it fell short of being a Joint-Stock\r\nCompany. He had then informed Lord Durham[35] that colonisation having\r\ngone on in New Zealand to some extent, the only question was between\r\nallowing it to proceed along desultory lines, without law, and fatal\r\nto the natives, or a colonisation organised and salutory. \"Her\r\nMajesty's Government are therefore,\" he said, \"disposed to entertain\r\nthe proposal of establishing such a colony. They are willing to\r\nconsent to a Corporation by a Royal Charter, of various persons to\r\nwhom the settlement and government of the projected colony for some\r\nshort term of years would be confided. The Charter would be framed\r\nwith reference to the precedents of the colonies established in North\r\nAmerica by Great Britain in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\"\r\n\r\nThe basis on which these Atlantic colonies had been established was\r\nthat of business concerns; for it was officially stated that the\r\nAssociation's scheme was objected to because of the absence of an\r\nactual subscribed capital, and the consequent want of protection to\r\nthose proceeding to the colony as emigrants. For the reasons already\r\ngiven, the stipulation that the Association should convert itself into\r\na Joint-Stock Company was so contrary to the motives which had\r\ninspired it that it was at first, and still was, hotly resented and\r\nresisted by its principal and truly philanthropic promoters. Many of\r\nthese now withdrew from the ranks of the Association; but others,\r\nrather than give up the hope of colonising the Islands, consented to\r\ncomply with the demand of the Minister, after Parliament had rejected\r\ntheir Bill, as they wrongly assumed, for the insufficient reason of a\r\nnon-existent capital. The Association then, in 1838, became a Company,\r\nshares were issued, capital subscribed, the reorganisation changing\r\nits whole character from a quasi-benevolent to a strictly commercial\r\nconcern, whose business it was to buy land at a low price in New\r\nZealand, and sell it at a high price in England.[36]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a change had taken place at the Colonial Office. Lord\r\nGlenelg had fallen over his Canadian policy, and in the year following\r\nits reconstruction, the Company, on the ground that they had now\r\ncomplied with all that had been stipulated for, approached his\r\nsuccessor, Lord Normanby, \"with a view of obtaining, through his\r\nLordship's intervention, a Royal Charter of Incorporation.\" Upon what\r\ntook place at this interview the widest divergence of opinion appears\r\nto exist. The Company claimed that the Minister received them with the\r\ngreatest affability and encouragement, and that in consequence they\r\nleft the Colonial Office in high spirits at the very favourable\r\nreception they had met with, and were perfectly satisfied in their own\r\nminds that all opposition to their scheme had not only ceased, but\r\nthat they could proceed with the full concurrence of the Government.\r\n\r\nTheir feelings may, therefore, be easily imagined when, within\r\nforty-eight hours of their meeting with the Minister, they received an\r\nofficial letter from Lord Normanby, dated March 11, 1839, in which his\r\nLordship warmly repudiated the suggestion that the Government was in\r\nany way bound to give effect to his predecessor's promise. He pointed\r\nout that Lord Glenelg's offer had been distinctly rejected by those to\r\nwhom it was made; that they had since applied to Parliament for powers\r\nwhich they had failed to procure from the Crown; and that the\r\npersonnel of the Company had so completely changed that by no process\r\nof reasoning could it be argued that the promise of Ministerial\r\napproval had been given to the same people as were now making the\r\napplication. He therefore claimed that he stood unfettered by any\r\npledge, and was free to discuss the question in the public interests,\r\nand for the public as though the rejected offer of 1837 had not been\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nIn thus sternly refusing to countenance the proceedings of the\r\nCompany, the Minister may have been induced to adopt the course he\r\ntook by a reason altogether different from that which he gave, but one\r\nwhich he found more difficult to diplomatically express. For directing\r\nhis attention to the change in the personnel of the promoters he was\r\nindebted to his Departmental Secretary, Mr. Stephen, who had kept the\r\nstrictest watch upon the correspondence of the Company, and when the\r\nrequest, now under review, was preferred, he wrote a Memorandum to his\r\nMinister which may have profoundly influenced the mind of Lord\r\nNormanby.\r\n\r\n \"You can see,\" he said, \"from looking over the list of the proposed\r\n Directors, that the leading members are now Roman Catholics. If this\r\n business is committed to them, New Zealand will infallibly become a\r\n Roman Catholic country. I am convinced that this would give the most\r\n severe offence to all the religious bodies which have established\r\n Missions there. I cannot withhold expressing my own opinion that the\r\n objection would be perfectly just and well founded. As long as we\r\n have the choice of establishing Popery or Protestantism in any part\r\n of the world I cannot understand how any one, not a Roman Catholic,\r\n would hesitate what that choice should be.\"[37]\r\n\r\nHow far the suggestion of Mr. Stephen weighed, or did not weigh, with\r\nhis chief can now only be a matter of merest speculation, for\r\nunfortunately little in the way of record has been left to guide us.\r\nIt is possible that under the sway of the religious feeling which\r\nexisted in England at that time he did not altogether disregard it,\r\nbut it is more probable that the circumstance which weighed with him\r\nmost was the fact that since Lord Glenelg's day the Government had\r\nreceived more serviceable advice as to their powers under the Law of\r\nNations, and that finding it was not within their right to issue a\r\nCharter affecting New Zealand, they were then considering the\r\nsuggestions made by Mr. Busby and Captain Hobson, and were even at\r\nthat moment contemplating the steps which they afterwards took. Lord\r\nNormanby would, under these circumstances, find it difficult and\r\ninexpedient to refer in definite language to these immature plans, and\r\nconsequently the general terms in which he was compelled to speak may\r\nhave misled the members of the Company who waited on him to sue for a\r\nCharter. In considering a petition from the Merchants, Bankers, and\r\nShipowners of the City of London respecting the colonisation of New\r\nZealand, an effort was made by a Committee of the House of Commons, in\r\n1840, to discover exactly what was the attitude of the Ministerial\r\nmind at this juncture. Mr. Gibbon Wakefield complained that the\r\nCompany had been scurvily treated by Lord Normanby, who had led them\r\nto suppose that they had his sympathy and approval, and had then,\r\nwithin a comparatively few hours, despatched the letter in which he\r\nrefused to be bound by the promise of his predecessor to issue a\r\nCharter. In reply to this accusation, Mr. Labouchere, who was then\r\nUnder-Secretary at the Colonial Office, and might, therefore, be\r\nexpected to have some inside knowledge, took the view that the\r\nMinister had been misunderstood, and asked whether the position was\r\nnot this: That Lord Normanby had stated to the Company that he\r\nconsidered their objects very useful and laudable, and that he should\r\nhave been disposed to give them his most favourable consideration,\r\nprovided New Zealand were a British colony; that he intended to take\r\nsteps that he believed would probably lead to the constitution of New\r\nZealand, either wholly or in part as a British colony; but that till\r\nthose steps had been taken it would be utterly inconsistent with his\r\nofficial duty, not only to give encouragement, as a Minister, to the\r\nproceedings of the Company, but even to recognise them in any way\r\nwhatever?\r\n\r\nTo this Mr. Wakefield's answer was: \"My impression has always been\r\nthat when Lord Normanby received those gentlemen he sincerely felt\r\nwhat he said; that he was glad to see persons of so much influence,\r\nand of such station in society, engaged in such a work; but that after\r\nthe interview he came into communication with the officers of his\r\nDepartment, and received information of what had passed before, for he\r\nwas quite new in the office,[38] and that the letter written after the\r\ninterview, which was so much at variance with it, was written rather\r\nby the office, I should say, than by Lord Normanby himself, for the\r\npurpose of maintaining the consistency of the course which the\r\nGovernment had pursued.\"\r\n\r\nIt was therefore clearly the opinion of Mr. Wakefield that Mr. Stephen\r\nwas a force to be reckoned with, and that whether he influenced it\r\nfrom the religious or the secular point of view, the Departmental head\r\nof the office was a powerful factor in moulding the policy which the\r\nMinister afterwards followed. But be that as it may, it still remains\r\nthat from this date the Company and its colonising scheme received no\r\nquarter from the Colonial Secretary nor from the Department while he\r\nwas at its head. Nothing daunted by official discouragement, the\r\nCompany went steadily on with their arrangements; and within the year\r\nthey had so far completed their plans that their pilot ship was ready\r\nto sail, all that was requisite being the extension of a helping hand\r\nto Colonel Wakefield, their pioneer representative, by Her Majesty's\r\nofficers in Australia, in the event of things going badly with him. To\r\nthis end, on April 29, Mr. William Hutt, who had now become chairman\r\nof the Company, Lord Petre and Mr. Somes waited upon Lord Normanby,\r\npreferring a request that letters might be given to the leader of\r\ntheir expedition, soliciting the good offices of the Governors of New\r\nSouth Wales and Van Dieman's land, should Colonel Wakefield require\r\ntheir aid. Their request was accompanied by a copy of the Company's\r\ninstructions to Wakefield, all of which came as a violent surprise to\r\nthe Colonial Secretary, who immediately pronounced with unmistakable\r\nemphasis, the Government's hostility to these unauthorised\r\nproceedings. He protested that this was the first he had heard of the\r\nCompany's matured plans to proceed to New Zealand and there set up a\r\nsystem of Government independent of the authority of the British\r\nCrown, therefore it was impossible that he could do any act which\r\nmight be construed into a direct, or even indirect, sanction of such a\r\nproceeding. He further made it plain that the Government could not\r\nrecognise the authority of any agents whom the Company might send out\r\nto New Zealand, nor would they give future recognition to any\r\nproprietary titles to land within that country, which the Company\r\nmight obtain by grant or purchase from the natives. Indeed, so far had\r\nmatters, he said, now been pushed, that he had no option but to\r\nindicate that the time had arrived when Her Majesty must be advised by\r\nher Ministers to adopt one of the last of Lord Glenelg's\r\nrecommendations, before he left the Colonial Office,[39] and take\r\nmeasures without delay to obtain cession in sovereignty to the British\r\nCrown of such parts of New Zealand as are, or might be, occupied by\r\nBritish subjects, and that officers selected by the Queen, and not by\r\nthe Company, would be appointed to administer the executive Government\r\nwithin such territory. \"Under these circumstances,\" the Colonial\r\nSecretary concluded, \"I must decline to furnish the Company with the\r\nintroductory letters for which they apply.\"\r\n\r\nThis intimation was given to the Company in the dying days of April\r\n1839, and by the 13th of June Lords Normanby and Palmerston had, after\r\nconsultation with the Law Officers of the Crown, agreed not only that\r\nthe moment was ripe for official action, but that the proper course to\r\ntake was to send to New Zealand an officer with Consular powers, whose\r\nfirst duty would be to secure the cession in sovereignty from the\r\nchiefs. The territory so ceded was then to be annexed to New South\r\nWales, the Consul to be raised to the rank of Lieut.-Governor, acting\r\nunder the Governor of the Mother colony, but invested with sufficient\r\nauthority to preserve law and order in the country. His salary of £500\r\nper annum was at first to be a charge upon the revenues of New South\r\nWales, to be refunded so soon as the necessary arrangements could be\r\nmade for the collection of taxation in New Zealand.\r\n\r\nOn July 19 these proposals were confirmed by the Lords of the\r\nTreasury, whereupon Lord Palmerston penned the letter to Captain\r\nHobson of which the opening paragraph of the previous chapter is a\r\nbrief extract.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a clipper brig of 400 tons, named the _Tory_ had\r\nbeen quietly fitted out by the Company for a dash to New Zealand. She\r\nwas armed with eight big guns, and as a precaution against a hostile\r\nreception, small arms were provided for all the members of the crew, a\r\nspecially selected body of men. Under the command of Captain Chaffers,\r\nwho had been round the world with Fitzroy in the _Beagle_, she\r\nleft Plymouth Sound on May 12 (1839) and proving a smart sailer,\r\ncrossed the equator twenty-six days out, the high land of the South\r\nIsland being sighted in the vicinity of Cape Farewell on August 16.\r\nThis pioneer ship of the Company's fleet carried in her cabin their\r\nofficial representative in the person of Colonel William Wakefield,\r\nand in her hold a full complement of pots, pipes, and Jews' harps,\r\nwhich that gentleman proposed to exchange as full value for the land\r\nhe hoped to acquire by barter from the natives.\r\n\r\nThe sailing of the _Tory_ was the New Zealand Company's challenge\r\nto the Government, and in any estimate of its subsequent policy this\r\nprecipitate event must be accounted an important factor in endowing\r\nthe Colonial Office with a vital force which had hitherto been sadly\r\nlacking.\r\n\r\n[28] This war, it is said, arose through some one on board the\r\n_Roslyn Castle_ carrying off a native woman of high rank to sea.\r\nHer friends at Kawakawa accused the people of Kororareka of killing\r\nand eating her in satisfaction of an old feud. This they denied, but a\r\nwar ensued, 1500 fighting men being engaged, the war continuing for\r\nseveral months, eighty being killed.\r\n\r\n[29] In 1821 Mr. Henry Goulburn, by direction of Earl Bathurst,\r\ninformed R. M. Sugden that his Lordship \"did not feel he had any power\r\nof approving any particular encouragement to the establishment of a\r\ncolony in New Zealand.\" In 1822 Earl Bathurst informed Thomas England\r\nand Messrs. Taylor and Upton that no encouragement was given by the\r\nGovernment to settlers to proceed to New Zealand. In the same year Mr.\r\nJohn Thomson, A.M., Edinburgh, offered to found a colony of 50 sober\r\nmen, 100 Sepoys, and 100 convicts, as \"the inhabitants of New Zealand\r\nare just in that state of civilisation to be made useful.\" In November\r\n1823 Lieutenant-Colonel Nicolls, an ex-Indian officer, made a proposal\r\nto Earl Bathurst to establish a colony of military pensioners. In the\r\nfollowing month Baron de Thierry's scheme was brought under the notice\r\nof the Government. The year 1825 saw the first New Zealand Company\r\nestablished. Colonel R. Torrens, who afterwards did such good work in\r\nSouth Australia, applied in 1826 for the command of a military force\r\nin New Zealand, and so enable him to \"make preliminary arrangements\r\nwhich would facilitate the future colonisation of these islands upon\r\nsound economical principles.\"\r\n\r\n[30] It was said that at one period of its existence the New Zealand\r\nAssociation could command 42 votes in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n[31] Lord Glenelg did not on this occasion urge as an objection that\r\nNew Zealand was not a part of the British Empire.\r\n\r\n[32] After the Association was formed into a Company Lord Howick\r\nbecame one of its most ardent supporters.\r\n\r\n[33] A select Committee of the House of Lords was set up in 1838 \"to\r\nenquire into the present state of the Islands of New Zealand and of\r\nthe expediency of regulating the settlement of British subjects\r\ntherein.\"\r\n\r\n[34] \"It was only within the last three months that I received a\r\nletter from Paisley, stating that if a colony were formed in New\r\nZealand on the principles laid down in our publication in that\r\nneighbourhood alone there were a hundred respectable persons--indeed I\r\nam not sure the expression was not 'respectable families,' but I have\r\nnot the letter with me--who would emigrate immediately\" (Dr. Hinds\r\nbefore the House of Lords Committee). Mr. G. S. Evans, LL.D., in his\r\nevidence stated there was an Association in the West of Scotland\r\nconsisting of 200 members, and another in the Carse of Gowrie\r\nconsisting of at least 100 persons, all anxious to emigrate to New\r\nZealand.\r\n\r\n[35] _Vide_ his letter to Lord Durham, December 29, 1837.\r\n\r\n[36] \"I was the principal founder of the Company and the principal\r\nManaging Director from the time of its formation till the summer of\r\n1846, allowing for intervals of absence occasioned by illness and\r\nother occupation at a distance from England. My incapacity changed the\r\nwhole character of the direction of the New Zealand Company's affairs,\r\nwhich then fell into the hands of a few persons in whose minds sound\r\nprinciples of colonisation and colonial government were as nothing\r\ncompared with pounds, shillings, and pence.\"--Evidence of E. G.\r\nWakefield before a New Zealand Parliamentary Committee on New Zealand\r\nCompany's debt--Sessions 1 and 2.\r\n\r\n[37] For the text of the above Memorandum I am indebted to Mr. R.\r\nM'Nab, who copied it from the original in the Record Office, London.\r\nMr. Stephen, who wrote the Memorandum, was, at the time, an officer of\r\nthe Church Missionary Society.\r\n\r\n[38] Lord Normanby became Colonial Secretary on February 8, 1839.\r\n\r\n[39] _Vide_ his letter to Lord Palmerston, December 12, 1838.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nFINDING A WAY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe favour of Ministerial selection for the onerous task of bringing\r\nNew Zealand within the realms of Britain fell upon Captain Hobson,\r\nbecause his record in the Navy had justified the opinion expressed of\r\nhim by Sir Richard Bourke, that he was an experienced and judicious\r\nofficer. Moreover, his visit to the country in the _Rattlesnake_\r\nhad given him a local knowledge of which few men of eminence and\r\ncharacter were at that time possessed. There is no reason to suppose\r\nthat the appointment was in any way a party one, and except that the\r\nnew Consul was the victim of indifferent health, it was probably the\r\nbest that could have been made at the time, its greatest justification\r\nbeing the complete success which attended his mission up to the time\r\nof his early decease.[40] Captain Hobson left England in the H.M.S.\r\n_Druid_ commanded by Lord John Churchill. He went out fortified\r\nfor his task by a series of instructions which left little doubt that\r\nif Ministers had been slow to move, they had at least endeavoured to\r\ntake a statesman-like view of the position when circumstances\r\ncompelled them to act, the breadth of which can be best understood\r\nfrom the instructions themselves. After adverting to the social\r\nconditions existing in New Zealand, with which Captain Hobson was\r\nperfectly cognisant and which Lord Normanby assured him the Government\r\nhad watched with attention and solicitude, the Colonial Secretary\r\nproceeded to explain the attitude which the Government had adopted in\r\nregard to this branch of Imperial policy.\r\n\r\n We have not been insensible to the importance of New Zealand to the\r\n interests of Great Britain in Australia, nor unaware of the great\r\n natural resources by which that country is distinguished, or that its\r\n geographical position must in seasons, either of peace or war, enable\r\n it in the hands of civilised men to exercise a paramount influence in\r\n that quarter of the globe. There is probably no part of the earth in\r\n which colonisation could be effected with a greater or surer prospect\r\n of national advantage.\r\n\r\n On the other hand, the Ministers of the Crown have been restrained by\r\n still higher motives from engaging in such an enterprise. They have\r\n deferred to the advice of the Committee of the House of Commons in\r\n the year 1836 to enquire into the state of the Aborigines residing in\r\n the vicinity of our colonial settlements, and have concurred with\r\n that Committee in thinking that the increase in national wealth and\r\n power, promised by the acquisition of New Zealand, would be a most\r\n inadequate compensation for the injury which must be inflicted on\r\n this kingdom itself by embarking in a measure essentially unjust, and\r\n but too certainly fraught with calamity to a numerous and inoffensive\r\n people whose title to the soil and to the sovereignty of New Zealand\r\n is undisputable and has been solemnly recognised by the British\r\n Government. We retain these opinions in unimpaired force, and though\r\n circumstances entirely beyond our control have at length compelled us\r\n to alter our course, I do not scruple to avow that we depart from it\r\n with extreme reluctance.\r\n\r\n The necessity for the interposition of the Government has, however,\r\n become too evident to admit of any further inaction. The reports\r\n which have reached this office within the last few months establish\r\n the facts that about the commencement of 1838 a body of not less than\r\n two thousand British subjects had become permanent inhabitants of New\r\n Zealand, that amongst them were many persons of bad and doubtful\r\n character,--convicts who had fled from our penal settlements, or\r\n seamen who had deserted their ships,--and that these people,\r\n unrestrained by any law and amenable to no tribunals, were\r\n alternately the authors and victims of every species of crime and\r\n outrage. It further appears that extensive cessions of land have been\r\n obtained from the natives, and that several hundred persons have\r\n recently sailed from this country to occupy and cultivate these\r\n lands. The spirit of adventure having been effectually roused it can\r\n be no longer doubted that an extensive settlement of British subjects\r\n will be rapidly established in New Zealand, and that unless protected\r\n and restrained by necessary loans and institutions they will repeat\r\n unchecked in that quarter of the Globe the same process of war and\r\n spoliation under which uncivilised tribes have almost invariably\r\n disappeared, as often as they have been brought into the immediate\r\n vicinity of emigrants from the nations of Christendom. To mitigate,\r\n and if possible to avert these disasters, and to rescue the emigrants\r\n themselves from the evils of a lawless state of society, it has been\r\n resolved to adopt the most effective measures for establishing\r\n amongst them a settled form of Government. To accomplish this design\r\n is the principal object of your mission.\r\n\r\n I have already stated that we acknowledge New Zealand as a sovereign\r\n and independent state so far at least as it is possible to make that\r\n acknowledgment in favour of a people composed of numerous dispersed\r\n and petty tribes, who possess few political relations to each other,\r\n and are incompetent to act or even deliberate in concert. But the\r\n admission of their rights, though inevitably qualified by this\r\n consideration, is binding on the faith of the British Crown. The\r\n Queen, in common with Her Majesty's predecessor, disclaims for herself\r\n and her subjects every pretension to seize on the Islands of New\r\n Zealand, or to govern them as a part of the Dominions of Great Britain\r\n unless the free intelligent consent of the natives, expressed\r\n according to their established usages, shall be first obtained.\r\n Believing, however, that their own welfare would, under the\r\n circumstances I have mentioned, be best promoted by the surrender to\r\n Her Majesty of a right now so precarious, and little more than\r\n nominal, and persuaded that the benefits of British protection and of\r\n laws administered by British judges would far more than compensate for\r\n the sacrifice by the natives of a national independence which they are\r\n no longer able to maintain, Her Majesty's Government have resolved to\r\n authorise you to treat with the aborigines of New Zealand for the\r\n recognition of Her Majesty's sovereign authority over the whole or any\r\n part of those Islands which they may be willing to place under Her\r\n Majesty's dominion. I am not unaware of the difficulties by which such\r\n a treaty may be encountered. The motives by which it is recommended\r\n are, of course, open to suspicion. The natives may probably regard\r\n with distrust a proposal which may carry on the face of it the\r\n appearance of humiliation on their side, and of a formidable\r\n encroachment on ours: and their ignorance even of the technical\r\n terms in which that proposal must be conveyed, may enhance their\r\n aversion to an arrangement of which they may be unable to comprehend\r\n the exact meaning, or the probable results. These are, however,\r\n impediments to be gradually overcome by the exercise on your part of\r\n mildness, justice, and perfect sincerity in your intercourse with\r\n them. You will, I trust, find powerful auxiliaries amongst the\r\n Missionaries who have won and deserved their confidence; and amongst\r\n the older British residents who have studied their character and\r\n acquired their language. It is almost superfluous to say that, in\r\n selecting you for the discharge of this duty, I have been guided by a\r\n firm reliance on your uprightness and plain dealing. You will\r\n therefore frankly and unreservedly explain to the natives or their\r\n chiefs the reasons which should urge them to acquiesce in the\r\n proposals you will make to them. Especially you will point out to\r\n them the dangers to which they may be exposed by the residence\r\n amongst them of settlers amenable to no laws or tribunals of their\r\n own and the impossibility of Her Majesty extending to them any\r\n effectual protection unless the Queen be acknowledged as the\r\n Sovereign of their country, or at least of those districts within, or\r\n adjacent to which Her Majesty's subjects may acquire lands or\r\n habitations. If it should be necessary to propitiate their consent by\r\n presents, or other pecuniary arrangements, you will be authorised to\r\n advance at once to a certain extent in meeting such demands, and\r\n beyond those limits you will refer them for the decision of Her\r\n Majesty's Government.\r\n\r\n It is not, however, to the mere recognition of the sovereign authority\r\n of the Queen that your endeavours are to be confined, or your\r\n negotiations directed. It is further necessary that the chiefs should\r\n be induced, if possible, to contract with you, as representing Her\r\n Majesty, that henceforward no lands shall be ceded, either\r\n gratuitously or otherwise, except to the Crown of Great Britain.\r\n Contemplating the future growth and extension of a British colony in\r\n New Zealand, it is an object of the first importance that the\r\n alienation of the unsettled lands within its limits should be\r\n conducted from its commencement upon that system of sale of which\r\n experience has proved the wisdom, and the disregard of which has been\r\n so fatal to the prosperity of other British Settlements. With a view\r\n to those interests it is obviously the same thing whether large tracts\r\n of land be acquired by the mere gift of the Government or by purchases\r\n effected on nominal considerations from the aborigines. On either\r\n supposition the land revenue must be wasted, the introduction of\r\n emigrants delayed or prevented, and the country parcelled out amongst\r\n large land-owners whose possession must long remain an unprofitable,\r\n or rather a pernicious waste. Indeed, in a comparison of the two\r\n methods of acquiring land gratuitously, that of grants from the\r\n Crown, mischievous as it is, would be the less inconvenient, as such\r\n grants must be made with at least some kind of system, with some\r\n degree of responsibility, subject to some conditions, and recorded\r\n for general information. But in the case of purchases from the\r\n natives even these securities against abuse must be omitted, and none\r\n could be substituted for them. You will, therefore, immediately on\r\n your arrival announce, by a proclamation[41] addressed to all the\r\n Queen's subjects in New Zealand that Her Majesty will not acknowledge\r\n as valid any title to land which either has been, or shall hereafter\r\n be acquired in that country which is either not derived from or\r\n confirmed by a grant to be made in Her Majesty's name and on her\r\n behalf. You will, however, at the same time take care to dispel any\r\n apprehensions which may be created in the minds of the settlers that\r\n it is intended to dispossess the owners of any property which has\r\n been acquired on equitable conditions, and which is not upon a scale\r\n which must be prejudicial to the latent interests of the community.\r\n Extensive acquisitions of such lands have undoubtedly been already\r\n obtained, and it is probable before your arrival a great addition\r\n will have been made to them. The embarrassments occasioned by such\r\n claims will demand your earliest and most careful attention.\r\n\r\n I shall in the sequel explain the relation in which the proposed\r\n colony will stand to the Government of New South Wales. From that\r\n relation I propose to derive the resources necessary for encountering\r\n the difficulty I have mentioned. The Governor of that country will,\r\n with the advice of the Legislative Council, be instructed to appoint\r\n a Legislative Commission to investigate and ascertain what are the\r\n lands held by British subjects under grants from the natives; how far\r\n such grants were lawfully acquired and ought to be respected; and\r\n what may have been the price or other valuable consideration given\r\n for them. The Commissioners will make their report to the Governor,\r\n and it will then be decided by him how far the claimants, or any of\r\n them, may be entitled to confirmatory grants from the Crown, and on\r\n what conditions such confirmations ought to be made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPTAIN HOBSON, R.N.]\r\n\r\n The propriety of immediately subjecting to a small annual tax all\r\n uncleared lands within the British settlements in New Zealand will\r\n also engage the attention of the Governor and Council of New South\r\n Wales. The forfeiture of all lands in respect of which the tax shall\r\n remain for a certain period in arrear would probably before long\r\n restore to the demesne of the Crown so much of the waste land as may\r\n be held unprofitably to themselves, and the public, by the actual\r\n claimants. Having by these measures obviated the dangers of the\r\n acquisition of large tracts of country by mere land-jobbers, it will\r\n be your duty to obtain by fair and equal contracts with the natives\r\n the cession to the Crown of such waste lands as may be progressively\r\n required for the occupation of settlers resorting to New Zealand. All\r\n such contracts should be made by yourself, through the intervention\r\n of an officer expressly appointed to watch over the interests of the\r\n aborigines as their protector. The resales of the first purchases\r\n that may be made will provide the funds necessary for future\r\n acquisitions; and beyond the original investment of a comparatively\r\n small sum of money no other resource would be necessary for this\r\n purpose. I thus assume that the price to be paid to the natives by\r\n the local Government will bear an exceedingly small proportion to the\r\n price for which the same lands will be resold by the Government to\r\n the settlers, nor is there any real injustice in this inequality. To\r\n the natives or their chiefs much of the land in the country is of no\r\n actual use, and in their hands it possesses scarcely any exchangeable\r\n value. Much of it must long remain useless, even in the hands of the\r\n British Government also, but its value in exchange will be first\r\n created, and then progressively increased by the introduction of\r\n capital and of settlers from this country. In the benefits from that\r\n increase the natives themselves will gradually participate.\r\n\r\n All dealings with the natives for their lands must be conducted on\r\n the same principles of sincerity, justice, and good faith as must\r\n govern your transactions with them for the recognition of Her\r\n Majesty's sovereignty in the Islands. Nor is this all: they must not\r\n be permitted to enter into any contracts in which they might be\r\n ignorant and unintentional authors of injuries to themselves. You\r\n will not, for example, purchase from them any territory, the\r\n retention of which by them would be essential or highly conducive to\r\n their own comfort, safety, or subsistence. The acquisition of land by\r\n the Crown for the future settlement of British subjects must be\r\n confined to such districts as the natives can alienate without\r\n distress or serious inconvenience to themselves. To secure the\r\n observance of this rule will be one of the first duties of their\r\n Official Protector.\r\n\r\n There are yet other duties owing to the aborigines of New Zealand\r\n which may be all comprised in the comprehensive expression of\r\n promoting their civilisation, understanding by that term whatever\r\n relates to the religious, intellectual, and social advancement of\r\n mankind. For their religious instruction liberal provision has\r\n already been made by the zeal of the Missionaries, and of the\r\n Missionary Societies in this Kingdom, and it will be at once the most\r\n important and the most grateful of your duties to this ignorant race\r\n of men to afford the utmost encouragement, support, and protection to\r\n their Christian teachers. I acknowledge also the obligation of\r\n rendering to the Missions such pecuniary aid as the local Government\r\n may be able to afford, and as their increased labours may reasonably\r\n entitle them to expect. The establishment of schools for the\r\n education of the aborigines in the elements of literature will be\r\n another object of your solicitude, and until they can be brought\r\n within the pale of civilised life, and trained to the adoption of its\r\n habits, they must be carefully defended in the observance of their\r\n own customs, so far as these are compatible with the universal maxims\r\n of humanity and morals. But the savage practices of human sacrifice\r\n and cannibalism must be promptly and decisively interdicted; such\r\n atrocities, under whatever plea of religion they may take place, are\r\n not to be tolerated in any part of the dominions of the British\r\n Crown.\r\n\r\n It remains to be considered in what manner provision is to be made\r\n for carrying these instructions into effect as for the establishment\r\n and exercise of your authority over Her Majesty's subjects who may\r\n settle in New Zealand, or who are already there. Numerous projects\r\n for the establishment of a constitution for the proposed colony have\r\n at different times been suggested to myself and to my immediate\r\n predecessor in office, and during the last session of Parliament, a\r\n Bill for the same purpose was introduced into the House of Commons at\r\n the instance of some persons immediately connected with the\r\n emigrations then contemplated. The same object was carefully examined\r\n by a Committee of the House of Lords. But the common result of all\r\n enquiries, both in this office and in either House of Parliament, was\r\n to show the impracticability of the schemes proposed for adoption,\r\n and the extreme difficulty of establishing at New Zealand any\r\n institutions, legislative, judicial, or fiscal without some more\r\n effective control than could be found amongst the settlers themselves\r\n in the infancy of their settlement. It has therefore been resolved to\r\n place whatever territories may be acquired in the sovereignty by the\r\n Queen in New Zealand in the relation of a dependency to the\r\n Government of New South Wales. I am of course fully aware of the\r\n objections which may be reasonably urged against this measure; but\r\n after the most ample investigation I am convinced that for the\r\n present there is no other practicable course which would not be\r\n opposed by difficulties still more considerable, although I trust\r\n that the time is not distant when it may be proper to establish in\r\n New Zealand itself a local legislative authority.\r\n\r\n In New South Wales there is a Colonial Government possessing\r\n comparatively long experience, sustained by a large revenue, and\r\n constituted in such a manner as is best adapted to enable the\r\n legislative and executive authorities to act with promptitude and\r\n decision. It presents the opportunity of bringing the internal\r\n economy of the proposed new colony under the constant revision of a\r\n power sufficiently near to obtain early and accurate intelligence,\r\n and sufficiently remote to be removed from the influence of the\r\n passions and prejudices by which the first colonists must in the\r\n commencement of their enterprise be agitated. It is impossible to\r\n confide to an indiscriminate body of persons who have voluntarily\r\n settled themselves in the immediate vicinity of the numerous\r\n population of New Zealand those large and irresponsible powers which\r\n belong to the representative system of Colonial Government. Nor is\r\n that system adapted to a colony struggling with the first\r\n difficulties of their new situation. Whatever may be the ultimate\r\n form of government to which the British settlers in New Zealand are\r\n to be subject, it is essential to their own welfare, not less than\r\n that of the aborigines, that they should at first be placed under a\r\n rule which is at once effective and to a considerable degree\r\n external. The proposed connection with New South Wales will not,\r\n however, involve the extension to New Zealand of the character of a\r\n penal settlement. Every motive concurs in forbidding this, and it is\r\n to be understood as a fundamental principle of the new colony that no\r\n convict is ever to be sent thither to undergo his punishment.\r\n\r\n The accompanying correspondence with the Law Officers will explain to\r\n you the grounds of law on which it is to be concluded that by the\r\n annexation of New Zealand to New South Wales the powers vested by\r\n Parliament in the Governor and Legislative Council of the older\r\n settlement might be exercised over the inhabitants of the new colony.\r\n The accompanying Commission under the Great Seal will give effect to\r\n this arrangement, and the warrant which I enclose under Her Majesty's\r\n sign manual will constitute you Lieut.-Governor of that part of the\r\n New South Wales colony which has thus been extended over the New\r\n Zealand Islands. These instructions you will deliver to Sir George\r\n Gipps, who on your proceeding to New Zealand will place them in your\r\n hands to be published there. You will then return it to him to be\r\n deposited amongst the archives of the New South Wales Government.\r\n\r\n In the event of your death or absence the officer administering the\r\n Government of New South Wales will, provisionally, and until Her\r\n Majesty's pleasure can be known, appoint a Lieut.-Governor in your\r\n place, by an instrument under the public seal of his Government.\r\n\r\n It is not for the present proposed to appoint any subordinate\r\n officers for your assistance. That such appointments will be\r\n indispensable is not, indeed, to be doubted. But I am unwilling at\r\n first to advance beyond the strict limits of the necessity which\r\n alone induces the Ministers of the Crown to interfere at all on this\r\n subject. You will confer with Sir George Gipps as to the number and\r\n nature of the official appointments which would be made at the\r\n commencement of the undertaking and as to the proper rate of their\r\n emoluments. These must be fixed with the most anxious regard for\r\n frugality in the expenditure of public resources. The selection of\r\n the individuals by whom such offices are to be borne must be made by\r\n yourself from the colonists either of New South Wales or New Zealand,\r\n but upon the full and distinct understanding that their tenure of\r\n office, and even the existence of the offices which they are to hold\r\n must be provisional and dependent upon the future pleasure of the\r\n Crown. Amongst the offices thus to be created, the most evidently\r\n indispensable are those of a Judge, a Public Prosecutor, a Protector\r\n of the Aborigines, a Colonial Secretary, a Surveyor-General of Lands,\r\n and a Superintendent of Police. Of these, the Judge alone will\r\n require the enactment of a law to create and define his functions.\r\n The Act now pending in Parliament, for the revival, with amendments,\r\n of the New South Wales Act will, if passed into law, enable the\r\n Governor and Legislative Council to make all necessary provision for\r\n the establishment in New Zealand of a Court of Justice and a judicial\r\n system separate from and independent of the existing Supreme Court.\r\n The other functionaries I have mentioned can be appointed by the\r\n Governor in the unaided exercise of the delegated prerogative of the\r\n Crown. Whatever laws may be required for the Government of the new\r\n colony will be enacted by the Governor and Legislative Council. It\r\n will be his duty to bring under their notice such recommendations as\r\n you may see cause to convey to him on subjects of this nature. The\r\n absolute necessity of the revenue being raised to defray the expenses\r\n of the Government of the proposed settlement in New Zealand has not,\r\n of course, escaped my careful attention. Having consulted the Lords\r\n of the Treasury on this subject I have arranged with their Lordships\r\n that until the sources of such revenue shall have been set in action,\r\n you should be authorised to draw on the Government of New South Wales\r\n for your unavoidable expenditure. Separate accounts, however, will be\r\n kept of the public revenue of New Zealand and of the application of\r\n it and whatever debt may be contracted to New South Wales, must be\r\n replaced by the earliest possible opportunity. Duties of impost on\r\n tobacco, spirits, wine, and sugar will probably supersede the\r\n necessity of any other taxation, and such duties except on spirits\r\n will probably be of a very moderate amount.\r\n\r\n The system at present established in New South Wales regarding land\r\n will be applied to all the waste lands which may be kept by the Crown\r\n in New Zealand.\r\n\r\n Separate accounts must be kept of the Land revenue, subject to the\r\n necessary reductions for the expense of surveys and management, and\r\n for the improvement by roads and otherwise the unsold territory, and\r\n subject to any deductions which may be required to meet the\r\n indispensable exigencies of the local Government. The surplus of this\r\n revenue will be applicable, as in New South Wales, to the charge of\r\n removing emigrants from this kingdom to the new colony.\r\n\r\n The system established in New South Wales to provide for the\r\n religious instruction of the inhabitants has so fully justified the\r\n policy by which it was dictated that I could suggest no better means\r\n of providing for this all-important object in New Zealand. It is,\r\n however, gratifying to know that the spiritual wants of the settlers\r\n will, in the commencement of the undertaking, be readily and amply\r\n provided for by the Missionaries of the Established Church of England\r\n and of other Christian communions, who have been so long settled in\r\n those Islands. It will not be difficult to secure for the European\r\n inhabitants some portion of that time and attention which the\r\n Missionaries have hitherto devoted exclusively to the aborigines.\r\n\r\n I enclose, for your information and guidance, copies of a\r\n correspondence between this department and the Treasury, referring\r\n you to Sir George Gipps for additional instructions as may enable you\r\n to give full effect to the view of Her Majesty's Government on the\r\n subject of finance. You will observe that the general principle is\r\n that of maintaining in the proposed colony a system of revenue,\r\n expenditure, and account entirely separate from that of New South\r\n Wales, though corresponding with it as far as that correspondence can\r\n be maintained.\r\n\r\nAfter briefly describing the rules to be observed by Captain Hobson in\r\nconducting his correspondence with his immediate superior, Governor\r\nGipps, and the Colonial Office, Lord Normanby concluded his\r\ninstructions as follows:\r\n\r\n I have thus attempted to touch on all the topics on which it seems to\r\n me necessary to address you on your departure from this country. Many\r\n questions have been unavoidably passed over in silence, and others\r\n have been adverted to in a brief and cursory manner, because I am\r\n fully impressed with the conviction that in such an undertaking as\r\n that in which you are about to engage much must be left to your own\r\n discretion, and many questions must occur which no foresight could\r\n anticipate or properly resolve beforehand. Reposing the utmost\r\n confidence in your judgment, experience, and zeal for Her Majesty's\r\n service, and aware how powerful a coadjutor and how able a guide you\r\n will have in Sir George Gipps, I willingly leave for consultation\r\n between you many subjects on which I feel my own incompetency, at\r\n this distance from the scene of action, to form an opinion.[42]\r\n\r\nThe publication of this document brought down upon the head of the\r\nMinister a storm of criticism from the committee of the New Zealand\r\nCompany, who attacked with especial bitterness that portion of the\r\ninstructions wherein Lord Normanby made it especially clear that\r\nBritain claimed no right of sovereignty in or over New Zealand. In the\r\nprevious year, when the Company was promoting its Bill in the House of\r\nCommons, and when the organisation was less mercenary in its nature,\r\nthe promoters had taken a modified view of this question of\r\nsovereignty, and were prepared to concede something to the natives\r\nwhich, as a Company, they were now eager to deny.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MISSION CHURCH AT KORORAREKA.\r\n\r\nWhere Captain Hobson read his Proclamations.]\r\n\r\nThis earlier attitude was admirably expressed by the Rev. Dr. Hinds,\r\nwho in discussing the matter before the Committee of the House of\r\nLords, boldly stated that he believed civilised people had a right--an\r\ninherent right--over countries that have not been subject to\r\ncivilisation, whether those countries were uninhabited or partially\r\ninhabited by savages who were never likely themselves to cultivate the\r\ncountry. \"Here,\" he said, \"is a country considered to be populous for\r\na savage country. According to an estimate made by a respectable\r\nMissionary of the C.M.S. the inhabitants of the Northern Island amount\r\nto about 105,000. This Northern Island is probably about the size of\r\nEngland, and this its population of 105,000 stated to be decreasing in\r\nnumber without the least chance of their becoming cultivators or\r\nsovereigns of the soil. I hold it not to be an infringement of any\r\nnatural rights to claim the sovereignty of the Island, and this is a\r\nclaim which until lately would never have been questioned. There has\r\nbeen often a question as to the mode in which sovereign rights over\r\nsavage countries should be distributed among civilised people, but it\r\nhas been a question between one civilised country and another.\r\nFormerly the Pope used to claim the disposal of sovereignty.\r\nSubsequently it has been more conveniently settled by allowing the\r\npriority of claim to the first discoverers--a course as convenient\r\nprobably as can be advised. Within the last few years, however, the\r\njustice of this claim has been questioned, and it has been asserted\r\nthat savage as well as civilised men have sovereign rights. I do\r\nnot, myself, think they have; but it has been the wish of the\r\nAssociation not to offend any scruples, and therefore they have\r\ncarefully in this Bill waived the question, and allowed the claim to a\r\nsovereign right of some kind to exist in those savages. I say a\r\nsovereign right of some kind, because it is clear in the instance just\r\nmentioned, the giving the flag to the Bay of Islands, that the very\r\nassumption on the part of Great Britain of a right to give that flag\r\nsupposes the New Zealanders not to be altogether a sovereign power.\r\nMany probably who may be willing to cede to them the right of\r\nsovereignty as far as concerns themselves would not go to such lengths\r\nas to say that Great Britain should not cede the sovereignty as\r\nregards any right which may be put in by other nations; and I do not\r\nknow on what principle we should draw a distinction, and say how much\r\nor how little of this right of sovereignty we should claim. The French\r\nhave been attracted by the flax: suppose they were to say 'If you\r\nrelinquish your rights of sovereignty we will put in our claim, we\r\nstand next,' or the Dutch may say so. I do not know which visited the\r\ncountry first, but I cannot see on what principle we could interfere\r\nwith the French or Dutch unless we contend that we had some disposal\r\nover the sovereignty of the Islands. The question, however, has been\r\nwaived in the Bill; we suppose the New Zealanders and not Great\r\nBritain to be in possession of the right of sovereignty, and we\r\npropose accordingly that a purchase should be made of the sovereignty\r\nas well as the fee simple of the land. We have some precedents for\r\nthis. I do not know whether it is of consequence to bring forward\r\nprecedents, but even at a late period a purchase of this kind has been\r\nmade; Sir Stafford Canning took possession in 1815 of Singapore; it\r\nwas at that time in possession of the Malays, the subjects of the\r\nSultan of Jahore. In 1825 he found, I think, some inconvenience\r\narising from the Sultan's claims, and the English bought the Domain of\r\nthe Sultan for a sum of money, and so clear was the understanding\r\nabout it, that the Sultan made some reservations; some exceptional\r\nlaws, as they are called in this Bill, were made. There was a clause\r\nthat the Sultan's slaves should not be emancipated, and certain lands\r\nwere reserved and became entailed property and inalienable. When Penn\r\npurchased Pennsylvania he no doubt understood he purchased the\r\nsovereignty as well as the fee simple of the land, for I can conceive\r\nno one mad enough to found a colony in the midst of barbarians without\r\nsecuring the colonists against their interference as sovereigns.\r\nVattel certainly speaks of Penn's treaty as if he understood him to\r\nhave purchased the sovereign rights as well as the fee simple. These\r\nare precedents which may not be considered as carrying any great\r\nauthority. The question has not been very much discussed; it has been\r\ntaken for granted, and I think with reason, that the savage is in a\r\nstate of pupilage, and must be treated as we treat children. The only\r\nprinciple which it is important to maintain is this: If you go into a\r\ncountry at all inhabited by savages and take possession of their land\r\nand become sovereigns of it, you infringe their rights if you do not\r\nconsider their benefit as well as your own. If you were treating with\r\na child you would not infringe the rights of that child simply by\r\nacting and deciding for him, but you would infringe his rights if you\r\nacted and decided for your benefit and not his. So with respect to\r\nsavages; they are compared with civilised men, like children. They are\r\nof themselves incapable of acquiring the arts and habits of civilised\r\nlife; unless some interference that amongst civilised men would be\r\nconsidered unjust, takes place, they never can, by themselves, rise to\r\nthat higher condition. The injustice to be deprecated is that of\r\nseeking our own benefit solely and not theirs; and with respect to the\r\nNew Zealanders our purchase of the sovereignty of their country ought\r\nnot to be represented as being the same kind of bargain as if the\r\nFrench, for instance, were bargained with to cede the sovereignty over\r\nany portion of their territory. When the French ceded their sovereign\r\nrights over Martinique, Guadaloupe, and the Mauritius, they strictly\r\nceded all their sovereign rights; but in the present instance what is\r\nmeant by the cession of sovereignty amounts to this--that we purchase\r\nthe right to participate in the sovereignty with them; we do not wish\r\nto exclude them, but pay them a price to partake in the sovereignty\r\nwith them. Of course, in the first instance, the civilised man will be\r\nthe only sovereign, but that is because he only will be fit and\r\ncapable of exercising sovereign rights. As the savage advances in\r\ncivilisation he will come in for his share; and I see no reason, as\r\nsoon as the New Zealander is capable of it, against his being Chief\r\nJustice, Governor, or Bishop, or holding any other office. It is not\r\ntherefore that we take the sovereignty from him; we purchase the right\r\nof participating with him in the sovereignty, and by so doing we\r\nenable him to become Sovereign of the country, which he is not at\r\npresent.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Government had unmistakably demonstrated their\r\nintention not to recognise the Company, and with all hope of political\r\npatronage gone the Company saw no reason why they should spare the\r\nGovernment. There was now in their opinion no possible room to doubt\r\nthat the sovereignty over New Zealand rested in Great Britain, and\r\nthat the Colonial Department was betraying a national trust in\r\nconceding any rights to the natives, thereby opening the door to\r\nforeign intervention. They first showered their protests against this\r\nsupposed surrender of a national asset upon the Colonial Office, but\r\nwhen they discovered themselves ignored in this direction they turned\r\nwith renewed complaint to the Foreign Minister. \"We are assured,\" they\r\nwrote to him, on November 7, 1839, \"that this question of the\r\nsovereignty of New Zealand engages the attention of various commercial\r\nbodies and a large portion of the public press in France; that the\r\nsovereignty in England is denied; that the French Government is urged\r\neither to join in that denial, by protesting against the colonisation\r\nof the Islands by England, or to claim an equal right with England to\r\nplant settlements there. We are not without fear that some such\r\nprotest or claim should be admitted by your Lordship's Department, as\r\nit appears to have been admitted by the Colonial Department. It\r\nappears that the agitation of this question in France has been\r\nproduced by the publication of a Minute of the British Treasury made\r\nat the instance of the Colonial Department (July 19), and also of an\r\nextract of certain instructions recently given by that Department to\r\nCaptain Hobson,--two documents by which the Crown of England seems to\r\nrepudiate the sovereignty of New Zealand. The apparent repudiation\r\nconsists of an acknowledgment of sovereignty in the native chiefs from\r\nwhom Captain Hobson is instructed to procure, if possible, a cession\r\nto Her Majesty. It is this acknowledgment, according to all our\r\ninformation, which has given occasion to the pretensions now urged in\r\nFrance.[43] That which England, it is contended, instructs her officer\r\nto procure, if possible, she admits she does not possess, and she\r\nthereby admits the right of France either to obtain sovereign\r\njurisdiction in New Zealand, by the means which Captain Hobson is\r\ninstructed to employ, or if France should prefer that course, to\r\nsustain the independent sovereignty of the natives. The argument\r\nappears conclusive. It becomes very important, therefore, if it is of\r\ngreat importance to England, to prevent the establishment of a French\r\npower in the midst of the English colonies of Australasia that your\r\nLordship should be made aware of the acts of the British Crown which\r\nlead to a conclusion directly at variance from that which may be drawn\r\nfrom the said minute and instructions.\"\r\n\r\nThe Company's nominal[44] advocate on this occasion was their\r\nDeputy-Governor, Mr. Somes, who apparently possessed a faculty for\r\nstating strongly a weak case; and in the course of this letter to Lord\r\nPalmerston he taxed his ability to show that the right of sovereignty\r\nin New Zealand had vested in Britain since the discovery of the\r\nIslands by Captain Cook; that it had been confirmed by numerous\r\ndiplomatic acts in all the years since then, and could not now be\r\nabandoned on the mere whim of a Minister.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of his trenchant review of the position Mr. Somes\r\ndeclared that the sovereignty of England in New Zealand had been over\r\nand over again asserted and exercised. Whether it could be\r\nsubsequently abandoned by such documents as the Treasury Minute and\r\ninstructions was a question in constitutional and international law on\r\nwhich his Lordship was of course far more competent to judge than they\r\ncould pretend to be. But that there was recently a British sovereignty\r\neither to maintain or to abandon the Company had no sort of doubt. He\r\npointed out that in the year 1769, Captain Cook, acting under a\r\ncommission from the Crown of England, took possession of the Islands\r\nof New Zealand, in the name of His Majesty, George III. This act was\r\nperformed in the most formal manner, and was published to the world.\r\n\"We are not aware,\" he wrote, \"that it was ever questioned by any\r\nforeign power. It constituted sovereignty by possession. The Law of\r\nNations, we believe, recognises no other mode of assuming dominion in\r\na country, of which the inhabitants are so barbarous as to be ignorant\r\nof the meaning of the word sovereignty, and therefore incapable of\r\nceding sovereign rights. This was the case with the New Zealanders,\r\nfrom whom it would have been impossible for Captain Cook to have\r\nobtained, except in mockery of truth, a British sovereignty by\r\ncession. Sovereignty by possession is that which the British Crown\r\nmaintains in a large portion of its foreign dependencies. In this\r\nyear, 1787, a Royal Commission was granted to Captain Philip\r\nappointing him in pursuance of the British sovereignty in\r\npossession, which had previously been established by Captain Cook,\r\n\"Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief in and over the territory of\r\nNew South Wales and its dependencies.\" This territory was described in\r\nthe commission as \"Extending from Cape York, latitude 11° 37´ south,\r\nto the South Cape, latitude 43° 30´ south, and inland to the westward\r\nas far as 135° east longitude, comprehending all the Islands adjacent\r\nin the Pacific Ocean, within the latitudes of the above-named capes.\"\r\nThis is the Act by which the Crown first assumed the Government of\r\nNew South Wales and the other barbarous lands of which Captain Cook\r\nhad taken possession in the name of the King. The Islands of New\r\nZealand are as clearly within the prescribed limits as Norfolk Island,\r\nVan Dieman's Land, or even New South Wales itself. On November 9,\r\n1814, the Governor and Captain-General of New South Wales and its\r\ndependencies, acting on the representation of the Crown, by public\r\nproclamation, declared New Zealand to be a Dependency of his\r\nGovernment, and by regular commission of _dedimus potestatem_\r\nappointed Justices of the Peace to act there. Some of the Magistrates\r\nso appointed were aboriginal natives of the country. It is plain that\r\nthey were treated as British subjects. In 1819 again Governor\r\nMacquarrie appointed an English Magistrate in New Zealand. This\r\nJustice of the Peace exercised the authority so bestowed on him by\r\napprehending offenders and sending them for trial to the seat of\r\nGovernment. In 1823 a British Act of Parliament (4 George IV. cap. 96)\r\nextended the jurisdiction of the Courts of New South Wales to New\r\nZealand by name, and also to other places in the Southern Pacific not\r\nwithin the latitudes previously mentioned. Under this authority\r\nseveral persons, we understand, have been tried in New South Wales for\r\noffences committed in New Zealand, and we have been informed that\r\nproperty in New Zealand, as well real as personal, has been made the\r\nsubject of the Bankruptcy law of New South Wales. The authority of the\r\nBritish Crown was frequently enforced by means of ships of war, and\r\nalthough it cannot be asserted that regular government was ever\r\nestablished in New Zealand, far more than was essential to creating\r\nBritish dependency seems to have been performed. The Islands thus\r\ncontinued in a state of dependency until the year 1831, when a series\r\nof proceedings commenced by which the sovereignty of Britain may\r\nperhaps have been forfeited. An officer was appointed to reside at the\r\nBay of Islands. He presented to certain native chiefs, as from the\r\nCrown of England, what was termed \"a national flag.\" This might have\r\nbeen considered a transfer to these chiefs of the British\r\nsovereignty, if the Resident had not been 'accredited' to certain\r\nofficers of the Church Missionary Society, then settled at the Bay of\r\nIslands. By the latter act the sovereignty of the Islands would almost\r\nseem to have been transferred to these Missionaries. But in October\r\n1835 this diplomatic agent assembled certain native chiefs residing in\r\nthe Northern part of the North Island, called them a \"Confederation,\"\r\nand sanctioned a declaration of Native Independence, to which their\r\nnames were appended. This last act appears, by all accounts, to have\r\nbeen a mere mockery of its ostensible purport. The tribes of New\r\nZealand are so entirely distinct, so utterly destitute of nationality,\r\nas to have no name for the whole country which they inhabit. A\r\nnational name was invented for this occasion--the words _Na Terrene_\r\nwhich express the native pronunciation of the English words \"New\r\nZealand.\" The only parties besides to the so-called Declaration of\r\nIndependence were the chiefs of a few tribes then inhabiting a small\r\npart of one of the Islands. These even, inasmuch as their language\r\ncontains no words to express nationality, sovereignty, or\r\nindependence, must have been unconscious instruments of the Resident,\r\nor of the Missionaries, to whom that officer was accredited, as if\r\nthey (the Missionaries) had been the sovereigns of New Zealand. If\r\nindeed the sovereignty was delegated to the Missionaries they could,\r\nbeing British subjects, have held it as trustees for the Crown. If the\r\nsovereignty of the natives was then acknowledged it extended only to a\r\nsmall part of one Island inhabited by the parties to the Declaration.\r\nAnd in either case this mockery of an independent sovereign\r\nnationality has been set at naught by the power in whose name it took\r\nplace, inasmuch as the jurisdiction of British law, and the armed\r\nauthority of British warships have been exercised since in the same\r\nway as before the Bay of Islands' Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\n\"I beg leave,\" continued Mr. Somes, \"to assure your Lordship in the\r\nname of my colleagues that we intrude on you with the greatest\r\nreluctance. But we have felt that it was incumbent on us especially\r\nduring the recess of Parliament to convey to your Lordship the\r\ninformation that we have received as to the state of feeling in France\r\non this subject, so that if unhappily the British sovereignty of New\r\nZealand were lost it should be through no fault of ours. We fear that\r\nthe measures recently adopted by the Colonial Department may, unless\r\npromptly remedied, lead to very disastrous results. We are deeply\r\nconcerned for the fate of a large and most respectable body of our\r\ncountrymen, who have emigrated under our auspices. Connected as\r\nseveral of us are with the commercial and shipping interests of the\r\ncountry, and knowing therefore how much importance they attach to the\r\nBritish possession of New Zealand, as they have frequently stated in\r\nmemorials to the Treasury and Board of Trade, we have felt that it was\r\na duty to express to your Lordship the apprehensions which we\r\nentertain. We have been told that a French frigate recently sailed for\r\nthe South Seas with sealed orders, and some of the French newspapers\r\nreport, with expressions of satisfaction, that the Government of the\r\nUnited States of America has appointed a Consul in New Zealand, to be\r\naccredited to 'the Confederation of chiefs,' and has sent him to his\r\ndestination in a man-of-war, which is to remain under his orders.\r\nThese statements may be untrue, or only premature, but in either case\r\nCaptain Hobson's instructions which attach two conditions, either or\r\nboth of which may be unattainable, to the exercise of any authority by\r\nhim in New Zealand, namely possession of the land by British subjects,\r\nand cession by the natives of the sovereignty over such land, are\r\ncalculated to invite foreign pretensions which otherwise would never\r\nhave been imagined.\"\r\n\r\nThis protest was taken most philosophically by Lord Palmerston, who\r\nmerely passed it on to Lord John Russell, who had now succeeded Lord\r\nNormanby at the Colonial Office. Lord John treated it even more\r\nphilosophically, for it was not for several months (March 11, 1840)\r\nthat he deigned to reply, and then only after he had been reminded of\r\nthe omission by the Foreign Office. In the meantime all need of\r\nfurther argument had been obviated by the success of Captain Hobson's\r\nmission, and so the Colonial Secretary wasted no words in rhetoric,\r\nbut forwarded to his colleague a memorandum couched in concise\r\nofficial terms, setting out in sequence the events which in the light\r\nof International law would be used as evidence against any claim to\r\nBritish sovereignty, and which contained all the information it\r\nappeared necessary to afford in answer to the communication from Mr.\r\nSomes.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand the indignation of the Company on learning of\r\nthe Minister's repudiation of British sovereignty in New Zealand,\r\nbecause it sapped the very foundations of their scheme, seeing that it\r\nwas illegal for British subjects to establish colonies outside the\r\nlimits of the Empire without the sanction of the Crown. They had\r\nalways presupposed the existence of a British sovereignty over New\r\nZealand and upon that supposition all their calculations had been\r\nbuilt. Now the basis of their building had gone, they adroitly\r\npretended that what grieved them was not so much their loss as that\r\nthe repudiation of British authority was a national calamity, and that\r\nwhat was the neglect of Britain became the opportunity of France.\r\n\r\nThe position taken up by the Government was, however, perfectly sound,\r\nand was the only logical one they could occupy. Whether previous\r\nGovernments had acted wisely and well in declining to embrace the\r\nopportunity to colonise which Cook's discovery had opened to them, may\r\nbe a debatable question, but the fact at this date was that the golden\r\nopportunity had passed, and that by subsequent diplomatic acts,\r\ndeliberately taken, the independence of the Maori people had been\r\nclearly and emphatically acknowledged. \"The answers,\" wrote Lord John\r\nRussell to Lord Palmerston, \"which would be made by foreign nations to\r\nsuch a claim as that put forward by Mr. Somes are two. First that the\r\nBritish Statute Book has, in the present century, in three distinct\r\nenactments, declared that New Zealand is not a part of the British\r\nDominions, and secondly that King William IV. made the most public,\r\nsolemn, and authentic declaration which it was possible to make that\r\nNew Zealand was a substantive and independent state. The resolution by\r\nthe King, Lords, and Commons of Great Britain of the fact that New\r\nZealand is not a part of the British Dominions will be found in the\r\nStatutes 57 George III. cap. 53, 4 George IV. cap. 96, sec. 3, and\r\n9 George IV. cap. 83, sec. 4.\"\r\n\r\nThe Act of 57 George III. cap. 53 is entitled \"An Act for the more\r\neffectual punishment of murders and manslaughters committed in places\r\nnot within His Majesty's dominions.\" It sets forth--\"Whereas grievous\r\nmurders and manslaughters have been committed at the settlement of the\r\nBay of Honduras in South America, etc.,\" \"and the like offences have\r\nalso been committed in the South Pacific Ocean, as well on the high\r\nseas as on land, in the Islands of New Zealand and Otaheite, and in\r\nother Islands, countries, and places not within His Majesty's\r\ndominions, by the Masters and crews of British ships, and other\r\npersons who have for the most part deserted from or left their ships,\r\nand have continued to live and reside amongst the inhabitants of those\r\nIslands, etc.,\" and the Act then provides for the punishment of\r\noffences so committed \"in the said Islands of New Zealand and\r\nOtaheite, or within any other Islands, countries, or places, not\r\nwithin His Majesty's dominions, nor subject to any other European\r\nState or power,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThe Statute 4 George IV. cap. 96, sec. 3 enacts that the Supreme\r\nCourts in the colonies of New South Wales and Van Dieman's Land may\r\ntry offences \"committed in the islands of New Zealand, Otaheite, or\r\nany other Island, country, or place, situate in the Indian or Pacific\r\nOceans, and not subject to His Majesty or to any European State,\" if\r\nsuch offences were committed by British subjects.\r\n\r\nThe Statute 9 George IV. cap. 83, sec. 4 repeats that enactment in the\r\nsame words, adding only that the punishment of the offence shall be\r\nthe same as if the crime had been committed in England.\r\n\r\nThe recognition by King William IV. of New Zealand as a substantive\r\nand independent state is shown in the following narrative:\r\n\r\n\"On November 16 a letter to King William IV. from thirteen of the\r\nchiefs of New Zealand was transmitted to Lord Goderich, praying the\r\nprotection of the British Crown against the neighbouring tribes and\r\nagainst British subjects residing in the Islands. On June 14, 1832,\r\nLord Ripon despatched Mr. Busby as British Resident, partly to protect\r\nBritish Commerce, and partly to repress the outrages of British\r\nsubjects on the natives. His Lordship sent with Mr. Busby a letter to\r\nthe chiefs, in which the King was made to address them as an\r\nindependent people. Their support was requested for Mr. Busby, and\r\nthey were reminded of the benefits which they would derive from 'the\r\nfriendship and alliance with Great Britain.'\r\n\r\n\"In the month of June 1832 a Bill was brought into the House of\r\nCommons for the prevention of crimes committed by His Majesty's\r\nsubjects 'in New Zealand, and in other Islands in the Pacific not\r\nbeing within His Majesty's dominions.' The Bill was rejected because\r\nParliament could not lawfully legislate for a foreign country.\r\n\r\n\"On April 13, 1833, the Governor of New South Wales, in obedience to\r\nLord Ripon's (formerly Lord Goderich) orders, addressed instructions\r\nto Mr. Busby, in which New Zealand was expressly mentioned as a\r\nforeign country, and Mr. Busby himself as being accredited to the\r\nchiefs. That document throughout assumes the independence of New\r\nZealand.\r\n\r\n\"On April 29, 1834, General Bourke transmitted to Lord Stanley a\r\nproposal from Mr. Busby for establishing a national flag for the\r\ntribes of New Zealand, 'in their collective capacity,' and advised\r\nthat ships built in the Island and registered by the chiefs should\r\nhave their registers respected in their intercourse with British\r\npossessions. Sir R. Bourke reported that he had sent three patterns of\r\nflags, one of which had been selected by the chiefs; that the chiefs\r\nhad accordingly assembled with the commanders of the British and three\r\nAmerican ships, to witness the inauguration of the flag, at which the\r\nofficers of H.M.S. _Alligator_ were also present. The flag had been\r\ndeclared to be 'the national flag' of New Zealand, and being hoisted,\r\nwas saluted with twenty-one guns by the _Alligator_, a British\r\nship-of-war.\r\n\r\n\"On November 21, 1834, a despatch was addressed to Sir Richard Bourke\r\nby Lord Aberdeen, approving of all these proceedings in the name of\r\nthe King, and sending a copy of a letter from the Admiralty, stating\r\nthat they had instructed their officers to give effect to the New\r\nZealand Registers, and to acknowledge and respect the national flag of\r\nNew Zealand.\r\n\r\n\"If these solemn Acts[45] of Parliament, and of the King of Great\r\nBritain, are not enough to show that the pretension made on behalf of\r\nHer Majesty by this Company is unfounded, it might still further be\r\nrepelled by a minute narrative of all the relations between New\r\nZealand and the adjacent British colonies. It is presumed, however,\r\nthat after the preceding statement it would be superfluous to\r\naccumulate arguments of that nature and the rather because they could\r\nnot be intelligibly stated without entering into long and tedious\r\ndetails.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this discussion was proceeding in England, Captain Hobson was\r\nhappily on his way to Sydney, with his instructions rendered still\r\nmore explicit[46] by further explanation from Lord Normanby, thus\r\neliminating, as far as human forethought could provide, the\r\npossibility of misunderstanding as to the extent of his authority, or\r\nto the sincerity of the broad humanitarian principles which were to\r\ngovern his conduct towards the natives.\r\n\r\nReaching Sydney late in December 1839[47] he immediately reported\r\nhimself to Sir George Gipps, who entered into the spirit of the\r\nenterprise with his characteristic enthusiasm for the service of the\r\nEmpire. During their official negotiations the final arrangements were\r\ncompleted agreeably to the intentions of the Colonial Secretary.\r\nCaptain Hobson was placed in the possession of the Proclamation under\r\nthe Great Seal, by which the Government of New South Wales was\r\nextended to any territory which might be acquired as the result of\r\nHobson's mission \"in those Islands commonly called New Zealand.\"\r\nSimultaneously he was presented with his own Commission as\r\nLieutenant-Governor of any such territory, and with the proclamations\r\nhe was to issue in New Zealand, as circumstances rendered necessary or\r\nadvisable. He was also placed in possession of further instructions\r\nfrom Sir George Gipps, who laid special stress upon the financial\r\nrelations existing between the two colonies. \"My responsibility for\r\nthe due expenditure of the public money of this colony,\" he said, \"is\r\none of which I cannot divest myself, and where responsibility is there\r\nalso must be control. The extent to which establishments are to be\r\nerected in New Zealand, the salaries to be paid to public officers,\r\nand the expenditure of public money on public works, must for the\r\npresent be fixed by myself on estimates and reports or proposals to be\r\nforwarded by you.\" Close enquiry was also made into the legal question\r\nwhich Captain Hobson had raised with Lord Normanby when seeking fuller\r\ninformation regarding his powers of administration. Hobson desired the\r\npower to appoint and suspend Magistrates; to pardon offences and remit\r\nsentences, and to exercise original control, which the insular position\r\nof New Zealand seemed to demand, but which was seldom conferred upon\r\nthose holding the subordinate office of Lieutenant-Governor. To this\r\nrequest Lord Normanby had replied that all the powers necessary for\r\nthe proper conduct of his office would be conferred upon him by acts\r\nof the Governor and Legislature of New South Wales. Hobson was\r\nunconvinced, but deferentially refrained from pitting his lay opinion\r\nagainst that which he naturally assumed was based upon the wider\r\nknowledge possessed by the Department. Sir George Gipps had no such\r\nreservations, and at once declared his inability to delegate to\r\nanother powers which had only been delegated to him.\r\n\r\nIn communicating his final instructions to the Lieutenant-Governor,\r\nGipps wrote: \"With respect to certain powers or prerogations of the\r\nCrown, with which Governors of colonies are usually entrusted, it is\r\nnecessary for me to point out to you that though I am myself\r\nauthorised by Her Majesty to exercise them in her name, and on her\r\nbehalf, I have no power to delegate the exercise of them to another.\r\nFrom this, which is an inherent maxim in law, it will, I believe\r\nfollow:\r\n\r\n\"(1) That you will not have power to pardon offences, or to remit\r\nsentences pronounced on offenders in due course of law, though you may\r\nstay the execution of the law.\r\n\r\n\"(2) That you will not be authorised to suspend officers holding\r\nappointments direct from Her Majesty, though you may recommend to me\r\nthe suspension of them. With respect to persons holding appointments\r\nfrom me you will have the power of suspension, and over such as hold\r\nappointments from yourself a power of dismissal unless they may have\r\nbeen previously recommended by you for confirmation in the service, in\r\nwhich case your power will extend only to suspension.\r\n\r\n\"(3) You will not have power of appointing Magistrates, though of\r\ncourse you will recommend to me such persons as you may think fit to\r\nbe appointed.\r\n\r\n\"(4) In the event of the enrolment of a militia, the same will hold\r\ngood respecting the appointment of officers.\"\r\n\r\nA staff of officials for the due conduct of the civil business of the\r\ncountry was also appointed,[48] even to a small force of policemen,\r\nand with an almost prophetic punctiliousness for detail, a Commission\r\nwas prepared for his successor in the event of Hobson's death, so that\r\nthere might be no break in the continuity of official control.\r\n\r\nWith these preliminaries settled, Governor Gipps, on January 14,\r\nissued three proclamations: (1) extending the boundaries of New South\r\nWales to New Zealand; (2) proclaiming Captain Hobson Lieutenant-Governor\r\nof those Islands, and \"calling upon all British subjects to the aiding\r\nand assisting of the said William Hobson in the exercise of his said\r\nduty\"; (3) to put an end to the speculation in New Zealand lands then\r\nbeing openly carried on in Sydney.\r\n\r\nThe _Herald_, a frigate of twenty guns, commanded by Captain\r\nNias, lay in Spring Cove, waiting to convey the Queen's representative\r\nand his party to New Zealand.[49] At six o'clock on the evening of\r\nSaturday the 18th the staff appointed to accompany the Consul joined\r\nthe vessel, and at a somewhat later hour Captain Hobson himself went\r\non board. Under the influence of a fine N.E. wind, a full moon shining\r\ndown upon the harbour, the _Herald_ left Port Jackson and headed\r\nfor the Bay of Islands. Fine weather was experienced in the Tasman Sea\r\nand on Sunday the 26th, while a gentle breeze filled the sails and\r\nsoft zephyrs whispered through the cordage, Captain Nias conducted\r\nDivine service on the gun deck, which was attended by the whole ship's\r\ncompany, and \"a more beautiful and impressive scene I never\r\nwitnessed,\" is the description of the ceremony given by Mr. Felton\r\nMathew, who was coming with Hobson as the Surveyor-General to the new\r\ncolony. At daylight on the following morning the Three Kings were\r\nsighted, and shortly after the mainland came into view. Two days were\r\nspent in beating up the coast, and again at daylight on the 29th, the\r\n_Herald_ entered the Bay of Islands, drifting with the tide, there\r\nbeing not a breath of wind. All the morning was spent in this tedious\r\nprocess, and it was not till eleven o'clock that the anchor was cast\r\nin front of the little town of Kororareka.[50] Across the Bay the\r\nUnion Jack was flying in front of Mr. Busby's residence, but what most\r\nattracted the attention and excited the interest of those on board was\r\nthe French tricolour floating from a staff upon the hill-side above\r\nthe township. \"What this may indicate,\" wrote Mr. Mathew in his diary,\r\n\"we have yet to learn--whether it is merely a French Missionary\r\nestablishment or whether a French frigate is at anchor in the Bay and\r\nhas anticipated us, we shall soon discover.\"\r\n\r\n[40] Captain Hobson had acquired some distinction in the Navy by the\r\ncapture of a band of pirates in the Mediterranean, the personal\r\nbravery displayed by him on that occasion being decidedly meritorious.\r\nHe was afterwards engaged with the sloop-of-war _Rattlesnake_,\r\nand first attracted political notice by his report to the Government\r\non the state of Society in New Zealand. Major Bunbury, who had\r\nconsiderable personal knowledge of him, describes him as an officer\r\nwho wrote a good despatch, was fluent of speech, and was not without\r\nabilities, but had not the necessary grasp of thought to seize the\r\nmain point of a question--to separate the grain from the chaff. He was\r\nvery jealous of his authority and obstinate, particularly as disease\r\nmade encroachment on his frame and intellect. He was of social habits\r\nand had the faculty of making private friends and also of creating\r\npublic enemies. Mrs. Hobson is described as \"an interesting person.\"\r\n\r\n[41] This Proclamation was not enclosed amongst the official\r\ncorrespondence delivered to Captain Hobson upon his leaving England,\r\nand the deficiency was supplied by one drafted by Sir George Gipps and\r\nhis Executive.\r\n\r\n[42] _Vide_ his instructions to Captain Hobson, August 14, 1839.\r\n\r\n[43] The _Journal de Havre_ was particularly active in discussing\r\nNew Zealand at this time.\r\n\r\n[44] It is suggested that the real advocate was Edward Gibbon\r\nWakefield.\r\n\r\n[45] These Acts were quoted as evidences of Britain's repudiation of\r\nsovereignty in New Zealand, by M. Guizot, the French Foreign Minister,\r\nduring the debate on the sovereignty question in the Chamber of\r\nDeputies on May 29, 1844.\r\n\r\n[46] After perusing the original draft of his instructions, Captain\r\nHobson referred several matters therein back to the Minister for\r\nfurther explanation, and on August 15, 1839, Lord Normanby replied in\r\na memorandum which amplified his intentions, but in no way changed\r\ntheir spirit.\r\n\r\n[47] On arrival at Sydney Captain Hobson was waited on by a deputation\r\nof New Zealand landowners, who requested to know his views regarding\r\ntheir lands. With his answers to their questions the deputation was in\r\ngeneral satisfied, as he encouraged them to occupy their lands and\r\nproceed with their improvements. Subsequently an address of Welcome\r\nwas presented to him at Government House, and he appeared highly\r\nflattered by the compliment paid him.\r\n\r\n[48] \"Captain Hobson is accompanied by several officers, selected for\r\ntheir known incompetency by Sir George Gipps. What assistance he is to\r\nexpect from these persons I do not know, but they are evidently sent\r\nto New Zealand because Sir George Gipps has no use for their services\r\nhere, and was consequently anxious to get rid of them.\" Dr. Martin's\r\n_New Zealand Letters_.\r\n\r\n[49] The ship _Westminster_ was also engaged to convey stores to\r\nNew Zealand so soon as word should be received of the success of\r\nCaptain Hobson's mission. The _Westminster_ reached the Bay of\r\nIslands on March 17, 1840, bringing with her Mr. and Mrs. Burrows and\r\nMr. and Mrs. Matthew for the C.M.S. Mission.\r\n\r\n[50] I am indebted to Mr. H. M. Stowell (Hare Hongi) for the following\r\nnote on the origin and meaning of _Kororareka_; the ancient name\r\nof the town of Russell.\r\n\r\n_Kororareka_ has several original native names:\r\n\r\n1. _O-kiato_: _kiato_ means confined, of circumscribed area;\r\nand this describes its situation exactly.\r\n\r\n2. _Wai-taha-rua_: This means, two-sided water, or, the double\r\nwaterside. This also describes its situation for it has a fine\r\nfrontage to the Bay itself, and an arm of the Bay runs up to its\r\nback-door (so to speak).\r\n\r\n3. _Kororareka_: _Korora-reka_, means Sweet-penguin. This\r\nhas remained its favourite name, and it originated in the following\r\nincident: An old high chief lay here dying. He expressed a wish to\r\ntaste a little of the penguin bird before dying. Now this bird is a\r\nrarity in those waters. So many young men of the tribe went off in\r\ntheir canoes and scoured the headlands, isles, and islets for miles\r\naround the Bay. At length two young men were fortunate enough to\r\ndiscover a penguin, a real _Korora_, or blue penguin, which they\r\nmanaged to capture. They hastened back with their catch, and the bird\r\nwas feathered and cleaned and boiled in the ancient manner of boiling.\r\nThis was to place the bird in a deep wooden bowl, cover it well with\r\nwater, and keep that water boiling by dropping red-hot stones in it\r\nfrom an oven by its side.\r\n\r\nThe bird being cooked in this way was served up to the old chief, but\r\nbeing unable to chew or to eat any portion he begged for a little of\r\nthe water (soup) in which it had been boiled. This was brought to him,\r\nand having been assisted to a partially seated position he drank some\r\nof the \"soup,\" after which he sank back on his pillow, murmured:\r\n\"_Ka reka te Korora_\" and immediately expired. Now, _Ka reka te\r\nKorora_, means: How _sweet_ is the Penguin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE MAORI MAGNA CHARTA\r\n\r\n\r\nSo soon as the _Herald_ was come to anchor she was boarded by Mr.\r\nBusby and three of the resident Missionaries, from whom Captain Hobson\r\nlearned that his apprehensions regarding French occupancy were\r\ngroundless, the tricolour on the hill indicating no more than the\r\nwhereabouts of Bishop Pompallier's church. One of the visitors who had\r\ncome thus early to pay his respects to the new Governor was Mr.\r\nColenso, with whom Captain Hobson entered into an arrangement for the\r\nprinting, at the press of the Church Missionary Society, of circular\r\nletters inviting the chiefs to meet him at Mr. Busby's residence at\r\nWaitangi on the following Wednesday, for the purpose of discussing the\r\nproposals of the British Government; and to all the British residents\r\nrequesting their presence at the Mission church at Kororareka on the\r\nfollowing day, there to hear Her Majesty's Commission under the Great\r\nSeal, extending the limits of the colony of New South Wales, and also\r\nHer Majesty's Commission under the Royal signet and Sign manual,\r\nappointing Captain Hobson as Lieutenant-Governor over such part of\r\nthat colony as might be acquired in Sovereignty in New Zealand. These\r\ninvitations were in circulation on the following morning, messengers\r\nbeing despatched to inform the chiefs, while the European residents\r\nperused the notice issued to them with marked interest and mixed\r\nfeelings. During the afternoon Captain Hobson, accompanied by Captain\r\nNias and his officers, landed on the Kororareka beach, and walking to\r\nthe church there read his Letters Patent in the presence of the\r\nassembled people, forty of whom so far signified their approval of the\r\nproceedings as to subscribe their names to the document. The\r\nproclamations framed by Sir George Gipps and his Executive were also\r\nread, the first announcing that Her Majesty's authority had been\r\nasserted over British subjects in New Zealand; the second, which was\r\nby no means so popular, acquainting the public of the fact that Her\r\nMajesty did not deem it expedient to acknowledge as valid any titles\r\nto land in New Zealand which were not derived from, or confirmed by, a\r\ngrant from the Crown.\r\n\r\nThese ceremonies concluded, the intervening days were spent in\r\ncompleting arrangements for the fateful gathering on the 5th, not the\r\nleast arduous duty being the drafting of the treaty, upon the\r\nacceptance or rejection of which everything would depend. The\r\nexigencies of the position demanded that the greatest care should be\r\nexercised in framing the terms of the document,[51] because while it\r\nwas desired that the proposal of the Crown should be stated with the\r\nutmost frankness, the least looseness of expression might imperil the\r\nwhole project by raising ungrounded alarm in the minds of the natives.\r\n\r\nTo guard against this it was necessary that those concerned in the\r\npreparation of the treaty should have not only a full knowledge of the\r\nCrown's intentions, but also an intimate acquaintance with the\r\nsubtleties of the native character. This latter qualification neither\r\nCaptain Hobson nor the members of his staff possessed even in a remote\r\ndegree. To add to their difficulties, Captain Hobson began now to\r\nexperience the first symptoms of that illness which in less than three\r\nyears proved fatal to him. He became indisposed, and was unable to\r\nleave the _Herald_. In the seclusion of his cabin, however, he devoted\r\nhimself to an effort to reduce to concrete terms the obligations in\r\nwhich the Crown was prepared to involve itself, and the reciprocating\r\nadvantages it would require from the natives. In this he achieved but\r\nmeagre success, and conscious of failure he despatched his chief\r\nclerk, Mr. George Cooper, to Mr. Busby, giving him his rough notes\r\ntogether with a request that the erstwhile Resident might favour him\r\nwith his opinion as to their suitability as the basis of the treaty.\r\n\r\nMr. Busby had no hesitation in saying that he regarded them as quite\r\nunsuitable, but offered to prepare the draft treaty for Captain\r\nHobson's consideration, if such a service would be acceptable. To this\r\nMr. Cooper replied that nothing would afford His Excellency greater\r\npleasure, as he recognised that Mr. Busby's seven years of official\r\ntraining and native experience had furnished him with many\r\nqualifications for the task. The result was entirely satisfactory. The\r\ndraft prepared by Mr. Busby was adopted by Captain Hobson without\r\nalteration beyond the transposition of certain paragraphs, which did\r\nnot in any degree affect the spirit or the sense of what has long been\r\nregarded as the Maori Magna Charta.\r\n\r\nA pleasant interlude was afforded by the presentation to Captain\r\nHobson of an Address of Welcome by forty-five of the settlers, in\r\nwhich they expressed their gratification at his safe arrival, and at\r\nthe early prospect of the establishment of British law and authority\r\nin the Islands, which had long been the desire nearest to their\r\nhearts. They expressed equal gratification at the appointment of a\r\ngentleman as Lieutenant-Governor so distinguished for courage,\r\nfirmness, justice, and humanity as Captain Hobson, presaging as it did\r\na bright era of prosperity for the colony. They expressed their\r\nreadiness to await with patience the unfolding of a scheme of\r\ngovernment in which the best interests of all were involved, and\r\npromised not only to continue the service of loyal subjects of the\r\nQueen, but to aid with their best exertions her representative in\r\nestablishing order, law, and security for life and property in what\r\nthey were pleased to designate \"this improving and important colony.\"\r\n\r\nAs was becoming of him, Captain Hobson replied in most gracious\r\nterms, which seemed to indicate the existence of a useful harmony\r\nbetween the new Governor and the more decently-disposed settlers.\r\n\r\nNot so the speculative element, who were deeply chagrined at the\r\nunexpected turn affairs had taken. To these law-breakers the arrival\r\nof Hobson meant the complete suspension of their future operations,\r\nand what was equally distasteful, a revision of their past\r\ntransactions. Their hope, therefore, lay in preventing the\r\nconsummation of the official plan, and before the Lieutenant-Governor\r\nhad been at the Bay twelve hours, the lawless and the land-grabber\r\nwere busy poisoning the native mind against the Governor's proposal,\r\ntelling them with many dark insinuations and bitter taunts, that now\r\nthey were to be made _taurekareka_--the \"slaves\" of the Queen.\r\n\r\nThese mischievous suggestions naturally had a disquieting influence\r\nupon the minds of many of the chiefs, who had not as yet gathered the\r\nfull purport of the impending change, and whose haughty spirit\r\nrebelled against the prospect of any loss in tribal dignity.\r\nFortunately they were able to appeal with confidence to the\r\nMissionaries, and to the credit of that body it must be said that they\r\nwere as loyal to their country as they had already proved themselves\r\nfaithful to their church. Mr. Henry Williams, the head of the Church\r\nMissionary Society's group of Missionaries, than whom no man wielded\r\ngreater influence with the natives at this period, was not at the Bay\r\nof Islands when the _Herald_ arrived. He had just returned to the\r\nWaimate Mission station from the Manawatu, whither he had gone with\r\nTamihana Te Rauparaha, and Matene te Whiwhi, to install the Rev.\r\nOctavius Hadfield in his West Coast charge. The hurried decision of\r\nthe Home Government to forestall the New Zealand Company had been as\r\nunknown to him as it was to the other residents of New Zealand, and\r\nthe first intimation he had that the change he so much desired was\r\nnear fruition, was a letter from the Bishop of Australia informing him\r\nof Captain Hobson's arrival in Sydney, and the rumoured report of his\r\nmission. Bishop Broughton earnestly advised the Missionary to assist\r\nCaptain Hobson to the end that success might crown his efforts.[52]\r\n\r\nClosely following upon this came a letter, dated January 30, 1840,\r\nfrom Captain Hobson, inviting Mr. Williams to meet him at his earliest\r\nconvenience, and although it was late at night when the messenger\r\narrived, he made immediate preparations to comply with the request.\r\nLeaving home early in the morning the energetic Missionary boarded the\r\n_Herald_ that afternoon, and congratulated the newly-arrived\r\nGovernor upon his coming, which indeed was a pleasant surprise. He\r\nassured him of the hearty support of the Missionaries in the purpose\r\nof establishing Her Majesty's authority in the Islands, and of his own\r\npersonal aid to any extent that it might be of service to him.\r\n\r\nOf this offer Captain Hobson availed himself a few days later, when at\r\n4 P.M. on February 4 he brought to him the draft of the\r\ntreaty which had been prepared for submission to the chiefs at\r\nWaitangi on the morrow, and asked that he might be good enough to\r\ntranslate it into the native language. In this Mr. Williams had the\r\nassistance of his son Edward, who was then regarded as the scholar\r\n_par excellence_ in the Nga-Puhi dialect, the purest of all the\r\ndialects of the Maori tongue.\r\n\r\nThe task of translation was necessarily a difficult one, it being\r\nessential that there should be a complete avoidance of all expressions\r\nof the English for which there was no equivalent in Maori, and yet\r\npermitting no alterations which would destroy the original spirit and\r\ntenor of the treaty. Upon its completion the work was revised by Mr.\r\nBusby, who suggested the elimination of the word _huihuinga_ used\r\nby the translators, and the substitution of _whakaminenga_ to\r\nmore adequately express the idea of the Maori Confederation of Chiefs.\r\nWith this exception the translation was adopted, and the excellence\r\nof its rendering may be judged from the fact that though it has been\r\nmany times tried by the most accomplished of Maori scholars, the\r\ntranslation has never been shaken, and stands to-day a perfect native\r\nreflex of the European mind, conveying in all probability a clearer\r\nview to the Maori of what the treaty meant than the English version\r\nhas done to the average _Pakeha_.\r\n\r\nThe scene chosen for the conference with the chiefs was the lawn in\r\nfront of Mr. Busby's house,[53] which stands upon a gently sloping\r\npromontory directly opposite the old town of Kororareka. A large and\r\ncommodious building, with its French casements, cedar doors, and\r\nold-fashioned fittings, it looks out across the Bay from the seclusion\r\nof its plantation of imported trees. Down between the house and the\r\nsea beach there runs a grassy slope, at the termination of which rises\r\na grove of the beautiful _Pohutukawa_, which had just shed their\r\nblaze of Christmas bloom when Captain Hobson arrived.\r\n\r\nTo the right flow the tidal waters of the Waitangi River, whose falls\r\nfour miles beyond its mouth have given their name to the district.[54]\r\nUpon the flat which fringes the river bank, the Maoris camped amongst\r\nthe cabbage palms, and the smoke of their fires might have been seen\r\ncurling upwards until it was lost in the mists of the morning air.\r\nStill farther to the right, and across the river, under the\r\nforest-clad hill, nestled the little Mission station of Paihia, where\r\nMr. Colenso was industriously producing copies of the New Testament\r\nfrom his primitive printing-press. Away to the left, in Oihi Bay,\r\nstands the cross marking the spot where the first Christian sermon was\r\npreached to the Maoris by Samuel Marsden, on Christmas Day of 1814,\r\nand between these two points where they had first received the spoken\r\nand the written Word, the natives were now asked to decide a question\r\nthat very largely involved their political salvation.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the auspicious day (Wednesday, February 5) broke with\r\nnature's approving smile upon it. The sun shining brightly in the\r\nHeavens lit up the blue waters of the Bay, the slopes of the brown\r\nhills, the shadows of the sombre forest in which the birds sang even\r\nmore blithely than was their wont. Many of the natives had arrived\r\nduring the previous day, and the face of the harbour was still alive\r\nwith canoes speeding from all directions to the place of meeting,\r\ntheir crews keeping time with their paddles to the chant of the\r\nexcited _Kai tuki_[55] as he stood upon the centre thwart, urging\r\nby word, song, and gesture, a more vigorous bending of broad backs and\r\nstraining of tawny arms in the hope of outstripping his opponents in\r\nthe race to Waitangi.\r\n\r\nOn shore a large marquee had been erected upon the grassy lawn in\r\nfront of Mr. Busby's residence, towards which the bunting of the\r\n_Herald_ had been liberally applied, the Union Jack waving gaily\r\nover the whole scene until the official proceedings were begun, when\r\nit was lowered as an indication that sovereignty had not yet been\r\nceded to the Queen. The ships in the harbour had likewise marked the\r\noccasion by displaying all their bright flags and in the brilliant\r\nsunlight the scene was one of picturesque animation, not the least\r\ninteresting feature being the blue-shirted settlers--British and\r\nAmerican[56]--promenading on the lawn. As a counterpoise to these\r\nthere were the groups of natives squatting on the ground, each tribe\r\ndiscussing with ample gesticulation and volubility the treaty from\r\ntheir own immediate point of view. \"Beyond the grounds,\" writes Dr.\r\nBright, \"refreshment was vended to the Europeans and many a cork\r\n(adopting a poetic phrase) escaped its glassy confines, to let out,\r\nnot a lake, but Dunbar's foaming stout, or Hodge's paler streams. Nor\r\nwere more patrician fluids wanting; nor yet ardent cognac; nor the\r\nclear burning fluid of St. Giles' dames; nor the spirit of storms,\r\nrum, which sailors gulp, ingulphing a torrid zone within no temperate\r\none--all waters of fire to the sober Maori, and which they might be\r\ntaught are waters that the Devil navigates to reach the island of the\r\nsoul. Nor was there wanting solid aliment--pork, salt and fresh, in\r\nvarious forms of hams, cold roast, pork pies, and baskets of bread and\r\nbiscuit all to be transmuted into money. Troops of natives came from\r\nall directions to the _korero_ with the _rangatira nui_, or great\r\ngentleman from England. You might inspect a group of brown skins and\r\nthen a group of white skins, and with but little puzzling discern the\r\nsame stage-stock of feelings common to both. The Europeans were very\r\nnumerous but the natives were more so, many who came from a distance\r\ncarrying guns. What, thought I, if these savages refuse to accede to\r\nthe treaty, is to hinder them from driving us into the sea, or into\r\ntheir ovens? What greater proof of their sovereignty than their\r\nwillingness to yield it up to us?\"\r\n\r\nAt 9 o'clock the Lieutenant-Governor, accompanied by Captain Nias,\r\nlanded at Waitangi, and they were shortly afterwards followed by the\r\nofficers of the ship, Lieutenant Shortland and the members of the\r\ncivil staff, and by the Missionaries who were resident in and about\r\nthe Bay of Islands.\r\n\r\nDuring this time Captain Hobson, Mr. Busby, and Mr. Henry Williams,\r\nwere engaged in a final discussion upon the treaty and its\r\ntranslation. At 10.30 Bishop Pompallier, the newly-appointed Roman\r\nCatholic Bishop of Oceania, dressed in full canonicals[57] and\r\naccompanied by one of his priests[58] arrived from Kororareka, and\r\nwithout displaying any hesitation, walked straight to Mr. Busby's\r\nhouse, and entered the room in which the Lieutenant-Governor and his\r\nassociates were in close conference. The Bishop's manner was so full\r\nof confident assurance that the two constables[59] standing on guard\r\nat the door were so completely taken by surprise that they failed to\r\nchallenge the cleric's right to enter. The incident was equally\r\nstartling in its dramatic suddenness to all the astonished onlookers,\r\nand it made a considerable impression upon the natives. In their eyes\r\nthe pomp and circumstance implied by the ecclesiastical dress meant\r\nmuch, while the air of superior authority with which the proceeding\r\nhad been carried out conveyed the suggestion to them that this man\r\nmust indeed be a _rangatira_.[60]\r\n\r\nA buzz of comment arose, the natives whispering amongst themselves,\r\n\"_Ko ia anote tino rangatira! Ko Pikopo[61] anake te hoa mo te\r\nKawana._\" \"This surely is the chief gentleman. The Bishop only is\r\nthe companion for the Governor.\"\r\n\r\nThe importance of these comments were not lost upon the Church\r\nMissionaries, who were deferentially standing outside, and a hurried\r\nconference resulted in their deciding to be on equal terms with the\r\nBishop. They accordingly moved towards the house, and had just reached\r\nthe verandah when an announcement was made that the Lieutenant-Governor\r\nintended to hold a levee in order that all who had not already been\r\nintroduced to him, and desired to have that privilege, might do so by\r\nentering at one door and passing out at another. While the\r\nintroductions were proceeding Bishop Pompallier remained in the room,\r\nand as the Missionaries were unable to take their position with him\r\nowing to the crush in the narrow passage, they made a virtue of\r\nnecessity and coldly declined to participate in the ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe levee over, and it was not a lengthy proceeding, Captain Nias and\r\nMr. Busby, preceded by the representatives of the police, came out of\r\nthe house followed by the Lieutenant-Governor, and in this order the\r\nprocession was moving towards the tent when the Bishop and his\r\nassociate stepped briskly forward and took their positions immediately\r\nbehind Captain Hobson, thus giving the Protestant Missionaries no\r\noption but to follow in his wake. \"Brethren,\" said Mr. Colenso, \"this\r\nwon't do. We must never consent to this position.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied the Rev. Richard Taylor, \"I will never consent to follow\r\nRome,\" and so saying he and his brethren quietly withdrew from the\r\nprocession and made their way unofficially towards the marquee.\r\n\r\nA raised platform had been erected at the end of the marquee, and on\r\nthis the Lieutenant-Governor and Captain Nias took their seats. Bishop\r\nPompallier and his priest were shown to chairs on the left, and Mr.\r\nHenry Williams was directed to a chair on the Governor's right. The\r\nother missionaries, Messrs. King, Kemp, Baker, Clarke, and Colenso[62]\r\nwere modestly standing behind this group when Lieutenant Shortland,\r\nwho was acting as Secretary to the Governor and as Master of\r\nCeremonies, plucked Mr. Colenso by the sleeve of his coat and said,\r\n\"Go over to that end and support your cloth,\" an intimation which,\r\naccording to Mr. Colenso, they lost no time in attending to, ranging\r\nthemselves as best they could behind Mr. Williams.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the crowd had been accumulating, and were rapidly finding\r\npositions of vantage within the tent. \"The scene,\" says an\r\neye-witness,[63] \"was very interesting and impressive. In the centre\r\nof the narrow raised platform were the Governor and Captain of the\r\nman-of-war in full uniform, on the Governor's left were Mr. Busby and\r\nthe Roman Catholic Bishop in canonicals, his massive gold chain and\r\ncrucifix glistening on his dark purple-coloured habit. On the right of\r\nHis Excellency were the members of the Church of England Mission, in\r\nplain black dresses. The different officers of the _Herald_\r\ntogether with His Excellency's suite stationed themselves as best they\r\ncould--some here and there on the platform, and some immediately\r\nbefore it. In front of the platform, in the foreground, were the\r\nprincipal native chiefs of several tribes, some clothed with dog-skin\r\nmats made of alternate longitudinal stripes of black and white hair.\r\nOthers were habited in splendid-looking new woollen cloaks[64] of\r\ncrimson, blue, brown, and plaid, and indeed of every shade of striking\r\ncolour such as I had never before seen in New Zealand, while some were\r\ndressed in plain European, and some in common native dresses. Near by,\r\nin the midst, stood Hakitara, a tall native of the Rarawa tribe,\r\ndressed in a very large and handsome silky white _Kaitaka_ mat--a\r\ngarment of the finest and best kind, and only worn by superior\r\nchiefs--fringed with a deep and dark coloured woven border of a\r\nlozenge and zigzag pattern, the whole of native and national design\r\nand manufacture. The sunlight streaming down from an aperture in the\r\ntop of the tent on this beautiful white dress, admired by natives and\r\nEuropeans alike, threw the figure of this chief into very prominent\r\nand conspicuous relief, forming a fine contrast to the deep and dark\r\nshades of colour around; whilst here and there a _hani_ or\r\n_taiaha_[65] was seen erected adorned with the long flowing white hair\r\nof the tails of the New Zealand dog, and crimson cloth and red\r\nfeathers. In the distance the raven black and glossy locks of the\r\nnatives, gracefully ornamented with the snow-white and drooping\r\nfeathers of sea-birds, and of the white crane, forming a striking\r\ncontrast, added much to the _tout ensemble_. Around the sides of the\r\ntent were the whites, residents, and settlers, by far the greater part\r\nbeing very respectably dressed; and outside of them, against the walls\r\nof the tent were flags of different nations, which from the brightness\r\nof their colours, gave a charming air of liveliness to the whole, the\r\ntable being covered by the vivid colours of the Union Jack.\"\r\n\r\nAs Captain Hobson rose from his seat the hum of human voices which\r\nfilled the tent suddenly ceased. Animated conversation gave way to an\r\nair of silent expectancy as the Queen's representative began to speak\r\nin slow and measured tones. His speech had been carefully prepared,\r\nand for the purposes of greater accuracy he relied upon extensive\r\nnotes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. BUSBY'S RESIDENCE.\r\n\r\nWhere the Treaty was signed.]\r\n\r\n\"Her Majesty Victoria, Queen of Great Britain and Ireland,\" he said,\r\n\"wishing to do good to the chiefs and people of New Zealand, and for\r\nthe welfare of her subjects living amongst you, has sent me to this\r\nplace as Governor. But as the law of England gives no civil powers to\r\nHer Majesty out of her dominions, her efforts to do you good will be\r\nfutile unless you consent. Her Majesty has commanded me to explain\r\nthese matters to you, that you may understand them. The people of\r\nGreat Britain are, thank God! free, and so long as they do not\r\ntransgress the laws, they can go where they please, and their\r\nsovereign has no power to restrain them. You have sold them lands here\r\nand encouraged them to come here. Her Majesty, always ready to protect\r\nher subjects is also always ready to restrain them. Her Majesty the\r\nQueen asks you to sign this treaty, and to give her that power which\r\nshall enable her to restrain them. I ask you for this publicly: I do\r\nnot go from one chief to another. I will give you time to consider the\r\nproposal I shall now offer you. What I wish you to do is expressly for\r\nyour own good, as you will soon see by the treaty. You yourselves have\r\noften asked the King of England to extend his protection unto you. Her\r\nMajesty now offers you that protection in this treaty. I think it is\r\nnot necessary to say any more about it. I will therefore read the\r\ntreaty.\"[66]\r\n\r\nIn a clear voice His Excellency then read the treaty in English for\r\nthe benefit of the European settlers, the terms of the document being\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n TREATY OF WAITANGI\r\n\r\n HER MAJESTY VICTORIA, Queen of the United Kingdom, of Great\r\n Britain and Ireland regarding with her Royal favour the Native chiefs\r\n and tribes in New Zealand, and anxious to protect their just rights\r\n and property, and to secure to them the enjoyment of peace and good\r\n order, has deemed it necessary in consequence of the great number of\r\n Her Majesty's subjects who have already settled in New Zealand, and\r\n the rapid extension of emigration both from Europe and Australia\r\n which is still in progress, to constitute and appoint a functionary\r\n properly authorised to treat with the aborigines of New Zealand for\r\n the recognition of Her Majesty's sovereign authority over the whole\r\n or any part of those Islands. Her Majesty, therefore, being desirous\r\n to establish a settled form of Civil Government with a view to avert\r\n the evil consequences which must result from the absence of the\r\n necessary laws and institutions, alike to the native population and\r\n to her subjects, has been graciously pleased to empower and authorise\r\n me, William Hobson, a Captain in Her Majesty's Royal Navy, Consul and\r\n Lieutenant-Governor of such parts of New Zealand as may be or\r\n hereafter shall be ceded to Her Majesty, to invite the confederate\r\n and independent chiefs of New Zealand to concur in the following\r\n articles and conditions:\r\n\r\n _Article the First_\r\n\r\n The chiefs of the Confederation of the United tribes of New Zealand,\r\n and the separate and independent chiefs who have not become members\r\n of the Confederation, cede to Her Majesty the Queen of England,\r\n absolutely and without reservation, all the rights and powers of\r\n sovereignty which the said confederation or individual chiefs\r\n respectively exercise or possess, or may be supposed to exercise or\r\n possess over their respective territories as the sole Sovereigns\r\n thereof.\r\n\r\n _Article the Second_\r\n\r\n Her Majesty, the Queen of England, confirms and guarantees to the\r\n chiefs and tribes of New Zealand, and to the respective families and\r\n individuals thereof the full, exclusive, and undisturbed possession\r\n of their lands and estates, forests, fisheries, and other properties\r\n which they may collectively or individually possess, so long as it is\r\n their wish and desire to retain the same in their possession; but the\r\n chiefs of the United tribes and the individual chiefs yield to Her\r\n Majesty the exclusive right of pre-emption over such lands as the\r\n proprietors thereof may be disposed to alienate, at such prices as\r\n may be agreed upon between the respective proprietors and persons\r\n appointed by Her Majesty to treat with them in that behalf.\r\n\r\n _Article the Third_\r\n\r\n In consideration thereof Her Majesty, the Queen of England, extends\r\n to the natives of New Zealand her Royal protection, and imparts to\r\n them all the rights and privileges of British subjects.\r\n\r\n W. HOBSON,\r\n Lieutenant-Governor.\r\n\r\n Now, therefore, we the chiefs of the Confederation of the United\r\n tribes of New Zealand, being assembled in congress at Victoria, in\r\n Waitangi, and we the separate and independent chiefs of New Zealand,\r\n claiming authority over the tribes and territories which are\r\n specified after our respective names, having been made fully to\r\n understand the provisions of the foregoing treaty, accept and enter\r\n into the same in the full spirit and meaning thereof; in witness of\r\n which we have attached our signatures or marks at the places and the\r\n dates respectively specified.\r\n\r\nWhen he had concluded, he turned to Mr. Henry Williams, and invited\r\nhim to read to the natives the translation which had been prepared in\r\nthe Maori language.\r\n\r\n\"In the midst of profound silence,\" Mr. Williams wrote in subsequent\r\nyears, \"I read the treaty to all assembled. I told all to listen with\r\ncare; explaining clause by clause to the chiefs, giving them caution\r\nnot to be in a hurry, but telling them that we, the Missionaries,\r\nfully approved of the treaty, that it was an act of love towards them,\r\non the part of the Queen, who desired to secure to them their\r\nproperty, rights, and privileges. That this treaty was a fortress to\r\nthem against any foreign power which might desire to take possession\r\nof their country, as the French had taken possession of Otiaiti.\"\r\n\r\n MAORI TRANSLATION OF THE TREATY OF WAITANGI\r\n AS PRINTED AT THE PRESS OF THE CHURCH MISSIONARY SOCIETY, PAIHIA\r\n\r\n KO, WIKITORIA, te Kuini o Ingarani i tana mahara\r\n atawai ki nga Rangatira me nga Hapu, o Nu Tirani, i tana hiahia hoki\r\n kia tohungia ki a ratou o ratou rangatiratanga, me to ratou whenua, a\r\n kia mau tonu hoki te Rongo ki a ratou me te ata noho hoki kau wakaaro\r\n ia he mea tike kia tukua mai tetahi Rangatira hei kai wakarite ki nga\r\n tangata Maori o Nu Tirini.

Because too many together\r\n are the men of her tribe who have sat down in this land and are\r\n coming hither.\r\n\r\n Now it is the Queen who desires that the Governorship may be arranged\r\n that evils may not come to the native men, to the white who dwells\r\n lawless. There! Now the Queen has been good that I should be sent,\r\n William Hobson, a Captain of the Royal Navy, a Governor for all the\r\n places in New Zealand that are yielded now or hereafter to the Queen.\r\n She says to the Chiefs of the Assemblage (Confederation) of the\r\n tribes of New Zealand, and other chiefs besides, these laws which\r\n shall be spoken now.\r\n\r\n Here's the first: Here's the chief of the Assemblage, and all the\r\n chiefs also who have not joined the Assemblage mentioned, cede to the\r\n utmost to the Queen of England for ever continually to the utmost the\r\n whole Governorship of their lands.\r\n\r\n Here's the second: Here's the Queen of England arranges and confirms\r\n to the chiefs, to all the men of New Zealand the entire chieftainship\r\n of their lands, their villages, and all their property.\r\n\r\n But here's the chiefs of the Assemblage, and all the chiefs besides,\r\n yield to the Queen the buying of those places of land where the man\r\n whose land it is shall be good to the arrangement of the payment\r\n which the buyer shall arrange to them, who is told by the Queen to\r\n buy for her.\r\n\r\n Here's the third: This, too, is an arrangement in return for the\r\n assent of the Governorship of the Queen. The Queen of England will\r\n protect all the native men of New Zealand. She yields to them all the\r\n rights, one and the same as her doings to the men of England.\r\n\r\n Now here's we: Here's the chiefs of the Assemblage of the tribes of\r\n New Zealand who are congregated at Waitangi. Here's we too. Here's\r\n the chiefs of New Zealand, who see the meaning of these words, we\r\n accept, we entirely agree to all. Truly we do mark our names and\r\n marks.\r\n\r\n This is done at Waitangi on the six of the days of February, in the\r\n year one thousand eight hundred and four tens of our Lord.\r\n\r\nThe whole subject was now before the meeting for discussion, and the\r\nchiefs were invited to express their views upon it, or to make any\r\nenquiries upon points that were still obscure. There being some little\r\nhesitancy displayed Mr. Busby rose and, addressing the natives,\r\nassured them that the Governor had not come to deprive them of their\r\nlands, but rather to secure them in possession of what they had not\r\nalready sold. He reminded them that he had frequently given them his\r\nword that land not properly acquired from them would not be recognised\r\nas the property of the person claiming it, but would be returned to\r\nthe natives, to whom it rightly belonged. He was proceeding to say\r\nthat this promise the Governor would of a certainty be prepared to\r\ncarry out, when suddenly he was interrupted by Te Kemara, a chief of\r\nthe Ngatikawa tribe, who, springing from his place in front of the\r\nplatform exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Health to thee, O Governor. This is mine to thee, O Governor. I am\r\nnot pleased towards thee. I will not consent to thy remaining here in\r\nthis country. If thou stayest as Governor then perhaps Te Kemara will\r\nbe judged and condemned. Yes, indeed, and more than that--even hung by\r\nthe neck. No, no, no, I shall never say 'Yes' to your staying. Were\r\nall to be on an equality, then perhaps Te Kemara would say, 'Yes.' But\r\nfor the Governor to be up and Te Kemara down--Governor high up, up\r\nup, and Te Kemara down low, small, a worm, a crawler. No, no, no. O\r\nGovernor! this is mine to thee, O Governor! my land is gone, gone, all\r\ngone. The inheritances of my ancestors, fathers, relatives, all gone,\r\nstolen, gone with the Missionaries. Yes, they have it all, all, all.\r\nThat man there, the Busby, and that man there, the Williams, they have\r\nmy land. The land on which we are now standing this day is mine. This\r\nland, even this under my feet, return this to me. O Governor! return\r\nme my lands. Say to Williams 'Return to Te Kemara his land.'\" With\r\noutstretched finger he ran and pointed to the Missionary, \"Thou, thou,\r\nthou, thou bald-headed man, thou hast got my lands. O Governor! I do\r\nnot wish thee to stay. You English are not kind to us like other\r\nforeigners. You do not give us good things. I say go back, go back,\r\nGovernor, we do not want thee here in this country. And Te Kemara says\r\nto thee, go back, leave to Busby and to Williams to arrange and to\r\nsettle matters for us natives as heretofore.\"\r\n\r\nTe Kemara was a master in the art of Maori oratory, and he delivered\r\nthis speech with much simulated anger. Gesture and grimace were alike\r\nextravagant even for a native; his eyes rolled in violent oscillations\r\nand flashed with demoniacal fire, while his whole body trembled as\r\nthough convulsed by pent-up rage. He made a brave show of injured\r\ninnocence, especially when pleading for the return of his lands. And\r\nyet it was not serious: it was mere theatrical display; for not long\r\nafterwards he gave evidence before the Land Claims Commissioners, and\r\ntestified to the fair sale of his land. For the present, however,\r\nMaori vanity was satisfied--Te Kemara had made a great speech.\r\n\r\nThe serious impression made by the hostile deliverance of the\r\nNgatikawa chief was somewhat dispelled by the diversion created when\r\nRewa, of Ngaitawake rose, and, addressing His Excellency in the best\r\nEnglish he could command said, \"How d'ye do, Mr. Governor?\" The sally\r\nwas so unexpected that it immediately created a roar of laughter, in\r\nwhich all present joined. But Rewa soon became more earnest. He had\r\nevidently no intention of being frivolous--\"This is mine to thee, O\r\nGovernor!\" he impressively said. \"Go back. Let the Governor return to\r\nhis own country. Let my lands be returned to me which have been taken\r\nby the Missionaries--by Davis and by Clarke and by who and who\r\nbesides. I have no lands now--only a name,[67] only a name. Foreigners\r\ncome, they know Mr. Rewa, but this is all I have left--a name! What do\r\nnative men want of a Governor? We are not whites or foreigners. This\r\ncountry is ours, but the land is gone. Nevertheless we are the\r\nGovernor--we the chiefs of this our Fathers' land. I will not say\r\n'Yes' to the Governor's remaining. No, no, no, return. What! this land\r\nto become like Port Jackson and all other lands seen by the English.\r\nNo, no, return. I, Rewa, say to thee, O Governor, go back. Send the\r\nman away. Do not sign the paper. If you do you will be reduced to the\r\ncondition of slaves, and be compelled to break stones on the roads.\r\nYour land will be taken from you and your dignity as chiefs will be\r\ndestroyed.\"\r\n\r\nThe next speaker was Moka, a chief of the Patukeha tribe, from\r\nRawhiti, the burden of whose speech was also against the acceptance of\r\nthe treaty. \"Let the Governor return to his own country. Let us remain\r\nwhere we are. Let my lands be returned to me--all of them--those that\r\nare gone with Baker. Do not say, 'The lands will be returned to you.'\r\nWho will listen to thee, O Governor? Who will obey thee? Where is\r\nClendon? Where is Mair?[68] Gone to buy, buy our land, notwithstanding\r\nthe 'book'[69] of the Governor.\"\r\n\r\nOn this statement being interpreted to him Captain Hobson immediately\r\nstopped the speaker, and in the most earnest manner assured the\r\ngathering that lands unjustly held would be returned, and that after\r\nthe date of the Proclamation all land, however purchased, would be the\r\nsubject of enquiry, and no purchases would be lawful until sanctioned\r\nby the Crown.\r\n\r\nThis scarcely sufficed to satisfy the sceptical Moka, who replied, as\r\nhe advanced close up to the platform, \"That is good, O Governor! that\r\nis straight. But stay, let me see. Yes, yes, indeed! Where is Baker?\r\nWhere is the fellow? Ah, there he is--there standing. Come, return to\r\nme my lands?\"\r\n\r\nHere the orator paused, awaiting a reply. His injunction was addressed\r\nto Mr. Baker in the most direct and personal way, so that it could not\r\nbe evaded. Moka stood leaning against the edge of the platform,\r\nlooking directly at the Missionary, upon whom all eyes were\r\nimmediately turned. There was profound silence and the suspense was\r\nacute. Mr. Baker did not flinch but quietly replied, \"_E hoki,\r\nkoia_\"; in other words, \"We shall see whether they will return.\"\r\n\r\nThis retort was comfortless to Moka, who exclaimed, \"There, there,\r\nthat is as I said. No, no, no, all false, all false, alike. The lands\r\nwill not return to me.\"\r\n\r\nHe was in the midst of this lamentation when he was again interrupted.\r\nA European came forward, and addressing His Excellency said that the\r\nspeeches of the natives were not being faithfully interpreted by Mr.\r\nWilliams, nor were His Excellency's remarks being fully reported to\r\nthe natives. He said the natives complained of being robbed, and by a\r\ngesture indicated that Mr. Williams was the robber. This he followed\r\nup by venturing to suggest that a Mr. Johnson, who was present, could\r\ndo the work with greater satisfaction to both parties. This was the\r\nfirst open declaration of the general discontent which pervaded the\r\nsettlers, who were angry because of the Proclamation which had so\r\nsummarily put an end to their speculations, and which they felt was\r\nplaying them unfair. They had heard that a Charter had been granted\r\nto a rich Company in England, while many of them who had worked long\r\nin the land were being, as they thought, overreached by the\r\nGovernment. But the honest settler was not more angry than the\r\nland-jobbers, the gamblers of the south, who stood on the outskirts of\r\nthe crowd, \"looking like smugglers foiled in a run, or a pack of\r\nhounds lashed off their dying prey,\" and appeared as if they were\r\ntaking a vengeful pleasure in thwarting the wishes of authority. Many\r\nviewed the proceedings with malignant eyes and smouldering mischief in\r\ntheir hearts, remaining silent themselves, yet prompting others to\r\ninterrupt; hence these accusations of false interpretation, these\r\nirrelevant observations about the Missionaries and Mr. Busby taking\r\nadvantage of their privileged positions to unfairly acquire land.\r\n\r\nCaptain Hobson, always willing to be affable, and desirous that\r\nnothing should give rise to misunderstanding, begged Mr. Johnson, who\r\nwas a dealer in spirits at Kororareka, to come forward and do him the\r\nfavour of making everything clear to natives and Europeans alike.\r\n\r\nJohnson, however, was not so confident of his attainments as a Maori\r\nlinguist as his friend was, and in reply to His Excellency's question\r\nwhether he fully understood the native language he replied, \"Why, I\r\ncan't say I do, but I know how to speak to them, and know also what\r\nthey say when they speak to me, and----\"\r\n\r\n\"Then pray tell me, Mr. Johnson, what has not been interpreted?\" said\r\nCaptain Hobson.\r\n\r\nTo which the modest Johnson replied, \"No, Sir, I beg to be excused.\r\nThe gentlemen of the Mission ought to be able to do it, and can do it\r\nvery well; only let Mr. Williams speak out loud so that we may\r\nhear--that is, those of us in the back part of the tent, and let all\r\nthat the natives say be interpreted to the Governor. They say a great\r\ndeal about land and Missionaries which Mr. Williams does not translate\r\nto you.\"[70]\r\n\r\nThis reflection both upon his capacity as a linguist and his integrity\r\nas a man rather nettled the Missionary, who, having obtained the\r\npermission of the Governor to vindicate himself, addressed the white\r\npeople in English, and with his customary directness came at once to\r\nthe point. He said there had been much talk about the Missionaries\r\nowning land and farming and such like; but the Commissioners who were\r\nabout to sit would examine into the lands held by the Missionaries,\r\nand their titles thereto, as strictly as into any other. It was his\r\nspecial wish that this should be done, and he had so far given an\r\nearnest of his desire in that direction that he had already applied to\r\nHis Excellency to have the Missionary lands made the first subject of\r\ninvestigation. \"People,\" he said, \"should recollect that were it not\r\nfor the Missionaries they would not be here this day, nor be in\r\npossession of a foot of land in New Zealand. If any one person has a\r\nprior claim to land in this country that person must be the\r\nMissionary, who has laboured for so many years in this land when\r\nothers were afraid to show their noses. I have a large family--a\r\nfamily of eleven children--more probably than any one present, and\r\nwhat are they to do when I am taken from them if they are not to have\r\nsome land? Much has been said about my land, but I believe that when\r\nit is seen and known, and shared up between my children, no one will\r\nsay that I have been over the mark, but on the contrary under. All I\r\nshall say at present is, I hope that all who hold land, obtained from\r\nthe natives, will be able to show as good and honest titles to the\r\nsame as the Missionaries can do to theirs.\"[71]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WAITANGI FALLS.]\r\n\r\nMr. Busby, who owned the whole of the Peninsula between the Waitangi\r\nand Kerikeri Rivers, felt that he, too, was being drawn into the\r\nvortex of the speculators by these accusations of native spoliation.\r\nHe accordingly deemed it due to himself that something should be said\r\nin defence of his purchases, and so having obtained the permission of\r\nCaptain Hobson he rose, and, speaking in English, said with some\r\nemphasis, \"I deny that the term 'robbed' has been used by the chiefs\r\nTe Kemara and Rewa with reference to my purchase of land, as indicated\r\nby the white man who spoke, and coupled by him with Mr. Williams, by\r\ngestures, though not plainly by words. I never bought any land but\r\nwhat the natives pressed me to buy, for which I always paid them\r\nliberally. Allusion has been made to my possessing large tracts of\r\nland. I am happy to say I do hold some land; but I did not make any\r\nextensive purchases until I was out of office, and then, on my finding\r\nthat, after having served the Government for fifteen years, not any\r\nprovision was made, nor was likely to be made for myself and family, I\r\npurchased land. I only regret I had not done so at an earlier period,\r\nand that to a larger extent. In all my purchases, also, I have\r\nreconveyed to the natives both habitations and cultivations, by an\r\ninalienable gift, according to the number of persons thereon.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Busby having delivered his protest against what he considered to\r\nbe the unwarranted aspersions of the white settler, whose name does\r\nnot appear to have been recorded, Tamati Pukututu, a chief of the Te\r\nUri-o-te-hawato tribe broke in upon the monotony of the opposition\r\nwith a speech in favour of the treaty.\r\n\r\n\"This is mine to thee, O Governor! Sit, Governor, sit, a Governor for\r\nus--for me, for all, that our lands may remain with us; that these\r\n'_piritoka_' and '_piriawaawa_,' these homeless wanderers\r\nwho sneak about, sticking to rocks, and to the side of the brooks and\r\ngullies may not have it all. Sit, Governor, sit for me, for us. Remain\r\nhere a father for us. These chiefs say, 'Don't sit,' because they have\r\nsold all their possessions and they are filled with foreign property,\r\nand they have also no more to sell. But I say, what of that? Sit,\r\nGovernor, sit. You two stay here, you and Busby--you two, and they\r\nalso, the Missionaries.\"\r\n\r\nIn his advocacy of the Governor's cause Tamati was seconded by Matiu,\r\na chief of the Uri-o-ngongo tribe. \"O Governor! sit, stay, remain, you\r\nas one with the Missionaries, a Governor for us. Do not go back, but\r\nsit here, a Governor, a father for us, that good may increase, may\r\nbecome large to us. This is my word to thee. Do thou sit here, a\r\nfather for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, go back, go back,\" cried Kawiti, a turbulent Ngatihine. \"What\r\ndost thou want here? We native men do not wish thee to stay. We do not\r\nwant to be tied up and trodden down. We are free. Let the Missionaries\r\nremain, but as for thee, return to thine own country. I will not say\r\n'Yes' to thy sitting here. What! to be fired at in our boats and\r\ncanoes by night! What! to be fired at when quickly paddling our canoes\r\nby night! I, even I, Kawiti, must not paddle this way nor paddle that\r\nway because the Governor said 'No,' because of the Governor, his\r\nsoldiers, and his guns. No, no, no, go back, go back, there is no\r\nplace here for a Governor.\"\r\n\r\nA chief of the Ngatiamake tribe named Wai, now rose and addressed some\r\npertinent enquiries to His Excellency.\r\n\r\n\"To thee, O Governor! this. Will you remedy the selling, the\r\nexchanging, the cheating, the lying, the stealing of the whites? O\r\nGovernor! yesterday I was cursed by a white man. Is that straight? The\r\nwhite man gives us natives a pound for a pig, but he gives a\r\n_Pakeha_ four pounds for such a pig. Is that straight? The white\r\nman gives us a shilling for a basket of potatoes, but to a\r\n_Pakeha_ he gives four shillings for a basket like that one of\r\nours. Is that straight? No, no, they will not listen to thee, so go\r\nback, go back. If they would listen and obey, ah yes, good that, but\r\nhave they ever listened to Busby? And will they listen to thee, a\r\nstranger, a man of yesterday? Sit indeed! what for? Wilt thou make\r\ndealing straight?\"\r\n\r\nAt this point there was again some general dissatisfaction amongst the\r\nEuropeans who apparently were only able to hear imperfectly. A hawker,\r\na pedlar named Jones, from Kororareka, called out to His Excellency\r\nthat the whites could not follow the interpreter. A young man on the\r\nopposite side of the tent confirmed his complaint, and the European\r\nwho had previously objected to Mr. Williams's methods once more became\r\nprominent in support of his confrères. These dissatisfied individuals\r\nmaintained a running comment across the tent for some moments, which\r\nresulted in the Governor again requisitioning the services of Mr.\r\nJohnson, who came forward and interpreted the speech of Wai, but not\r\nto the complete satisfaction of that dusky orator, who described the\r\nJohnsonian effort as \"great lies.\"\r\n\r\nThis resulted in the restoration of Mr. Williams, whose next subject\r\nwas Pumuka, a man of influence in the Roroa tribe who was favourable\r\nto the treaty: \"Stay, remain, Governor; remain for me\" was his\r\nmessage. \"Hear all of you. I will have this man a foster-father for\r\nme. Stay, sit, Governor. Listen to my words, O Governor! Do not go\r\naway; remain. Sit, Governor, sit. I wish to have two fathers--thou and\r\nBusby and the Missionaries.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, what else? Stay, sit if not what? Sit, if not how?\" were the\r\nopening queries of Warerahi, a chief of Ngaitawake, who was popularly\r\nknown as George King. \"Is it not good to be at peace?\" he asked. \"We\r\nwill have this man as our Governor. What! turn him away! Say to this\r\nman of the Queen, 'Go back?' No, no.\"[72]\r\n\r\nThe next speaker was to be Hakiro, who wanted room to deliver himself\r\nas became a great chief, and whilst the reclining natives were being\r\nmoved back to make a clear space in which he could run from one end of\r\nthe platform to the other a chief from the Waikare, whose name has not\r\nbeen recorded, rose and complained of the unjust dealings of the white\r\npeople, who had no sense of justice. For a very little thing--a\r\nshilling--they wanted a pig as big as himself. What he wanted to know\r\nwas could the Governor make the _Pakeha_ give a payment as large as\r\nthe article he bought, but the speech was little noticed in the hustle\r\ncaused by the clearing of a passage for Hakiro.\r\n\r\nHakiro belonged to the Ngatirehia tribes, being the son of Tareha, but\r\non this occasion he essayed to speak for Titore,[73] though it is\r\nhighly questionable whether he reflected the sentiments to which that\r\nchief would have given utterance had he been still with the living.\r\nTitore was justly regarded as one of the noblest of the Nga-Puhi\r\nchieftains, and his early death was generally mourned, not only as a\r\npersonal loss, but as a misfortune to the cause of national unity. Be\r\nthat as it may, his illustrious representative on this auspicious\r\noccasion, swayed by other influences, elected to throw the weight of\r\nhis great name into the opposite scale to which he would almost\r\ncertainly have thrown it himself.\r\n\r\n\"To thee, O Governor! this. Who says sit? Who? Hear me, O Governor! I\r\nsay, no, no.\"\r\n\r\nAs he shouted these questions and answers he ran swiftly backwards and\r\nforwards brandishing a _taiaha_ as he ran.\r\n\r\n\"Sit indeed! Who says sit? Go back, go back. Do not thou sit here.\r\nWhat wilt thou sit here for? We are not thy people. We are free. We\r\nwill not have a Governor. Return, return, leave us. The Missionaries\r\nand Busby are our fathers. We do not want thee, so go back, return,\r\ndepart.\"\r\n\r\nTareha, who followed, was easily one of the largest natives in the\r\nNorth, and had been one of the most ferocious of cannibals.[74] He\r\nseldom burdened himself with much clothing, and on this occasion, as\r\nif to show how independent he was of such European luxuries, he\r\nappeared with nothing more than a dirty piece of old matting fastened\r\nround his waist. In the one hand he carried a canoe paddle, and in the\r\nother a small bunch of fern-root, tied by a piece of string, for the\r\npurpose of further demonstrating that he and his people still had the\r\nfood of their fathers to rely upon. Tareha never became a\r\nChristian--dying as he lived, a heathen--but under the influence of\r\nHongi he had always shown considerable solicitude for the\r\nMissionaries, whose interests he had invariably protected, both with\r\nhis personal and tribal power. His particular protégé at this time was\r\nBishop Pompallier, to whom, in common with Rewa, Moka, and Hakiro, he\r\nlived near at Kororareka. Whether this association in any way affected\r\nthe views of Tareha and his associates is probably a matter best left\r\nto individual opinion, but it has been observed as an interesting\r\ncoincidence that the natives who were in closest contact with the\r\nBishop were the most aggressively hostile to the treaty.\r\n\r\nThis fact had already been so much in evidence that when Tareha rose,\r\nand in his deep sepulchral voice shouted, \"No Governor for me--for us\r\nnative men,\" no one who was taking a keen interest in the proceedings\r\nwas very much surprised. With much of the gesticulation peculiar to\r\nMaori oratory and a clever application of the arts involved in native\r\nelocution, Tareha began to develop his pronouncement against the\r\nGovernor. \"We, we only are the chiefs--the rulers. We will not be\r\nruled over. What! thou, a foreigner, up and I down! Thou high, and I,\r\nTareha, the great chief of the Nga-Puhi tribes low! No, no, never,\r\nnever. I am jealous of thee; I am, and shall be until thou and thy\r\nship go away. Go back, go back, thou shalt not stay here. No, no, I\r\nwill never say 'Yes.' Stay! Alas! what for? Why? What is there here\r\nfor thee? Our lands are already all gone. Yes, it is so, but our names\r\nremain. Never mind, what of that--the lands of our fathers alienated!\r\nDost thou think we are poor, indigent, poverty-stricken--that we\r\nreally need thy foreign garments, thy food? Look at this!\"\r\n\r\nHere he dangled his bunch of fern-root in the air as proof that his\r\nargument was not without foundation.\r\n\r\n\"See, this is my food, the food of my ancestors, the food of the\r\nnative people. Pshaw! Governor, to think of tempting men--us\r\nnatives--with baits of clothing and food! Yes, I say we are the\r\nchiefs. If all were to be alike, all equal in rank with thee; but thou\r\nthe Governor up high--up, up, as this tall paddle[75] and I down,\r\nunder, beneath! No, no, no. I will never say 'Yes, stay.' Go back,\r\nreturn, make haste away. Let me see you (all) go; thee and thy ship.\r\nGo, go, return, return.\"\r\n\r\nThe speech of Tareha with its forceful opinions and dramatic delivery\r\nhad a marked and visible effect upon the native section of the\r\naudience, so much so that Captain Hobson began to regard the result\r\nwith considerable trepidation. He expressed these fears to Mr.\r\nWilliams, who, knowing the delicacy of the situation, advised him not\r\nto betray his anxiety, but at the close of the meeting to recommend\r\nthe treaty to their deliberate consideration, and to say that he would\r\ngive them three days in which to finally make up their minds upon it.\r\n\r\nFor this advice Captain Hobson thanked the Missionary, and then a more\r\nfavourable turn was given to the debate by a humorous sally from\r\nRawiri, a chief of Ngatitautahi, who, anxious to display his\r\nsmattering of newly acquired English, opened his speech with the\r\nsalutation, \"Good morning, Mr. Governor, very good you.\" This was as\r\nfar as his linguistic accomplishments could carry him, and for the\r\nremainder of his oration he relapsed into his native tongue, in which\r\nhe made an earnest appeal for established authority and a law that\r\nwould maintain them in peace. \"Our Governor, our Father! stay here, O\r\nGovernor! Sit that we may be in peace. A good thing this for us, my\r\nfriends, native men. Stay, sit. Do thou remain, O Governor! to be a\r\nGovernor for us.\"\r\n\r\nUp to this point the weight of influence and oratory had been heavily\r\nagainst the Governor, the opposition evidently considering it good\r\ntactics to get in early and reap the fruits of a first impression. But\r\nthe friends of the treaty now put up a powerful foil to Tareha in the\r\nperson of Hone Heke, the nephew and son-in-law of Hongi, and\r\nadmittedly one of the most influential men, both by lineage and\r\nachievement, in all the North. Heke at this time was actively\r\nespousing the Christian cause, and had not developed the mischievous\r\nspirit which afterwards gave him even greater prominence in European\r\nannals than he had as yet acquired in Maori fame. He began in that\r\nmystical manner so much beloved by Maori orators, the skilful use of\r\nwhich was regarded as a test of their accomplishment.\r\n\r\n\"To raise up, or to bring down? To raise up, or to bring down? Which?\r\nWho knows? Sit, Governor, sit. If thou shouldst return, we natives are\r\ngone, utterly gone, nothinged, extinct. What then shall we do? Who are\r\nwe? Remain, Governor, a father for us. If thou goest away, what then?\r\nWe do not know.\"\r\n\r\nThen turning and addressing himself to those immediately about him, he\r\nsaid, \"This, my friends, is a good thing. It is even as the word of\r\nGod.[76] Thou to go away! No, no, no! For then the French people or\r\nthe rum-sellers will have us natives. Remain, remain, sit, sit here;\r\nyou with the Missionaries all as one. But we natives are children.\r\nYes, it is not for us, but for you, our fathers--you Missionaries--it\r\nis for you to say, to decide what it shall be. It is for you to\r\nchoose, for we are only natives. Who and what are we? Children, yes,\r\nchildren solely. We do not know. Do you then choose for us. You our\r\nfathers--you Missionaries. Sit, I say, Governor, sit. A father, a\r\nGovernor for us.\"\r\n\r\nThe emphasis with which these concluding sentences were pronounced,\r\nand the gestures by which they were accompanied, came as a convincing\r\nclimax to what had been a mighty speech. The _mana_ of Heke was\r\ngreat, for was he not descended from Rahiri, who came down in a direct\r\nline from a Viking Admiral of the Hawaiki fleet; was he not the\r\nrepresentative of the Ariki family of Nga-Puhi; had he not by virtue\r\nof his great name levied toll upon all who crossed his estate at\r\nPuketona; was he not the brave who had distinguished himself at the\r\n1830 fight at Kororareka when Hengi was killed, and had he not fought\r\nvaliantly at Tauranga when Titore attacked the _pa_ at Otumoetai?\r\nHeke had thus become great in all that told most in the estimation of\r\nthe Maori, and when he had spoken it was indiscreet for any dog to\r\nbark.[77]\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he resumed his seat upon the ground than the hum of\r\napproving comment could be heard in all quarters of the tent. Here was\r\na speech indeed, Europeans and natives alike joining in eulogiums of\r\nboth its manner and its matter. While the buzz of conversation filled\r\nthe air, Hakitara, a chief of the Rarawa tribe, rose and commenced a\r\nspeech in favour of the treaty. He was, however, unfortunate in having\r\nto follow Heke, who had for the moment captured public attention, and\r\nHakitara, being unable to raise his voice above the din, soon subsided\r\nand made way for a greater even than Heke.\r\n\r\nWhile the latter was speaking the gathering had received an important\r\naugmentation by the arrival of Tamati Waaka Nēne, his elder brother\r\nPatuone, and the Nga-Puhi chiefs of Hokianga. They had mingled with\r\nthe crowd, and immediately the Rarawa chief had concluded, Nēne\r\ncame forward and spoke \"with a degree of natural eloquence that\r\nsurprised all the Europeans and eventually turned aside the temporary\r\nfeeling of hostility that had been created.\"[78]\r\n\r\nDr. Bright, one of the few Englishmen who have left us an account of\r\nthis historic gathering, describes Nēne at this moment as a\r\n\"mild-looking, middle-aged man with a deportment as if he felt he was\r\na gentleman.\" As he listened to Heke he rested upon his _taiaha_,\r\nand smiled upon those about him. His face bore evidence that he was\r\nglad to see the white man and the brown in conference.\r\n\r\nTo this chief with his great mental powers, his keen perception, his\r\ncapacity to read the signs of the times, it had been long apparent\r\nthat the advent of the _Pakeha_ was inevitable, and that the\r\nMaori system was incapable of developing the principles of a stable\r\nGovernment. To now enter upon a campaign of hostility to the whites\r\nwould, he believed, certainly result in the destruction of his own\r\nrace. It was too late. Yet to govern themselves was manifestly\r\nimpossible. He therefore found himself in the same dilemma as had\r\npresented itself to a large section of the ancient Jews in the\r\nbeleaguered city of Jerusalem, who honestly enough believed that their\r\ncountry had arrived at that stage in its history when its only\r\nsalvation lay in its seizure and government by a foreign power strong\r\nenough to establish justice and security, even though it might be at\r\nthe sacrifice of liberty. What the Romans were to Palestine the\r\nBritish were in Nēne's eyes to New Zealand, and that was what he\r\nmeant when he begged the Governor to remain and be to the Maori a\r\nfriend, a father, and a Governor.\r\n\r\nAs he stepped into the arena of debate the storms were laid still, and\r\na general calm suppressed the rising excitement, for he was esteemed\r\nby the white men and known to his own race as one who dared to fight\r\nas well as to talk of peace. His voice was low at first, nor needed he\r\nto raise it high--no sound intruded on it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAMATI WAAKA NĒNE.\r\n\r\nAfter the painting by G. Lindauer in the Partridge Collection,\r\nAuckland, by kind permission of the owner.]\r\n\r\n\"I will first speak to us, to ourselves, the natives,\" said Nēne.\r\n\"What do you say? The Governor to return? What then shall we do? Say\r\nhere to me, O ye chiefs of the tribes of the northern part of New\r\nZealand, how are we henceforward to act? Friends, whose potatoes do we\r\neat? Whose were our blankets? These spears (holding up his\r\n_taiaha_) are laid aside. What has the Nga-Puhi now? The\r\n_Pakeha's_ gun, his shot, his powder. Many months has he been in\r\nour _whares_; many of his children are our children. Is not the\r\nland already gone? Is it not covered, all covered with men, with\r\nstrangers, foreigners--even as the grass and herbage--over whom we\r\nhave no power? We the chiefs, and natives of this land, are down low;\r\nthey are up high, exalted, yet they make no slaves. What do you say?\r\nThe Governor to go back? I am sick, I am dead, killed by you. Had you\r\nspoken thus in the olden time, when the traders and grog-sellers\r\ncame--had you turned them away, then you could well say to the\r\nGovernor, 'Go back,' and it would have been correct, straight, and I\r\nwould also have said with you, 'Go back'--yes, we together as one man,\r\nwith one voice. But now as things are, no, no, no. What did we do\r\nbefore the _Pakeha_ came? We fought, we fought continually. But now\r\nwe can plant our grounds and the _Pakeha_ will bring plenty of trade\r\nto our shores. Then let us keep him here. Let us all be friends\r\ntogether. I'll sign the _puka puka_.[79] I am walking beside the\r\n_Pakeha_.\"\r\n\r\nThis portion of the speech had been spoken with all the fiery\r\ndeclamation of which Waaka Nēne was capable when needs demanded it,\r\nbut having delivered his message to his own people, he turned and,\r\nwith pleading and pathos in his voice, said: \"O Governor, sit. I,\r\nTamati Waaka, say to thee, sit. Do not thou go away from us; remain\r\nfor us a father, a judge, a peacemaker. You must not allow us to\r\nbecome slaves. You must preserve our customs, and never permit our\r\nland to be wrested from us. Yes, it is good, it is straight. Sit thou\r\nhere, dwell in our midst. Remain, do not go away. Do not thou listen\r\nto what the chiefs of Nga-Puhi say. Stay, then, our friend, our\r\nfather, our Governor.\"[80]\r\n\r\nAs it has always been frankly conceded that Nēne's speech was the\r\nturning-point in the debate, it may be well to present here a sketch\r\nof the chief whose stirring history and admirable characteristics were\r\nwell and personally known to a writer who lived through all these\r\neventful days in New Zealand. According to this authority, Nēne\r\n\"had a singularly open, honest, and benevolent expression of face, and\r\nthough, if needs were, he could be stern enough, there was little of\r\ncruelty or vindictiveness in his composition as there could possibly\r\nhave been in one whose youth was spent in such surroundings. He was\r\nthe bravest among the brave; a splendid Maori general, averse to\r\nfighting until every way of conciliation was exhausted; and although\r\nhe never heard of Polonius, with him too it was a maxim, 'Beware of\r\nentrance to a quarrel, but, being in, bear't that the opposed may\r\nbeware of thee.' He was impressed with the abiding feeling that the\r\nonly chance for his race was to keep peace with the _Pakeha_, to\r\naccept loyally the supremacy of the Queen, and to bear themselves\r\npatiently through the slow and difficult transition from Maori custom\r\nto British law. His bare word was trusted all through the country as\r\nthe most binding writing would be trusted amongst ourselves, and he\r\nhad the power of attracting followers to his person with a devotion\r\nwhich made them ready to stand by him in life or in death.\r\n\r\n\"He had for many years been a convert of the Wesleyan Mission, and had\r\nreceived at his baptism the prefix Thomas Walker to his old Maori name\r\nof Nēne. From beginning to end he never swerved in his pledge of\r\nloyalty to the Queen. When he died he was buried in the little\r\nchurchyard of Kororareka, having solemnly adjured his friends not to\r\nallow the Maori custom of disposing of his bones, but to let him lie\r\nin peace in a Christian grave; and over his grave the Government\r\nraised a stone monument, with an inscription in both languages\r\nexpressive of their gratitude, and purporting that _that_ was the\r\nresting-place of one who was alike steadfast in his friendship for the\r\nBritish and in his labours to secure the best interests of his\r\ncountrymen--a chief of men, one wise in counsel as he was brave in\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n\"For once in a way there was an epitaph of severe and simple truth,\r\nand there was not a word of flattery in its praise of the dead. He had\r\nbeen one of Hongi's lieutenants, and had traversed with his war\r\nparties the whole of the Northern Island to the neighbourhood of Cook\r\nStrait. But it was for his wisdom as a counsellor and his influence as\r\na peacemaker that he was specially famous. No one could set down his\r\nconciliation to weakness or fear. In his ordinary bearing he was\r\ngentle as a child. In conversation his voice was soft as a woman's,\r\nbut in the shout of battle it was said to be terrible, and it could be\r\nheard above all the clash of arms and the din of the conflict. He was\r\nhardly ever defeated, and it was his way before he fought to look\r\nbeyond the victory, and to determine the move by which it should be\r\nfollowed. He was half a life older than Heke, and indeed he regarded\r\nthe action of that chief very much as the escapade of a petulant boy.\r\nIn their case the struggle had none of the bitterness of personal\r\nresentment, and when Heke made his somewhat sulky submission, Nēne\r\nadvised the Government to treat him with kindness and consideration,\r\nand the war being ended, not to add to his disappointment anything\r\nthat would hurt his sense of personal dignity. We owe Nēne's\r\nmemory, more than to any other of the Maori race, a real debt of\r\ngratitude and respect, for at many a crisis he threw himself into the\r\nbreach, and averted dangers that might have been fatal in those early\r\ndays. As a father he was a man of tender feeling. He had but one son,\r\neighteen years old, whom my mother nursed in his illness, and after\r\nthe boy's death, when Nēne came to our house, he could not speak of\r\nhis loss without tears, or thank her too much for the kindness that\r\nseemed to him to have been all in vain.\"\r\n\r\nNēne was followed in the debate by his elder brother, Patuone, well\r\nknown as one of the fathers of Nga-Puhi. Though he has not held the\r\npicturesque position in Maori history occupied by his younger\r\nrelation, his life was at least eventful enough to have become the\r\nsubject of an interesting biography,[81] as he was at this time as\r\nhighly esteemed by his own people as he was by the _Pakeha_ in\r\nlater years; when in his old age he was living well down into the\r\nEuropean era.\r\n\r\nPatuone spoke briefly, but definitely. He favoured the coming of the\r\nGovernor as the solution of all their troubles.\r\n\r\n\"What shall I say on this great occasion, in the presence of all these\r\ngreat chiefs of both countries? Here then this is my word to thee, O\r\nGovernor! Sit, stay--thou and the Missionaries, and the word of God.\r\nRemain here with us, to be a father to us, that the French have us\r\nnot, that Pikopo,[82] that bad man, have us not. Remain, Governor,\r\nsit, stay, our friend.\"\r\n\r\nThe turn which affairs had now taken proved too much for the\r\nexcitable Te Kemara, who had been the first speaker. He had patiently\r\nheard out Heke, Nēne, and Patuone, but unable to longer restrain\r\nhimself he at this point jumped up and in his lively, breezy manner\r\nproceeded to counter the flow of pro-British oratory: \"No, no,\" he\r\nshouted. \"Who says stay? Go away, return to thine own land. I want my\r\nlands returned to me. If thou wilt say, 'Return to that man, Te\r\nKemara, his land,' then it will be good. Let us be all alike. Then, O\r\nGovernor, remain. But the Governor up, Te Kemara down, low, flat! No,\r\nno, no. Besides, where art thou to stay, to dwell? There is no place\r\nleft for thee.\"\r\n\r\nThis exclamation of Te Kemara's drew from Mr. Busby the remark that\r\nhis house would be occupied by the Governor until a suitable residence\r\ncould be procured for him, which piece of information served to\r\nproduce a marked change in the chief's demeanour.\r\n\r\nCrossing his hands as though they were locked in handcuffs, he ran up\r\nto the Governor, and with eyes flashing with anger, he exclaimed:\r\n\"Shall I be thus? Say to me, Governor; speak. Like this--eh, like\r\nthis? Come, come; speak, Governor, Like this--eh?\"\r\n\r\nHere his manner became distinctly offensive to His Excellency, and one\r\nof the chiefs sitting near-by reproached him for his insolence,\r\nwhereupon he turned one of those violent mental somersaults which all\r\nextremists are at times apt to do. Leaping forward, he seized hold of\r\nCaptain Hobson's hands and shook them heartily, grinning gleefully,\r\nwhile he shouted in the best English he could command, \"How d'ye\r\ndo--eh, Governor? How d'ye do--eh, Mister Governor?\" This enquiry he\r\nrepeated over and over again, the Governor evidently enjoying the joke\r\nas much as any one. \"This,\" says Captain Hobson, \"occasioned amongst\r\nthe natives a general expression of applause, and a loud cheer from\r\nthe Europeans in which the natives joined.\"\r\n\r\nThus the business of the meeting closed in the most amiable spirit,\r\nthe further consideration of the momentous question being by general\r\nconsent adjourned until the following Friday (the 7th), in order that\r\nthe natives might have one clear day during which to reflect upon the\r\nGovernor's proposal.[83]\r\n\r\nWhen Captain Hobson and his escort left the meeting they descended the\r\nrude pathway cut in the side of the hill, and as they walked towards\r\nthe beach where their boat lay, the Governor was discussing with Mr.\r\nColenso the printing of the treaty and other kindred matters. They had\r\njust reached the boat and were preparing to enter, when their\r\nattention was directed to a commotion not far off. They had not\r\ndiscovered the cause of the excitement before a chief, very much out\r\nof breath, burst in upon the viceregal party, and, standing directly\r\nbefore the Lieutenant-Governor, gazed intently at him for a few\r\nminutes. Then in a loud shrill voice he cried out in wailing tones,\r\n\"_Au e he koroheke! E kore e roa kua mate_,\" and at once fell\r\nback into the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe incident was so sudden in its happening, and was so evidently of\r\npersonal moment to himself, that Captain Hobson was naturally curious\r\nto know its full import. He appealed to Mr. Colenso to kindly\r\ninterpret the old man's message, but the Missionary, unwilling to\r\nenlighten the Governor as to the sinister suggestion conveyed by the\r\ngrey-headed seer, endeavoured to evade the point by telling him what\r\nwas perfectly true--that this was an old chief who had just arrived\r\nfrom the interior and was anxious to see the Queen's representative.\r\nThe explanation, though plausible enough, did not satisfy the\r\nGovernor, who had a predilection that there was more behind the\r\nchief's wild lament than this, and his importunities to know the truth\r\nbeing supported by those of Captain Nias, Mr. Colenso at length had to\r\nadmit that there was more of prophecy than curiosity in the chief's\r\nmournful exclamation: \"Alas! an old man. He will soon be dead.\"\r\n\r\nThe incident, which had something of comedy in its early features,\r\nthus terminated with a tragic note, and the Governor, who had been\r\nhighly elated at the success of the meeting, pulled off to his ship in\r\na gloomy and meditative mood.\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of the day[84] a strong effort was made by the\r\nbeach-combers and whisky-sellers of Kororareka to spread dissension\r\namongst the chiefs, and to prejudice the idea of the Queen's\r\nprotection; but the Missionaries were whole-hearted in their support,\r\nand vigilant to counteract the opposition of these ill-disposed\r\nindividuals.[85] The good impression created by Heke and Nēne\r\ntherefore stood, and before the evening had closed there was a\r\npreponderating number anxious to sign the treaty.\r\n\r\nThe Missionaries were equally anxious to take advantage of this\r\nfavourable feeling, and were now keenly apprehensive that the delay\r\nuntil Friday would be detrimental to the treaty party. They therefore\r\nconsulted together with a view to expediting the taking of the chiefs'\r\nsignatures, and concluded that it would be better to do so on the\r\nmorrow.\r\n\r\nThere was also another, and undeniably a powerful, factor operating in\r\nfavour of a speedy termination of the business. This was the fact that\r\nthe natives, having been called hurriedly together, were insufficiently\r\nsupplied with food, nor were provisions for so large a number\r\nprocurable within easy distance. The natives were thus faced with the\r\nalternative of remaining hungry at Waitangi or returning home to be\r\nfed. This was an option about which no Maori ever had two opinions,\r\nand it was perfectly obvious that if the proceedings were further\r\ndelayed until Friday there would be a stampede from the scene of\r\nnegotiations and the golden opportunity would be in all probability\r\nirretrievably lost.\r\n\r\nInfluenced by these considerations, the Missionaries agreed that\r\nCaptain Hobson should be made aware of the altered position of\r\naffairs, but apparently no proper steps were taken to have the\r\ninformation conveyed to him. Consequently when they arrived next\r\nmorning from their station at Paihia, about one and a half miles\r\ndistant from Waitangi, the Governor had not yet come on shore. There\r\nwas also a perceptible diminution in the number of the natives\r\npresent, several companies, chagrined at their treatment in the\r\nscramble for the tobacco on the previous day, having folded their\r\nblankets and returned home. Still there were from 300 to 400 squatting\r\nin groups here and there, all earnestly discussing the treaty with\r\nmore or less clarity of comprehension. An hour flew by and yet no sign\r\nof the Governor, nor could any movement be detected on board the\r\n_Herald_ indicative of his coming.\r\n\r\nNoon had arrived but still no Governor, impatience being manifest on\r\nevery face, when a boat containing two officers was seen to leave the\r\nship. They rowed leisurely across the Bay, and when they reached the\r\nlanding-place and were told that both natives and Europeans were\r\nawaiting the Governor, they were considerably surprised, and explained\r\nthat \"His Excellency certainly knew nothing of a meeting to be held\r\nhere this day.\"\r\n\r\nNow that it was clear there had been an unfortunate misunderstanding\r\nit was not long before communication was held with the ship, and\r\nCaptain Hobson, accompanied by the officers of his Government, came\r\nashore; but his departure had been so hurried that he came in\r\ncivilian clothes, having no time to don more of his uniform than his\r\ncocked hat. He hurriedly assured those about him that he had not\r\nentertained the least notion that a meeting was to be held; that as\r\nmatters stood he was quite prepared to take the signatures of all the\r\nchiefs willing to sign, but that he must still hold the public meeting\r\non the following day as already announced by him.\r\n\r\nA move was then made towards the tents by the whole party, closely\r\nfollowed by the natives, who crowded under the canvas with no small\r\nexcitement and hustle. Some preliminary details--such as the\r\narrangement of tables at which the chiefs could sign--having been\r\ncompleted, the Governor and party then ascended the platform, and\r\nCaptain Hobson announced that this not being a regularly convened\r\npublic meeting he could not permit of any discussion on the merits of\r\nthe treaty. The business, therefore, would be confined to accepting\r\nthe signatures of those chiefs who were willing and ready to sign.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture a message came to His Excellency from Bishop\r\nPompallier, stating that he and his priest were at that moment resting\r\nin Mr. Busby's house, and were anxious to be present at the meeting.\r\nLieutenant Shortland was immediately despatched to bring the Bishop\r\nin, and on his entering he was welcomed and invited to occupy the seat\r\nhe had filled on the previous day.\r\n\r\nThe business was resumed by Captain Hobson proposing that Mr. Henry\r\nWilliams should read the treaty from the parchment on which it had\r\nbeen engrossed, as that which had been submitted to them on the\r\npreceding day had been merely the original draft. This office was\r\nperformed by Mr. Williams, whereupon Bishop Pompallier leaned over to\r\nthe Governor and asked that the natives might be informed that all who\r\nshould join the Catholic Church should have the protection of the\r\nBritish Government.\r\n\r\nCaptain Hobson, with much blandness of gesture and expression,[86]\r\nreplied, \"Most certainly,\" and proceeded to express his regret that\r\nthe Bishop had not made known his wishes earlier, as in that event the\r\nprovision \"would have been embodied in the treaty.\"\r\n\r\nTurning then to Mr. Williams, he said: \"The Bishop wishes it to be\r\npublicly stated to the natives that his religion will not be\r\ninterfered with, and that free toleration will be allowed in matters\r\nof faith. I should therefore thank you to say to them that the Bishop\r\nwill be protected and supported in his religion--that I shall protect\r\nall creeds alike.\"\r\n\r\n\"I presume the same protection will be offered to all?\" remarked Mr.\r\nWilliams; to which the Governor replied, \"Certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"What need, then,\" asked Mr. Williams, \"is there to burden the\r\nproceedings with such an announcement if all are to have protection\r\nalike?\"\r\n\r\nTo this the Governor replied that as the Bishop was anxious that the\r\nannouncement should be made, he would feel obliged if Mr. Williams\r\nwould deliver it to the meeting.\r\n\r\nMr. Williams then proceeded to address the natives: \"_Na, e mea ana\r\nte Kawana_\"--\"Attend, the Governor says.\" Here, however, he felt\r\nthe matter was one of such magnitude that he could not afford to treat\r\nit in a casual way, and he expressed this opinion to his fellow\r\nMissionary, Mr. Clarke, who was standing near him.\r\n\r\n\"Pray, sir, write it down first, as it is an important sentence,\"\r\nsuggested Mr. Colenso.\r\n\r\nMr. Williams, taking pencil and paper, then wrote as follows: \"The\r\nGovernor wishes you to understand that all the Maoris who shall join\r\nthe Church of England, who shall join the Wesleyans, who shall join\r\nthe Pikopo, or Church of Rome, and those who retain their Maori\r\npractices shall have the protection of the British Government.\"\r\n\r\nThis he handed to the Governor, who passed it on to the Bishop, who,\r\nhaving read it, said in English, \"Oh yes, that will do very well.\"\r\n\r\nThe statement was read to the meeting, and if Mr. Williams is to be\r\naccepted as an authority, it was received in silence, the natives not\r\nknowing what it meant.[87] Bishop Pompallier then rose and, bowing to\r\nthe Governor, left the meeting.\r\n\r\nThese preliminaries having been satisfactorily disposed of, the chiefs\r\nwere as a body invited to come forward and append their signatures to\r\nthe treaty. To this invitation no one responded for a time, none\r\ncaring to be the first to take what might prove to be a precipitate\r\nstep. For several minutes the Maori mind hung in this state of doubt\r\nand indecision until Mr. Busby hit upon the expedient of calling upon\r\nthe chiefs by name. He had prepared a list for his own information of\r\nthose eligible to sign, and by a fortunate circumstance the name of\r\nHone Heke stood first upon that list. Heke, who had proved himself\r\nsuch a redoubtable advocate of the treaty, came forward frankly enough\r\nwhen thus directly appealed to, and was about to sign, when Mr.\r\nColenso interposed by asking the permission of the Governor to clear\r\nup one point upon which grave doubts had been raised in his mind as\r\nthe result of his mingling with the natives since the earlier meeting.\r\nThis permission was readily granted, whereupon Mr. Colenso said, \"May\r\nI ask Your Excellency whether it is your opinion that these natives\r\nunderstand the articles of the treaty which they are now called upon\r\nto sign?\"\r\n\r\nHe was proceeding to say that he had that morning arrived at a\r\ndifferent conclusion, when Captain Hobson interrupted him with the\r\nremark: \"If the native chiefs do not know the contents of this treaty\r\nit is no fault of mine. I wish them to fully understand it. I have\r\ndone all that I could to make them understand the same, and I really\r\ndon't know how I shall be enabled to get them to do so. They have\r\nheard the treaty read by Mr. Williams.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, Your Excellency,\" rejoined Mr. Colenso, \"but the natives are\r\nquite children in their ideas. It is no easy matter to get them to\r\nunderstand--fully to comprehend a document of this kind; still I\r\nthink they ought to know somewhat of it to constitute its legality. I\r\nspeak under correction, Your Excellency. I have spoken to some of the\r\nchiefs concerning it, who had no idea whatever as to the purport of\r\nthe treaty.\"\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Busby joined in the discussion by reminding Mr. Colenso that\r\nthe best answer that could be given to his observation would be found\r\nin the speech made yesterday by the very chief about to sign, Hone\r\nHeke, who said \"the native mind could not comprehend these things;\r\nthey must trust to the advice of their Missionaries.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is the very thing to which I was going to allude,\" replied\r\nMr. Colenso. \"The Missionaries should do so, but at the same time the\r\nMissionaries should explain the thing in all its bearings to the\r\nnatives, so that it should be their very own act and deed. Then in\r\ncase of a reaction taking place, the natives could not turn round on\r\nthe Missionary and say, \"You advised me to sign that paper, but never\r\ntold me what were the contents thereof.\"[88]\r\n\r\nCaptain Hobson, who had evidently not contemplated this contingency,\r\nexpressed the hope that no such reaction would take place. \"I think,\"\r\nhe said, \"that the people under your care will be peaceable enough: I\r\nam sure you will endeavour to make them so. And as to those that are\r\nwithout, why, we must endeavour to do our best with them.\"\r\n\r\nThis attitude on the part of the Governor sufficed to satisfy Mr.\r\nColenso, who had no desire to be contumacious, but having conscientious\r\ndoubts upon the native grasp of a subject necessarily foreign to their\r\ntribal policy, he felt it his duty to give full expression to those\r\ndoubts, and he thanked His Excellency for having given him the\r\nopportunity to do so.\r\n\r\nHone Heke then put his name upon the parchment,[89] and as if to\r\nanswer the objection raised by Mr. Colenso, he told the people in a\r\nbrief speech that he fully approved of the proceeding, as they all\r\nneeded protection from every foreign power, and they well knew the\r\nfostering care of the Queen of England towards them.\r\n\r\nWith so propitious a lead there was no further hesitancy on the part\r\nof the remaining chiefs, and the process of recording their signatures\r\nwent merrily on. While it was proceeding, Marupo, a chief of the\r\nWhanaurara tribe, and Ruhe, a chief of the Ngatihineira tribe, were\r\nbusy making violent speeches against the treaty. Both warriors\r\ndelivered themselves in the style characteristic of their people when\r\nthey have serious business on hand, running sharply up and down a\r\nbeaten avenue, gesticulating energetically, stamping their feet, and\r\npouring out their denunciations with a volubility that was difficult\r\nto follow. Marupo, who had discarded all his clothing except a\r\n_piupiu_ made of reeds which hung round his waist, was especially\r\ndetermined in his opposition, continuing his harangue until voice and\r\nbody failed from sheer physical exhaustion.\r\n\r\nThen realising that his oratory had not turned the tide of public\r\nopinion, and that the adoption of the treaty was inevitable, he and\r\nhis compatriots, appreciating the advantage of being on the popular\r\nside, joined the ranks of the signatories and drew their _moko_[90]\r\nupon the parchment.\r\n\r\nMarupo signalised his conversion by shaking hands heartily--even\r\nviolently--with the Governor, and desired to confirm the new-formed\r\nfriendship by seizing the Governor's hat, which was lying on the\r\ntable, and putting it upon his head.\r\n\r\nThe next of the insurgents to surrender was the versatile but volatile\r\nTe Kemara, who, when he had succumbed to the pressure of the popular\r\nwill, volunteered the statement that he had been influenced in his\r\nopposition by the French Bishop, who had told him \"not to write on\r\nthe paper, for if he did he would be made a slave.\"\r\n\r\nThe only chief of high standing who was present and had not now signed\r\nthe treaty was Rewa, but his obduracy was at length overcome, he\r\nyielding to the persuasions of his tribal friends, supported by the\r\nadvice of the Church Missionaries, and when at length he drew his\r\ncurious hieroglyphics upon the parchment, he too admitted that his\r\nopposition had been wholly inspired by the Bishop, who had earnestly\r\ninterceded with him not to become a party to the treaty.\r\n\r\nCaptain Hobson, who had apparently recovered from his recent\r\nindisposition, appeared to be in the cheeriest of spirits, and as each\r\nchief signed the treaty he took him by the hand, and repeating in\r\nMaori \"_He iwi tahi tatou_\"--\"We are now one people\"--paid a\r\nlittle compliment to the native race that was hugely appreciated by\r\nthe recipients.[91]\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the morning small contingents of natives had been\r\narriving from distant parts, who had not been present at the previous\r\nday's proceedings owing to the unavoidable delay in receiving their\r\nsummoning circulars, but after brief explanations by their friends,\r\nthey, without exception, subscribed to the Queen's proposal to give\r\ntheir country a stable Government. Altogether forty-five chiefs signed\r\nthe treaty on this eventful February 6, but they were for the most\r\npart men of only moderate influence, and with the exception of Waaka\r\nNēne, and his brother Eruera Patuone, who hailed from Hokianga, and\r\nKauwhata, Wharau, and Ngere, from Wangaruru, all were resident within\r\nthe immediate vicinity of the Bay of Islands. Twenty-six of these,\r\nhowever, had signed the much-despised Declaration of Independence five\r\nyears before, and Captain Hobson so far concluded that their\r\nacquiescence in his present mission \"must be deemed a full and clear\r\nrecognition of the sovereign rights of Her Majesty over the northern\r\nparts of this Island,\" that he immediately arranged with Captain Nias\r\nto announce the cession on the morrow with a salute of twenty-one guns\r\nfrom the deck of the _Herald_.[92]\r\n\r\nHaving now concluded the official portion of the business, Captain\r\nHobson, who had conducted the whole of the proceedings with\r\nconspicuous patience and ability, left the meeting under a volley of\r\ncheers from the natives, which resounded through the hills and across\r\nthe sunny waters of the Bay.\r\n\r\n\"In the course of these proceedings,\" wrote Captain Hobson to Sir\r\nGeorge Gipps, \"I have courted the utmost publicity, and I have\r\nforborne to adopt even the customary measure of propitiating the\r\nconsent of the chiefs by promises of presents, and not until the\r\ntreaty was signed did I give them anything. To have sent them home\r\nwithout some acknowledgment would have been a violation of their\r\ncustoms, and would have given offence. I therefore distributed a few\r\narticles of trifling value before they separated.\"\r\n\r\nThis distribution was entrusted to Mr. Colenso, each chief who had\r\nsigned the treaty receiving two blankets and a quantity of tobacco,\r\nand \"by dint of close and constant attention,\" reports that gentleman,\r\n\"the said distribution went off well without any mishap or hitch.\"\r\n\r\nNext morning broke with a grey sky and rain so incessant as to\r\ndissipate all hope of holding the contemplated meeting. Neither was it\r\ndeemed advisable under such depressing circumstances to proclaim the\r\nevent by a Royal salute, so that by a strange perversion of fate,\r\nFriday the 7th, which was to have been the day of days, passed off\r\ncold, bleak, and uneventful. It was not, therefore, until Saturday the\r\n8th that the proceedings, so far as they had gone, were fully\r\nconsummated. This was accomplished amidst the floating of bunting and\r\nthe booming of guns, for upon this bright and sunny day it may be\r\nsaid that New Zealand became a British colony, and what some of us are\r\nvain enough to regard as the brightest jewel in Britain's Crown.[93]\r\n\r\n[51] The number and extent of the erasures in the original draft\r\nindicate that the greatest care was taken in its composition by those\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n[52] \"Upon the fullest consideration my judgment inclines me strongly\r\nto recommend you, and through you, all the other members of the\r\nMission, that your influence should be exercised amongst the chiefs\r\nattached to you, to induce them to make the desired surrender of\r\nsovereignty to Her Majesty.\"--Bishop Broughton's letter to Mr. Henry\r\nWilliams.\r\n\r\n[53] Mr. Busby's house was built of Australian hard wood, and though\r\nupwards of eighty years old is still standing in an excellent state of\r\npreservation. The property is now occupied by Mr. Theo. A. Izard, who\r\nrecently unearthed on the site where the marquee was erected the iron\r\nshoe of a military tent-peg of the period, doubtless one that was used\r\nin connection with the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi.\r\n\r\n[54] Waitangi signifies \"crying water,\" and there were many people\r\nsuperstitious enough to believe that the choice of this spot was a bad\r\nomen.\r\n\r\n[55] The man who stands in the centre of the canoe and gives the time\r\nto the rowers.\r\n\r\n[56] Amongst the Americans present were several of the scientists\r\nattached to the United States exploring expedition, under Commander\r\nWilkes, who had assembled at the Bay of Islands to await the return of\r\ntheir vessels from the Antarctic. With the exception of Bishop\r\nPompallier the Frenchmen at the Bay were conspicuous by their absence,\r\nbelieving that in this way they were offering a protest against the\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\n[57] This was a clever strategetical move on the part of the Bishop,\r\nwho, though protesting that he was not concerned in a political\r\nnegotiation, evidently saw the advantage of utilising the occasion to\r\nmake an impression on the native mind in the interests of his Church.\r\nIn his published account of the event Bishop Pompallier makes it\r\nappear that the Protestant Missionaries had been circulating the\r\nstatement amongst the natives that he would not \"dare\" to put in an\r\nappearance at the meeting. He was, however, specially invited by\r\nCaptain Hobson, and he made the most of the opportunity thus given\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n[58] The name of this priest does not seem to have been preserved.\r\n\r\n[59] They were members of the Mounted Police Force which Captain\r\nHobson had brought with him from Sydney.\r\n\r\n[60] _Rangatira_: Chief, gentleman, one in authority.\r\n\r\n[61] In his discussions with the Maoris, Bishop Pompallier had\r\nstressed the point that he held the advantage over the Protestant\r\nMissionaries in that he was a member of the Episcopacy. The best\r\nattempt on the part of the natives to render into their own language\r\nthe word Episcopo, in its varied forms, was \"_Pikopo_,\" hence the\r\nBishop and his converts became known as _Pikopo_.\r\n\r\n[62] The Revs. Ironside and Warren, of the Wesleyan Mission, arrived\r\nat a later hour, with the contingent of Hokianga natives, including\r\nTamati Waaka Nēne; and on the following day they were amongst the\r\nwitnesses to the signatures.\r\n\r\n[63] _Authentic and Genuine History of the Signing of the Treaty of\r\nWaitangi_, by the Rev. W. Colenso.\r\n\r\n[64] These were all of foreign manufacture, and were the gifts of\r\nBishop Pompallier. On this point Jameson says: \"But the most virtuous\r\nof human actions are liable to be misinterpreted and misjudged, and M.\r\nde Pompallier's liberality to the natives was uncharitably stigmatised\r\nas an attempt to bribe and lure them to the adoption of the Catholic\r\npersuasion. This conduct was invidiously contrasted with that of the\r\nChurch of England and Wesleyan Missionaries, who deemed it a point of\r\nduty to hold out no temptation to the cupidity of the natives, as an\r\ninducement for them to become Christians, and also to encourage among\r\nthem regular habits of industry, gave them nothing except in fair\r\nexchange for agricultural produce or for services performed. The\r\nProtestant Missionaries have laboured with great zeal and success\r\namongst the New Zealanders. But in acknowledging their merits, we, in\r\ncommon justice, cannot condemn the motives of M. de Pompallier.\"\r\n\r\n[65] A short spear.\r\n\r\n[66] \"Captain Hobson spoke briefly but emphatically and with strong\r\nfeeling.\"--Felton Mathew.\r\n\r\n[67] Rewa once replied to a European who had chided him because he had\r\nceased to pay him his customary visits, \"I was ashamed to go, because\r\nI had no present to offer you. Formerly, when I went to see my friends\r\nI always carried them a present of pigs and potatoes, but I am a poor\r\nman now. I have sold all my land and I have nothing to give my\r\nfriends.\"\r\n\r\n[68] Mr. Gilbert Mair was a merchant at Kororareka. Mr. James E.\r\nClendon was likewise a merchant there, and had been Assistant British\r\nResident at Hokianga. He was at this period U.S.A. Consul.\r\n\r\n[69] Meaning the Proclamation referring to land titles.\r\n\r\n[70] Colenso repudiates the suggestion that the speeches were not\r\nproperly interpreted, and explains that Maori oratory is redundant\r\nwith repetition which, of course, was very properly eliminated during\r\nthe course of the translation.\r\n\r\n[71] The Bishop of Australia thus wrote to Mr. Williams on the subject\r\nof the Missionaries' land claims: \"I am led to believe that the\r\nimmediate consequence of establishing the British Dominion will be the\r\nsettlement of titles to land according to the principles of law and\r\nequity. This proceeding will necessarily lead to a judicial\r\ninvestigation of the landed properties transmitted to the Society.\r\nThese should be exactly and jealously re-examined, that you may be\r\nprepared to sustain them, even to the minutest point when brought\r\nunder the scrutiny of the world at large, as beyond all doubt they\r\nwill be. I think also that it will be expedient that you should take\r\nadvantage of the warning thus given of what you are to expect, by\r\npreparing a most full and explicit account of all the transactions\r\nbetween you and any of the natives.\"\r\n\r\n[72] This native had been actually christened at his own request as\r\n\"King George,\" Mr. Williams having taken the responsibility of\r\nreversing the names, and entering them in that form in the Register.\r\n\r\n[73] This was not the great Titore, who was the first to commence the\r\nfelling of kauri spars for the Navy, but another chief of the same\r\nname. Titore Nui (the great) signed the Treaty under the name of\r\nTakiri.\r\n\r\n[74] The Rev. R. Taylor relates an instance in which Tareha was about\r\nto despatch a slave for some real or imaginary offence. Mr. Kemp, one\r\nof the Missionaries interposed, and could not be persuaded to let the\r\nkilling go on. Whereupon Tareha picked him up (for he was a small man)\r\nand carried him over to his cottage, deposited him inside, and told\r\nMrs. Kemp to shut him up and keep him out of harm's way. He then\r\nreturned to the business on hand. On another occasion the Missionaries\r\ndiscovered Tareha in a choking condition, a fish bone having lodged in\r\nhis throat. He being _tapu_ (sacred) none of his people dared\r\ntouch him, but after considerable labour the Missionaries succeeded in\r\ndislodging the bone with the aid of a pair of scissors. After he had\r\nrecovered, the punctilious Tareha claimed the scissors as payment for\r\nthe desecration of his sacred throat.\r\n\r\n[75] Here he held up the canoe paddle, which he had used dramatically\r\nthroughout his oration.\r\n\r\n[76] This was a reference to the New Testament, which had just been\r\nprinted in the native language at the Missionary Press, at Paihia, and\r\ncirculated amongst the tribes.\r\n\r\n[77] Amongst the many contradictions which the historian of the Treaty\r\nof Waitangi has to reconcile, none is more difficult than the\r\nexplanation of Hone Heke's attitude towards the negotiation. The\r\nreport of his speech as printed above is taken from Colenso's account\r\nof the proceedings, and would lead one to suppose that Heke was in\r\nfavour of the treaty. Colenso's view is supported by the Rev. Henry\r\nWilliams, who tells us that Heke \"fully approved\" of the treaty and\r\nadvised the people to sign it. Other accounts are quite different. The\r\nRev. Mr. Burrows states that Heke \"gave a lot of trouble\" at the\r\nsigning of the treaty. The Rev. Mr. Ironside reports that Heke \"was\r\nviolent in his harangue against Captain Hobson, vociferating\r\nrepeatedly in his native style, '_Haere e hoki_' ('Go, return').\r\nTamati Waaka came to me and said his heart was _pouri_ (grieved)\r\nwith Heke's violence, and the way Captain Hobson was being treated.\r\n'Well,' I said, 'if you think so, say so'; whereupon Tamati sprang up\r\nand made his speech.\" In some interesting annotations made on the\r\ntreaty by Mr. William B. Baker, translator to the Native Department in\r\n1869, that gentleman says: \"I remember distinctly being present during\r\nthe whole of the meeting; that Hone Heke Pokai was very violent in his\r\nlanguage, though he is not mentioned by Captain Hobson. The chief\r\nwhose name is given, Kaiteke, was a better-known character in those\r\ndays than Heke, who, though a person of high rank and influence\r\nthrough his marriage with Hongi's favourite daughter, Rongo, had\r\npreviously led a very quiet and retired life. A war of words ensued\r\nbetween Tamati Waaka Nēne, who came in at this crisis, and Heke,\r\nthe result of which was that Waaka 'removed the temporary feeling that\r\nhad been created.'\" There is thus a distinct difference of opinion and\r\nimpression between Mr. Colenso and the above writers who were also\r\npresent and heard what was said.\r\n\r\n[78] _Vide_ Captain Hobson's despatch to Sir George Gipps,\r\nFebruary 5, 1840.\r\n\r\n[79] The Treaty.\r\n\r\n[80] \"Nēne spoke in a strain of fervid and impassioned eloquence\r\nsuch as I never before heard, and which immediately turned the tide in\r\nour favour.\"--Felton Mathew.\r\n\r\n[81] _Life and Times of Patuone_, by C. O. Davis.\r\n\r\n[82] This was a reference to Bishop Pompallier. The remark was no\r\ndoubt prompted by religious prejudice, and serves to show to what\r\nextent the bitterness of sectarian feeling had already grown, for\r\nPatuone was otherwise a man of a most kindly nature.\r\n\r\n[83] \"One of the chiefs said, 'Give us time to consider this\r\nmatter--we will talk it over amongst ourselves, we will ask questions,\r\nand then decide whether we will sign the treaty.' The speeches\r\noccupied about six hours, and the whole scene was one I would not have\r\nmissed for worlds, and which I will never forget.\"--Felton Mathew.\r\n\r\n[84] An attempt was made during the afternoon to distribute a quantity\r\nof tobacco amongst the natives, but in their impetuosity to secure the\r\n\"fragrant weed\" they upset the distributor, and an unseemly scramble\r\nensued which resulted in a certain amount of bad feeling.\r\n\r\n[85] \"In the meantime Mr. J. R. Clendon, an Englishman acting as\r\nAmerican Consul, the Missionaries, and many interested persons\r\nresiding there, or about becoming settlers, were made to understand\r\nthat their interests would be much promoted if they should forward the\r\nviews of the British Government. Every exertion was now made by these\r\nparties to remove the scruples of the chiefs, and thus form a party\r\nstrong enough to overreach the rest of the natives, and overcome their\r\nobjections. About forty chiefs, principally minor ones--a very small\r\nrepresentation of the proprietors of the soil--were induced to sign\r\nthe treaty. The influence of Mr. Clendon arising from his position as\r\nthe representative of the United States, was amongst the most\r\nefficient means by which the assent of even this small party was\r\nobtained. The natives placed much confidence in him, believing him to\r\nbe disinterested. He became a witness to the document, and informed\r\nme, when speaking of the transaction, that it was entirely through his\r\ninfluence that the treaty was signed.\"--Extract from Commander\r\nWilkes's _Journal_.\r\n\r\n[86] In some _Early Recollections_ Archdeacon Williams attributes\r\nthis affability to the fact that at this time Captain Hobson was\r\n\"under the delusion\" that the Catholics carried the sway with the\r\nnatives.\r\n\r\n[87] The Bishop rather plumes himself that by his intervention he\r\nsecured the inestimable boon of religious freedom to the people of New\r\nZealand--_vide_ his _History of the Catholic Church in Oceana_; but he\r\nis obviously labouring a point about which there was no dispute.\r\n\r\n[88] Archdeacon Williams is responsible for the statement that none of\r\nthe natives held back from signing the treaty because they did not\r\nunderstand it, but many did because of extraneous influences brought\r\nto bear upon them.\r\n\r\n[89] Hone Heke signed the treaty under his ancestral name, Pokai. All\r\nthe writers are agreed that he was the first, or amongst the first to\r\nsign; but on the treaty itself his name appears as sixty-sixth in\r\norder, the place of honour being given to Kawiti, his confederate in\r\nthe war of 1845. This may be accounted for by the fact that he wrote\r\nhis name on the part of the sheet that came most convenient to him.\r\n\r\n[90] The tattoo marks on their face.\r\n\r\n[91] At the close of the second day's ceremony Patuone advanced to the\r\ndais and presented Captain Hobson with a handsome greenstone\r\n_mere_ as a gift to the Queen. He afterwards returned on board\r\nthe _Herald_ and had dinner with the Governor.\r\n\r\n[92] The _Herald_ lay off the Hermione reef, where her guns could\r\ncommand the lawn in front of Mr. Busby's house, as well as the flat to\r\nthe left on which the Maoris were camped.\r\n\r\n[93] The following interesting reminiscences regarding the Treaty of\r\nWaitangi are from the pen of Mr. George Elliott-Elliott, who in the\r\nyear 1841 was Record clerk in the Government service: \"This celebrated\r\ndocument, a sort of New Zealand Magna Charta in its importance, is not\r\na single document, but is composed of a number of separate sheets;\r\nand, if I remember rightly, some few are of parchment and some of\r\npaper--the text is the same in all; these separate sheets were sent to\r\nthe different tribes and _hapus_ of natives for the signatures of\r\nthe different chiefs and influential men amongst them. Some of them\r\ncould write, and signed their names; others affixed their marks, in\r\nthe shape of what was supposed to be an imitation of the tattoo on\r\ntheir faces. Each of these sheets was in charge of some well-known\r\nEuropean, generally some one in connection with the Church of England\r\nor Wesleyan Missions, who attested the signatures and remarks of the\r\nvarious persons on the document, and, on completion, returned it to\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\n\"There is no doubt that this treaty has a _mana_ peculiar to\r\nitself, and that the natives regard it with respect. They believe that\r\nthey have thereby voluntarily given up to the _Pakeha_ a\r\nsomething which is their loss and the _Pakeha's_ gain; but what\r\nthat something is they are quite unable to define. I feel pretty sure\r\nthat if, from any accident in the early days, this document had been\r\nlost or destroyed, the natives would never have been induced to sign\r\nanother. That it was once saved from such accident the following will\r\nshow: In 1841 the Government offices were held in a four-roomed wood\r\ncottage in Official Bay, Auckland. The Colonial Secretary, the Audit,\r\nthe Colonial Treasurer, and the Customs each had one room. Mr.\r\nShortland was Colonial Secretary (the Audit was also under his\r\ncontrol), Mr. Cooper was Colonial Treasurer and Collector of Customs.\r\nThere were four clerks in the establishment--Grimstone in the\r\nTreasury, Leech in the Audit, Freeman and myself in the Colonial\r\nSecretary's. We were the Government in those prehistoric days. I was\r\ncalled Clerk of Records, and had charge of the various records and\r\npapers--not many then--amongst them this Treaty of Waitangi. This,\r\nwith the seal of the colony, I kept in a small iron box brought from\r\nSydney in the _Westminster_ the year before. I was living in a\r\n_raupo_ whare in Queen Street, close to Shortland Street, at that\r\ntime ('41), when early one morning--I can't remember the precise\r\ndate--I observed a great body of smoke ascending from Official Bay. I\r\nat once ran up Shortland Street, and on reaching the top of the hill\r\nfound that the Government offices were on fire. When I got to the\r\nbuilding one end was in flames and the place full of smoke. I saw that\r\nnothing could save the place. I at once tied my handkerchief over my\r\nface, got the door open, and rushed into the room which the Colonial\r\nSecretary occupied. I could not see for the smoke, and the\r\nhandkerchief both blinded and choked me. The room was small, and I\r\nknew it so well I could put my hand on anything in it blindfold. I at\r\nonce went to the iron box, unlocked it, took out the Treaty of\r\nWaitangi, and the seal of the colony, and ran out again directly. I\r\nsuppose from the time I entered the building until I left it was not\r\nmore than a minute, but it seemed an hour. I carried the seal and the\r\ntreaty to the house of Mr. Felton Mathew (Surveyor-General), which was\r\nclose by, and gave them into his charge. When I got outside the\r\nburning offices several persons had come up, amongst them some seamen\r\nfrom a French man-o'-war, then in harbour. They had a portable\r\nfire-engine, but it was useless, for there was no water. Of course the\r\nbuilding and its contents were all destroyed, amongst them the iron\r\nbox from which I had taken the seal and the treaty. The box was made\r\nof common sheet iron.\r\n\r\n\"I subsequently fastened the different sheets of the treaty together\r\nand deposited it in the Colonial Secretary's office, where I presume\r\nit has been ever since.\"\r\n\r\nTo commemorate the signing of the treaty, Mrs. Busby planted the\r\nPohutukawa tree still growing in front of the old Residency (see\r\nillustration).\r\n\r\nThe Maoris have also erected a monument on the opposite side of the\r\nriver, beside what is known as the Treaty House, where they at one\r\ntime hoped to establish a Parliament of their own. The monument was\r\nunveiled by the Hon. William Rolleston, Native Minister, on March 23,\r\n1881.\r\n\r\nThe original documents comprising the Treaty of Waitangi are now in\r\ncharge of the Department of Internal Affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nIN SEARCH OF SIGNATURES\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Captain Hobson had every reason to be gratified with the\r\nresult of his mission at Waitangi, it was perfectly obvious that the\r\nsignatures obtained there were only sufficient to give him jurisdiction\r\nover a very circumscribed area of country. It was equally evident that\r\nif the full intentions of the British Government were to be given\r\neffect to, it would be necessary to put into practice the Mahomedan\r\nprinciple and go to the mountain, since the mountain had failed to\r\ncome to him. He accordingly arranged a campaign by which the districts\r\nnorth of the Bay of Islands would be visited, either by himself\r\npersonally, or by his duly accredited officers. Pursuant to this\r\narrangement on the morning of the 10th, the Lieutenant-Governor\r\n(accompanied by Captain Nias) and his suite left the Bay of Islands\r\nand rode over to the Mission station at Waimate, where on the 12th\r\nthey held a meeting and obtained the signatures of all the chiefs\r\npresent. With two of the Church Missionaries, Messrs. Taylor and\r\nClarke, added to his company, Captain Hobson left Waimate next day and\r\ncontinued his journey to Hokianga, where it was anticipated a great\r\nmeeting would be held. On arriving at Waihou, a settlement on the\r\nbanks of the river about seven miles above the Wesleyan Mission\r\nstation,--for he was now within the Wesleyan sphere of influence,--the\r\nGovernor was met by the members of the Mission and all the principal\r\nEuropean settlers in the neighbourhood. Here he received, probably in\r\nthe form of an address, the warmest assurances of the settlers'\r\nfidelity to the Queen, and the most hearty congratulations to himself\r\nupon his selection as her representative.\r\n\r\nFrom this point the journey was continued by boats supplied by the\r\nsettlers, and the progress down the river was marked by frequent\r\nevidences of cordiality and even enthusiasm. On passing the settlement\r\nat Hauraki a salute of thirteen guns was fired from a miniature fort\r\nof European construction, and on arrival at the Mission station the\r\nGovernor was again the recipient of congratulations from the settlers\r\nand the Missionaries.\r\n\r\nIn response to these graceful felicitations Captain Hobson delivered a\r\nbrief address, in which he expressed the high sense he entertained of\r\nthis earnest of their loyal zeal in forwarding the views of Her\r\nMajesty's Government, and of the honour they had conferred upon him\r\npersonally by their flattering attention. At the same time Captain\r\nHobson took occasion to announce that in accordance with notices\r\nalready published, he proposed to hold a meeting of the chiefs there\r\nnext day, to which a cordial invitation was extended to the European\r\npopulation of every class and nation.\r\n\r\nThe novelty of the occasion was not without its influence upon the\r\nnatives, and upon a careful estimate it is computed that there were\r\nnot less than 3000 at the station next morning, of whom between 400\r\nand 500 were chiefs of varying rank and importance. Thus everything\r\npromised well. But at the hour appointed for the assembly it was\r\nobserved that there was a great disinclination on the part of the\r\nchiefs to associate themselves with the movement. Some were reticent,\r\nothers morose, more were openly hostile, and that to such an extent it\r\nwas manifest they were not approaching the subject with unprejudiced\r\nminds, and it required no keen observer to detect that an unfavourable\r\nspirit prevailed amongst them. By the exercise of a little judicious\r\nmanœuvring, however, they were at length induced to admit that\r\nthere could be nothing derogatory in at least hearing what message the\r\nGovernor had to deliver, and after some delay they were induced to\r\nform into procession and march to the place of meeting.\r\n\r\nThe business of the day commenced in much the same manner as it had\r\ndone at Waitangi and Waimate, the Rev. Mr. Hobbs, of the Wesleyan\r\nMission, acting as interpreter. After a short address to the\r\nEuropeans, Captain Hobson entered into a full explanation to the\r\nchiefs of the views and motives of Her Majesty in proposing to extend\r\nto New Zealand her powerful protection. He then, as on previous\r\noccasions, read the treaty, expounded its provisions, offered to\r\nelucidate all doubtful points, and invited the freest discussion.\r\n\"This undisguised manner of proceeding,\" wrote Captain Hobson to Sir\r\nGeorge Gipps, \"defeated much of the opposition, but did not, to the\r\nextent of my wish or expectation, remove the predetermination to\r\noppose me that had already been manifested. The New Zealanders are\r\npassionately fond of declamation, and they possess considerable\r\ningenuity in exciting the passions of the people. On this occasion all\r\nthe best orators were against me,[94] and every argument they could\r\ndevise was used to defeat my object.\"\r\n\r\nThe debate was opened by Aperahama Taonui, who rose and said: \"We are\r\nglad to see the Governor. Let him come to be a Governor to the\r\n_Pakehas_. As for us we want no Governor; we will be our own\r\nGovernor. How do the _Pakehas_ behave to the black fellows at\r\nPort Jackson? They treat them like dogs! See a _Pakeha_ kills a\r\npig; the black fellow comes to the door and eats the refuse.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the Governor come for?\" exclaimed Papahia. \"He, indeed! He to\r\nbe high, very high, like Maungataniwha (a high hill near Hokianga) and\r\nwe low on the ground; nothing but little hills. No, no, no! Let us be\r\nequal; why should one hill be high and another low? This is bad.\"\r\n\r\nMOSES (Mohi Tawhai)--\"How do you do, Mr. Governor? All we\r\nthink is that you come to deceive us. The _Pakehas_ tell us so,\r\nand we believe what they say; what else?\"\r\n\r\nTAONUI--\"We are not good (or willing) to give up our land. It\r\nis from the earth we obtain all things. The land is our Father; the\r\nland is our chieftainship; we will not give it up.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" cried Kaitoke; \"no, Mr. Governor, you will not square out\r\nour land and sell it. See there, you came to our country, looked at\r\nus, stopped, came up the river, and what did we do? We gave you\r\npotatoes, you gave us a fish-hook; that is all. We gave you land, you\r\ngave us a pipe, that is all. We have been cheated, the _Pakehas_\r\nare thieves. They tear a blanket, make two pieces of it, and sell it\r\nfor two blankets. They buy a pig for one pound in gold, and sell it\r\nfor three. They get a basket of potatoes for sixpence, sell it for two\r\nshillings. This is all they do; steal from us, this is all.\"\r\n\r\nHere the voluble Taonui again broke in upon the proceedings with some\r\nobservations which were so clearly not of native origin as to convince\r\nCaptain Hobson that he had not only the natural Maori ignorance and\r\nsuspicion to contend with, but powerful counter-influences originating\r\nwith the Europeans.\r\n\r\n\"Ha, ha, ha, this is the way you do,\" cried Taonui. \"First your Queen\r\nsends Missionaries to New Zealand to put things in order, gives them\r\n£200 a year. Then she sends Mr. Busby to put up a flag, and gives him\r\n£500 a year, and £200 to give to us natives. Now she sends a\r\nGovernor.\"[95]\r\n\r\n\"Speak your own sentiments, not what bad men have told you,\" retorted\r\nCaptain Hobson.\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" replied Taonui. \"I have not been to Port Jackson, but I know\r\nGovernors have salaries.\"\r\n\r\nThe Governor again felt compelled to interpose, and accused the\r\nspeaker of being prompted by designing Europeans.\r\n\r\nThis fact Taonui frankly admitted, and, turning to the assembly,\r\ncalled for his _Pakeha_ adviser to come forward and sustain his\r\nallegations. \"This call was reiterated by me,\" says Captain Hobson,\r\n\"when a person named Manning[96] presented himself. I asked him his\r\nmotive for endeavouring to defeat the benevolent object of Her\r\nMajesty, whose desire it is to secure to these people their just\r\nrights, and to the European settlers peace and civil Government.\"\r\n\r\nManning's reply was that he conscientiously believed that the natives\r\nwould be degraded under British rule and influence, and that therefore\r\nhe had advised them to resist the persuasions of the Governor and the\r\nMissionaries in favour of the treaty, admitting at the same time that\r\nthe laws of England were requisite to restrain and protect British\r\nsubjects, but to British subjects alone should they be applicable.\r\n\r\n\"But are you not aware that English laws can only be exercised on\r\nEnglish soil?\" asked Captain Hobson.\r\n\r\n\"I am not aware,\" replied Manning, \"I am not a lawyer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then that will do. Resume your seat,\" commanded Hobson.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant-Governor then proceeded to tell the chiefs that their\r\n_Pakeha_ friend had given them advice in utter ignorance of the\r\nmost important principle that British laws could not be enforced on a\r\nforeign soil, and that their only hope of protection against\r\nunscrupulous Europeans was to become a party to the treaty.\r\n\r\n\"If you listen to such counsel,\" he continued, \"and oppose me, you\r\nwill be stripped of all your lands by a worthless class of British\r\nsubject, who will consult no interest but their own, and who care not\r\nhow much they will trample upon your rights. I am sent here to control\r\nsuch people, and to ask from you the authority to do so.\"\r\n\r\nThis spirited little speech was responded to by what Captain Hobson\r\nhas called \"a song of applause.\" Several chiefs who had been silently\r\nsympathetic with the Governor now sprang up actively in his support,\r\nand by their championship changed the whole spirit of the debate.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome, welcome, welcome, Governor!\" cried Ngaro. \"Here are the\r\nMissionaries; they come to the land, they bought and paid for it, else\r\nI would not have them. Come, Come! I will have the Governor. No one\r\nelse perhaps will say 'Yes,' but I, Ngaro, I will have him. That is\r\nall I say.\"\r\n\r\nMOSES (Mohi Tawhai)--\"Where does the Governor get his\r\nauthority? Is it from the Queen? Let him come; what power has he?\r\nWell, let him come, let him stop all the lands from falling into the\r\nhands of the _Pakehas_. Hear, all ye _Pakehas_! Perhaps you\r\nare rum-drinkers, perhaps not; hear what is said by us. I want all to\r\nhear. It is quite right for us to say what we think; it is right for\r\nus to speak. Let the tongue of every one be free to speak; but what of\r\nit? What will be the end? Our sayings will sink to the bottom like a\r\nstone, but your sayings will float light, like the wood of the\r\nWhau-tree, and always remain to be seen. Am I telling lies?\"\r\n\r\nKaitoke, who had previously delivered a hostile speech, again openly\r\nmaintained his opposition by interjecting, \"Let us choose our own\r\nGovernor.\"\r\n\r\nThese sentences, democratic though they were to the last degree, found\r\nno sympathy with Rangatira Moetara, who followed with a brief speech.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome, Mr. Governor! How do you do? Who sold our land to the\r\n_Pakehas_? It was we ourselves by our own free will; we let it\r\ngo, and it is gone, and what now? What good is there in throwing away\r\nour words? Let the Governor sit for us.\"\r\n\r\nMOSES (Mohi Tawhai)--\"Suppose the land has been stolen from\r\nus, will the Governor enquire about it? Perhaps he will, perhaps he\r\nwill not. If they have acquired the land by fair purchase, let them\r\nhave it.\"\r\n\r\nTaonui, upon whom the refutation of Manning by the Governor had\r\nevidently had a marked effect, again rose and said:\r\n\r\n\"Lo, now for the first time my heart has come near to your thoughts. I\r\napproach you with my whole heart. You must watch over my children; let\r\nthem sit under your protection. There is my land too; you must take\r\ncare of it, but I do not wish to sell it. What of the land that is\r\nsold? Can my children sit down on it? Can they--eh?\"\r\n\r\nHere the chiefs Waaka Nēne, his brother Patuone, Rangatira, and\r\nTaonui stepped forward and chanted a song of welcome to the Governor,\r\nafter which Nēne made the following speech:\r\n\r\n\"Listen to me, Governor; all of you listen to me. This is my speech.\r\nIf the Baron de Thierry wishes to claim my land, why is he not here\r\nto-day? No, no; it was never sold to him. Does he think he will have\r\nit? No, no; he shall not have any of it. This is all I have to say.\"\r\n\r\nA chief, Hone Kingi Raumati, whose baptismal name was John King, next\r\ndelivered a sympathetic address: \"My speech is to the Governor. This\r\nis what I have to say. It was my father, it was Muriwai, told me to\r\nbehave well to the _Pakehas_. Listen, this is mine; you came, you\r\nfound us poor and destitute. We on this side say, 'Stay and sit here.'\r\nWe say, 'Welcome, welcome'; let those on the other side say what they\r\nlike. This is ours to you. Stay in peace. Great has been your trade\r\nwith our land. What else do you come for but to trade? Here am I. I\r\nwho brought you on my shoulders.[97] I say come; you must direct us,\r\nand keep us in order; that is all mine to you. If any one steal\r\nanything now there will be payment for it. I have done my speech.\"\r\n\r\nA chief whose name does not seem to have been preserved by the\r\nchronicler of the meeting, but who had support for the Governor in his\r\nwords, said: \"How do you do? Here am I, a poor man; and what is this\r\nplace? A poor place, but this is why you have come to speak to us\r\nto-day. Let the _Pakehas_ come and I have not anything to say against\r\nit. There is my place, it is good land; come and make it your\r\nsitting-place--you must stay with me. That is all.\"\r\n\r\nThe last speech was that of Daniel Kahika: \"What indeed!\" he said in\r\nindignant tones. \"Do you think I will consent to other people selling\r\nmy land? No, truly. If my land is to be sold I will sell it myself.\r\nBut no, I will not sell my land. I do not like the _Pakehas_ to\r\ntease me to sell my land. It is bad. I am quite sick with it. This is\r\nmy speech.\"\r\n\r\nSo closed the debate at Hokianga. Apologies were freely offered by the\r\nopposing chiefs, the most prominent of whom at once came forward and\r\nsigned the treaty.\r\n\r\n \"When the example had once been shown,\" wrote Captain Hobson, \"it was\r\n with difficulty I could restrain those who were disentitled by their\r\n rank from inserting their names. Upwards of fifty-six signatures were\r\n given,[98] and at twelve o'clock at night the business closed. Before\r\n the last of the party were dismissed it was intimated to me that the\r\n chiefs were desirous I should attend their feast on the following\r\n morning, and in order to gratify them I relinquished a visit I had\r\n arranged to the lower part of the river. At ten o'clock on the 13th I\r\n went by appointment to the Hauraki, and there 1000 as fine warriors\r\n as were ever seen were collected in their best costume. The native\r\n war-dance, accompanied by those terrific yells which are so well\r\n qualified to exhibit the natural ferocity of the New Zealand\r\n character, was exhibited for my amusement, the guns from a small\r\n European battery were fired, and the natives discharged their muskets\r\n and dispersed under three hearty cheers for my party. The feast which\r\n I had ordered to be prepared, consisting of pigs, potatoes, rice, and\r\n sugar, with a small portion of tobacco to every man, was partaken of\r\n by all in perfect harmony. It was estimated that of men, women, and\r\n children there were 3000 persons present. The influence against me\r\n was entirely traceable to the foreign Bishop of the Roman Catholic\r\n persuasion, and to a set of escaped convicts and other low ruffians\r\n who have congregated on the river in considerable numbers. These\r\n parties, though actuated by different motives, were united in their\r\n proceedings, and many of the latter were agents of the former. Mr.\r\n Manning, whom I have before mentioned, though not of a degraded\r\n class, is an adventurer, who lives with a native woman, has\r\n purchased a considerable portion of land, and being an Irish Catholic\r\n is the active agent of the Bishop. Another person, altogether of a\r\n lower description, known under the name of 'Jackey Marmon,' who is\r\n married to a native woman, and has resided in this country since\r\n 1809, is also an agent of the Bishop. He assumes the native character\r\n in its worst form--is a cannibal--and has been conspicuous in the\r\n native wars and outrages for years past. Against such people I shall\r\n have to contend in every quarter, but I do not despair of arranging\r\n matters hereafter with comparative ease. The two points at which I\r\n have already met the natives were the strongholds of our most violent\r\n opponents, and notwithstanding the untiring efforts of the Bishop\r\n Pompallier and the convicts, I have obtained the almost unanimous\r\n assent of the chiefs. Of the whole of the Hokianga but two head\r\n chiefs refused their consent, and even from their tribes many chiefs\r\n have added their names to the treaty. On the morning of the 14th,\r\n when preparing to return here, I regret to say that, notwithstanding\r\n the universal good feeling which subsisted among the chiefs on the\r\n previous day, two tribes of the Roman Catholic Communion requested\r\n that their names might be withdrawn from the treaty. It is obvious\r\n that the same mischievous influence I before complained of had been\r\n exercised in this instance. I did not of course suffer the\r\n alteration, but I regret that the credulity of the chiefs should\r\n render them so susceptible of unfavourable impressions. I considered\r\n that on the conclusion of the treaty at Waitangi the sovereignty of\r\n Her Majesty over the whole of the northern district was complete. I\r\n can now only add that the adherence of the Hokianga chiefs renders\r\n the question beyond dispute. I therefore propose to issue a\r\n Proclamation announcing that Her Majesty's dominions in New Zealand\r\n extend from the North Cape to the 36th degree of longitude. As I\r\n proceed southward and obtain the consent of the chiefs I shall extend\r\n these limits by Proclamation until I can include the whole of the\r\n Island.\"\r\n\r\nOn the day that Captain Hobson had first met the Rev. Henry Williams\r\non board the _Herald_ one of the many subjects they had discussed\r\nwas the purchasing of a site for the colonial Capital. In this respect\r\nthe Missionary's geographical knowledge of the north was invaluable,\r\nand when asked for his opinion he immediately pronounced solidly\r\nagainst the Bay of Islands where the land was too confined for a\r\npotential city. He was, however, enthusiastic about the isthmus at the\r\nWaitemata, as being unoccupied by natives, and possessing topographical\r\nadvantages far in excess of any other known site. It was, therefore,\r\nfor the dual purpose of inspecting this promising locality, and of\r\nmeeting the natives at Waitemata, that the Governor and Mr. Williams\r\nleft the Bay of Islands on February 21 in the _Herald_. A\r\nconsiderable number of signatures were obtained at various points\r\nalong the coast of the Hauraki Gulf, and on reaching the mouth of the\r\nWaitemata River in the Firth of Thames,[99] Mr. Williams was\r\ndespatched to Maraetai to communicate with and collect the natives in\r\nthat district. As he was returning to the ship four days later he met\r\nCaptain Nias coming to meet him in his boat. The Captain conveyed to\r\nhim the disquieting intelligence that on the previous Sunday (March 1)\r\nCaptain Hobson had been attacked by a violent illness--due to the\r\nharassing nature of his duties and to long exposure to wet, resulting\r\nin a paralytic seizure[100]--so severe as to disable him, and to cause\r\nhim to seriously contemplate his resignation and return to Sydney.\r\n\r\nWhen the Missionary saw the invalid in his cabin he took a more\r\noptimistic view of the situation, and strongly urged Captain Hobson\r\nnot to determine so hurriedly to relinquish his office as Governor. He\r\nfurther offered to find him comfortable quarters at the Mission\r\nstation where he could rest and have every care it was possible to\r\nprovide under the circumstances. These persuasions induced the\r\nGovernor to fall in with the Missionary's views; the _Herald_\r\nreturned to the Bay of Islands, and the patient was conveyed to the\r\nhouse of Mr. Richard Davis at Waimate, where he was attended by the\r\nship's surgeon, Dr. Alexander Lane, and was for several months nursed\r\nwith the utmost solicitude by the Missionary's family.\r\n\r\nDuring this period of forced inactivity Captain Hobson displayed the\r\ngreatest anxiety that the interests of his mission should not suffer\r\nbecause of his misfortune, and so far as his energies would permit he\r\ndaily laid his plans for the carrying on of the campaign which had\r\nthus been suddenly interrupted so far as he was personally concerned.\r\n\r\nFortunately he was surrounded by a band of men who were loyal, and\r\nenthusiastic in the cause he had come to espouse, and he had no\r\ndifficulty in enlisting the services of those who were prepared to\r\ncontinue the work where he had been compelled to lay it down. In this\r\nrespect the Missionaries, confidently relying on the traditional\r\njustice of the British Government,[101] were particularly zealous, and\r\nto them more than to any one else does the ultimate success belong.\r\nHad they so much as whispered hostility, the treaty and all its\r\nprofessions would have been rejected and despised. So far from this,\r\nthey not only lent it the influence of their word, but at this\r\ncritical stage, when the Governor was lying a stricken man, they\r\nbecame the harbingers of its promises and the apostles of its\r\nprinciples.[102]\r\n\r\nTo the north went the Rev. Mr. Taylor with Mr. Shortland; to the east\r\nthe Rev. William Williams, each bearing an authenticated copy of the\r\ntreaty, and authorised to treat with the principal native chiefs, at\r\nproperly constituted gatherings, for their signatures and their\r\nadherence to the provisions of the national compact.\r\n\r\nThe meeting in the north, which must rank next in importance to the\r\ngatherings at Waitangi and Hokianga, was that conducted by Lieutenant\r\nShortland at Kaitaia. Indeed it is questionable whether in some\r\nrespects it has not achieved a greater celebrity, for it was here that\r\nthe eloquent chief Nopera (Noble) coined the phrase which has been\r\nmore often quoted than any other in connection with the history of the\r\ntreaty: \"The shadow of the land goes to the Queen, but the substance\r\nremains with us.\"\r\n\r\nOn April 27 Mr. Shortland, who had now become Colonial Secretary,\r\naccompanied by the Rev. Mr. Taylor, Dr. Johnston, and Lieutenant Smart\r\nof the mounted police embarked on board the little schooner _New\r\nZealander_, and steering for the far north, touched first at\r\nMangonui, where they obtained the services of a native pilot, and on\r\nthe following Saturday anchored in the Awanui River, fully sixteen\r\nmiles from their destination. Mr. Taylor and the Doctor at once left\r\nthe vessel, and pushed on to the Mission station, there to arrange the\r\npreliminaries with Mr. Puckey, the resident Missionary. The Colonial\r\nSecretary remained on board the schooner until the Monday, and then\r\nwith Lieutenant Smart and the members of his force proceeded up the\r\nriver to Kaitaia, where they were received with volleys of musketry,\r\nand the fearsome evolutions of the war dance. From an early hour on\r\nthe following morning the chiefs and people were astir, busy with the\r\npreparations for the meeting, their demeanour being marked by a\r\ncordiality which had been so conspicuous by its absence at Waitangi\r\nand Hokianga.\r\n\r\nAt 10 o'clock the people--a motley and vivacious crowd--assembled on a\r\nlarge grass plot in front of Mr. Matthew's house, where they were\r\naddressed by the Colonial Secretary, with a solemnity befitting the\r\noccasion and a pomposity[103] which he deemed becoming his station.\r\nThe illness of the Governor was touchingly referred to as a reason for\r\nthe speaker's presence; the text of the treaty was read; the purpose\r\nof the compact explained; the machinations of the Queen's opponents\r\nwere denounced, and a promise given that His Excellency would strictly\r\nperform all the solemn engagements which the treaty imposed upon him\r\nin the name of Her Majesty.\r\n\r\nWith this important difference, that there was but little opposition,\r\nthere were few features to distinguish the debate from its\r\npredecessors. Several of the speakers boldly stated they had been told\r\nthat the treaty was nothing but a cunning device to enslave them.\r\nThere were also dark references to a Nga-Puhi plot to drive the\r\n_Pakehas_ into the sea, but to which they unhesitatingly declared\r\nthey were not prepared to give their countenance,[104] the speeches as\r\na whole breathing deeply the influence of the Missionaries.\r\n\r\nThe first speaker was a chief who had accepted the baptismal name of\r\nTaylor,[105] who appeared to scent trouble, but subsequently signed\r\nthe treaty under the name of Reihana Teira.\r\n\r\n\"This is my speech. We have always been gentlemen; we do not want a\r\nshepherd. We will not be hindered getting wood; we formerly cleared\r\nany spot of land we liked, burnt the wood; then some once came and\r\nbuilt a house on it, and then we quarrelled.\"\r\n\r\n\"The _Pakehas_ say the Governor comes to take the land,\"\r\nexclaimed a chief whose name has not been recorded. \"This is the first\r\ntime I ever heard the _pukapuka_ (the treaty). The _Pakehas_\r\nexplained it differently. Some people say plenty of _Pakehas_ are\r\ncoming to buy our land, but not for our good. They say the soldiers\r\nare come to shoot us, and that the Governor will not be a shepherd for\r\nus.[106] They say Mr. Puckey and Mr. Matthew know what is to become\r\nof us, but will not tell us. These are my sayings.\"\r\n\r\nWILLIAM (Wiremu Wirihana)--\"They tell us you are come to\r\nmurder all the Maoris, but if your works are good you will come to\r\npreserve us. If you are like the Missionaries that will be good. We\r\nfear the soldiers.\"\r\n\r\nIn clear and emphatic tones Te Rewiti, to whom has been given the\r\nEnglish name of Davis, exclaimed, \"I say 'Yes,' I say 'Yes' for the\r\nQueen. Although some men say 'No,' for the Governor, I say, 'Yes.' If\r\nthe Governor come to be our shepherd that is good; but if he come to\r\ntake our land I will not have him. If you say who makes me say, 'Yes,'\r\nI say my own heart. Much land has been bought by the _Pakehas_.\r\nLet it not be said it has been taken by the Governor. It has been\r\ntaken before. I have nothing more to say. If you have anything to say,\r\nsay it now, but do not go home and grumble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let all our sayings be one, let none say 'No,'\" was the counsel of\r\nForde. \"The Governor has not taken our land, it was taken before. My\r\nheart and my thoughts are with the Governor. I say, Yes, yes.\"\r\n\r\nMARSDEN--\"We shall not be slaves. Had we gone to other lands\r\nwe might have been slaves; they have come to protect us. Let not our\r\nhearts be dark; let us not listen to words from afar; let us see\r\nfirst. Is it not sin to murder and commit adultery; to tell lies. If\r\nwhat we hear from our teachers is true then what we hear from the\r\nGovernor is not a lie.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no land to give the Governor,\" said Toketau (Tokitahi). \"We\r\nwere gentlemen before, we will be greater now. Now we have more\r\nblankets, shirts, and trousers. Our houses were once made of rushes;\r\nthey are better now. I have made my speech.\"\r\n\r\nBUSBY (Puhipi)--\"Before the _Pakehas_ came we loved our\r\nown people. We sometimes quarrelled and then made war; then we made\r\npeace again and rubbed noses, then we had another battle. I am glad\r\nyou are come; let our hearts be one. If quarrels happen who will settle\r\nthem? You are so far off. Murder and theft may be suppressed, but what\r\nshall be done with adultery? It is carried on privately; do not let it\r\nbe said that I hide anything.\"\r\n\r\nPI (Pihere)--\"It will be good to see all the adulterers\r\nhanged in a row.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will a man be taken up if he walk in the night?\" was the pertinent\r\nquestion put by Matiu Tauhara (Mathew). \"That is all I am afraid of.\r\nIf a man steal it is right to punish him. This is all I have to say:\r\nLet all the Governors and _Pakehas_ be like the Missionaries,\r\nthat we be good. We have not been hurt by them.\"\r\n\r\n\"If your thoughts are as our thoughts in Christ, let us be one. We\r\nbelieve your hearts to be good. The _Pakehas_ bought all our\r\nland, and we have no more,\" were the words of Matiu Huhu.\r\n\r\nThe speech of Paratene Waiora (Broughton) concluded those of the minor\r\nchiefs.\r\n\r\n\"There is only one great man,\" he said, \"who cannot be killed, that is\r\nthe tongue; it often stirs up great wars. My father, Nopera, was\r\nsitting in his house reading his Bible when they said he was gone to\r\nthe north to kill the people. I say send away Pikopo (Bishop\r\nPompallier). Send him back; he is the cause of strife amongst us.\"\r\n\r\nNopera Panakareao, the most powerful chief in the district, who had\r\naccepted the not inappropriate baptismal name of Noble,[107] then rose\r\nand delivered the great speech of the meeting--a speech if not the\r\nmost influential in guiding the native mind at a critical moment it is\r\nat least so rich in worldly wisdom, so happy in poetic simile, so full\r\nof fervent loyalty, that it has become one of the Maori classics, and\r\ndeserves to be preserved amongst the finest examples extant of\r\nold-time native oratory:\r\n\r\n\"Here all of you _Pakehas_ and Maoris. This is my speech. My desire\r\nis that we should be all of one heart. Speak your words openly; speak\r\nas you mean to act; do not say one thing and mean another. I am at\r\nyour head. I wish you all to have the Governor. We are saved by this.\r\nLet every one say 'Yes,' as I do. We have now some one to look up to.\r\nSome say it will be the _Pakehas_ who will offend, I say no; it will\r\nbe the Maoris. My grandfather brought the _Pakehas_ to this very spot,\r\nand the chiefs agreed with what my grandfather did. He went on board\r\nthe ship and got trade. He spread it through the land. Let us act\r\nright as my ancestors did. The _Pakehas_ went to the Bay of Islands\r\nand were murdered. Let us do them no harm. What has the Governor done\r\nwrong? The shadow of the land goes to the Queen, but the substance\r\nremains with us. We will go to the Governor and get payment for our\r\nland as before. If the Nga-Puhi commit evil they will suffer. We have\r\nalways been friendly with the _Pakehas_. We never went in ships to\r\nEngland or Port Jackson to buy arms to kill our countrymen. If you\r\nwant to be cut off, go and fight the Governor. Do not, like the chiefs\r\nat Hokianga, wish to kill the Governor. Live peaceably with the\r\n_Pakehas_. We have now a helmsman, one said, 'Let me steer,' and\r\nanother said, 'Let me steer,' and we never went straight. Be jealous:\r\nlook well into your own hearts and commit no evil. The natives did\r\nwrong at the Bay and suffered. What man of sense would believe that\r\nthe Governor would take our goods, and only give us half of it? If you\r\nhave anything else to say, say it; but if not, finish, and all of you\r\nsay, 'Yes'--say 'Yes.'\"\r\n\r\nThis oration swept away all vestige of possible opposition as chaff\r\nbefore the wind. No one was bold enough to contend with the\r\nredoubtable Nopera, to agree with him were superfluous. The debate\r\ntherefore abruptly closed with a general exclamation of \"_Ae,\r\nAe_\" (\"Yes, yes\") and the assent and signatures of sixty of the\r\nprincipal chiefs were speedily obtained,[108] so that a few days\r\nlater Captain Hobson was able to write from his sick-room to the Chief\r\nSecretary for the Colonies: \"I am happy to report to your lordship\r\nthat Mr. Shortland succeeded to the fullest extent.\"\r\n\r\nThe Ambassador to the west was Captain Symonds,[109] an officer of the\r\nBritish Army, who immediately on receipt of his instructions proceeded\r\nto Manakau and there, aided by Mr. Hamlin, a Catechist of the Church\r\nMissionary Society, summoned at short notice a meeting of the chiefs.\r\nThe Missionary explained to the assembled warriors the views of the\r\nBritish Government, and solicited their adherence to the treaty, but\r\nthe opponents of the measure had been in advance of its advocates, and\r\nprejudice was already in the air. Amongst the most active in his\r\nhostility was the vacillating Rewa, who having reluctantly signed the\r\ndocument at Waitangi, had speedily recanted.[110] He now sought to\r\nmake up for his apparent desertion from the ranks of the opponents by\r\nthe violence of his attacks upon the Government, and Captain Symonds\r\nfound the chief had been so successful in his misrepresentations that\r\nhe was not able to do more at the first meeting than to dispel some of\r\nthe doubts which the ingeniousness of Rewa had created in the minds of\r\nall. A few days later the chiefs were again in council, when new\r\nforces were gathered from the Waikato, Taranaki, and Taupo. With these\r\nRewa had less influence, with the result that some signatures, and\r\nseveral promises were obtained from amongst the most influential men.\r\n\r\nBut now a new species of opposition was developed. The haughty Te\r\nWherowhero, the potential king of the Waikato, felt that he had been\r\nslighted in not being bidden to consult with the _Pakeha_\r\nGovernor ere this. Why had he been left to this late hour, and who\r\nwere these who had been placed before him? His dignity was severely\r\nwounded; his aristocratic soul rebelled against such scurvy treatment,\r\nand in a fit of pique he wrapped his blanket about him and refused to\r\nsign.\r\n\r\nFeeling that he must be satisfied for the present with whatever\r\nmeasure of success he had achieved, Captain Symonds left Manukau on\r\nApril 3, and hauling his boats across the portage which divides the\r\nManakau from the waters of the Waikato, he proceeded down the Awaroa\r\nriver to the Church Mission station at the Waikato Heads. Here he was\r\nreceived with the utmost cordiality by the Rev. Mr. Maunsell[111] who\r\nwas waiting his coming with no small anxiety. Matters had almost\r\nreached a crisis with the Missionary, who in the previous month had\r\ntaken advantage of a large gathering of natives for religious purposes\r\nto introduce the subject of the treaty, a copy of which had already\r\nbeen forwarded to him by the Lieutenant-Governor. The project had been\r\nreceived by the natives in the most friendly spirit, and signatures\r\nhad been obtained with the utmost alacrity. One important feature,\r\nunobserved at the time, had, however, been omitted. No presents had\r\nbeen sent to the Missionary to distribute amongst the signatories.\r\nException had not been taken to this apparent lack of hospitality at\r\nthe moment, but word had come into the settlement from the north that\r\nall who had signed the treaty at the Bay of Islands, and at Hokianga\r\nhad been paid with the Governor's blanket. The insidious nature of\r\nthis treatment had just dawned upon them when Captain Symonds arrived.\r\nThe whole settlement was in a state of wildest excitement. Their\r\nMissionary had deceived them; payment had been withheld; their\r\nsignatures had been wrongly obtained. To put matters right they loudly\r\ndemanded the return of the offending paper that they might tear it to\r\nbits and scatter it to the winds. Symonds was, however, able to\r\nquieten the tumult with timely explanations, and, what was more to the\r\npurpose, distributed a number of blankets amongst the chiefs,\r\npromising a similar gift to all others who would subscribe to the\r\nterms of the treaty.\r\n\r\nThe expedition displayed by Mr. Maunsell, but which had come so\r\nperilously near wrecking his own influence, proved an unexpected boon\r\nto Captain Symonds, who on examination of the signatures thus obtained\r\ndiscovered that with few exceptions all the influential chiefs as far\r\nsouth as Mokau, had acknowledged the sovereignty of the Queen. These\r\nfew were resident in the districts of Aotea and Kawhia, and were\r\nwithin the sphere wherein was labouring the Rev. John Whiteley,[112]\r\nof the Wesleyan Mission. To him accordingly Captain Symonds wrote,\r\n\"being well assured of the disposition on the part of the Wesleyan\r\nMission to support the Government by every exertion in its power,\" and\r\nconfided to him the execution of that portion of his instructions\r\nwhich he deemed could be more expeditiously carried out by the\r\nMissionary than by himself.\r\n\r\nOn April 18 Captain Symonds returned to Manakau, and there obtained\r\nseven more signatures. Te Wherowhero[113] was still obdurate, though\r\nmanifesting no ill-will towards the Government. His native pride had\r\nbeen hurt, and time had not yet healed his injured spirit.\r\n\r\nIn these latter negotiations Captain Symonds laboured under the\r\nconsiderable disadvantage that he was unable to procure the services\r\nof a competent interpreter, Mr. Hamlin[114] being absent on duties\r\nincidental to his station. The lack of all public ceremonial was also\r\nto his disadvantage, the pageant of which ever appeals with persuasive\r\nforce to the impressionable mind of the savage; while the surroundings\r\nwere not altogether without the suggestion that the crozier was still\r\nsecretly opposing the Crown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REV. HENRY WILLIAMS, C.M.S.]\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of preserving the consecutive nature of our narrative\r\nit will be convenient at this point to digress for a moment, and in\r\nthat time discuss a debatable point which must ere now have occurred\r\nto the reader, viz. what was Bishop Pompallier's attitude towards the\r\ntreaty? To aid our judgment in this connection two classes of evidence\r\nare available,--that of the Protestant Missionaries and the official\r\ndespatches of those engaged in the promotion of the treaty, on the one\r\nside, and the personal statement of his position by the Bishop on the\r\nother. Bishop Pompallier had landed at Hokianga in 1838 for the\r\npurpose of establishing a branch of the Roman Catholic Oceanic\r\nMission, of which he had been appointed Vicar Apostolic. We have his\r\nassurance, which may be accepted without reservation, that he hoped to\r\nlabour in a part of the country where he would not come into conflict\r\nwith other Missions, and it came to him as a surprise, and probably as\r\na deep disappointment, when he discovered that the existing Missions\r\nhad so far covered the country that no such isolation was possible at\r\nHokianga, upon which he had determined as the centre of his operations.\r\nBut having come he decided to remain; and his advent was a bitter\r\ntrial to the representatives of the Protestant Missions, who foresaw\r\nin it a serious interruption of their work by the introduction to the\r\nMaori of doubts and controversies which, while disturbing, were not\r\nessential either to their civilisation or to their soul's\r\nsalvation.[115] Exactly what they anticipated would occur, did occur,\r\nwith the result that the animosities of religious rivalry were kindled\r\nin a way that had never been known between the Anglican and Wesleyan\r\nMissions; and the absurdity was not infrequently witnessed of Maoris\r\nconfidently discussing matters of dogma which for centuries have\r\nbaffled solution at the hands of trained theologians. The effect of\r\nthis was to sow the seeds of bitterness in the hearts of the\r\nProtestant Missionaries, and there is sometimes noticeable a dearth of\r\ncharity in their references to the Bishop which unfortunately is not\r\nsingular in Church history.\r\n\r\nWe may, therefore, discount on the grounds of prejudice their\r\naccusations against the \"Catholic Bishop\" as much as we please, but we\r\nhave still to account for the awkward fact, to which Mr. Colenso has\r\ndrawn pointed attention, that the most violent opposition to the\r\ntreaty at Waitangi came from the chiefs living under the religious\r\nguidance of Bishop Pompallier. The same circumstance was noted by\r\nCaptain Hobson at Hokianga, by Captain Symonds at Manakau, and by\r\nMajor Bunbury at Tauranga. Was, then, this widespread disaffection\r\namongst the Catholic converts merely a coincidence? or was it the\r\nfruit of suggestion?\r\n\r\nIt has to be admitted that whatever feelings animated the Protestant\r\nMissionaries, at least Captain Hobson was not the victim of religious\r\nprejudice. From the first he adopted an attitude of most respectful\r\ndeference towards the Bishop, a partiality which the Frenchman was not\r\nslow to observe and comment upon. When, therefore, the Lieutenant-Governor,\r\ntook the responsibility of stating in his despatch to Sir George Gipps\r\n(February 17, 1840), \"The influence against me was easily traceable to\r\nthe foreign Bishop of the Roman Catholic persuasion,\" he is at least\r\nentitled to the credit--considering the character of the man--of our\r\nbelieving that he would not have made so bold an assertion had he not\r\nbeen fortified by the conviction that there was evidence to support\r\nit. The same measure of confidence must be accorded to Captain\r\nSymonds, a military officer of, so far as we can judge, the highest\r\nintegrity. In reporting the result of his mission at Manakau he\r\nrecords the fact that \"Rewa the principal follower of the Roman\r\nCatholic Bishop, exerted all his influence against me,\" and that on\r\nhis return to this settlement from the Waikato Heads a few days later,\r\nhe was still unable to secure the signatures of certain chiefs, a\r\nfailure which he attributed \"partly to the Bishop's influence.\" Again\r\nbluff Major Bunbury tells us that when at the Otumoetai Pa, near\r\nTauranga, \"Another chief expressed some indignation because the\r\nChristian chiefs had not, as he said, met them. I presume he meant\r\nthose from the other _pa_ where Mr. Stack's influence was\r\nsupposed to extend more than his own, and where a Roman Catholic\r\nResidency and the Catholic Bishop were supposed to have more\r\ninfluence.\"\r\n\r\nWhether this failure on the part of the Christian natives to\r\nco-operate with the residents of Otumoetai in the consideration of the\r\ntreaty meant their active hostility, or merely a negative indifference\r\nto the proposals of the Crown, is not clear, nor is it certain to\r\nwhat extent the influence of the Missionary Bishop and his assistant\r\ncontributed to either of these conditions, if either existed. Certain\r\nit is, however, that neither exerted themselves to aid the\r\nconsummation of the treaty. Of this fact Bishop Pompallier has made no\r\nsecret so far as he himself was concerned, and it is unlikely that his\r\nclergy would adopt an attitude different to his own. Neutrality he\r\nmakes the buttress of his position, professing a total disregard for\r\npolitics; his whole concern being the spreading of the Church's\r\ninfluence and the refutation of heresy. Of this, a perusal of the\r\nBishop's own statement is the least devious road to proof:\r\n\r\n On January 1840 Captain Hobson arrived at the Bay of Islands with the\r\n qualification of English Consul and Vice-Governor of New Zealand,\r\n under the immediate control of the Governor of Sydney in New Holland.\r\n The corvette, the _Herald_, brought Captain Hobson and all the\r\n members of his approaching administration. The Protestant\r\n Missionaries spread the report amongst the natives that this time the\r\n Catholic Bishop was going to be taken out of the country by the\r\n English man-o'-war which lay at anchor off the coast. They said also\r\n that I would not dare to appear at the public meetings that the new\r\n Governor was going to hold with the Maori chiefs and the whites, to\r\n talk over with them his plans for the Colonial administration of New\r\n Zealand. All the natives in the country were astonished both at the\r\n arrival of a strange Governor, and at the strange reports that were\r\n flying about. The day after his arrival, the Maori chiefs received\r\n printed letters from Captain Hobson, inviting them to meet at a place\r\n in the Bay called \"Waitangi,\" where a treaty was to be read to them\r\n in their own language, and afterwards signed by them. Many of the\r\n Catholic chiefs came to consult me, above all the great chief Rewa.\r\n They asked me what was to be done under the circumstances in which\r\n their country was placed, and whether they ought or not to sign. I\r\n answered them that these were political matters which were outside my\r\n province. I was only in this country to pasture souls in the word of\r\n God, and direct them in the faith, morality, and the Catholic\r\n discipline, confer the sacraments of salvation on persons of\r\n whatsoever nationality who should have recourse to my ministry in a\r\n proper disposition, and that there ended my divine mission. It was\r\n for them to determine what they might desire to do with their\r\n national sovereignty; whether to keep it or to transfer it to a\r\n foreign nation; they were therefore at liberty to sign or not, to\r\n sign the treaty which was going to be put before them; that for\r\n myself and my clergy we were prepared to exercise our ministry of\r\n salvation for those who signed in the same manner as for those who\r\n did not sign. In a word, we were prepared to instruct them in the\r\n faith whether they continued to be New Zealanders or became English.\r\n Now in this way I kept myself entirely aloof from politics, and the\r\n people were at liberty to do as seemed best to them, with regard to\r\n their social state of life, and I remained free in what concerned my\r\n ministry for the spiritual and Christian life they had to follow in\r\n the Catholic Church. I went dressed in my Episcopal cassock, to the\r\n great meeting of the chiefs of the Bay of Islands with the whites,\r\n over which Captain Hobson presided. His Excellency was surrounded by\r\n the officers of the corvette and by a number of Protestant\r\n Missionaries. My coming was a great surprise to the latter, and to\r\n the natives who had heard that I should never dare to appear there.\r\n Captain Hobson received me with much civility and respect, and caused\r\n me to be put in a place of distinction. A political treaty which the\r\n English Government wished to conclude with the Maoris was read and\r\n explained to them. By virtue of this treaty the Maoris became English\r\n subjects; they remained masters of their landed property, but they\r\n were not allowed to sell, as formerly to private purchasers. If they\r\n desired to sell any of their land they could only do so with the\r\n consent of the Colonial Government.\r\n\r\n While the speeches were being made on behalf of Captain Hobson and\r\n the chiefs of the Maori tribes I remained silent; I had nothing to\r\n say; they were simply about political matters. One question, however,\r\n interested me deeply, it was that of religious freedom about which no\r\n one in any way seemed to trouble themselves. Before the last meeting\r\n broke up, and it became a question of signing the treaty I broke\r\n silence. I addressed Captain Hobson, begging him to make known to all\r\n the people the principles of European civilisation which obtain in\r\n Great Britain, and which would guarantee free and equal protection to\r\n the Catholics as to every other religion in New Zealand. My demand\r\n was immediately acceded to by Captain Hobson, who made a formal\r\n notification of it to all the assembled people, to the great\r\n satisfaction of all the Catholic chiefs and tribes, who triumphed in\r\n the fact of my presence in the face of the Protestant Missionaries,\r\n and at the speedy compliance with the few words I had spoken. As to\r\n the political treaty, was it or was it not understood by the natives?\r\n That is a mystery difficult to solve. The result was that some chiefs\r\n signed it and some did not. But the Catholic religion gained instead\r\n of losing its dignity and its influence over the minds of the people.\r\n When a certain number of natives had signed the treaty the\r\n sovereignty of England over the whole of New Zealand was declared by\r\n a salvo of artillery fired by the corvette _Herald_. The English\r\n flag floated over the country, and Mr. Hobson took the title of\r\n Vice-Governor of New Zealand. As for myself, I exercised my ministry\r\n as freely as before over all parts of this large archipelago. The\r\n Governor seemed to have a particular regard for the Catholic Bishop.\r\n His Excellency promised that my future missionary vessel should be\r\n free from all imposts, and that everything that came to me from\r\n beyond the country for the purpose of my labours should be free from\r\n duty. My position at this time disappointed not a little the ill-will\r\n of those who had spread sinister reports about myself and my clergy,\r\n some weeks before. The people became more and more confident in the\r\n idea that Protestantism had always been deceiving them. They saw,\r\n moreover, that we had come to New Zealand but for them and the ends\r\n of salvation, in favour of every soul that lived in the country, not\r\n troubling ourselves as to what national flag they belonged. They saw\r\n in our hands but one standard, that of the cross that leads to\r\n Heavenly glory. At one time they had said the Catholic had come to\r\n seize upon the sovereignty of New Zealand, and they beheld him\r\n remaining and working just as before, after possession had been\r\n taken. Many natives in their uprightness said, \"It was all very well\r\n for the Protestant Ministers to tell us so much about the Catholic\r\n Bishop taking our country, but on the contrary, it was themselves, in\r\n their own nation who took it from us.\" From all these new\r\n circumstances there resulted on the part of the people, English and\r\n Maoris, but especially the latter, more esteem, more confidence, more\r\n attention for the Bishop and the Catholic Clergy.[116]\r\n\r\nThe Bishop's publicly expressed views receive valuable confirmation\r\nfrom Captain Lavaud, of the French frigate _L'Aube_ which reached\r\nthe Bay of Islands in July 1840. After paying his respects to the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, the Captain proceeded to the Bishop's house and\r\nthere had an interview with the prelate, the substance of which he\r\nsubsequently reported in the following terms to the French Minister of\r\nMarine:\r\n\r\n I arrived at the Bishop's only in the afternoon, so long is the\r\n passage from Russell-town to Kororareka against contrary winds and\r\n tide. I was curious and impatient to hear what he might have to\r\n communicate to me. Still I was reassured as to the situation in which\r\n he found himself placed with regard to the authorities, by the very\r\n pleasing manner in which Mr. Hobson[117] had just spoken of him to\r\n me: the feelings of esteem and consideration which he expressed; the\r\n respect his name evoked from all those present, and the well-deserved\r\n praise they gave to his character and his tolerance. Compared with\r\n the Anglican Missionaries he was the real good man, the friend of the\r\n poor and of the savages, having no other ambition than to call to the\r\n Catholic faith and to civilisation the natives, to whose happiness he\r\n consecrates his existence, hoping to receive in the other world a\r\n reward which his adversaries prefer to taste in this one. Their\r\n evangelic labours are thus always accompanied by schemes of\r\n aggrandisement of luxury, and of riches, things in which they have\r\n until now made considerable progress. To stop them nothing less was\r\n necessary than the prohibition of the Queen (of England) forbidding\r\n them henceforth to acquire land from the natives, and limiting the\r\n holdings to 2500 acres. These gentlemen were indeed not slow to\r\n notice that though they were occult instruments of British power in\r\n New Zealand, they were its first victims. One must not, however,\r\n believe that the Anglican, Wesleyan, Methodist, and other\r\n Missionaries occupy themselves exclusively, and all of them, with\r\n speculations and means of making their fortunes; they also occupy\r\n themselves with the instruction of the people, but I shall have\r\n opportunity later on of returning to this subject. On my arrival at\r\n Bishop Pompallier's I received the marks of kindness which that\r\n excellent pastor lavishes on all his fellow-countrymen. He thanked me\r\n more than it was necessary for him to do for all my care and\r\n attention towards the priests during the voyage, and he did not\r\n conceal from me that this little increase of subjects sent out to him\r\n by the Marist community had been so necessary for so long a time that\r\n it was no longer by twos, but by tens and even twenties that priests\r\n ought to be sent out to him to help him to save the people of New\r\n Zealand, of whom 25,000 were already on the way to Catholicism. He\r\n also told me how grateful he was to the French Government for the\r\n protection it granted him, as well as to his mission in these seas.\r\n He spoke to me of the acts of kindness of the King, of the Queen and\r\n the Royal family, and principally of the interest H.R.H. Madam\r\n Adelaide was taking in the success of his labours. I took great\r\n pleasure in listening to Monsignor Pompallier on this subject, but I\r\n had not lost sight of the fact that he must have other things whereof\r\n to inform me. I, too, since I had seen Captain Hobson, was rather\r\n eager for news, and curious to know the mission of the _Herald_. I\r\n therefore profited by the first opportunity I had to ask the Bishop\r\n to speak to me about the political events of this country, but\r\n Monsignor is like they all are, he loves his Mission, his successes,\r\n his hopes, and it was with difficulty he decided upon changing the\r\n subject of conversation, but at last he did it most graciously. I\r\n learned thus from him, that from the month of February 1839, Captain\r\n Hobson, who had arrived some days previously in the Bay of Islands,\r\n with the title of \"Consul\" had assumed the rank of Lieutenant-Governor\r\n of the Islands of New Zealand conferred on him by the gracious will\r\n of the Queen; that an assembly presided over by him, and attended by\r\n most of the great chiefs of the North Island, as well as several\r\n Europeans of distinction, Monsignor himself included, had taken\r\n place, the aim of which was to make known to the New Zealand chiefs\r\n that the Queen would grant her powerful protection to the New Zealand\r\n tribes who had solicited it, only under the condition that the treaty\r\n proposed to them would inform them that H.B.M. would extend her\r\n sovereignty over the Islands of New Zealand only as far as these\r\n chiefs would consent to sign it. I here transcribe this official\r\n document, yet but little known, and so singularly reproduced by some\r\n persons.[118]\r\n\r\n It will be noticed that at the Assembly of which I have just spoken,\r\n which was held in Busby's in Wai-Tanghi, there was not one single\r\n Frenchman, except Monsignor. They thought by their absence (at least\r\n that was their intention) to protest against what was taking place.\r\n The Bishop who certainly was not obliged to inform me of the motives\r\n that made him act differently, told me, however, that having received\r\n a special invitation from Mr. Hobson, he thought he ought not to\r\n refuse his presence, inasmuch as his Mission was quite a spiritual\r\n one, and that his being an ecclesiast put him outside of all\r\n politics, and that it was most necessary for the success of\r\n Catholicism in this country that all should be convinced that in that\r\n respect he was perfectly indifferent, that every day he was trying to\r\n avoid giving his conduct the slightest doubt of the purity of his\r\n intentions, that besides in the assembly Captain Hobson had in his\r\n address to the New Zealand chiefs, of whom several were Catholics,\r\n informed them that Bishop Pompallier, pointing him out, would remain\r\n amongst them, that he would be protected there, as well as the\r\n religion he preached, in the same manner as the British Missionaries\r\n and their co-religionists. At this assembly the New Zealanders\r\n appeared uneasy and anxious to know how the meeting would end,\r\n during which several speeches were delivered by the chiefs, partly to\r\n the Governor and partly to the New Zealanders themselves. At one\r\n moment it was feared the treaty would be rejected. Several chiefs\r\n spoke against it, and one of the most prominent, Rewa-Rewa, went as\r\n far as to say, \"Let us drive away the white chief. What does he come\r\n here for? To take away from us the liberty you are enjoying. Do not\r\n believe his words. Do you not see that, later on, he will use you to\r\n break stones on the roads?\"\r\n\r\n This chief belonged to the Catholic religion, but his allocution was\r\n opposed by two of the principal chiefs of the Island, and of the\r\n district of Hokiangha, as well as by Pomare the nephew of the\r\n celebrated chief of that name of Kawa-Kawa, in the Bay of Islands,\r\n all partisans of the Williams Mission. This allocution (Rewa's) did\r\n not have the success he expected for it, and the acceptance took\r\n place, although without enthusiasm, by the majority of the members of\r\n the assembly. Several gave their adhesion by signing the treaty,\r\n others retired without signing, and already on the following day,\r\n after a few small gifts, the sovereignty of H.M. the Queen of England\r\n was proclaimed over the North Island of New Zealand. Eye-witnesses\r\n report that this declared sovereignty is a conjuring trick on the\r\n part of Captain Hobson, but in that case, at least we must admit that\r\n the trick was played rapidly and skilfully enough. Other official\r\n declarations were made on the same subject.\r\n\r\nHere then are the facts--conflicting it is true--from which no doubt\r\nconclusions equally conflicting will be drawn. Having regard to the\r\nhigh character of the Bishop it is inconceivable that he would desire\r\nto do anything but that which was right. It is, however, equally\r\npossible that he experienced a difficulty in completely suppressing\r\nhis national feelings, and that he had unconsciously created for\r\nhimself the paradoxical position of being neutral as an ecclesiastic,\r\nand yet hostile as a Frenchman.\r\n\r\nAlong the populous shores of the Bay of Plenty, and in the interior\r\nbehind Tauranga, Hobson had as his allies the Revs. Brown and Stack,\r\nwhile William Williams[119] carried the treaty from _hapu_ to _hapu_\r\nthrough the rugged country on the eastern coast between East Cape and\r\nAhuriri.[120] In a like manner upon Missionaries Chapman and Morgan\r\ndevolved the onerous task of bringing the turbulent Arawas at Rotorua\r\ninto line. The manner in which these minor envoys laboured, and the\r\nextent to which they succeeded is modestly told in their letters to\r\nthe Lieutenant-Governor; but this much must in justice be said, that\r\nthough their proceedings were necessarily less picturesque in their\r\nsetting, and less sensational in their climax, they were equally\r\nsincere with those who garnered in the wider fields, and who in\r\nconsequence have loomed more prominently in the historical\r\nperspective.\r\n\r\nA mission upon a more extensive scale and one fraught with more\r\nimportant issues was entrusted to the Rev. Henry Williams. To this\r\nvirile Missionary was allotted the task of bearding the lion in his\r\nden, for the Lieutenant-Governor had every reason to believe that the\r\nofficers of the New Zealand Company would use whatever influence they\r\npossessed to prevent the consummation of a policy which in its\r\nultimate effects they surmised would be so prejudicial to their own.\r\nFor this assumption events proved there was only too much justification.\r\nThe Government had, however, put its hand to the plough; and in Mr.\r\nWilliams, Colonel Wakefield found a match both in determination and\r\ndiplomacy.\r\n\r\nA small schooner, the _Ariel_, owned and sailed by Captain\r\nClayton, was chartered for the journey, and late in March they set\r\noff, calling at Tauranga and Poverty Bay _en route_, leaving\r\ncopies of the treaty for local circulation as they went. The\r\n_Ariel_ reached Port Nicholson late in April, her coming being by\r\nno means a welcome circumstance to the principal agent of the Company.\r\nThe first meeting between Colonel Wakefield and the Missionary took\r\nplace on the Saturday after arrival, at the house of Mr. Hunter, and\r\nwas more animated than friendly. The former had either not yet\r\nreceived--or chose to ignore--the private instructions of his\r\nsuperiors in England, to afford Captain Hobson all the aid and\r\nassistance in his power towards the attainment of British\r\nsovereignty.[121]\r\n\r\nFor ten days the Colonel doggedly held on his course of opposition,\r\nduring which time there was a frequent clash of wordy weapons, the\r\nsoldier seeking to vindicate the independence of his settlement on the\r\nground that they had acquired their rights from the chiefs prior to\r\nthe intervention of the Crown; the missionary maintaining that no such\r\nrights could be acquired by British subjects without the consent of\r\nthe Sovereign.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the constitutional nature of this argument appealed to\r\nthe Colonel, it is impossible to say. In all probability it did not,\r\nbut there are ample reasons for concluding that the governing\r\ninfluence in his conduct was a desire to obtain possession of a block\r\nof forty acres of land in what was then the most valuable portion of\r\nthe infant settlement of Wellington, and to which Mr. Williams had\r\nacquired an undoubted title. Wakefield's subsequent actions at least\r\nindicate that his surrender did not carry with it his conversion to\r\nthe treaty, which he still strove to persuade himself could not affect\r\nthe purchases of the Company. But whatever the considerations that\r\ninfluenced him, just as the Missionary was preparing to depart in\r\ndisgust, he at length[122] consented to withdraw his objections to\r\nthe chiefs considering the treaty, and retracting what Mr. Williams\r\nhas been pleased to designate as his \"insolent\" remarks.\r\n\r\nThe character of the terms in which the Colonel was likely to address\r\nthe Missionary may be judged from a paragraph in a letter indicted by\r\nhim to his directors on May 25, 1840, in which he declares: \"I cannot\r\nexpress to you the feelings of repugnance entertained by the\r\nrespectable colonists who came into contact with Mr. Williams, towards\r\nhim, on account of his selfish views, his hypocrisy, and unblushing\r\nrapaciousness. He frequently said that finding I had been before him\r\nin the purchase of land in the Strait without consulting him, he had\r\nendeavoured to do the best for himself, and had disparaged the Company\r\nand its settlers to the natives. On the whole, it was only by a great\r\neffort, and in the hope of benefiting the colony that I could bring\r\nmyself to hold any terms with this worst of land-sharks.\"[123]\r\n\r\nThe hostility of the Company's principal agent once removed,\r\nthirty-two of the chiefs signed the treaty readily enough on the 29th\r\nof the month, the impression made on Mr. Williams's mind being \"that\r\nthey were much gratified that protection was now afforded to them in\r\ncommon with Her Majesty's subjects.\"\r\n\r\nIn his marked antipathy to Mr. Williams and all that he did Colonel\r\nWakefield has endeavoured to deprecate the value of these proceedings\r\nin his report to his superiors, wherein he takes the responsibility of\r\nsaying, \"The natives executed some paper, the purport of which they\r\nwere totally ignorant,\" and insinuates that the whole transaction took\r\nplace in an underhand way and had neither the countenance nor the\r\nassistance of the colonists.\r\n\r\nThe _Ariel_ then crossed over to Queen Charlotte Sound, \"where,\"\r\nsays Mr. Williams in his Memoir, \"we saw all who were to be seen\r\nthere. We crossed over to Kapiti, Waikanae, and Otaki the stations of\r\nthe Rev. O. Hadfield. The treaty was explained at all these places and\r\nsigned.[124] On this visit I saw in the Bank at Wellington a map of\r\nNew Zealand about six feet in length, and was told by the authorities\r\nof the New Zealand Company that the coloured portion was the property\r\nof the Company from the 38° to the 42° parallel of latitude. At this\r\ntime there was no one in connection with their Company who knew\r\nanything of the language. A man named Barret could speak a few words\r\nin the most ordinary form. This man alone was the medium of\r\ncommunication between the Maoris and the Company in all their affairs,\r\nand the deeds of purchase were drawn up in English, not one word of\r\nwhich was understood by the Maoris.\"\r\n\r\nIt had been Mr. Williams's intention, after completing the collection\r\nof the signatures in the vicinity of Cook Strait, to proceed to the\r\nfar South, soliciting the assent of the Ngai-Tahu tribe to the terms\r\nof the treaty. To this end he had already entered into an arrangement\r\nwith Captain Clayton, who like the loyal sailor he was, readily agreed\r\nto forgo his more lucrative coastal trade in order that his vessel\r\nmight remain at the disposal of the Government. Before this section of\r\nthe voyage could be undertaken, however, it was ascertained that the\r\nGovernor, deeming the mission worthy of some more ostentatious display\r\nof power than could be effected by a schooner, had commissioned Major\r\nBunbury of the 80th Regiment to sail with Captain Nias in Her\r\nMajesty's frigate _Herald_,[125] for the purpose of visiting the more\r\nimportant Southern settlements.\r\n\r\nOn hearing of this, Mr. Williams returned with all expedition to his\r\nduties at Waimate, which place he reached on June 10, bringing with\r\nhim the famous Ngati-Awa chief, Wiremu Kingi, whose anxiety to see the\r\nGovernor had induced him to travel all the roadless miles which lay\r\nbetween Waikanae and the Bay of Islands.\r\n\r\nOn the submission of his report to the Governor, Mr. Williams was the\r\nrecipient of the most hearty congratulations from Captain Hobson, who\r\nrecognised in the service of the Missionary an arduous task well and\r\nfaithfully performed in the interests of the Crown.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of April 28 the _Herald_ left her anchorage in the\r\nouter harbour of the Bay of Islands, carrying with her Major Bunbury,[126]\r\ncommissioned to accept the signatures of the Southern chiefs; Mr.\r\nEdward Marsh Williams engaged to act as interpreter, and a small\r\ncompany of marines whose presence it was thought would add somewhat to\r\nthe impressiveness of the occasion. Captain Nias was authorised \"to\r\ndisplay the force of his ship along the coast,\" and Major Bunbury was\r\nfurnished with complete instructions for the governance of his conduct\r\nin all his negotiations with the native people, which needless to say,\r\nwere to be continued along the strictly honourable lines which had\r\nhitherto been observed by the Lieutenant-Governor. Pursuant to these\r\ninstructions the _Herald_ entered the Coromandel harbour next day\r\n(30th), and Major Bunbury, accompanied by Mr. Williams, landed at the\r\nhouse of Mr. Webster, an American whose claims to land in New Zealand\r\nhave since been the subject of searching enquiry by his own country.\r\nThe purpose of this visit was to arrange a time and place at which the\r\nchiefs might be invited to a _korero_. Monday May 4, and Mr. Webster's\r\nestablishment were selected to fill these essentials, and messengers\r\nwere accordingly despatched to the various surrounding _pas_ to bid\r\nthe chiefs to the conference. Hearing that the Scottish exile, Captain\r\nStewart, the discoverer of the southern Island which bears his name,\r\nwas at Mercury Bay, a special messenger was hurried off to him\r\nrequesting that he would pilot the _Herald_ in these waters, and\r\nlikewise use his influence with the chiefs of Mercury Bay in the\r\ndirection of securing their presence at the meeting, to both of which\r\nthe sealer Captain gave a ready response.\r\n\r\n\"On the day appointed,\" so writes the Major, \"Captain Nias, with\r\nseveral officers of the ship, together with Mr. Williams and myself,\r\nwent on shore at 11 o'clock, but no native chiefs had at that hour\r\nassembled. A considerable number of Europeans appeared, however, to\r\nhave been attracted by the report of the expected meeting.\r\nSubsequently a number of natives did assemble with six chiefs of\r\ndifferent tribes. Mr. Williams explained the treaty; its object in\r\nconsequence of the increasing influx of strangers; and that the claim\r\nfor pre-emption on the part of the Crown was intended to check their\r\nimprudently selling their lands without sufficiently benefiting\r\nthemselves or obtaining a fair equivalent. After a variety of\r\nobjections on the part of the chiefs we succeeded in obtaining the\r\nsignatures of four, one of these being the principal chief of the\r\ndistrict the celebrated Horeta,[127] of Bannin's Island notoriety. The\r\nprincipal orator, an old chief named Piko, and another of inferior\r\nnote, refused to sign, alleging as a reason that they wanted more time\r\nto assemble the different tribes of the Thames district, and to\r\nconsult with them, when they would also sign; but that he could, for\r\nhimself, see no necessity for placing himself under the dominion of\r\nany prince or queen, as he was desirous of governing his own tribe.\"\r\n\r\nThis policy of procrastination was obviously induced by the\r\nintelligence which had reached them of the arrest at the Bay of\r\nIslands of a native, Kiti, for the murder of Mr. Williams's shepherd,\r\nPatrick Macdonald, and of his trial and subsequent condemnation. They\r\ndid not complain of the injustice of the punishment, but the whole\r\nproceeding was so novel in its character, and so dubious in its\r\nultimate result that they felt prudence warranted a deeper reflection\r\nthan the subject had yet received. They therefore hesitated before\r\ncommitting themselves to a policy, the end whereof they could not see.\r\n\r\nThere was also a passing difficulty with those chiefs who signed the\r\ntreaty, for these gentlemen elected to entertain so exalted an idea of\r\nthe Queen's munificence that they deemed the homely blanket offered to\r\nthem as being altogether unworthy of so great a Sovereign's\r\ngenerosity, and expressed a decided preference for forage caps and\r\nscarlet cloaks. There was greater unanimity displayed over the feast\r\nof pork and potatoes which Major Bunbury had thoughtfully provided for\r\ntheir entertainment before he left.\r\n\r\nAfter completing arrangements for securing the signatures of a few\r\neligible chiefs who were living near the Mission station of the Rev.\r\nMr. Preece, Major Bunbury, late in the evening of Friday the 8th, took\r\nhis departure from Coromandel in the schooner _Trent_, chartered\r\nfrom Captain Bateman, and coasted round to Tauranga, a district where,\r\nin consequence of a war with the Rotorua people, the claims of the\r\nCrown had not been enthusiastically received. On Sunday, at nightfall,\r\nthe vessel arrived at the entrance of the harbour, but prudent\r\nseamanship dictated the wisdom of remaining in the offing till the\r\nmorning, when the treaty party landed at the Mission station and were\r\nwelcomed by Mr. Stack.\r\n\r\n\"I was agreeably surprised,\" wrote Major Bunbury to Captain Hobson,\r\n\"to learn that most of the native chiefs in this neighbourhood had\r\nalready signed the treaty, the exception being the principal chief,\r\nand one or two of his friends at the Omimoetoi (Otumoetai) _pa_. This\r\n_pa_ we visited the same evening, accompanied by Mr. Stack. It was a\r\nvery extensive fortification, and appears to contain about one\r\nthousand men. The chief who had declined signing is a very young man,\r\nand his manner was timidly reserved and less prepossessing than most\r\nof those I had before seen. On our taking leave he made the usual\r\nremark, that he wanted to consult the other chiefs, and that he would\r\nmeet us with them at the Mission station on the morrow. On the\r\nfollowing day he did not speak until the close of the conference, and\r\nthen only in private to Mr. Williams--after Mr. Stack and I had left\r\nthem--to enquire how much he was to get for his signature.[128]\r\nAnother chief expressed some indignation because the Christian chiefs\r\nhad not--as he said--met them. I presume he meant those from the other\r\n_pa_ where Mr. Stack's influence was supposed to extend more than to\r\nhis own, and where a Roman Catholic European residentiary and the\r\nCatholic Bishop are supposed to have more influence.\"\r\n\r\nA third chief, evidently of an enquiring mind, created some amusement\r\nby his quaint method of arriving at a complete analysis of the\r\nposition. The debate had to all appearances closed--his own speech\r\nbeing no small contribution to the oratory of the day--and he was\r\napproached with a view to securing his signature, he firmly deprecated\r\neverything in the nature of hurry, and calmly _taihoa-ed_[129]\r\nthe whole proceeding.\r\n\r\n\"Now first let us talk a little,\" he said. \"Who was the first stranger\r\nwho visited our shores?\"\r\n\r\nOn being told it was Captain Cook, he continued, \"And who was Cook's\r\nking, was he not Georgi?\"\r\n\r\nTo this a reply was returned in the affirmative. \"And who then,\" he\r\nasked, \"is this Queen?\"\r\n\r\nMajor Bunbury took some trouble to explain to him that the King George\r\nto whom he referred had been dead for some years, as also his two sons\r\nGeorge IV. and William IV., who had succeeded him on the throne, and\r\nthat the present Queen now reigned because she was the next in line to\r\nthese dead monarchs.\r\n\r\nThis modest little dissertation on the Royal genealogy appeared to\r\nsatisfy him on that point, for he immediately adverted to the native\r\nwars, and more particularly to their own hostilities with the Rotorua\r\ntribes. Major Bunbury assured him that one of the principal objects of\r\nhis mission was to persuade all the tribes at present at war to accept\r\nthe mediation of the Governor, and to induce them to abide by his\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n\"If then your nation is so fond of peace, why have you introduced into\r\nthis country firearms and gunpowder?\" was his pertinent rejoinder.\r\n\r\nTo this Major Bunbury replied that the effects of this traffic had\r\nbeen much deplored by Her Majesty's Government, who were most anxious\r\nto mitigate its consequences by substituting justice and a regular\r\nform of government in their country for the anarchy which had\r\nprevailed, but this could only be done by the surrender of the\r\nsovereign rights to the Queen as asked for in the treaty.\r\n\r\nHis next enquiry was whether the Queen governed all the white nations?\r\n\r\n\"Not all,\" replied Major Bunbury, \"but she is the Queen of the most\r\npowerful white nation.\" The Major then went on to explain that Britain\r\nhad acknowledged the Maoris as an independent nation, but that\r\narrangement had proved abortive in consequence of the native wars and\r\ntheir want of cohesion. To themselves alone therefore were to be\r\nattributed the evils from which they suffered. As a corrective for\r\nthese political troubles the Government had not leagued themselves\r\nwith other white nations to force an unwelcome authority upon them,\r\nbut they had come direct to the Maoris themselves, and asked them as\r\na spontaneous gift to vest in Britain the power to avert the evils\r\nwhich were assuredly accumulating round them; evils due to the\r\nincreasing influx of the _Pakeha_, and who must otherwise remain\r\nsubject to no law and amenable to no control.\r\n\r\n\"On being told,\" continues Major Bunbury's report, \"that I was a chief\r\nof a body of soldiers, and that I had served under the monarchs\r\nalready named, he enquired should his tribe, agreeable to my request,\r\nabstain from making war upon the natives at Rotorua, would the\r\nGovernor send a portion of my force to protect them? I told them Your\r\nExcellency desired rather to mediate between them, and only in cases\r\nof extreme emergency would you be prevailed upon to act in any other\r\nmanner. If, however, your arbitration was applied for I had no doubt\r\nthe custom of their country would be complied with, by your insisting\r\non a compensation being made to the party injured, by the party\r\noffending.\"\r\n\r\nMajor Bunbury then dwelt upon the sale of native lands, and the right\r\nof pre-emption claimed for the Queen, explaining that this restriction\r\nwas intended equally for their benefit, and to encourage industrious\r\nwhite men to settle amongst them to teach them arts, and how to\r\nmanufacture those articles which were so much sought after and admired\r\nby them. This course, he pointed out, was preferable to leaving the\r\nsale of large tracts of country to themselves, when they would almost\r\nsurely pass into the hands of men who would never come amongst them,\r\nbut would by their speculations hamper the industrious. The Government\r\nbeing aware of the intentions of these men--many of whom had no doubt\r\ncounselled them against signing the treaty--would nevertheless\r\nunceasingly exert themselves to mitigate the evils following in the\r\ntrain of the speculators, by purchasing the land directly from the\r\nnatives at a more just valuation.\r\n\r\nTo this the Nestor of the tribe replied that there was but cold\r\ncomfort in that for them, as their lands had already gone to the white\r\nmen, but the land had been fairly sold and fairly bought.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAJOR BUNBURY, K.T.S.]\r\n\r\nFeeling that he had now said all that he could say of a nature likely\r\nto influence the chiefs, and knowing the constitutional abhorrence on\r\nthe part of the Maori to hurry in such matters, Major Bunbury\r\nintimated that he had still another _pa_ to visit, and departed,\r\nleaving Mr. Williams to answer any new points which might be evolved\r\nin the fertile brain of the men who spoke for the tribe. Their further\r\ndeliberations, however, took a pecuniary rather than a legal turn.\r\nPresents were demanded, and when Mr. Williams indicated that Major\r\nBunbury would doubtless arrange that Mr. Stack should distribute his\r\ngifts to those entitled to receive them the sceptical diplomat, who\r\nbelieved in having his bird in the hand, was candid enough to remark\r\nthat he was not enamoured of prospects so remote.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the district Major Bunbury visited the chiefs of the\r\nMaungatapu _pa_, a stronghold of great strength, peopled by a\r\ntribe of considerable importance. These men being well disposed\r\ntowards the Government had, with two exceptions, previously signed the\r\ntreaty, and their reception of the Governor's representative was most\r\ncordial. The hospitality of his table was offered by Nuka, the\r\nprincipal chief, whose engaging manners and admirable bearing so\r\nimpressed the visitor that he estimated his good-will as worth\r\nsecuring at the cost of \"some mark of distinction\" if ever it came\r\nwithin the policy of the Government to so honour the more discerning\r\nof the chiefs.\r\n\r\n\"I have deemed it expedient to enter more fully into the detail of\r\nthis conference,\" wrote the Major to the Lieutenant-Governor in rebuke\r\nof the disloyal speculators, \"as one which not only shows fully the\r\ngeneral character of the natives, but also the nature of the obstacles\r\nI may hereafter expect to meet when principles alien to the Government\r\nhave been instilled by interested Europeans into their minds, as\r\nexemplified also at Coromandel Harbour. Neither will I disguise from\r\nYour Excellency my regrets that men professing Christianity should, in\r\na country emerging from barbarity, whose inhabitants are scarcely able\r\nto comprehend the simplest doctrines of the Christian religion,\r\nendeavour to create distrust of its Ministers--of whatever\r\npersuasion--Christianity in any shape, with these people being better\r\nthan the deplorable condition of many of them at present. It is not\r\nthe specious professions of a religion which asserts itself\r\nunconnected with civil Government which should blind us to the\r\npolitical disunion it creates, but rather its sincerity should be\r\ntested by its acts and their effects whether it seeks to open a new\r\nfield of labour before uncultivated, or to paralyse the efforts of\r\nthose who have laboured to improve the soil by establishing themselves\r\nupon it. The latter I conceive is incompatible with such professions,\r\nwhile this country contains so vast a field untried, but still it is\r\nto be hoped reclaimable.\"\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the Tauranga conference Major Bunbury resumed his\r\njourney towards the south, the Missionaries being commissioned by him\r\nto continue their negotiations for signatures as opportunity offered.\r\nWith the Arawa people at Rotorua, they had but poor success, for the\r\nreason that the members of that tribe were not altogether free to\r\nexercise their own will. Worsted in recent wars by Hongi and other\r\nvictorious chiefs, the Arawas had in self-defence sought an alliance\r\nwith the great Te Heuheu, of Taupo, whose protecting _mana_ was\r\nat this time thrown over them, and fearful lest they might forfeit his\r\ngood-will should they adopt a course to which they had every reason to\r\nbelieve their ally was hostile, they refused to subscribe to the\r\ntreaty until the voice of Te Heuheu had been heard. This leads us to a\r\npoint where it will be convenient to consider the attitude adopted\r\ntowards the treaty by this remarkable man.\r\n\r\nTe Heuheu Tukino was the second chief of that name, and was a leader\r\nendowed with exceptional power, being large of body and of brain. His\r\nhome was on the shores of Lake Taupo, and by claiming certain\r\ngeographical features as portions of his own body, he had thereby\r\nrendered his domain sacred, and so limited the right to dispose of it\r\nto himself. He was not amongst the chiefs present at Waitangi, for\r\nunder the limited notice given by Captain Hobson, that was not\r\npossible. It is even within the bounds of probability that had the\r\nmessengers of the Lieutenant-Governor reached him he would have\r\ndismissed them as they came, for of this he was firmly convinced--that\r\nhe was \"a law unto himself,\" asserting his own _rangatiratanga_ as\r\nsufficiently strong to rule his own people, for which he neither\r\nneeded nor desired foreign assistance. His first introduction to the\r\ntreaty came to him through his younger brother Iwikau, who, together\r\nwith another chief of Taupo, Te Korohiko, were at the then small\r\nsettlement which has now grown into the city of Auckland, when they\r\nwere met by Captain Hobson's messengers, and invited to Waitangi.\r\nIwikau and his companion was in charge of a company of Taupo natives\r\nwho had gone to the shores of Waitemata harbour for the purpose of\r\nacquiring European goods. They had packed bundles of flax fibre on the\r\nbacks of their slaves, who had carried this medium of trade over\r\ntrackless miles to the coast in order that it might be exchanged for\r\nguns and powder. While trafficking with the _Pakehas_ news came of the\r\nprojected meeting at Waitangi, and some of the Nga-Puhi chiefs--so we\r\nare told--thus addressed Iwikau: \"Go you to Waitangi, for you are the\r\nfish of the stomach of the island.[130] The _mana_ of Queen Victoria\r\nis about to be drawn as a cover over the island. All we chiefs of the\r\nnative people will pass under her and her _mana_, that we may not be\r\nassailed by the other great nations of the world.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Iwikau answered: \"I will not be able to attend that meeting if\r\nsuch is its object, namely consenting to the _mana_ of Queen\r\nVictoria being placed over us. The right man to consent to or reject\r\nsuch a course is my elder brother, Te Heuheu, at Taupo; and any action\r\non my part might be condemned by him.\"\r\n\r\nThis objection was combated by the messengers from Nga-Puhi, who\r\nreplied: \"By all means go, that you may acquire red blankets to take\r\nback to your elder brother at Taupo.\"\r\n\r\nIwikau was still obdurate, feeling that he had no authority to\r\ncompromise his tribe in the absence of his superior chief, but the\r\nvision of the red blankets was more than Te Korohiko could resist, and\r\nhe joined to those of the Nga-Puhi chiefs his own solicitations: \"Oh,\r\nlet us go that we may acquire the red blankets.\"\r\n\r\nThis appeal finally broke down the resistance of Iwikau. They attended\r\nthe conference at Waitangi, and amongst others of influential rank\r\nwere invited to sign the treaty. Before signing, Iwikau remarked to\r\nCaptain Hobson, \"I have heard the payment for the chiefs' consent to\r\nthe Queen's rule consists of blankets.\" To which the Queen's officer,\r\nalways anxious that his presents should not be misunderstood, replied,\r\n\"No, not exactly. The blankets are not payment, but a friendly gift to\r\nyou folks who have come from afar, and as a means of keeping you warm\r\non your home journey.\"\r\n\r\nThe point of distinction was evidently neither so wide nor so fine as\r\nto cause Iwikau any alarm, and he signed the document with a portion\r\nof his _moko_, his clan being Ngati-Turumakina. Te Korohiko also\r\nsigned, and when the gathering had broken up they returned to Taupo to\r\nreport their proceedings. They met Te Heuheu at Rangiahua, his\r\n_pa_ at Te Rapa, where he stood in the midst of the assembled\r\npeople, a giant amongst men. When the self-constituted ambassadors had\r\nconcluded their explanations, and produced their blankets the storm\r\nwhich Iwikau had secretly feared burst upon them.\r\n\r\n\"What amazing conduct is this of yours? Were you two, indeed, sent to\r\nperform such acts? O say! O say! is it for you to place the _mana_\r\nof Te Heuheu beneath the feet of a woman. I will not agree to the\r\n_mana_ of a strange people being placed over this land. Though\r\nevery chief in the island consent to it, yet I will not. I will\r\nconsent to neither your acts nor your goods. As for these blankets,\r\nburn them.\"\r\n\r\nThus did Te Heuheu assert his prerogative, and scorn the interference\r\nof the stranger, but he was soon soothed into a more reasonable frame\r\nof mind, by Iwikau, who urged his angry brother to await future\r\ndevelopments when he would himself see the treaty. \"Be not so severe\r\nand you can state your thoughts to the Queen's official yourself, for\r\nhe is travelling the islands of Ao-tea-roa and Wai-pounamu, seeking\r\nyou, the surviving chieftains, that you may agree to that\r\nmarking.\"[131]\r\n\r\nTe Heuheu consented to wait, and the blankets were for the moment\r\npreserved. At length news arrived that Parore, a Nga-Puhi chief, and\r\nthe Queen's official were on their way to Rotorua to bear the treaty\r\nto the Arawa chiefs. Then Te Heuheu thus instructed his people: \"When\r\nthe officer reaches the Arawa at Rotorua I shall attend. Let the tribe\r\naccompany me, armed, as trouble may arise over my declining to accept\r\nthe Queen's rule.\"\r\n\r\nThere was much burnishing of rusty arms and snapping of fire-locks at\r\nTaupo for the next few days, in anticipation of possible contingencies,\r\nfor these inland tribes had not yet fully realised the peaceful nature\r\nof Britain's mission. Living as they did in the centre of the Island,\r\nthey were less corrupted by the influence of the degenerate whites,\r\nand had neither seen nor felt the need for the interposition of a\r\ncorrecting hand in the same way that the imperative necessity for a\r\nchange had appealed to the residents of the coastal districts.\r\n\r\nNeither were the tribesmen of Te Heuheu being influenced by the same\r\nconsiderations that were driving Nga-Puhi to accept the gospel from\r\nthe Missionaries and the treaty from the Government. For many years\r\nthe northerners had enjoyed almost a monopoly in the business of\r\nprocuring guns, and this superiority in weapons had enabled them to\r\nlevy a bloody toll upon their southern neighbours. With the increase\r\nof traders and the enlarged enterprise of the tribes less favourably\r\nsituated, this advantage was rapidly receding. Others were securing\r\nguns as well as they, and the leaders of Nga-Puhi saw that the day was\r\nnot far distant when their victims would retaliate, and they would\r\nperhaps receive as good as they had given. They therefore welcomed the\r\ngospel as a shield, and the intervention of British authority as a\r\nbulwark that would stand between them and their enemies whenever they\r\nshould think fit to seek satisfaction for former injuries on something\r\nlike equal terms. Not so the Taupo tribes, who were less controlled by\r\nsuch motives. Their position of greater isolation gave them the\r\nconfidence begotten of a sense of greater security; they felt that\r\nthey breathed the refreshing atmosphere of a wider independence, and\r\nwere less subjected to the force of external considerations.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the ceding of authority by treaty was an innovation dangerous\r\nin its novelty to a people who had known no method of acquiring or\r\nforegoing rights so effectual as conquest, and, confident in their own\r\nstrength to maintain their position by the older method, they were\r\nless disposed to dabble in the subtleties of negotiation. With war and\r\nits consequences they were perfectly familiar. Diplomacy they did not\r\nunderstand so well; and when to the uncertainty of the procedure was\r\nadded the supposed indignity of being asked to treat with a Queen, the\r\nhaughty spirit of Te Heuheu rebelled against such a demeaning\r\nsuggestion. To submit himself to the superior authority of a chief of\r\nhis own aristocratic lineage would have been indignity enough, but to\r\ncome under the dominion of a woman was beyond the limits of toleration.\r\n\r\nIn due course a messenger reached the _pa_ with the intelligence\r\nthat the Missionaries at Rotorua had received a copy of the treaty,\r\nwhereupon Te Heuheu set off with five hundred picked men, prepared to\r\nresist to the uttermost should an attempt be made to compel his\r\nsubmission to the Queen. On reaching the Papai-o-Uru _pa_ at\r\nOhinemutu, the discussion began, after the ceremonial of welcoming the\r\nstrangers had been concluded. The copy of the treaty which the Arawas\r\nwere being invited to sign, had been entrusted to Messrs. Morgan and\r\nChapman, the Church Missionaries, and to them Te Amohau and Te Haupapa\r\naddressed themselves on behalf of their tribe: \"The Arawa people have\r\nnothing to say in regard to your object. The Arawa will await the\r\nword of Te Heuheu Tukino, and will abide by what he says to you.\"\r\n\r\nTe Heuheu arose with stately grace, and repeated an ancient chant,\r\nrevered amongst the sacred _karakia_ of the Maori, and known as\r\n_Hiremai_. He repeated it to the end, all ears being strained to\r\ndetect an error, the commitment of which would have boded evil, but he\r\nwent on faultless to the finish. Leaping to their feet his warriors\r\nthen indulged in mock passages-at-arms, and when this form of revelry\r\nhad ended the great chief delivered his judgment upon the treaty:\r\n\"_Hau wahine e hoki i te hau o Tawhaki_. I will never consent to\r\nthe _mana_ of a woman resting upon these islands. I myself will\r\nbe a chief of these isles; therefore, begone! Heed this, O ye Arawa.\r\nHere is your line of action, the line for the Arawa canoe. Do not\r\nconsent, or we will become slaves for this woman, Queen Victoria.\"\r\n\r\nTe Pukuatua then rose and gave the final answer for his tribe:\r\n\"Listen, O Parore, you and your _Pakeha_ companions. The Arawa\r\nhave nothing to add to the words of Te Heuheu. His words denying the\r\n_mana_ of the Queen are also our words. As he is not willing to\r\nwrite his name upon your treaty, neither will the chiefs of the Arawa\r\ncome forward to sign.\"\r\n\r\nThen turning to Te Heuheu he added: \"Hear me, O Heu. The Arawas have\r\nnothing to say, for you are the person of the Arawa canoe.\"\r\n\r\nThe blankets given to Iwikau, at Waitangi, were returned to the\r\nMissionaries by Te Heuheu, with the remark: \"I am not willing that\r\nyour blankets should be received as payment for my head and these\r\nIslands,\" and with this embargo put upon their operations, the agents\r\nof the Lieutenant-Governor were unable to secure a single Arawa\r\nsignature to the treaty.\r\n\r\nThe fiat of Te Heuheu went even far beyond the steaming waters of\r\nRotorua, for at Tauranga upon the coast there lived Tupaea, a chief of\r\nthe Ngai-te-Rangi, whom because of his influence the Missionaries were\r\nparticularly anxious to enlist as a subject of the Queen. He too hung\r\nupon the words of Te Heuheu, and when he was approached he made answer\r\nthus: \"What did Te Heuheu say to you at Rotorua?\"\r\n\r\nThe reply was: \"Te Heuheu did not consent.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what of the Arawa chiefs?\" asked Tupaea.\r\n\r\n\"They followed the word of Te Heuheu,\" replied the Missionaries.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Tupaea, \"I will not agree to the chiefs of Ngai-te-Rangi\r\nsigning the treaty of Waitangi,\" a decision from which neither he nor\r\nhis people could ever be induced to depart.[132]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the _Herald_ had left the Auckland waters, and\r\nmade her way to the south, arriving off Banks's Peninsula during the\r\nnight of the 24th. Calms and storms alternately intercepted her\r\nprogress, and it was not until the 28th that Major Bunbury was able to\r\ndisembark at Akaroa, accompanied by Mr. Edward Williams and Captain\r\nStewart, whose personal acquaintance with the Southern chiefs and\r\ntheir altered dialect[133] was destined to be of great service in\r\npromoting a common understanding.\r\n\r\nAt Akaroa they found a native _pa_ in which lived a remnant of\r\nthe Ngai-Tahu people, broken by the last raid of Te Rauparaha, a\r\nwhaling station, and a cattle run,[134] established by a Captain\r\nLethart, who had arrived from Sydney as recently as the previous\r\nNovember. The visitors were more favourably impressed with the\r\ncondition of Lethart's cattle than with the appearance of the\r\nnatives, who were so dejected by their misfortunes as to consider\r\nthemselves almost destitute of rights and without a name. The\r\nsignature of Iwikau, a brother of Tamiaharanui, the chief who was\r\nconveyed captive by Te Rauparaha in the blood-stained _Elizabeth_, was\r\nobtained, as well as that of John Love, another native less highly\r\nborn, but more richly endowed with intelligence. These two signatures\r\nMajor Bunbury conceived to be of considerable consequence to his\r\npurpose, although from the diminished number of the tribe the men\r\nthemselves scarcely laid claim to the rank of chief.\r\n\r\nSouthward the frigate again sailed, and on June 4 cast anchor in\r\nZephyr Bay, a beautiful inlet at Southern Port, Stewart's Island.\r\nAccompanied by Captain Stewart, who was now in latitudes peculiarly\r\nhis own, Major Bunbury landed next morning, and set out to visit a\r\nstation in the harbour, distant four or five miles, where for some\r\ntime Stewart had employed a number of boat-builders, and who, it was\r\nhoped, might still be there. Vestiges of their former residence were\r\nfound but that was all. Their camp was deserted, their industry\r\nabandoned, and no sound broke the stillness of the primeval forest\r\nsave the flick of a bird's wing, or the screech of the brightly\r\nplumaged parrakeet.\r\n\r\nSeveral excursions were made to other parts of the island, but no\r\nnatives were met with, either upon the shores of the sheltered coves,\r\nor within the generous shade of the bush, and Major Bunbury returned\r\nto the ship for the first time without having added a signature as a\r\ntrophy in the cause of the Queen's sovereignty.\r\n\r\nAided by his own experience, and fortified by the local knowledge of\r\nCaptain Stewart, Major Bunbury concluded that the prospect of meeting\r\nwith any chief in the apparently deserted island was so slight as not\r\nto warrant the delay involved in the search. He therefore consulted\r\nwith Captain Nias, and together they agreed that it would be advisable\r\nto proclaim without protraction the Queen's authority over a territory\r\nthat had impressed them both as being singularly beautiful.[135] For\r\nthis purpose, during the afternoon of the day after arrival, the\r\nmarines were landed with a party of officers from the ship which had\r\nnow been moved into Sylvan Bay. Here upon the apex of a small island\r\nwhich becomes a peninsula at low water, the ceremonial forms usual to\r\nsuch occasions were duly observed. The Union Jack was hoisted by\r\nCaptain Nias and saluted by the marines. A salute was also fired from\r\nthe guns of the _Herald_, and after the following declaration had been\r\nread by Major Bunbury to the assembled sailors, Stewart's Island\r\nbecame an outpost of the Empire.\r\n\r\n DECLARATION OF SOVEREIGNTY OF THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND\r\n OVER STEWART'S ISLAND\r\n\r\n The Island called Stewart's Island, New Zealand, situated between the\r\n meridian 167° and 168° east of Greenwich, and 46° and 48° south\r\n parallel, with all the Bays, Rivers, Harbours, Creeks, etc., in and\r\n on the islands lying off, were taken possession of in the name and in\r\n the right (by the discovery of the late lamented Captain Cook) for\r\n Her Most Excellent Majesty Victoria, Queen of the United Kingdom and\r\n Ireland, and Her Majesty's colours were accordingly hoisted at Sylvan\r\n Bay, Southern Port, on the 5th day of June 1840, by Captain Joseph\r\n Nias, commanding Her Majesty's ship _Herald_, with a detachment\r\n of Royal Marines, and by Major Thomas Bunbury, K.T.S., 80th Regiment,\r\n who were commissioned for that purpose.\r\n\r\n Done in the presence of us:\r\n\r\n Peter Fisher, Lieutenant, H.M.S. _Herald_; C. Hewitt,\r\n Lieutenant, Royal Marines, H.M.S. _Herald_; James Giles, Purser,\r\n H.M.S. _Herald_; J. H. Shairp, Mate, H.M.S. _Herald_;\r\n William Kelly, Gunner, H.M.S. _Herald_; John Caseley, Boatswain,\r\n H.M.S. _Herald_; Fred. S. Grey, Volunteer, H.M.S. _Herald_.\r\n\r\n _Witnesses._--Joseph Nias, Captain; Thomas Bunbury, Major 80th\r\n Regiment (charged with a diplomatic Mission).\r\n\r\nOn the island eminence, where the sovereignty of the Queen had been\r\ndeclared, the original of this document was buried, enclosed in a\r\nbottle--a silent witness to be produced in the contingency of\r\ninternational complications, which were then believed to be by no\r\nmeans remote.\r\n\r\nFor three days the _Herald_ lay weather-bound, but on Tuesday the\r\n9th the wind shifted to a more favourable quarter, enabling her to\r\nleave her anchorage in Sylvan Bay and move over to Ruapuke Island, the\r\nhome of the greatest of all the Ngati-Tahu chiefs, Tu Hawaiki, more\r\nwidely known as \"Bloody Jack.\"[136] On nearing the land a boat manned\r\nby some natives and Europeans came off, and a Mr. Hesketh boarded the\r\n_Herald_ and explained that they had been expecting her arrival\r\nfor some time. He represented himself as the resident agent of Jones &\r\nCo., of Sydney, and being on intimate business relations with Tu\r\nHawaiki volunteered to go ashore and bring him off that evening,\r\nleaving an English seaman, formerly in the employ of Captain Stewart,\r\nto pilot the frigate to an anchorage. Here she lay in proximity to a\r\nFrench and a Portuguese whaler, neither of which had enjoyed a\r\nsuccessful season:\r\n\r\n The native village, being at some distance from an anchorage ground\r\n Mr. Hesketh did not return until late in the evening. The chief\r\n Tooiaki (Tu Hawaiki) came on board in the full dress staff\r\n uniform[137] of a British aide-de-camp, with gold lace trousers,\r\n cocked hat and plume, in which he looked extremely well, and his\r\n behaviour at Captain Nias's table, when he took tea, showed that the\r\n examples he had seen had not been lost upon him. He was also\r\n accompanied by a native orderly-sergeant dressed in a corresponding\r\n costume. The chief spoke a little English, and appeared to be aware\r\n of the nature of the treaty, but which I thought it necessary to have\r\n read and explained to him in the presence of Mr. Hesketh, and he\r\n signed it without hesitation.[138]\r\n\r\n He said he had at his village twenty men dressed and in training as\r\n British soldiers, and was very anxious that Captain Nias should\r\n permit them to come on board the following morning and see the\r\n marines go through the manual and platoon exercise, which he (the\r\n Captain) kindly acceded to. The chief then gave me a paper written in\r\n English which he wished me to sign and affirm. It was a declaration\r\n that the Island of Ruapuke was his property and that of his tribe, to\r\n different individuals to whom he had allotted portions of it. Not\r\n wishing that he should conceive that any deception was intended on\r\n our part I wrote on the back of the document, \"I have seen this paper\r\n but am not prepared to give an opinion, or any information on the\r\n purport of it. The treaty guarantees the full and exclusive\r\n possession of their lands and other properties to the natives.\" No\r\n mention having been made in this document to the title to the Middle\r\n Island, although this chief styles himself the principal, I am\r\n inclined to suppose it is claimed by some Europeans, I believe by a\r\n Mr. Weller, of Sydney. On the chief taking leave, I told him I would\r\n return his visit on the morrow, which I accordingly did, accompanied\r\n by Lieutenant Hewitt, Royal Marines, and Captain Stewart, to whom the\r\n chief was known, Mr. Williams, and an officer from the ship in charge\r\n of the boats.\r\n\r\n After being carried through the surf by some natives, we were\r\n received by the chief in the same scarlet uniform he had worn the day\r\n before, and by the sergeant who then accompanied him, at the head of\r\n six soldiers dressed in British uniforms, without hats or shoes. The\r\n chief took us to his cottage, a weatherboard hut, and offered us rum,\r\n of which he appeared to have a good supply, but Mr. Hesketh, to their\r\n credit, states that although they are not absolutely temperance men,\r\n they seldom get drunk. I was afterwards introduced to his son, a fine\r\n boy of about seven years of age, of whom he appears justly proud. The\r\n child was dressed in a very becoming manner, and has six toes on each\r\n of his feet, which his father seemed to exhibit with much\r\n satisfaction. Rauparaha, who is a great warrior, and the mortal enemy\r\n of this tribe, is similarly gifted with this unusual addition to his\r\n feet. I also received from him a memorandum respecting the register\r\n of a small craft between 25 and 30 tons, building at Mauraki (Moeraki),\r\n which paper I beg herewith to forward.\r\n\r\n I was very sorry to learn from the chief that a British subject,\r\n named M'Gregor, who had been residing some years in this\r\n neighbourhood, had suddenly disappeared with a small craft, taking\r\n with him some of this chief's women and _kookis_ (slaves). The\r\n vessel is without a name or register, and Captain Nias is in hopes we\r\n may be able to meet with her. M'Gregor is reported to be a convict\r\n escaped from Van Dieman's Land, and his conduct made the English\r\n residing here for some time apprehensive that the chief might\r\n retaliate on them and insist on a compensation. An Englishman, a\r\n carpenter residing at Otakou (Otago) I hear has been shot by a native\r\n when in a state of intoxication, but whether in connection with the\r\n above affair or otherwise, I could not satisfactorily ascertain.\r\n\r\n Knowing that Captain Nias was anxious to proceed on his voyage, we\r\n were obliged to shorten our visit. The chief and his son came off\r\n with us, and the sergeant and six of his soldiers, with two other\r\n chiefs, came off in two whale boats, a third following with natives\r\n bringing potatoes, etc., to the ship. The soldiers of the chief and\r\n natives having arranged themselves on deck, the Marines went through\r\n the manual and platoon exercise, as had been promised, and\r\n afterwards, at my request, Captain Nias permitted a few sailors to go\r\n through the sword exercise, which, as I had anticipated, pleased and\r\n interested them very much, particularly the \"attack\" and \"defence,\"\r\n the chief frequently calling to his followers to pay attention and\r\n see how it was performed.\r\n\r\n Whilst the ship was getting under way they took their departure, two\r\n other chiefs[139] having also been permitted to sign at the request\r\n of Tooiaki (Tu Hawaiki). This influential chief is one of the\r\n individuals, who (similarly with Rauparaha in Cook Strait) have had\r\n sufficient address to gain the ascendency over the chiefs of the\r\n neighbouring tribes, without any claim from circumstance of birth.\r\n\r\nSuch is Major Bunbury's own account of his historic meeting with this\r\nsingular native, whom he left upon his lonely island in the midst of a\r\nwindy strait struggling between his native barbarism and an\r\ninarticulate craving for civilisation. On the 13th the _Herald_\r\nreached the Otago Heads, but so late in the evening that there was\r\nonly time to obtain the signatures of two chiefs who resided near the\r\nentrance of the harbour.[140] Taiaroa was absent at Moeraki, and his\r\nson was so far inaccessible that the limits of daylight would not\r\npermit of his being reached. The boat, therefore, returned to the\r\nship, and on June 16 she dropped anchor in Cloudy Bay, then the most\r\nimportant centre of European activity in the South Island.\r\n\r\nSeven whalers were lying at anchor when the _Herald_ arrived, and\r\nthe strange admixture of humanity--the venturesome, quarrelsome,\r\nquasi-criminal collection--which went to make up a whaling community\r\nwas forcibly impressed upon Major Bunbury when he landed at Guard's\r\nCove in the evening. The only chief of importance whom he met was old\r\nNohorua, the elder brother of Te Rauparaha, who had with him three\r\nyounger men, his nephews. Their reception of the Major was cordial\r\nenough, but when the subject of the treaty was broached to them they\r\nresolutely declined to attach their signatures to it, or to\r\ncountenance it in any way. This attitude was adopted under the\r\ndistinct impression that if they signed the document their lands would\r\nbe taken from them, and considering that their only experience of\r\ndeeds had been with the Sydney land sharks[141] the reservation was,\r\nto put it mildly, a natural one.\r\n\r\nNot having been successful in securing the immediate concurrence of\r\nNohorua, Major Bunbury left him in the hope that he would fulfil his\r\nreluctant promise to visit the ship on the following day, by which\r\ntime he would have had the opportunity--dear to every Maori--of\r\nholding a _korero_ upon the novel suggestion. Early next morning\r\nthe Major, Mr. Williams, and Captain Stewart set off for one of the\r\nneighbouring coves, and here they met with greater success, the chiefs\r\nsigning without any hesitation when the principles of the treaty had\r\nbeen explained to them. Amongst the various natives whom they\r\nencountered was a young chief whom Major Bunbury has called Maui Pu,\r\nwho, having visited Hobart Town in the warship _Conway_, had\r\nsufficient command of English to converse freely with the Europeans.\r\nHis sympathies were at once enlisted in support of the treaty, and\r\nwhen the difficulties met with at Guard's Cove were mentioned he\r\nexpressed no surprise, as the natives had no conception of a deed that\r\ndid not mean the sacrifice of their land. He, however, offered to go\r\nwith them and assist at the second interview with Nohorua, and so\r\nadroitly did he explain the purport of the second Article that the old\r\nchief's objections were at length so far overcome that he agreed to\r\nsign provided his signature was witnessed by his European son-in-law,\r\nJoseph Toms,[142] a whaler who had interests both here and at Porirua.\r\n\r\nThough there is no definite information on the point, it is probable\r\nthat Toms had added his persuasion to those of Maui Pu, as Nohorua's\r\nreason for insisting upon the above stipulation discloses the justice\r\nof his mind and his desire to fix the responsibility beyond any chance\r\nof evasion: \"If my grandchildren lose their land, their father must\r\nshare the blame.\" The three younger men having no son-in-law on whom\r\nto shift the responsibility still postponed the important step until\r\nthey were aboard the ship.\r\n\r\nOn returning to the _Herald_ there was a considerable gathering\r\nof chiefs awaiting the treaty party, and with the exception of\r\nNohorua's nephews all expressed their willingness to subscribe to the\r\nterms of the compact. Not so these young gentlemen, who still held\r\naloof. For their reservation, however, the wife of one of them was\r\nanxious to compensate, by demanding the privilege of signing the\r\ntreaty. She claimed to be the daughter of the great Te Pehi, who was\r\ncaught in his own trap at Kaiapoi in 1829, and when Major Bunbury\r\npolitely but firmly declined to permit her the honour, she gave way to\r\na fit of anger, and in a torrent of invective expressed her opinions\r\nconcerning the _Pakeha_ in general, and Major Bunbury in\r\nparticular, with a freedom that would have been painful had all her\r\nobservations been clearly understood.\r\n\r\nAs an evidence of the persistency with which these people had been\r\nharassed about their lands, and the jealousy with which they sought to\r\npreserve this class of property, it was noted that they all firmly\r\ndeclined to receive the presents[143] which it had now become customary\r\nto offer, lest by some quibble it might be construed into a payment\r\nfor its surrender, and in this attitude they persisted until they had\r\nbeen repeatedly assured to the contrary.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Henry Williams having visited Queen Charlotte Sound during\r\nthe course of his Southern Mission and secured the signatures of the\r\nchiefs there, Cloudy Bay thus became the last port in the Middle\r\nIsland at which the _Herald_ could profitably call. Under these\r\ncircumstances Major Bunbury consulted with Captain Nias, and they were\r\nagreed that it would be advisable to at once proclaim the Queen's\r\nauthority over the Island as the most effectual means of preventing\r\nfurther dissensions amongst the natives and Europeans.\r\n\r\nThis resolution was not hurriedly arrived at, for although many\r\nimportant signatures had now been obtained the whole position was so\r\nhedged about with intricately interwoven interests that Major Bunbury\r\nfelt it was something akin to cutting the Gordian knot to take the\r\ncontemplated step without further consulting the Lieutenant-Governor.\r\nYet view the matter as he would, there appeared no simpler way, for\r\nthere was every reason to believe that delay would only breed new\r\ndifficulties, by suspending the establishment of political authority,\r\nand by affording other powers time to develop their embryonic claims.\r\nThe presence, too, of so many vessels at anchor in the harbour seemed\r\nto lend opportunity to the occasion, for with their co-operation it\r\nwas possible to render the declaration of Her Majesty's sovereignty\r\nmore solemn and imposing, and where it was desired to impress the\r\nnative mind Major Bunbury realised the advantage of pressing to his\r\nservice the assistance of this additional theatrical touch.\r\n\r\nThe decision come to by the Major and Captain Nias was conveyed to the\r\nnatives while they were still on board, and whether or not they were\r\nseized of all that the ceremony involved, they entered with\r\nconsiderable enthusiasm into the spirit of the occasion.\r\n\r\nIn order to invest the intended declaration with becoming dignity the\r\nmarines were landed on the little island on which was situated the\r\nHorahora-Kakahu _pa_. There a temporary flagstaff was erected and\r\nstanding at the foot of it at 2 P.M. Major Bunbury read to\r\nthe assembled people the following Declaration of Sovereignty.\r\n\r\n\r\n DECLARATION OF SOVEREIGNTY OVER TAVAI POENAMMOO (TE WAI-POUNAMU)\r\n\r\n This Island called Tavai Poenammoo (Te Wai-Pounamu), or Middle Island\r\n of New Zealand, situate between the meridian 166° and 174° 30' east\r\n of Greenwich, and 40° 30' and 46° 30' south parallel, with all the\r\n Bays, Rivers, Harbours, Creeks, etc., in and on the Islands lying\r\n off, having been ceded in Sovereignty by the several independent\r\n native chiefs to Her Most Gracious Majesty Victoria, Queen of the\r\n United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the said Island was\r\n accordingly taken possession of and formally proclaimed, and Her\r\n Majesty's colours hoisted at the _pa_ of Hoikaka\r\n (Horahora-Kakahu), Cloudy Bay, under a salute of 21 guns on the 17th\r\n day of June 1840, by Captain Joseph Nias, commanding Her Majesty's\r\n ship _Herald_, and by Major Thomas Bunbury, K.T.S., 80th\r\n Regiment, who were commissioned for that purpose.\r\n\r\n Done in the presence of us:--\r\n\r\n Peter Fisher, Lieutenant, H.M.S. _Herald_; P. L. D. Bean,\r\n Master, H.M.S. _Herald_; C. J. Parker, Acting Master, H.M.S.\r\n _Beagle_; J. H. Shairp, Mate, H.M.S. _Herald_; Thomas\r\n Frazer, Surgeon, H.M.S. _Herald_; James Giles, Purser, H.M.S.\r\n _Herald_; C. Hewitt, 1st Lieutenant Marines, H.M.S.\r\n _Herald_; F. H.

The yards of the frigate were manned, and the cheers\r\nof those grouped round the flagstaff were answered by those on board\r\nthe man-of-war, the echoes from the surrounding hills being reinforced\r\nby the approving shouts of the natives.\r\n\r\nThe all-important step having now been taken and received with local\r\napprobation, the _Herald_ weighed anchor and sailed for\r\nKapiti[144]. Two days later (June 19), she arrived under the shadow of\r\nTe Rauparaha's home. By a fortunate circumstance the great chief, whom\r\nMajor Bunbury had special instructions to see, was at that moment\r\nentering his canoe, preparatory to making an excursion to the Island\r\nof Mana. As the _Herald's_ boat was proceeding to the shore the\r\nQueen's Commissioner and the chief met mid way, the meeting being of\r\nthe most cordial nature. Te Rauparaha left his own canoe \"in lordly\r\ndecoration the lordliest far,\" and returned on board with Major\r\nBunbury in the ship's boat. Here the proceedings of the Rev. Henry\r\nWilliams were related by the chiefs--how he had explained the treaty,\r\nobtained Te Rauparaha's signature, and presented him with the\r\nmuch-prized blanket.\r\n\r\nOn enquiry being made by Major Bunbury for Te Rangihaeata and Te Hiko,\r\nhe was informed that both these warriors were at Mana. As this Island\r\nlay directly in the route to Port Nicholson, the _Herald_ was put\r\nabout and her course shaped towards the south. Under a fresh wind the\r\nvessel was soon abreast of Mana. The chief and Mr. Williams\r\naccompanied Major Bunbury on shore, where they found Te Rangihaeata\r\nbut Te Hiko was absent on an expedition to the mainland.\r\n\r\nNo record appears to have been preserved of the negotiations which\r\nfollowed between the representative of the Crown and the two leaders\r\nof the Ngati-Toa tribe. Major Bunbury contents himself with informing\r\nus that \"the chief Rangihaeata, after some time, returned with us on\r\nboard, accompanied by Rauparaha, when both signed the treaty.\"\r\n\r\nThe importance of their discussion is, however, somewhat diminished by\r\nthe fact that the elder chief had already signed the treaty under the\r\npersuasions of the Rev. Henry Williams, but their questions, which\r\nwere certain to have been shrewd and searching, would have been\r\ninteresting as revealing their mental attitude towards the proposed\r\ninnovation. There is a widespread impression, founded upon equally\r\nwidespread prejudice, that both men were thoroughly insincere[145]\r\nwhen they subscribed to the terms of the treaty, and this view is\r\nencouraged by the fact that at this time they stood less in need of\r\nBritish protection than any other chiefs of the native race. They were\r\nindeed masters of all the territory they claimed. Their immediate\r\nenemies had been defeated and crushed, their powerful foes were far\r\ndistant. There was a gun in the hand of their every warrior, and\r\nsolidarity in the ranks of their every _hapu_. So situated they\r\nhad less to gain by ceding their sovereign rights than others had.\r\nNeither is it to be supposed that the advantages of their position\r\nwere not apparent to themselves, for with their gifts of military\r\ncommand, they combined a state-craft that was of quite an exceptional\r\norder. If political considerations entered into the transaction at\r\nall, it is more than likely that a presentiment of impending trouble\r\nwith the New Zealand Company was the governing influence in securing\r\ntheir adherence to the policy of the Crown, and in the light of\r\nsubsequent events their fears were not unfounded--their foresight was\r\nalmost prophetic.\r\n\r\nWhile on shore at Mana, the protection of Major Bunbury was solicited\r\nby a section of the whaling population against the alleged\r\nencroachments of the Maori chiefs in general and Te Rangihaeata in\r\nparticular. Though clamorous for justice, they were unable to\r\nformulate any specific charges against the chief; and after such\r\ninvestigation as was possible under the circumstances, the Major came\r\nto the conclusion that the accusers were a set of \"drunken, lawless\r\nvagabonds,\" and that so far from their having any just grounds of\r\ncomplaint against Te Rangihaeata, the chief in all probability would\r\nhave more reason to feel aggrieved towards them.\r\n\r\nThe _Herald's_ course was now directed to Port Nicholson, and\r\narriving there next day (20th) she anchored inside the Heads, the wind\r\nand tide having failed her at a critical moment. Major Bunbury at once\r\nleft the ship and pulled towards the Thorndon beach, where much to his\r\nsurprise on landing, he met Mr. Shortland. The presence of Lieutenant\r\nShortland at Port Nicholson at this juncture requires some explanation.\r\nShortly after the departure of Major Bunbury from the Bay of Islands,\r\ncopies of the _New Zealand Gazette_, a paper published by the\r\ncolonists at Port Nicholson, reached the Lieutenant-Governor, and from\r\nthe columns of this journal, as well as from other well-authenticated\r\nsources, he learned that the settlers had set up a system of Local\r\nGovernment consisting of a Council, over which Colonel Wakefield\r\npresided, and a bench of Magistrates, who were attempting to levy\r\ntaxes, and to enforce punishments for breaches of laws enacted by\r\ntheir self-constituted authority.[146]\r\n\r\nTo this latter tribunal on April 14 came a Mr. Wade, pleading for\r\nprotection against the violence of Captain Pearson of the brig\r\n_Integrity_, his allegation being that this rude seaman had not\r\nonly assaulted him, but threatened to throw him overboard. The law,\r\nsuch as it was, was immediately set in motion, the Captain was\r\narrested and haled before Major Baker, who held the post of District\r\nMagistrate. To his other supposed offences, Pearson now added the more\r\nheinous one of refusing to recognise the jurisdiction of the Court. He\r\ndefied the complainant to proceed with his charge, and dared the\r\nMagistrate to convict him. For this exhibition of independence he was\r\nimmediately committed by the irate Magistrate, who could brook no such\r\ncontempt for his brief authority.\r\n\r\nOn hearing of the fate of their Captain, the crew of the\r\n_Integrity_ flew to arms and pulled to the rescue, but the\r\nsettlers were loyal to the law and repulsed them. In view of this\r\nbelligerent attitude on the part of his shipmates, it was deemed safer\r\nto incarcerate the recalcitrant Captain on board one of the other\r\nships lying in the harbour, whither he was conveyed, but it is said,\r\n\"owing to the culpable negligence of the constable in charge,\" he was\r\npermitted to escape.\r\n\r\nWhile the authorities were foolishly dreaming that their victim was\r\nsafely under lock and key, the _Integrity_ sailed for the Bay of\r\nIslands, where Captain Pearson reported, no doubt with advantages, to\r\nthe Lieutenant-Governor that the settlers at Port Nicholson were \"a\r\nturbulent set of rebels who were seeking to establish a republic.\"\r\n\r\nThe story of the indignant Captain took Governor Hobson completely by\r\nstorm, and after satisfying himself by reading the latest copies of\r\nthe _New Zealand Gazette_[147] that it had some foundation in\r\nfact he developed a state of anxiety not far removed from panic. It\r\ndid not take him long, however, to determine how he should act in the\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any legal authority to advise him he rather absurdly\r\ninterpreted the proceedings of the New Zealand Company as acts of high\r\ntreason, and within an hour had ordered the officer commanding the\r\ntroops to detach thirty men of the 80th Regiment for duty at Port\r\nNicholson. He also, two days later, dictated a Proclamation in which\r\nhe denounced the attempt to supersede the authority of the Queen, and\r\ncalled upon all loyal subjects to resume their allegiance to their\r\nlawful sovereign.\r\n\r\n\r\n PROCLAMATION\r\n\r\n WHEREAS certain persons residing at Port Nicholson, New\r\n Zealand, part of the Dominions of Her Majesty, Queen Victoria, have\r\n formed themselves into an illegal Association, under the title of a\r\n Council, and in contempt of Her Majesty's authority, have assumed and\r\n attempted to usurp the powers vested in me by Her Majesty's Letters\r\n Patent, for the Government of the said Colony, to the manifest injury\r\n and detriment of all Her Majesty's liege subjects in New Zealand.\r\n\r\n NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM HOBSON, Lieutenant-Governor of\r\n New Zealand, command all persons connected with such illegal\r\n Association immediately to withdraw therefrom, and I call upon all\r\n persons resident at Port Nicholson, or elsewhere, within the limits\r\n of this Government, upon the allegiance they owe to Her Majesty,\r\n Queen Victoria, to submit to the proper authorities in New Zealand,\r\n legally appointed, and to aid and assist them in the discharge of\r\n their respective duties.\r\n\r\n GIVEN under my hand at Government House, Russell, Bay of Islands,\r\n this 23rd day of May in the year of our Lord 1840.\r\n\r\n WILLIAM HOBSON,\r\n Lieutenant-Governor.\r\n\r\n By command of His Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor,\r\n\r\n WILLOUGHBY SHORTLAND,\r\n Colonial Secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe exigencies of the circumstances were such as seemed to warrant the\r\ntaking of even a more decisive step than the despatching of troops to\r\nWellington, and without waiting for a report from Major Bunbury as to\r\nthe success or failure of his mission, two other proclamations were\r\nhastily formulated and published, the one taking possession of the\r\nNorth Island by virtue of its cession by the native chiefs; the other\r\ndeclaring the South Island to be part of the Queen's Dominions by\r\nright of discovery.[148]\r\n\r\nIn order to give effect to the views which he had formed Captain\r\nHobson commissioned Lieutenant Shortland, in whose discretion he\r\nplaced implicit confidence, to proceed to Port Nicholson, there to\r\npersonally read the proclamations, and to take such steps as he might\r\ndeem necessary to secure the due recognition of the Crown at the\r\nSouthern settlement. Accompanied by the small detachment of troops,\r\nand a still smaller force of mounted police, under the command of\r\nLieutenants Smart and Best, the Colonial Secretary reached Port\r\nNicholson in the barque _Integrity_ on the evening of Tuesday,\r\nJune 2. A Mr. Cole[149] one of the civil staff, was immediately sent\r\non shore with copies of the proclamations, and a letter to Colonel\r\nWakefield, telling him it was Mr. Shortland's intention to land next\r\nday and read the proclamations, requesting at the same time that he\r\nwould make all the necessary arrangements.\r\n\r\nThese dispositions were interfered with by a heavy gale which sprang\r\nup during the night, making it impossible to carry out the intended\r\nceremony. In the meantime the Colonial Secretary was waited upon on\r\nboard the _Integrity_ by Dr. Evans, and Messrs. Chaffers and Tod,\r\nwho came for the purpose of expressing the gratification it gave the\r\nsettlers to learn of his arrival. They then proceeded to assure Mr.\r\nShortland that their actions and intentions had been greatly\r\nmisrepresented. Dr. Evans volunteering the information that their\r\nCouncil had been formed for no other purpose than to preserve the\r\npeace, and for mutual protection until either the Lieutenant-Governor\r\nor some duly accredited representative of the Crown should arrive in\r\ntheir midst.\r\n\r\nThese assurances Mr. Shortland indicated he was prepared to accept,\r\nconditionally upon their being followed by some practical evidence of\r\ntheir sincerity. He told them plainly that the Council must disappear,\r\nthat the flags flown as the insignia of its authority must come down,\r\nand that any proposal from any body of persons assuming any power or\r\nrights would be regarded by him as an act of hostility. To these\r\nconditions the deputation agreed and withdrew, after again protesting\r\nthe loyalty of the colonists.\r\n\r\nThe storm having abated, Lieutenant Shortland landed on the beach at\r\nThorndon at 2 o'clock on the afternoon of Thursday June 4, accompanied\r\nby Lieutenants Smart and Best and the four members of the police\r\nforce. They were received on the beach by Colonel Wakefield, Dr.\r\nEvans, Captain Smith, R.A., and all the principal settlers, who\r\nconducted them to the appointed place of ceremony. Here the Colonial\r\nSecretary read the proclamations, which he assures us \"were responded\r\nto by three hearty cheers; a royal salute from the Europeans, and with\r\na war dance and general discharge of musketry by the natives who had\r\nassembled in great numbers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n PROCLAMATION\r\n\r\n In the name of Her Majesty, Victoria, Queen of the United Kingdom of\r\n Great Britain and Ireland. By William Hobson, Esq., a Captain in the\r\n Royal Navy, Lieutenant-Governor of New Zealand.\r\n\r\n WHEREAS by a treaty bearing date the 5th day of February in\r\n the year of our Lord 1840, made and executed by me William Hobson, a\r\n Captain in the Royal Navy, Consul and Lieutenant-Governor in New\r\n Zealand, vested for this purpose with full powers by Her Britannic\r\n Majesty, of the one part, and the chiefs of the confederation of the\r\n United tribes of New Zealand, and the separate and independent chiefs\r\n of New Zealand, not members of the confederation, of the other, and\r\n further ratified and confirmed by the adherence of the principal\r\n chiefs of this Island of New Zealand, commonly called \"The Northern\r\n Island,\" all rights and powers of Sovereignty over the said Northern\r\n Island were ceded to Her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain and\r\n Ireland, absolutely and without reservation.\r\n\r\n NOW, THEREFORE, I, William Hobson, Lieutenant-Governor of\r\n New Zealand, in the name and on behalf of Her Majesty, do hereby\r\n proclaim and declare to all men, that from and after the date of the\r\n above-mentioned treaty, the full sovereignty of the Northern Island\r\n of New Zealand vests in Her Majesty Queen Victoria, her heirs and\r\n successors for ever.\r\n\r\n GIVEN under my hand at Government House, Russell, Bay of\r\n Islands, this 21st day of May in the year of our Lord 1840.\r\n\r\n WILLIAM HOBSON,\r\n Lieutenant-Governor.\r\n\r\n By His Excellency's command,\r\n\r\n WILLOUGHBY SHORTLAND,\r\n Colonial Secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n PROCLAMATION\r\n\r\n In the name of Her Majesty, Victoria, Queen of the United Kingdom of\r\n Great Britain and Ireland. By William Hobson, Esq., a Captain in the\r\n Royal Navy, Lieutenant-Governor of[150] New Zealand.\r\n\r\n WHEREAS I have it in command from Her Majesty Queen\r\n Victoria, through her principal Secretary of State for the Colonies,\r\n to assert the Sovereign rights of Her Majesty over the Southern\r\n Islands of New Zealand, commonly called \"The Middle Island\" and\r\n \"Stewart's Island,\" and also the Island commonly called \"The Northern\r\n Island,\" the same having been ceded in Sovereignty to Her Majesty.\r\n\r\n NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM HOBSON, Lieutenant-Governor of\r\n New Zealand, do hereby proclaim and declare to all men, that from and\r\n after the date of these presents the full sovereignty of the Islands\r\n of New Zealand extending from 34° 30' north[151] to 47° 10' south\r\n latitude, and between 166° 5' to 179° of east longitude, vests in Her\r\n Majesty Queen Victoria, her heirs and successors for ever.\r\n\r\n GIVEN under my hand at Government House, Russell, Bay of\r\n Islands, this 21st day of May in the year of our Lord 1840.\r\n\r\n WILLIAM HOBSON,\r\n Lieutenant-Governor.\r\n\r\n By His Excellency's command,\r\n\r\n WILLOUGHBY SHORTLAND,\r\n Colonial Secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the last sounds of the rejoicing died away the leaders of the\r\nSettlement again pressed upon the Colonial Secretary their\r\nprotestations of loyalty, and reiterated their assurances that in\r\nappearing to assume authority over the community they had been\r\nactuated by no other motive than a desire to preserve the peace and to\r\nprotect their property. Under these circumstances the Colonial\r\nSecretary was able to write to Captain Hobson on June 20, \"I have\r\ngreat pleasure in informing your Excellency that Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment is now fully established, and that both European and native\r\npopulations are in a very satisfactory state.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HORAHORA-KAKAHU ISLAND.\r\n\r\nWhere sovereignty was declared over the South Island.]\r\n\r\nMatters were in this position when Major Bunbury landed at Port\r\nNicholson. He confirmed the harmonious nature of the relations between\r\n_Pakeha_ and Maori in an interview he held with some native\r\nchiefs, and subsequently with Captain Smith, R.A., Surveyor-General to\r\nthe Company. This gentleman expressed himself as being much annoyed at\r\nthe exaggerated accounts which had been spread regarding the condition\r\nof the settlement,[152] and the disloyalty of the settlers, whom he\r\naverred had received the Colonial Secretary[153] with the most\r\nspontaneous cordiality, the feminine section of the community being\r\nequally enthusiastic in acclaiming the substitution of the British\r\nflag for that of the Company. These protestations must be received and\r\naccepted for whatever weight they may bear. It is a fact too well\r\nknown to again require substantiation, that the intervention of the\r\nBritish Government at this juncture was a grievous blow to the\r\npromoters of the New Zealand Company, and that whatever the feelings\r\nof the populace may have been, the leaders were never in a mood to\r\nexpress jubilation at the authority of the Crown thus unceremoniously\r\noverriding their own.\r\n\r\nIt is at least significant that the _New Zealand Gazette_, the\r\norgan of the Company, in its issue of June 6, is content with making\r\nthe most meagre mention of the fact that Lieutenant Shortland had\r\nlanded at Thorndon and read the Governor's proclamations. There is no\r\nenthusiasm, no shouts of acclamation described there, while the\r\neditorial is sullen in temper, and ill conceals the barb of\r\ndisappointment, or the touch of sarcasm in its congratulations:\r\n\r\n We congratulate our fellow-colonists upon being secured in this part\r\n of the world in all the rights of British subjects. All know, of\r\n course, that His Excellency has it not in his power either to extend\r\n or limit our rights, consequently if we were, so are we now entitled\r\n to the representative Government we have sometime enjoyed, though it\r\n may be for the present placed in abeyance. Under the British flag and\r\n having our representative Government in respect of administration of\r\n affairs, we shall be the most favoured Colony in this part of the\r\n world. We shall be in a better position even than South Australia,\r\n whose constitution is conditional upon having a given amount of\r\n population at a particular moment, and the which may be when obtained\r\n of a very questionable kind. If deprived of our representative\r\n Government, the main good of the proclamations will have been placing\r\n us, so far as the benefits of trade are concerned, on a footing with\r\n all other British colonies. But with this good we have a large\r\n quantity of bitter thrown into the cup. The highest in the scale of\r\n rank is a non-subcolony with a representative Government, and free of\r\n convicts; the lowest a subcolony to a Crown penal colony; and this is\r\n the position in which the free men of New Zealand find themselves\r\n placed by a British proclamation. We are dependent on New South\r\n Wales, and are therefore lowest in the scale of British\r\n colonies--indeed it would be difficult to conceive a lower condition.\r\n We are to be legislated for by a convict colony, we are therefore its\r\n inferior. New South Wales has Norfolk Island--the accursed of\r\n jails--and New Zealand as its dependencies. We place Norfolk Island\r\n first, because first subjected to New South Wales. The difference\r\n between these dependencies is that the one is now devoted to the\r\n convict system and the other is not, but as yet we have no guarantee\r\nthat this shall not be the cherished abode of vice and crime. We have\r\ncongratulated the colonists upon being placed under the British flag,\r\nbut of course we firmly believe that Lord John Russell will\r\nimmediately render these Islands independent of New South Wales, and\r\nthat if we lose our Representative Government for the present, we\r\nshall not find ourselves placed upon a less favourable footing than\r\nthe colonists of South Australia. It must never be forgotten that we\r\nhave shewn we can govern ourselves, and were proceeding in a quiet,\r\norderly, and successful career when the assertion of British authority\r\ntook place.\r\n\r\nThat these sentiments faithfully reflected the views of the leaders at\r\nPort Nicholson is scarcely open to question, for the writer was in\r\ndaily communication with them, and the most cursory perusal of them is\r\nall that is needed to establish how much of elation there is in their\r\ntone. The fact is the despatch of Captain Hobson to New Zealand, and\r\nhis subsequent success, brought the keenest mortification to Colonel\r\nWakefield and his colleagues, and after resistance and ridicule had\r\nfailed to prevent the consummation of the treaty, they adopted an\r\nattitude of silent but angry acquiescence in a line of policy which in\r\ntheir hearts they regarded with the utmost malignity.\r\n\r\nOne thing, and one thing only, made the new position tolerable to\r\nthem, and that was the prospect of securing to their own settlement\r\nthe seat of Government. To this end they adopted an address of welcome\r\nto Captain Hobson, and despatched Colonel Wakefield to the Bay of\r\nIslands to present it. The bait was offered of a hearty welcome and\r\nthe most valuable sites in the town for the convenience of the public\r\noffices. Captain Hobson's failure to accept the bribe only added fuel\r\nto the smouldering fires of discontent and served to enhance the\r\ndifficulties of his already intricate administration--perhaps to\r\nshorten his life.\r\n\r\nThe _Herald_ left Port Nicholson just before dusk on Sunday the\r\n21st, beating out of the Heads in the dark against a fresh south-east\r\nbreeze, with her boats holding lights on the extremities of the\r\noutlying reefs for the guidance of the helmsman. Her journey along the\r\ncoast was uneventful, and on the night of the 23rd she anchored in\r\nHawke's Bay.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning Major Bunbury landed in search of the chief\r\nTe Hapuku, the most influential representative of the Ngati-Kahungunu\r\ntribe living on this stretch of coast. By common report this chief had\r\nacquired an unenviable reputation for rapacity and extortion towards\r\nthe Europeans settled at Ahuriri (Napier). For this reason Major\r\nBunbury anticipated some little difficulty in finding him \"at home\":\r\n\r\n \"Nor,\" says he, \"did the tears of some of the women who followed us\r\n from one of his residences we found at the bottom of the Bay, make me\r\n think more favourably of him. After walking about a mile along the\r\n beach, and crossing the sandy isthmus we arrived at an estuary, the\r\n road leading round it being only passable at low water. After walking\r\n and wading another half hour we arrived at the _pa_, but the\r\n chief had gone into the country. A native was, however, sent after\r\n him. Here we remained some time, but no chief appearing, we prepared\r\n to return, and left a note for him explaining the nature of our\r\n mission, with a native who was able to read. Before reaching our boat\r\n Te Hapuku overtook us, accompanied by a chief from the Bay of Islands\r\n district, named Hara. The chief, Te Hapuku, at first refused to sign\r\n the treaty, saying that he was nobody, and that he had heard that\r\n those who signed it at the Bay of Islands had been made slaves. I\r\n therefore requested Mr. Williams to ask the chief Hara, who was one\r\n of those who had signed, how he came not to be made a slave and how\r\n many slaves he had seen at that place when he left the Bay of Islands\r\n with Mr. Williams' father. He endeavoured then to explain his meaning\r\n by a sort of diagram on a piece of board, placing the Queen by\r\n herself over the chiefs as these were over the tribes. I told him it\r\n was literally as he described it, but not for an evil purpose as they\r\n supposed, but to enable her to enforce the execution of justice and\r\n good government equally amongst her subjects. Her authority having\r\n been already proclaimed over New Zealand with the consent of the\r\n greatest number of influential chiefs, he would find that the tribes\r\n must no longer go to war with each other, but must subject their\r\n differences to her arbitration; strangers and foreigners must no\r\n longer be plundered and oppressed by natives or chiefs; nor must the\r\n natives be injured or insulted by white men. It was not the object of\r\n Her Majesty's Government to lower the chiefs in the estimation of the\r\n tribes, and that his signature being now attached to the treaty could\r\n only tend to increase his consequence by acknowledging his title. He\r\n might, therefore, sign or otherwise as he thought best for his own\r\n interests and those of his tribe. To give him greater confidence I\r\n told him I regretted it was not in my power to show him the ship, as\r\n we had not the means of relanding his party. I could give him and\r\n his party a seat in our gig, but as they did not appear to have any\r\n canoes in this part of the Bay I did not know how they were to get\r\n back. He then immediately volunteered to go and take his chance of\r\n meeting with some canoes alongside the ship, in which he might\r\n return.\r\n\r\n \"A complaint having been made to me by Mr. Ellis, against a native\r\n who had taken from him a whaling boat with its oars and sails, on\r\n pretence that Ellis had cursed him, and who acknowledged he had been\r\n induced so to act from having been prevented from removing some\r\n sawyers he had employed, and for an attempt made to make him pay over\r\n again five sovereigns and 40 lbs. of tobacco he had paid for the\r\n timber. I referred the matter on the spot to Te Hapuku, who\r\n acknowledged that the Englishman's statement was correct. He said,\r\n however, that the native did not belong to his tribe, but as he had\r\n been cursed he wished to know how the native was to be compensated. I\r\n told him Ellis had done wrong, but according to our notions, under\r\n all the circumstances, the punishment had far exceeded the offence. I\r\n should therefore insist upon the boat being returned to him, but as\r\n mild measures were always preferable, I begged he would send a native\r\n to advise the boat being immediately given up, to prevent the\r\n necessity for my employing the ship-of-war, which I otherwise should\r\n do. Mr. Parker of the _Herald_ and Mr. Williams having\r\n volunteered to accompany Mr. Ellis in his boat, I desired the latter,\r\n who understood and spoke the native language, to be told by Mr.\r\n Williams in their language, that I was determined that justice should\r\n be done, not alone to the natives, but to strangers also, and if\r\n necessary the _Herald_ would interfere. When Mr. Ellis was about\r\n to shove off in his boat he returned and told me the observations\r\n that had been made had caused such a sensation amongst the natives\r\n present that he was confident his boat would be, immediately on his\r\n arrival, returned to him, and that he did not consider it would now\r\n be necessary to trouble either Mr. Parker or Mr. Williams to\r\n accompany him. These gentlemen were accordingly passed into the\r\n _Herald's_ gig, and accompanied by Te Hapuku, Hara, and some\r\n other natives we returned on board. Captain Nias ordered a gun to be\r\n fired, at their request, and having signed the treaty and received\r\n some blankets and tobacco as a present, they were put on shore at a\r\n native village in the Bay, where they would get canoes to convey them\r\n to their residence. Mr. Ellis not having returned on board the\r\n _Herald_ according to an agreement I had made with him on shore,\r\n we concluded his boat had been restored to him.\"\r\n\r\nMajor Bunbury having now visited all the places of importance from the\r\npoint of view of native population on the East Coast, the\r\n_Herald_ once more set her course for the Bay of Islands,\r\nreaching port on July 4. Captain Hobson had so far recovered in\r\nhealth, as to resume the active administration of affairs, and was at\r\nthe moment of the Major's arrival \"absent on a tour of duty.\" The\r\npropaganda of the treaty had prospered to the fullest expectation.\r\nFive hundred and twelve[154] signatures had been obtained, embracing\r\nalmost every man of influence throughout the Islands with the\r\nexception of Te Wherowhero of Waikato, Te Heuheu, of Taupo, Te\r\nWaharoa, chief of Ngatihaua and Taiaroa, of Otago.\r\n\r\nIn recognition of this achievement Lord John Russell wrote to Captain\r\nHobson then rapidly approaching his end: \"As far as it has been\r\npossible to form a judgment, your proceedings appear to have entitled\r\nyou to the entire approbation of Her Majesty's Government.\"\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances we have now reached that stage in our history\r\nwhere we may in words of the chiefs themselves, write: \"Now, we, the\r\nchiefs of the Assembly of the _hapus_ of New Zealand, assembled\r\nat Waitangi. We, also, the chiefs of New Zealand, see the meaning of\r\nthese words. They are taken and consented to altogether by us.\r\nTherefore are affixed our names and our marks.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSIGNATURES TO THE TREATY OF WAITANGI\r\n\r\n=Waitangi, February 6, 1840=\r\n\r\n  KAWITI.

In Captain Hobson's despatch he makes it appear\r\nthat it was Papa Haiga (Papahia) who made this statement, but from Mr.\r\nShortland's notes it would appear to have been Taonui.\r\n\r\n[96] Afterwards Judge Manning of the Native Land Court, and author of\r\nthat classic _Old New Zealand_.\r\n\r\n[97] Meaning one who has been favourable to the introduction of\r\nEuropeans.\r\n\r\n[98] Altogether 120 signatures were obtained in the Hokianga\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\n[99] Captain Nias conducted the meeting at the Waitemata, and secured\r\neight or ten signatures.\r\n\r\n[100] It is more than likely that at this date Captain Nias did not\r\nknow the real nature of Captain Hobson's illness. Some correspondence\r\nwhich took place later in the month seems to suggest that there was a\r\nlittle friction between Dr. Lane, the ship's surgeon, and himself on\r\nthe subject. On the arrival of the _Herald_ in Sydney, towards\r\nthe end of March, Dr. Lane was sent for by Sir George Gipps, who\r\nrequested that he be furnished with a written report on the state of\r\nCaptain Hobson's health. Dr. Lane replied, ascribing the illness to an\r\nattack of paralysis hemiplegica. In forwarding this report to the\r\nGovernor, Captain Nias stated that \"it is in total contradiction of\r\neverything he has stated before to me on the subject.\"\r\n\r\n[101] The attitude of the Missionaries toward the treaty was well\r\nexpressed by the Rev. Mr. Maunsell in a letter to the Colonial\r\nSecretary, Mr. Shortland, dated April 14, 1840.\r\n\r\n[102] These services were acknowledged in the most generous terms by\r\nCaptain Hobson.\r\n\r\n[103] \"The appointment of Police Magistrates was one of the first acts\r\nunder the new order of things. Mr. Robert (?) Shortland, the first\r\nPolice Magistrate, after the illness of Governor Hobson, styled\r\nhimself Acting-Governor, and a more ridiculously pompous functionary\r\ncould scarcely be imagined.\"--Commander Wilkes.\r\n\r\n[104] \"A report prevails and not without foundation that a conspiracy\r\nagainst the Government and Military exists amongst many of the chiefs\r\nof this neighbourhood. I know the persons implicated and I will have\r\nthem closely watched. If there really is any truth in the matter it\r\nmay be ascribed to the mischievous stories that have been circulated\r\nby low, abandoned Europeans who try to persuade the natives that we\r\nonly wait until we are strong enough, to take possession of the land,\r\nand sell it, irrespective of Native claims.\"--_Vide_ Captain\r\nHobson's Letter to Sir G. Gipps, May 5, 1840.\r\n\r\n[105] In many cases Mr. Shortland has used the baptismal name of the\r\nmen who spoke, and in some instances, such as Forde and Marsden, it is\r\nnow impossible to identify the men from their signatures on the\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\n[106] A reference to the misrepresentations of the Europeans.\r\n\r\n[107] \"Our chief Noble has become quite a European in his habits. He\r\nhas a neat little weather-boarded cottage, which is furnished with\r\ntable and chairs like our own, and his food is much the same. He has\r\npurchased tea, sugar, and rice from the European settlers, and is as\r\ncleanly with his wife as any white person, and in all respects as\r\ncomfortable. He assembles his servants and people about him, morning\r\nand evening for prayer, and all his concerns are conducted with the\r\nutmost order. His Excellency Governor Hobson has just visited this\r\nplace. He, with his suite, supped at Noble's, and was vastly pleased\r\nwith him.\"--Report of Mr. Puckey in _Missionary Register_, 1841.\r\n\r\n[108] The meeting concluded with a war dance, and general discharge of\r\nmusketry, and a feast provided entirely at Nopera's expense. Not only\r\ndid he refuse to accept any payment, but he added to his generosity by\r\nsending to the Governor a present of pigs and potatoes.\r\n\r\n[109] Captain William Cornwallis Symonds was the son of Sir William\r\nSymonds, Surveyor of the Navy, and was Deputy Surveyor of New Zealand.\r\nHe accompanied Dr. Dieffenbach on some of his exploring expeditions,\r\nand made maps of his observations. He was also an enthusiastic student\r\nof the native language, and collected a vocabulary of 3000 Maori\r\nwords. He lost his life in 1841 through his canoe capsizing while\r\ncrossing the Manakau Harbour.\r\n\r\n[110] Rewa had said at Waitangi that his opposition there had been\r\ninspired by the Bishop.\r\n\r\n[111] The Rev. Robert Maunsell (afterwards Archdeacon Maunsell)\r\narrived in New Zealand in 1835. He was a \"ripe and trained scholar,\"\r\nand after he had mastered the native language became, next to Mr.\r\nHenry Williams, the leader of the Missionary movement. He rendered an\r\ninvaluable service to the cause of Christianity by his translations of\r\nthe scriptures and prayer-book into the Maori tongue. In July 1843 his\r\nhouse was destroyed by fire, and with it were lost the MSS. of his\r\ndictionary, and his revisions of the translated Psalms and Old\r\nTestament. He however courageously set to work again almost before the\r\nburns upon his hands had healed. A fund of £200 subscribed in England\r\nprovided him again with a library.\r\n\r\n[112] Afterwards massacred at the White Cliffs.\r\n\r\n[113] Neither Te Wherowhero nor his brother, Kati, appear to have\r\nsigned the treaty.\r\n\r\nIn the appendix to Kerry Nicholls' _King Country_ appears the\r\nfollowing as a portion of the late King Tawhiao's autobiographical\r\nnarrative: \"I remember a European coming to ask Te Wherowhero\r\n(Tawhiao's father) to sign the treaty of Waitangi. That European was\r\nMr. Maunsell. The Maori he had with him was Tipene Tahatika. Te\r\nWherowhero said he would not sign. Mr. Maunsell remarked to Tipene,\r\n'This ignorant old man, if he had signed, I would have given him a\r\nblanket.' Te Wherowhero was then at Awhitu. Te Wherowhero's name was\r\nafterwards put to the treaty, but it was written by Te Kahawai, and\r\nnot by himself.\"\r\n\r\n[114] Mr. Hamlin, though laying no great pretensions to scholarship,\r\nwas considered by the Maoris to be the most perfect speaker of their\r\nlanguage in New Zealand.\r\n\r\n[115] \"Here I may remark that it is impossible to view with unconcern\r\nthe injurious tendency of religious dissensions among a people just\r\nemerging from paganism. Between the disciples of the Bishop and those\r\nwho have embraced the doctrines of Protestantism there already exists\r\na feeling which borders on hostility, and it is not unusual to hear\r\nthe former taunted by their adversaries as worshippers of wood and\r\nstone, misguided unbelievers, devils, etc. To express sentiments of\r\nsevere censure against the Roman Catholic Church and its followers is\r\nnot the most efficient means of advancing the interests of the\r\nProtestant Church, and in reply to the illiberal language which is\r\ndealt forth so unsparingly on this subject, we may cite among\r\ninnumerable other facts, the life and actions of Fénélon, the most\r\nblameless and virtuous of men, in proof that a Roman Catholic\r\nclergyman is not of necessity either a Jesuit or a hypocrite. But\r\nholding in view the admitted tendency of religious dissensions to\r\nunsettle and weaken the impression of Christianity in the minds of the\r\nnatives of New Zealand, and at the same time to foster dissension and\r\nangry feeling it is certainly to be regretted that an attempt has been\r\nmade to introduce the doctrines of Rome into a field already\r\npreoccupied by the active and zealous emissaries of the reformed\r\nChurch.\"--Jameson.\r\n\r\n[116] \"During my residence at the Bay of Islands, on this occasion, I\r\nderived much pleasure from the acquaintance and conversation of M. de\r\nPompallier, the chief of the French Catholic Mission to the South\r\nSeas, and Bishop of Oceania, who was held in high esteem by every\r\nindividual in the settlement, not only on account of his polished and\r\ncourteous demeanour, but from his more important merits of learning,\r\nprofessional zeal, and practical benevolence. Whatever may be said of\r\nhis persuasion, it is at least evident that no motives of a worldly or\r\nambitious nature could have thus induced a man of rank and wealth to\r\ndevote himself to the arduous and hazardous duties of a missionary in\r\nthe Pacific.\"--Jameson.\r\n\r\n[117] Captain Lavaud mentions that during this interview he had always\r\naddressed the Lieutenant-Governor as \"Captain,\" and not as His\r\n\"Excellency.\" He explains, however, that he did so \"more by instinct\r\nthan with any intention of being discourteous.\"\r\n\r\n[118] The treaty is here transcribed in the Captain's Despatch.\r\n\r\n[119] The Rev. William Williams does not appear to have obtained the\r\nsignatures of Te Kani-a-Takirau or Houkamau amongst the chiefs of\r\nWaiapu. It is unlikely that men of importance such as these were\r\noverlooked, and we may therefore conclude that they objected to sign.\r\nMr. Williams reported that he would require sixty more blankets to\r\ncomplete the gifts to the chiefs in his district. Mr. Williams was\r\nafterwards first Bishop of Waiapu.\r\n\r\n[120] The district now surrounding Napier.\r\n\r\n[121] \"I desire to impress upon you the anxious wish of the Directors\r\nthat you, and all the servants of the Company, should do whatever may\r\nbe in your power to promote the success of Captain Hobson's mission,\r\nand to accelerate as much as possible the time when it is to be hoped\r\nthat he, as Her Majesty's representative may establish a British\r\nauthority and the regular application of English law, not only in the\r\nCompany's settlements, but throughout the Islands of New\r\nZealand.\"--Extract from a letter written by Mr. John Ward, Secretary\r\nto the Company, to Colonel Wakefield, after the Company had been\r\nadvised that its proceedings were illegal.\r\n\r\n[122] \"On the Wednesday following, while preparing to take my\r\ndeparture--not being able to obtain the signatures required owing to\r\nthe opposition of Colonel Wakefield and others, to the treaty between\r\nthe chiefs and Her Majesty--Colonel Wakefield came to me, making a\r\nmost ample apology, and expressed his regret that he should have given\r\nway to his hasty feelings on the previous Saturday, and hoped that I\r\nshould not leave the port with unfavourable feelings, and that he was\r\nready, if I wished, to make a public apology. The fact was that\r\nColonel Wakefield wanted the land, and was willing to make any\r\nsacrifice confined to words.\"--Carleton's _Life of Henry\r\nWilliams_.\r\n\r\n[123] This letter, written subsequent to the Colonel's apology, was\r\nfirst made public through the columns of the London Times, and it was\r\nnot for months afterwards that Mr. Williams heard of it. The history\r\nof the land transaction referred to, which excited the indignation\r\n(righteous or otherwise) of Colonel Wakefield, is fully told in that\r\ninteresting book, Hugh Carleton's _Life of Henry Williams_, vol. i.\r\npp. 237-243, and should be read by all impartial students of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n[124] Amongst others, by Te Rauparaha and his niece Topeora, the\r\npoetess, on May 14.\r\n\r\n[125] Immediately after his seizure, Captain Hobson had dispensed with\r\nthe services of the _Herald_, on account of his personal\r\ndifferences with her Captain. She then returned to Sydney, but Sir\r\nGeorge Gipps sent her back again, telling Captain Nias that \"naval\r\nco-operation was essential to the enterprise at New Zealand, as the\r\nQueen's sovereignty was established over only a small portion of the\r\nNorthern Island.\"\r\n\r\n[126] Major Bunbury, K.T.S., and a portion of his regiment (the 80th)\r\nwere sent to New Zealand by Sir George Gipps in H.M.S. _Buffalo_,\r\nas the result of a request from Captain Hobson for some military\r\nsupport. They left Sydney just as the news of Captain Hobson's illness\r\nreached the seat of Government, and Major Bunbury was given a\r\ncommission to act as Lieutenant-Governor in the event of Hobson's\r\ndeath or resignation.\r\n\r\nIn his _Reminiscences_ the Major states that Captain Hobson\r\nbegged him to undertake this Southern mission in order to relieve him\r\n(Hobson) from the necessity of again sailing with Captain Nias, with\r\nwhom he had several violent quarrels about the salutes he was to\r\nreceive and other similar details. \"It was,\" says the Major, \"a\r\ngrievous sacrifice to make, the troops not having yet landed or\r\narrangements been made for their accommodation, but I could not\r\nprevail upon myself to refuse him.\"\r\n\r\n[127] Horeta te Taniwha, the celebrated chief known as \"Hook-nose,\"\r\nwho remembered Cook's visit to New Zealand.\r\n\r\n[128] This was what the natives called \"making their hearts good.\"\r\n\"Pay us first and we will write afterwards.\" \"Put money in my left\r\nhand and I will write with my right hand,\" was how they often\r\nexpressed it.\r\n\r\n[129] _Taihoa_ = delay, postpone, put off, reserve for further\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n[130] Meaning that he was the representative of the central district.\r\n\r\n[131] The writing of the treaty.\r\n\r\n[132] Major Bunbury left eight blankets with Mr. Stack for\r\ndistribution amongst future signatories, but the Missionary mentions\r\nin a subsequent letter: \"Several more may be wanting if Tupaea and his\r\nfriends sign.\" Tupaea would not sign, either when approached by Mr.\r\nStack, or later when he paid a visit to Manakau. The above discussion\r\nexplains why.\r\n\r\n[133] The dialect spoken by the natives of the South Island of New\r\nZealand differs in some important respects from that spoken in the\r\nNorth Island.\r\n\r\n[134] Major Bunbury was so impressed with the fertile appearance of\r\nBanks's Peninsula that he recommended it be surveyed as soon as\r\npossible and thrown open for settlement in allotments of convenient\r\nsize, in order to put a stop to the \"preposterous claims\" which were\r\nbeing urged by the Sydney land speculators. Most of these claims of\r\n\"doubtful origin\" originated in sales contracted with Taiaroa, the\r\nOtago chief, who had an equally \"doubtful\" right to sell. Taiaroa went\r\nto Sydney in the _Dublin Packet_ in 1839.\r\n\r\n[135] \"In some excursions I made I was much pleased with the fertile\r\nappearance of this beautiful island, and although the winter was so\r\nfar advanced it was not so cold as I had anticipated from its being so\r\nfar south. Indeed the number of parrakeets seen flying about give it\r\nrather the appearance of a tropical island.... The soil appears in\r\ngeneral good, with plenty of timber. There are several varieties of\r\npine. All the trees, however, appear to be evergreens.\"--Major\r\nBunbury's _Despatch_.\r\n\r\n[136] Major Bunbury mentions that by this time he had become ashamed\r\nof this sobriquet, which was given to him by the whalers, and disowned\r\nit, preferring to be called by his native name.\r\n\r\n[137] Tu Hawaiki had only returned in the previous month of March from\r\nSydney, where he had been presented with these uniforms by Sir George\r\nGipps. Shortly after this chief's repulse of Te Rauparaha at Lake\r\nGrassmere, on the coast of Marlborough, he boarded a British\r\nman-of-war, and on being asked who he was, proudly replied: \"Me all\r\nthe same the Duke of Wellington, Te Rauparaha all the same Napoleon.\"\r\n\r\n[138] Another chief named Taiaroa is also credited with signing. It is\r\ndifficult to determine which chief this was, as the great Taiaroa was\r\nat Moeraki at the time. Possibly it was one of his sons.\r\n\r\n[139] These were Kaikoura and Taiaroa. The identity of this Taiaroa is\r\nnot clear.\r\n\r\n[140] There were two American and two French whalers at the anchorage\r\nhere at the time.\r\n\r\n[141] Major Bunbury mentions that some of these speculators had\r\nalready sent a number of cattle over, but the natives resisted the\r\noccupation of their alleged purchases, and the persons who were placed\r\nin charge of the cattle \"find themselves in rather an awkward\r\npredicament.\"\r\n\r\n[142] Popularly known amongst the whalers as \"Jordy Bolts.\"\r\n\r\n[143] Major Bunbury mentions the eagerness manifested by the natives\r\nof Cloudy Bay for spelling-books and Testaments. On the table in his\r\ncabin was lying a Testament printed in the native language which had\r\nbeen given to him by Bishop Broughton. This was seen by some of the\r\nMaoris visiting the ship, who importuned him for it, with the result,\r\nhe feared, that his refusal gave serious offence.\r\n\r\n[144] As the _Herald_ left Cloudy Bay, the Kaikouras, clad in\r\ntheir winter snow, loomed up in the distance, and Major Bunbury was\r\ndeeply impressed with what he calls their \"bleak and savage\r\nappearance.\" The Major took his departure from the Middle Island fully\r\nconvinced that it had been greatly underrated by the authorities both\r\nin regard to the fertility of its soil and the intelligence of its\r\nnatives.\r\n\r\n[145] Te Rauparaha may have laid himself open to this charge of\r\ninsincerity by afterwards making light of the fact that he had signed\r\nthe treaty, and offering to sign again if they gave him another\r\nblanket. With Te Rangihaeata it was different. Savage that he was, he\r\nhad the keenest sense of honour, and he would not have signed the\r\ntreaty had he not approved it so far as he understood it. His\r\nsubsequent rebellion was not a protest against the establishment of\r\ncivil authority so much as it was active resistance towards what he\r\nbelieved to be the unfair if not the dishonest methods of land dealing\r\nadopted by the New Zealand Company, in whom he lost all confidence\r\nafter their attempt to seize the Wairau Valley.\r\n\r\n[146] Before the first batch of the Company's emigrants sailed from\r\nthe Thames, they were induced by the Directors to sign an agreement\r\nbinding themselves to \"submit in all things needful to peace and order\r\nuntil the establishment of a regular Government.\" This meant that if\r\nany of them committed a breach of the law of England, he should be\r\npunished according to the law of England. This agreement was brought\r\nunder the notice of Lord John Russell who challenged the right of the\r\nCompany to enforce such a provision. The Company took the opinion of\r\nSerjeant Wilde upon the point, and his advice, given on November 14,\r\n1839, was that (1) the parties will not be justified by law in acting\r\nunder the agreement, (2) that those acting under it were liable to\r\nprosecution for so doing, and (3) the agreement should be abandoned.\r\n\r\n[147] \"Captain Pearson of the brig _Integrity_ was arrested\r\nto-day (April 14) under a warrant issued for illegal conduct towards\r\nhis charterer, Mr. Wade, of Hobart Town, and brought before the\r\nDistrict Magistrate, Major Baker. The prisoner refused to recognise\r\nthe Court, and was accordingly committed. The ensuing day Captain\r\nPearson made his escape, and an escape Warrant has accordingly been\r\nissued against him.\"--Extract from _New Zealand Gazette_ (the\r\nfirst newspaper published in the Colony), April 18, 1840.\r\n\r\n[148] The proclamation itself does not make it clear on what grounds\r\nHobson took possession of the \"Island.\" Indeed it is so ambiguously\r\nworded that he seems to imply that he claimed it by right of cession.\r\nIn his despatch to the Secretary for State, however, he made it clear\r\nthat he intended to claim it \"by right of discovery,\" a course which\r\nhe had recommended to Lord Normanby before he left England.\r\n\r\n[149] \"Captain\" Cole as he was sometimes called, because he had been\r\nsailing in an East Indiaman, had been one of the early Wellington\r\nsettlers, having come out in the _Aurora_. On the arrival of\r\nCaptain Hobson he removed to the Bay of Islands, and had succeeded in\r\ngetting himself appointed chief constable at Port Nicholson, in which\r\ncapacity he now appeared in the Southern settlement.\r\n\r\n[150] As sovereignty over only a small portion of the Colony had at this\r\ntime been ceded to the Queen, Hobson was claiming a wider jurisdiction\r\nthan he was entitled to in describing himself as \"Lieutenant-Governor\r\n_of_ New Zealand.\" He was only Lieutenant-Governor _in_ New Zealand.\r\n\r\n[151] This also was a mistake. It should have been South, not North.\r\nOn this error Sir George Grey once based the argument that New Zealand\r\nincluded New Guinea, and was entitled to claim control over it. The\r\nerror was corrected and the boundaries so amended as to include the\r\nChatham Islands.--Vide Letters Patent issued to Captain Hobson, April\r\n4, 1842.\r\n\r\n[152] It had been reported that the settlers were starving, which was\r\nquite untrue.\r\n\r\n[153] While H.M.S. _Britomart_ (Captain Stanley) was returning\r\nfrom her historic visit to Bank's Peninsula she put in to Port\r\nNicholson and took Mr. Shortland on board, leaving Mr. Murphy to\r\nsupply his place as the representative of the Government at the\r\nSouthern settlement.\r\n\r\n[154] This number was subsequently increased to 546.\r\n\r\n[155] Mr. Fredarb, who was trading master of the schooner _Mercury_,\r\nadded the following note to his copy of the treaty: \"The chiefs at\r\nOpotiki expressed a wish to have it signified who were Pikopos\r\n(_i.e._ Roman Catholics) and who were not, the which I did by\r\nplacing a crucifix † preceding the names of those who are, as above,\r\nand at which they seemed perfectly satisfied.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE TREATY\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Hobson having now by his own efforts and the agency of those\r\nwho were associated with him completed his negotiations with the\r\nnative chiefs, it remains for us to examine briefly the nature of the\r\ncompact into which the Maori and _Pakeha_ had thus solemnly\r\nentered. The Treaty of Waitangi is a document of few clauses and\r\nprecise terms. Yet under the conflicting interests which it was\r\ndesigned to harmonise few documents have been more generally\r\nmisunderstood or more persistently misinterpreted. More than once in\r\nhigh places its utility has been denied, its simple contracts have\r\nbeen repudiated, and its existence has been ignored. Lawyers have\r\nrepeatedly questioned its legality, courts have discussed its\r\nconstitutional force, parliaments have debated its wisdom, but still\r\nit stands to-day--unaltered in text or spirit--the great charter of\r\nMaori rights. Its most virulent enemies have ever been the land\r\nspeculators, and there are not wanting signs in these times of\r\nunsatisfied land hunger--of never-ceasing speculation--that the treaty\r\nhas either been forgotten by those whose duty it is to remember it, or\r\nthat its obligations have ceased to have their old-time moral value.\r\nLest we forget that the treaty is still in force, and that native\r\nlands are not common plunder for the avaricious _Pakeha_, let us\r\nbriefly review the circumstances which made the compact between the\r\ntwo nations a political virtue, if not a political necessity.\r\n\r\nIt is a principle recognised by the civilised nations of the Earth\r\nthat the discovery of a waste and uninhabited land by a pioneering\r\ncountry confers on that country a right, as against all other\r\ncivilised countries, to colonise its new discovery. In such a case the\r\ndiscovering nation may in fact go further, by immediately taking\r\npossession of the new-found territory, and assuming sovereignty over\r\nit. In this way Norfolk Island being found devoid of inhabitants by\r\nCaptain Cook, his discovery of the sea-girt isle not only entitled\r\nBritain to colonise it, but automatically added it to the possessions\r\nof the Empire. This principle has thus been concisely stated by\r\nVattel: \"All men have an equal right to the things which have not yet\r\nfallen into the possession of any one; and these things appertain to\r\nthe first occupant. Wherefore, when a nation finds a country\r\nuninhabited and without a master, it may lawfully seize upon the same,\r\nand after it has adequately denoted its will in this respect another\r\ncannot thereof despoil it. Thus navigators going on their voyages of\r\ndiscovery, provided with a commission from their sovereign, and\r\nfalling in with desert islands, or other desert lands, have taken\r\npossession of them in the name of their nation, and commonly this\r\ntitle has been respected, provided that thereupon a real possession\r\nhas closely followed.\"\r\n\r\nIt is equally an acknowledged maxim of the Law of Nations that should\r\nthe newly discovered land not prove to be \"waste and without a\r\nmaster,\" but that it should be inhabited and under government of any\r\nkind, then the mere fact of its discovery by a civilised nation\r\nconfers upon the discoverer no title to the soil, but only the prior\r\nright to colonise as against other colonising nations. This is but the\r\nnatural reward which belongs to the enterprise displayed in fitting\r\nout ships and expeditions destined to navigate unknown seas or to\r\ntravel in unknown lands. Such prior right to colonise is, however,\r\nstrictly limited by the important consideration that colonisation can\r\nonly take place with the free will and consent of the savage or\r\nsemi-civilised inhabitants of the newly discovered country. In no\r\nsense does the act of discovery confer the right of property in the\r\nland, or the right of sovereignty over its people. That is to say, in\r\nthe abstract, no nation whatever can under any pretext violate the\r\nrights of any other independent nation. This was clearly the principle\r\nwhich guided those British Governments to whose lot fell the\r\nestablishment of the first colonies in America. In all these cases was\r\nthe property of the Indian tribes respected, and no land was acquired\r\nsave by purchase, or by some other equitable arrangement made with the\r\naboriginal owners.[156] Hence in the celebrated case of the Cherokee\r\ntribe against the State of Georgia, tried in 1832, before the late\r\nChief-Justice Marshall, that eminent judge was able to declare that as\r\nthe United States had only inherited its rights from Great Britain\r\nafter the War of Independence, the individual States could not assume\r\nrights greater than Britain had claimed to possess prior to that\r\nevent. No right in Cherokee lands therefore vested in the State until\r\nthe Indian title had been honourably extinguished.\r\n\r\nThis equitable principle has not always been observed between\r\nso-called civilised nations and semi-barbarous peoples, but that it\r\nhas long held a place amongst the ideals of men is suggested to us by\r\nthe Phoenician legend, that when the merchant princes of Tyre and\r\nSidon resolved to establish a trading factory on the site upon which\r\nsubsequently rose the city of Carthage, they fairly bought the land\r\nfrom the natives of Northern Africa, the area being determined by the\r\nlength of the thongs cut from a bullock's hide. Such a story, coming\r\ndown to us as it does through the hoary mists of time, may or may not\r\nappeal to our practical present-day minds, but the fact that it was\r\ncommonly told and commonly accepted amongst the ancients is at least\r\nan indication that the principles which govern the conduct of modern\r\nnations towards their less fortunate brethren are founded upon and\r\nhave the sanction of great antiquity.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to apply these principles to New Zealand it is of course\r\nnecessary to remember that the first European discoverer[157] of this\r\nDominion was not Cook, but Abel Tasman. The Dutchman's association\r\nwith the country was, however, so cursory, and his nation's subsequent\r\ninterest in it so nominal, that to the sailor it appeared only as \"a\r\ngreat land uplifted high,\" while to his countrymen it was known only\r\nas a vague scrawl upon the chart. That Tasman's discovery of 1642 gave\r\nthe Dutch a right to colonise in New Zealand had they been so disposed\r\nis undoubted; but whatever rights they had thus acquired, such were\r\nclearly exhausted by Holland's failure to assert them during the long\r\nperiod of 135 years that elapsed before Cook came to make a reality of\r\nwhat to Tasman had only been a shadow.\r\n\r\nWith his characteristic thoroughness Cook left no weak link in the\r\nclaim which he made on behalf of his nation. He landed on our shores,\r\nheld intercourse with the natives, he surveyed our coasts, he took\r\nformal possession of both Islands \"in the name, and for the use of His\r\nMajesty King George III.\"\r\n\r\n\"A philosopher perhaps might enquire on what ground Lieutenant Cook\r\ncould take formal possession of this part of New Zealand in the name\r\nand for the use of the King of Great Britain, when the country was\r\nalready inhabited, and of course belonged to those by whom it was\r\ninhabited, and whose ancestors might have resided in it for many\r\npreceding ages. To this the best answer seems to be that the\r\nLieutenant in the ceremony performed by him had no reference to the\r\noriginal inhabitants, or any intention to deprive them of their\r\nnational rights, but only to preclude the claims of further European\r\nnavigators, who under the auspices and for the benefit of their\r\nrespective States, or Kingdoms, might form pretensions to which they\r\nwere not entitled by prior discovery.\"\r\n\r\nSo wrote one of the great explorer's most friendly biographers, and in\r\nhis dispassionate review of the facts we have a correct summation of\r\nthe rights which Cook's discoveries did and did not confer upon our\r\nnation. Clearly New Zealand was not a country in which, or over which,\r\nBritain could, by Cook's act, acquire a _bona fide_ possession, for it\r\nwas inhabited by a strong and virile people, living under a system of\r\ngovernment adequate in all respects for their social and military\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nIn conferring upon New Zealand her charter of severance from New South\r\nWales in 1840 Lord John Russell thus conveyed to Captain Hobson his\r\nview of the governmental state to which the Maori had risen: \"They are\r\nnot mere wanderers over an extended surface in search of a precarious\r\nexistence; nor tribes of hunters, or of herdsmen, but a people among\r\nwhom the arts of government have made some progress; who have\r\nestablished by their own customs a division and appropriation of the\r\nsoil; who are not without some measure of agricultural skill, and a\r\ncertain subordination of ranks, with usages having the character and\r\nauthority of law.\" New Zealand then being an inhabited country and a\r\ncountry under a system of government at least so efficient as to\r\nsubsequently induce the British authorities to recognise the Maori\r\nnation as an independent State, it becomes obvious that this could not\r\nbe designated a land which could be lawfully seized upon by\r\ncircumnavigators.\r\n\r\nBut such rights as Cook's discoveries did confer upon the nation, the\r\nGovernment of that day sought to conserve. Following upon his return\r\nto England with the accounts of his travels in strange waters, his\r\ncontact with strange peoples, his finding of new lands, proclamations\r\nwere issued which were not contested by other Powers. The Dutch title\r\nto these islands was thereby lawfully extinguished, and New Zealand,\r\nVan Dieman's Land, and Australia became for geographical and\r\ncolonising purposes portions of the British Empire.\r\n\r\nA laudable effort was made to render the claims of Britain even more\r\nexplicit when in 1787 Captain Philip was appointed by Royal Commission\r\nCaptain-General and Governor-in-Chief in and over the colony of New\r\nSouth Wales and its dependencies, which were claimed to include all\r\nthe discoveries of Cook in the Southern Pacific. The territory over\r\nwhich the new Governor was authorised to exercise jurisdiction was\r\ndescribed in his Commission as extending \"from Cape York, the\r\nextremity of the coast to the northward in the latitude of 11° 37´\r\nsouth, to the South Cape, the southern extremity of the coast in the\r\nlatitude of 43° 30´ south, and inland to the westward as far as 135°\r\nof east longitude, comprehending all the islands adjacent in the\r\nPacific Ocean within the latitudes of the above-mentioned capes.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, owing doubtless to imperfect geographical knowledge on\r\nthe part of those responsible, these boundaries were but loosely\r\ndefined, for if they had been strictly adhered to, then Britain was\r\nsetting up a claim not only to Cook's valuable discoveries, but to all\r\nthe islands eastward of Australia, as far as the western coast of\r\nSouth America, embracing many Spanish discoveries; while on the other\r\nhand they excluded not only Stewart's Island, but all that part of the\r\nSouthern Island of New Zealand south of Bank's Peninsula. Governor\r\nPhilip's Commission was therefore faulty, because it asserted\r\nexcessive rights in the one direction and made insufficient claims on\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in later years these boundaries were abandoned and the\r\nposition made even more anomalous. During the Governorship of Sir\r\nThomas Brisbane it was deemed expedient to separate Van Dieman's Land\r\nfrom New South Wales, and more circumscribed limits were assigned to\r\nthe Mother State. In this readjustment, whether by accident or design\r\nit is impossible now to say, not only Van Dieman's Land but New\r\nZealand were excluded from amongst the dependencies of New South\r\nWales. Then it became an arguable point whether the word \"adjacent\"\r\nhad ever covered Islands so far distant from the parent colony, and\r\nmuch legal acumen was expended in the effort to justify the contention\r\nthat New Zealand had always been beyond the pale of the dependencies.\r\n\r\nUp to this point, however, the official mind had never been troubled\r\nby doubts as to the extent of its jurisdiction. Governor Philip not\r\nonly believed that his authority extended to New Zealand, but far\r\nbeyond it, and under this belief he actually colonised Norfolk Island\r\nas a part of the territory he had been commissioned to govern. In like\r\nmanner the British Government believed it had a right to all that it\r\nclaimed in Philip's Commission; and at the Congress of Vienna at the\r\nclose of the Napoleonic wars in 1814, when the map of Europe was\r\nrecast, it had its claims allowed, New Zealand being acknowledged by\r\nthe Great Powers to be a portion of our then infant Empire. Even\r\nearlier in the century Ministers had seriously discussed a\r\nrepresentation made by Lieutenant-Colonel Foveaux, of the New South\r\nWales Corps, to appoint a Lieutenant-Governor in New Zealand, which\r\nunder his scheme was to become a penal settlement subordinate to New\r\nSouth Wales. Fortunately for New Zealand that baneful suggestion was\r\nnot entertained; but Governor Macquarie appointed Justices of the\r\nPeace and exercised the functions of Government within the Islands, as\r\ndid his successor, Sir Thomas Brisbane, down to the time of his\r\nproclamation which excluded New Zealand from amongst the dependencies\r\nof New South Wales.\r\n\r\nThus far Britain would seem _prima facie_ to have kept alive her\r\nright to colonise in these Islands as against any other nation,\r\nexcept, perhaps, in the important particular that she had not\r\nsystematically occupied the land. It is not sufficient that discovery\r\nshould take place, or that the free will and consent of the native\r\ninhabitants should be obtained to the introduction of colonisation. It\r\nis an essential factor in the acquisition of new territory that the\r\nsanction thus secured should be followed up by speedy emigration and\r\neffective settlement, for obviously no nation could be permitted to\r\nhold idle for an indefinite period vast tracts of waste country to the\r\nexclusion of another nation to whom the inhabitants might also be\r\nwilling to concede the right to colonise. The principle upon which\r\nthis view is based has thus been stated: \"The Law of Nations, then,\r\nwill recognise the proprietary rights, and the sovereignty of a\r\nnation over only uninhabited countries which it shall have occupied\r\nreally and in fact, in which it shall have formed a settlement, or\r\nfrom which it shall be deriving an actual use.\"\r\n\r\nIn the case of inhabited countries the condition of occupation is no\r\nless exacting. It is, however, hedged about by the additional\r\nrestriction that before occupation can take place the right to settle\r\nmust be ceded by the inhabitants. Had the point ever become one of\r\nnational importance as between ourselves and France, Britain might\r\nhave pleaded that her occupation was at least as far advanced as that\r\nof her rival. She might have pointed to her Missionaries, her traders,\r\nand her whalers as evidences of an irregular settlement by no means\r\ninconsiderable. But whatever importance British jurists may have\r\nattached to such a form of occupation in the settlement of an\r\ninternational dispute, it cannot be denied that it loses much of its\r\nvalue from the fact that the settlement was irregular, and that\r\nBritish Ministers would have been put in the anomalous position of\r\ncalling to their aid a condition of society which had arisen, not with\r\nthe sanction of the Crown, but in spite of the Crown.\r\n\r\nIf these views be founded on the principles of justice, it will be\r\nseen that it is a popular fallacy to suppose that Britain acquired any\r\nrights of sovereignty in, or over New Zealand by virtue of Cook's\r\ndiscovery. Her position in 1770 was much less absolute than that, and\r\nwhatever rights she had then acquired she subsequently proceeded to\r\nabrogate. In 1817 commenced a period of renunciation during which\r\nsuccessive British Governments appeared only too anxious to absolve\r\nthemselves from all further colonial responsibilities. Not only by\r\nneglect, but by direct Act and Ordinance did they repudiate the claim\r\nto New Zealand which their predecessors had been laboriously building\r\nup through all these years. These Acts of repudiation were\r\nspecifically enumerated by Lord John Russell in the memorandum which\r\nhe prepared for Lord Palmerston in reply to the protest of the New\r\nZealand Company against the views on sovereignty adopted by Lord\r\nNormanby in his instructions to Captain Hobson, and it was the known\r\nabrogation in these statutes of whatever claim Britain may have had to\r\nNew Zealand that led to the Declaration of Maori Independence in 1835.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that this Declaration of Independence was a serious\r\nbar to Britain's colonising scheme, for under the Confederation of\r\nChiefs which grew out of it, no Government was founded stable enough\r\nto merit recognition by other established administrations. Indeed its\r\nown members were the first to acknowledge its failure in the face of\r\nthe difficulties by which it was confronted. As useless and as\r\nharmless as the \"paper pellet\" to which it has been compared by the\r\nsarcastic Gipps, it was neither government for the Maori nor a\r\ncontrolling influence for the Europeans. It was therefore not that\r\nwhich the Maori had done which created difficulty for the Melbourne\r\nCabinet when they had seriously to face the question of assuming\r\nresponsibility in New Zealand--the obstacles to be overcome had,\r\ncuriously enough, been raised by the acts of the British Parliament\r\nitself. This was why, at the critical hour, Britain stood in no better\r\nposition towards New Zealand than did any of the other nations; why\r\nshe had to run the gauntlet of their competition for sovereignty, and\r\nwhy more astute statesmanship on the part of France or the United\r\nStates might have robbed her of \"the fairest flower in all the field.\"\r\n\r\nIn bidding for the sovereignty of the country two courses were open to\r\nthe British Government--force of arms, or honourable negotiation with\r\nthe chiefs. It is not to be doubted that had Britain chosen to invade\r\nthe country, she might, by pouring her battalions into it, in course\r\nof time have overcome the tribes by the slaughter of the sword. But\r\nwho can estimate at what a cost the country would thus have been\r\nwon?--while the crime of it would have been even more awful to\r\ncontemplate than the sacrifice of blood and treasure. Happily it can\r\nnever be suggested that Lord Melbourne's Ministers had ever\r\ncontemplated such a mode of securing sovereignty. Their personal view\r\nwas that it must be ceded if it was to be acquired at all, while the\r\nHouse of Commons had made it abundantly clear that it would accept it\r\non no other terms.\r\n\r\nHere then we have the genesis of the treaty. Discovery gave us no\r\nright of sovereignty. Force of arms was incompatible with the spirit\r\nof the times; possibly beyond the resources of the nation. Negotiation\r\non the other hand had been made easy by the labours of the\r\nMissionaries, and the repeated expressions of good-will which had\r\npassed between the British Sovereigns and the chiefs. It was the line\r\nof least resistance; a mode agreeable to the national conscience, and\r\napproved by the laws of civilisation. For these all-sufficient reasons\r\nthen Captain Hobson was despatched to New Zealand, charged with the\r\nmission of securing for the British Crown the sovereignty of the\r\ncountry by the \"free and intelligent consent of the natives, according\r\nto their established usages.\"\r\n\r\nIn proceeding to an analysis of the treaty itself it will not be\r\nnecessary to refer to the preamble, which is but an abridged recital\r\nof all that has appeared in the previous chapters of this work. It\r\nasserts no principle, and is remarkable only for the fact that it\r\nreflects in dignified terms the spirit of justice and equity in which\r\nits promoters desired to approach the Maori people.\r\n\r\nIn the first clause the chiefs both within and without the\r\nConfederation were invited to \"cede to Her Majesty Queen Victoria\r\nabsolutely and without reservation all the rights and powers of\r\nsovereignty which the said Confederation or individual chiefs\r\nrespectively exercise or possess, or may be supposed to exercise or\r\npossess, over their respective territories as the sole sovereigns\r\nthereof.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been said that this was a condition which the natives never\r\ndid, and could not possibly understand, seeing that they had neither\r\nsovereignty amongst themselves, nor any word in their language to\r\nexpress the idea of sovereignty. Their tribal system, it is true, was\r\nfatal to the principle of sovereignty in its broadest sense, and until\r\nthe formation of the Confederation of Chiefs there was no force\r\namongst them capable of exercising absolute authority over any great\r\nnumber of the people, the sovereignty of each chief being limited to\r\nhis own tribe. No real sovereignty, however, vested even in the\r\nConfederation. From the first it was impotent as a national\r\nGovernment, because it lacked the requisite cohesion. Mutual tribal\r\njealousies still prevailed, making it a Confederation only in name;\r\nand so far as is known it did not pretend to exercise any sort of\r\ndominion over the people after the excitement consequent upon the\r\nadvent of Baron de Thierry had subsided. The native mind had therefore\r\nlearned nothing of what was meant by sovereignty as we understand it,\r\nfrom the union of their chiefs. All that they knew of a paramount\r\nauthority which it was their duty habitually to obey was the\r\n_mana_[158] of their personal chiefs. That they understood perfectly,\r\nand that conveyed to them all that they required to understand. Each\r\nchief was a sovereign over his own people, and the people were not so\r\nlacking in intelligence as not to perceive that the treaty meant the\r\npassing of this _mana_ from the chief to the Queen. It would, of\r\ncourse, be radically unsound to pretend that every native who signed\r\nthe treaty had perfectly grasped its provisions, and knew with even\r\nmoderate certainty what he was retaining and what he was conceding. In\r\nmany instances, particularly where the land had already been sold, it\r\nmight not be incorrect to say that some of the chiefs did not even\r\nattempt to comprehend it. The red blanket[159] or the juicy plug of\r\ntobacco was an irresistible bait to many who felt they had no longer a\r\n\"name,\" and so far as they were concerned, sovereignty and all else\r\nmight fly to the four winds so long as their personal wants and their\r\nlove of colour were gratified. The predicament in which those natives\r\nfound themselves who afterwards alleged they had signed the treaty\r\nwithout a full appreciation of its terms and its obligations was\r\npoignantly put by Paora (Paul) Tuahaere, who, speaking at the\r\nKohimarama Conference[160] in 1860, said the treaty had come \"in a\r\ntime of ignorance,\" and upbraided the elder chiefs for being caught\r\nthus unwarily. \"Blankets were brought by Mr. Williams. These I call\r\nthe bait. The fish did not know there was a hook within. He took the\r\nbait and was caught. When he came to a chief Mr. Williams presented\r\nhis hook and drew out a subject for the Queen.\"\r\n\r\nIn less figurative, but not less pointed speech, Paora was supported\r\nby Heme Parae, who declared that the only law he heard of in 1840 was\r\nthe law of God. \"As to what is called the Treaty of Waitangi, I have\r\nheard nothing about it. It is true I received one blanket from Mr.\r\nWilliams, but I did not understand what was meant by it. It was given\r\nto me without explanation by Mr. Williams and Reihana.\"\r\n\r\nTwenty-three years after the event, when discussing the mental\r\nattitude of the Maori towards the treaty, the Rev. John Warren, one of\r\nthe Wesleyan Missionaries, wrote: \"I was present at the great meeting\r\nat Waitangi when the celebrated treaty was signed, and also at a\r\nmeeting which took place subsequently on the same subject at Hokianga.\r\nThere was a great deal of talk by the natives, principally on the\r\nsubject of securing their proprietary right in the land, and their\r\npersonal liberty. Everything else they were only too happy to yield to\r\nthe Queen, as they said repeatedly, because they knew they could only\r\nbe saved from the rule of other nations by sitting under the shadow of\r\nthe Queen of England. In my hearing they frequently remarked, \"Let us\r\nbe one people. We had the Gospel from England, let us have the law\r\nfrom England.\" My impression at the time was that the natives\r\nperfectly understood that by signing the treaty they became British\r\nsubjects, and though I lived among them more than fifteen years after\r\nthat event, and often conversed with them on the subject, I never saw\r\nthe slightest reason to change my opinion. The natives were at that\r\ntime in mortal fear of the French, and justly thought they had done a\r\npretty good stroke of business when they had placed the British lion\r\nbetween themselves and the French eagle. We have heard indignation\r\nexpressed at the way in which the natives were, in the treaty,\r\noverreached by the Government, especially in the matter of securing to\r\nthe Queen the right of pre-emption in the purchase of their lands.\r\nThere is a native proverb which says, with reference to a man of great\r\nkeenness and sagacity, 'He was born with his teeth,' and in the matter\r\nof making bargains the New Zealanders may be said to be a people who\r\nwere born with their teeth. I believe it is a very long time since it\r\nwas possible to overreach the natives much in a bargain. I know that\r\ntheir particular clause of the treaty was there by their own urgent\r\nrequest, and that it met with the universal and unqualified\r\napprobation of the chiefs.\"\r\n\r\nIn adopting this view Mr. Warren is not singular, for we find that his\r\nimpression is confirmed by many equally competent authorities. It\r\nwould therefore be an undeserved reflection upon the well-established\r\nintelligence of the Maori race to suppose that these indifferents\r\nconstituted any large section of the people, there being amongst them\r\na wide comprehension of the two great principles embodied in the\r\ntreaty--that they were surrendering the magisterial control of the\r\ncountry to the Queen, and retaining the possession of the land to\r\nthemselves.[161] The speeches of its opponents were eloquent of this\r\nfact. This was what Te Kemara meant when he exclaimed, \"If thou\r\nstayest as Governor then perhaps Te Kemara will be judged and\r\ncondemned. Yes, indeed and more than that--even hung by the neck.\"\r\nThis surely was what the great Te Heuheu of Taupo meant when,\r\naddressing some natives who had signed the treaty, he said: \"You are\r\nall slaves now. Your dignity and power are gone, but mine is not. Just\r\nas there is one man in Europe, King George, so do I stand alone in New\r\nZealand; the chief over all others; the only free man left. Look at\r\nme, for I do not hide when I say I am Te Heuheu. I rule over you all\r\njust as my ancestor Tonga-Riro, the mountain of snow, stands over all\r\nthis land.\"\r\n\r\nThe forms by which our sovereignty was exercised were doubtless new\r\nand strange to them, as witness their amazement at the pains the Crown\r\ntook to prove a crime against a prisoner who had already confessed his\r\nguilt.[162] In some instances the degree of authority parted with may\r\nalso have exceeded their anticipations, for we are told that it came\r\nas a shock to some of the chiefs when they discovered that they were\r\nnot free to kill their slaves under the new regime as they had been\r\nunder the old. Failure to comprehend such details is understandable in\r\nthe peculiarity of the circumstances. Indeed complete clarity of\r\nmental vision could not have been expected, and would not have been\r\nattained in all particulars had civilised men instead of savages been\r\nconcerned. The natives, however, understood clearly enough that for\r\nthe advantages they hoped to reap from the treaty they were yielding\r\nmuch of their existing power to the _Pakeha_ Governor, and\r\nwhether it was much or little they were the more willing to surrender\r\nit because they realised that the advent of the European had so\r\naltered their social conditions that rule by the old method was no\r\nlonger possible.\r\n\r\nTo these convictions must be added the indispensable persuasions of\r\nthe Missionaries, in whose word and advice the Maoris placed implicit\r\ntrust; but the thing which proved the determining influence in the\r\nnegotiations--more than the inducements offered by the Crown, or the\r\npersuasions of the Missionaries--was that the chiefs had acquired a\r\nclear grip of the primal fact that whatever it took from them, the\r\ntreaty left them in secure possession of their lands.\r\n\r\nThe sovereignty was the shadow, the land was the substance; and since\r\nthe shadow was already passing from them by force of circumstances\r\nover which they were powerless to exercise control, they consented to\r\nits surrender with all the less regret. Once having determined upon\r\nthis course, and given effect to their determination, there was no\r\nwavering, even though in its early stages the rule of the\r\n_Pakeha_ must have clashed harshly with their ideas of individual\r\nauthority. The Maori people were a people capable of delegating their\r\nsovereign rights, and they did so delegate them. The Treaty of\r\nWaitangi therefore became what it professed to be, a yielding of the\r\nsupreme political power in the country to the British Crown,[163] and\r\nwhen the last signature had been put to it, Britain's right to\r\ncolonise and govern in New Zealand was incontestable before all the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThat is why it has always appeared to the writer that there was at the\r\ntime, and has been for many years since, much beating of the air by\r\nthe importance given to the so-called race to Akaroa, between the\r\nBritish sloop _Britomart_ and the French frigate _L'Aube_,\r\nwhen, soon after the consummation of the treaty, the sovereignty of the\r\nSouth Island was supposed to be in danger. As this incident is the\r\nleading historical event which seems to challenge the value of the\r\nclause now under review it will be convenient to discuss it here.\r\n\r\nMajor Bunbury had returned from his southern mission on July 4, and at\r\nmidnight of the 10th the French corvette, _L'Aube_, cast anchor\r\nin the Bay of Islands. From the pilot who went out to bring her in,\r\nCaptain Lavaud heard that British sovereignty had been proclaimed over\r\nthe country by Captain Hobson, and that the Union Jack was flying over\r\nhis residence as an evidence of the fact.\r\n\r\nThis was serious intelligence for the Frenchman, who saw in it a\r\ncircumstance that would render discreet a material modification of the\r\ninstructions under which he had sailed from France. He had been\r\ncommissioned to hoist the French flag at Akaroa, where a colony of his\r\ncountrymen was to be established under his protection. These\r\ninstructions had been given to him by the French Ministry in ignorance\r\nof the British Government's intentions, and Captain Lavaud now saw\r\nthat to carry them out in their strict and literal sense must\r\ninevitably plunge the two countries into a distressful and useless\r\nwar. The French Commander thus found himself in a position of great\r\ndelicacy, but fortunately he was an officer blessed with a healthy\r\nfrankness of spirit, and he lost no time in communicating to Captain\r\nHobson the real nature of his mission. So soon as he had satisfied\r\nhimself by an examination of the treaty and the proclamations that\r\nBritish sovereignty had been procured in a manner such as could be\r\napproved by other nations, and was effectual in its operation, he\r\nreadily agreed to respect the rights thus acquired without committing\r\nhimself so far as to formally acknowledge them until he should hear\r\nfurther from his own Government. At the same time he undertook, upon\r\nthe first opportunity, to communicate with his Minister, and he\r\nentertained little doubt that on his representation of the altered\r\nconditions he would be instructed to recognise British sovereignty,\r\nand honour the British flag. It is at least certain that at the\r\nconferences between the two officers, an amicable arrangement was\r\narrived at by which the French commander was able to preserve the\r\nhonour of his own flag, while avoiding the tragedy of a conflict\r\nbetween their respective countries. There is even colour for the\r\nsuggestion that the subsequent despatch of H.M.S. _Britomart_,\r\nfollowed by _L'Aube_, was only a part of a preconcerted plan, and that\r\nthe much-paraded race to Akaroa between the French corvette and the\r\nBritish sloop was not a serious contest for sovereignty, but merely a\r\nlittle piece of theatrical play, promoted for the purpose of saving\r\nthe Frenchman's face. Certain it is that before he left the Bay of\r\nIslands, Captain Lavaud had realised that it would be impossible to\r\ncarry out his instruction at Akaroa without rupturing the national\r\npeace, and he was equally determined that he would not accept the\r\nresponsibility of firing the first shot until he had been further\r\nadvised from Paris. When this is understood it is all that is\r\nnecessary to explain the conciliatory manner in which he met the\r\nBritish demands at Akaroa, and participated with our officers in the\r\npreservation of order at the southern settlement.\r\n\r\nDuring their stay at the Bay of Islands the officers of _L'Aube_\r\nwere entertained with the utmost cordiality by Captain Hobson, who in\r\nconversation with their Commander learned something of the proceedings\r\nof the Nantes-Bordelaise Company, a colonising corporation organised\r\nin France for the purpose of establishing a settlement of their own\r\ncountrymen at Banks's Peninsula, and whose vessel, the _Comte de\r\nParis_, was now within a few days' sail of the coast. In 1838 a\r\nCaptain L'Anglois, as master of a French whaler, had visited Banks's\r\nPeninsula, and there, for some articles of European manufacture valued\r\nat £6, together with some agreeable promises, had secured the\r\nsignatures of several chiefs to a deed conveying to him an estate of\r\n30,000 acres of the Peninsula's finest land.[164] This document,\r\ncomposed in French, provided the basis of a negotiation which\r\nL'Anglois arranged between two mercantile firms in Nantes, two in\r\nBordeaux, and three Parisian gentlemen, by which they agreed to\r\npromote the Nantes-Bordelaise Company whose purpose was to promote a\r\nFrench colony in New Zealand. Their project received the sanction and\r\nsupport of Louis Philippe, who undertook to sustain their enterprise\r\nby the presence of one or two ships of war in the South Pacific.\r\nMeanwhile the French King had repeatedly assured the British Foreign\r\nOffice that he had no designs towards territorial aggrandisement in\r\nNew Zealand. This, in a qualified sense, may have been perfectly true,\r\nbecause while it had been agreed that the Nantes-Bordelaise Company\r\nwas to cede certain lands to the French Crown in consideration of the\r\nprotection afforded them, there is every reason to suppose that the\r\nFrench colonising design did not extend beyond Banks's Peninsula, and\r\nthat there never was any serious intention to annex the South Island.\r\nThis position was made clear to Captain Hobson by Captain Lavaud, and\r\nif it was not secretly agreed upon as a means of strengthening the\r\nlatter's hands in making his representations to his Government, the\r\nsending of the _Britomart_ south with two Magistrates can only have\r\nbeen a precautionary measure on the part of Hobson, who hoped by this\r\nmeans to make the assurance of his former act doubly sure. It has long\r\nbeen a cherished conviction in our history that by his strategetical\r\nmove Captain Hobson cleverly outwitted the French. It is more probable\r\nthat he was acting in concert with them, and that what has hitherto\r\npassed as a popular historical fact must now be relegated to the realm\r\nof historical fiction. Be that as it may, it is a fact that on the\r\nnight of July 30, while _L'Aube_ lay at her anchors, the old and\r\nweather-worn _Britomart_ sailed for Akaroa, carrying with her\r\nMessrs. Robinson and Murphy, who were instructed to open courts at all\r\nthe settlements on the Peninsula, where the British flag was also to\r\nbe displayed by Captain Stanley. The manner in which that officer, and\r\nthose associated with him, executed their mission, is told in the\r\nCommander's Despatch, written while the Britomart was returning to the\r\nBay of Islands.\r\n\r\n   HER MAJESTY'S SHIP \"BRITOMART,\"\r\n   _September 17, 1840_.\r\n\r\n SIR--I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that I\r\n proceeded in Her Majesty's sloop under my command to the port of\r\n Akaroa, in Banks's Peninsula, where I arrived on August 10, after a\r\n very stormy passage, during which the stern-boat was washed away, and\r\n one of the quarter boats stove. The French frigate _L'Aube_ had\r\n not arrived when I anchored, nor had any French emigrants been\r\n landed. On August 11 I landed, accompanied by Messrs. Murphy and\r\n Robinson, Police Magistrates, and visited the only two parts of the\r\n Bay where there were houses. At both places the flag was hoisted, and\r\n a court, of which notice had been given the day before, was held by\r\n the Magistrates. Having received information that there were three\r\n whaling stations on the Southern side of the Peninsula the exposed\r\n positions of which afforded no anchorage for the _Britomart_, I\r\n sent Messrs. Murphy and Robinson to visit them in a whale boat. At\r\n each station the flag was hoisted and a court held. On August 15 the\r\n French frigate _L'Aube_ arrived, having been four days off the\r\n port. On the 16th the French whaler _Comte de Paris_, having on\r\n board 57 French emigrants, arrived.[165] With the exception of Mr.\r\n Bellegui, from the Jardin des Plantes, who is sent out to look after\r\n the emigrants, and who is a good botanist and mineralogist, the\r\n emigrants are all of the lower order, and include carpenters,\r\n gardeners, stone-masons, labourers, a baker, and a miner, in all 30\r\n men, 11 women, and the rest children. Captain Lavaud, on the arrival\r\n of the French emigrants, assured me on his word of honour that he\r\n would maintain the most strict neutrality between the British\r\n residents and the emigrants, and that should any difference arise\r\n between them he would settle matters impartially. Captain Lavaud also\r\n informed me that as the _Comte de Paris_ had to proceed to sea,\r\n whaling, that he would cause the emigrants to be landed in some\r\n unoccupied part of the Bay, where he pledged himself he would do\r\n nothing that could be considered as hostile to our Government; that\r\n the emigrants would merely build themselves houses for shelter, and\r\n clear away what little land they might require for gardens. Upon\r\n visiting the _Comte de Paris_ I found that she had on board, besides\r\n agricultural tools for the settlers, six long 24-pounders, mounted\r\n on field carriages. I immediately called upon Captain Lavaud to\r\n protest against the guns being landed. Captain Lavaud assured me he\r\n had been much surprised at finding the guns had been sent out in the\r\n _Comte de Paris_, but that he had already given the most positive\r\n orders that they should not be landed. On August 19 the French\r\n emigrants having landed in a sheltered, well-chosen part of the Bay,\r\n where they could not interfere with any one, I handed over to Messrs.\r\n Murphy and Robinson the instructions entrusted to me by Your\r\n Excellency to meet such a contingency. Mr. Robinson, finding that he\r\n could engage three or four Englishmen as constables, and having been\r\n enabled through the kindness of Captain Lavaud to purchase a boat\r\n from a French whaler, decided upon remaining. Captain Lavaud\r\n expressed much satisfaction when I informed him that Mr. Robinson was\r\n to remain, and immediately offered him the use of his cabin and table\r\n as long as _L'Aube_ remained at Akaroa. Mr. Robinson accepted Captain\r\n Lavaud's offer until he could establish himself on shore. On August\r\n 27 I sailed from Akaroa for Pigeon Bay, when finding no inhabitants I\r\n merely remained long enough to survey the harbour, which, though\r\n narrow and exposed to the northward, is well sheltered from every\r\n other wind and is much frequented by whalers, who procure great\r\n numbers of pigeons. From Pigeon Bay I went to Port Cooper, where Mr.\r\n Murphy held a Court; several chiefs were present, and seemed to\r\n understand and appreciate Mr. Murphy's proceedings in one or two\r\n cases that came before him. Between Port Cooper and Cloudy Bay I\r\n could hear of no anchorage whatever from the whalers who frequent the\r\n coast. I arrived at Port Nicholson on September 2, embarked Messrs.\r\n Shortland and Stuart, and sailed for the Bay of Islands on September\r\n 16.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said and written concerning this incident, and in the\r\ndiscussion it has been invested with an importance which it does not\r\ndeserve. In no sense can it rightly be elevated into the crisis of a\r\ngreat international dispute, for the simple and sufficient reason that\r\nno dispute existed. Whatever Captain Hobson may have understood as the\r\nresult of his conversation with Captain Lavaud, the amiable manner in\r\nwhich that officer complied with every request made by Captain\r\nStanley, together with his conciliatory despatch to his own immediate\r\nMinister in France, indicate that he at least had no views in the\r\ndirection of taking forcible possession of any territory in New\r\nZealand, since British sovereignty over it had been officially\r\ndeclared. The pleasure he expressed when he learned that the British\r\nMagistrate had determined to remain amongst the settlers; the ready\r\nhospitality he extended to him; his refusal to allow the master of the\r\n_Comte de Paris_ to land the artillery brought in that vessel; and his\r\npromise to do even-handed justice to both English and French should\r\ndisputes arise, were not the acts of a man who felt that he had been\r\nforestalled and worsted in a race involving the sacrifice of new\r\nterritory and the loss of national prestige.\r\n\r\nThat Captains Hobson and Lavaud understood each other perfectly is\r\nabundantly clear from the letter which the latter wrote to the former\r\nover twelve months (September 17, 1841) after the events just\r\nnarrated. In the month of October 1840 Mr. Robinson, the Magistrate\r\nstationed at Akaroa, had intimated his intention of hoisting the\r\nBritish flag, against which Captain Lavaud had successfully protested,\r\nas being, in the peculiar circumstances, calculated to inflame the\r\nprejudices of the colonists, and to destroy his influence as a keeper\r\nof the peace between his own people and the whalers. When Governor\r\nHobson paid his first official visit to Akaroa in September 1841,\r\nCaptain Lavaud interviewed him and subsequently wrote to him,\r\nexplaining the incident, and asked that his action might be sustained.\r\nDuring the course of his communication he said:\r\n\r\n You have been good enough to promise me that you will give orders to\r\n Mr. Robinson that nothing shall be changed in the already established\r\n position at Akaroa, upon which we were agreed at the Bay of Islands,\r\n until I should receive fresh instructions. I have received nothing\r\n since my arrival in New Zealand, but I learned when you arrived that\r\n the corvette _L'Allier_ was being fitted out at Brest in\r\n February last, to come to relieve me, and would consequently bring\r\n the instructions which I now await with so much impatience. This\r\n vessel must now soon arrive, and any day I ought to see it make its\r\n appearance. From the note of our _chargé d'affaires_ at London,\r\n which you were good enough to send to me, I have no doubt as to the\r\n recognition by the French Government of British sovereignty over\r\n these Islands, and that is all the more reason why I should appeal to\r\n Your Excellency to maintain the position we are in to-day, until the\r\n arrival of the vessel which will take the place of _L'Aube_ in\r\n the protection of the fisheries. My conduct at Akaroa should have\r\n sufficiently proved to the British Government that I have no idea of\r\n opposing the rights of Her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain to the\r\n sovereignty, or in any way impeding it, upon the land. There has been\r\n no act on my part, other than with the idea of maintaining order in\r\n this place, and preventing friction between the two races. It is not\r\n without some trouble and firmness that I have been able, up to the\r\n present, to maintain order and satisfy the colonists. I have told\r\n them that I have taken all the responsibility upon myself until I\r\n receive fresh instructions, and that then I would inform them\r\n definitely as to the position in which they would be placed with\r\n regard to the British Government. If so soon before the time when my\r\n promise should be fulfilled some aggressive action on the part of the\r\n British Government were to take place my honour would be seriously\r\n compromised. The authority which I exercise over my countrymen has,\r\n up to the present, been as advantageous to the interests of Great\r\n Britain as to the colonists, seeing that it has only been used for\r\n the maintenance of order. More than once I have been asked by the\r\n Magistrate appointed by Your Excellency to interfere in a quarrel\r\n between some Englishmen and the police who had been driven back and\r\n beaten by the first named. The corvette which I command, in giving\r\n its protection to the authorities, detained the law-breakers for a\r\n few days, and since it was proved that the war-ship was a protection\r\n for British authority, order has been maintained. Last October,\r\n however, this influence which has been exercised only for good by me,\r\n was on the point of being destroyed, when Mr. Robinson announced that\r\n he was going to hoist the British flag. Upon representations from me\r\n he consented to postpone these proceedings. The following were the\r\n grounds upon which I based my objection: The hoisting of the flag in\r\n the present state of affairs would add nothing to British rights, the\r\n flag having already been hoisted and saluted by the corvette\r\n _Herald_ before my arrival. The proclamations in the name of the\r\n Queen had quite another effect, as also had the acts and presence of\r\n the Magistrate to enforce the British sovereignty. Nothing on my part\r\n could have caused the English authorities to doubt in any way the\r\n purity and sincerity of my intentions, and of the arrangements\r\n between myself and Captain Stanley, to whom I promised that no arms\r\n or projectiles of war should be landed. If the British flag were to\r\n be hoisted at Akaroa so shortly before the day when I shall doubtless\r\n receive orders from my Government to recognise the British\r\n sovereignty, the authority which I exercise over my countrymen would\r\n come to an end. I should be unable to interfere in any manner\r\n whatever on land for the maintenance of peace and order. I should\r\n confine myself to my functions as captain of my ship, and should\r\n regard myself merely as the protector of my nation's subjects in case\r\n of trouble or judicial proceedings, as in the case of all foreign\r\n countries where there is no Consul. From such a state of affairs\r\n serious evils might result, and before long, so you may be assured\r\n from the experience of my fourteen months' sojourn here,\r\n consternation and disgust would take possession of the colonists;\r\n work would not be proceeded with; there would be widespread\r\n drunkenness, and most complete disorder. If on the other hand you may\r\n think fit to order Mr. Robinson to await the arrival of my\r\n instructions, which certainly cannot fail to be in agreement with the\r\n spirit of the note of our _chargé d'affaires_, in London, you will at\r\n the same time prevent the colony being placed in the undesirable\r\n position which I have shown you is possible, and you will give me the\r\n pleasure of according to your flag, the day it is hoisted, the\r\n honours which are due to it, without any disturbance taking place, as\r\n I shall inform the colonists that my Government, having recognised\r\n the Queen's sovereignty, they must, like myself, submit to the orders\r\n I have received.\r\n\r\nThis letter Captain Hobson acknowledged with becoming courtesy, and\r\npromised that as, under existing circumstances, no question could\r\narise respecting the sovereign rights of Her British Majesty over\r\nevery part of the colony of New Zealand, he would willingly forego the\r\nexhibition of any authority that could have a tendency to weaken\r\nCaptain Lavaud's influence over the minds of his countrymen. He would\r\ntherefore not display the British flag or publish any proclamation at\r\nAkaroa, unless some pressing and unforeseen event should render such\r\nmeasures necessary.[166]\r\n\r\nFortunately no such exceptional circumstances did arise before the\r\nformal acknowledgment was made by France, and in the following\r\nNovember Hobson, when penning his despatch to the Home authorities,\r\nwas able to assure them that Captain Lavaud's attitude had been\r\nconsistent throughout; that he had frankly disclaimed any national\r\nintentions on the part of his Government, but had vigilantly supported\r\nthe claims of the French emigrants as private individuals. As a matter\r\nof fact, since he had satisfied himself as to the validity of Britain's\r\npretensions, Captain Lavaud had taken up the position that he was in\r\nthese waters for no other purpose than to see his countrymen peaceably\r\nsettled on the estate of 30,000 acres to which the Nantes-Bordelaise\r\nCompany believed they had secured a title by one of those loose\r\ntransactions so common in the history of New Zealand. He was\r\ndetermined to preserve the peace until he should be instructed to make\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nBut had his intentions been other than peaceable, Captain Hobson's\r\nprecautions in sending Magistrates to Akaroa could not have made the\r\nBritish title more secure than it already was. The Treaty of Waitangi\r\nwas a compact such as no civilised nation could, or would ignore, and\r\nwhen Major Bunbury, by virtue of that treaty, hoisted the British flag\r\nat the Cloudy Bay _pa_ on June 17, 1840, he put the sovereignty\r\nin the South Island beyond all question of doubt until it could be\r\nwrested from Britain by force of arms.\r\n\r\nThe most that can be said for the sudden despatch of the _Britomart_\r\nto Akaroa, and the proceedings of her Captain and his associates\r\nthere, is that the presence of British authority on the Peninsula may\r\nhave prevented the growth of any false ideas concerning national\r\ninterests in the minds of the emigrants, and so obviated possible\r\nfriction at a later date. In no sense did it give anew to Britain a\r\nright that had already been ceded to her by the only people who were\r\ncapable of ceding it--the natives. That the official mind of France\r\nhad no delusions on this point was demonstrated during the discussion\r\nwhich engaged the Chamber of Deputies after the receipt of Captain\r\nLavaud's despatch, when M. Guizot, as Foreign Minister, maintained in\r\nthe face of the sharpest opposition that the British proclamation read\r\nat Cloudy Bay determined by the highest principles known to nations in\r\nwhom the right of sovereignty lay.\r\n\r\nIt is both interesting and instructive to observe that during this\r\ndebate M. Guizot declined to seriously discuss the proclamation issued\r\nby Captain Hobson on May 21, declaring the Queen's sovereignty over\r\nthe South Island, \"by right of discovery,\" although the point was\r\nwarmly pressed by MM. Billault and Berryer. Captain Hobson had always\r\nfavoured this mode of dealing with the South Island, he being under a\r\ngrave misapprehension both as to the number and character of the\r\nnatives residing there. Before he left England he felt that his\r\ninstructions were meagre in this regard, and in seeking more explicit\r\ndirection from the Chief Secretary of State he drew the attention of\r\nLord Normanby to what he regarded as a material distinction between\r\nBritain's position in the two Islands. In August (1839) he wrote to\r\nhis Lordship:\r\n\r\n The first paragraph (of the original instructions) relates to the\r\n acquisition of the sovereign rights by the Queen over the Islands of\r\n New Zealand. Under this head I perceive that no distinction is made\r\n between the Northern and Southern Islands, although their relations\r\n with this country, and their respective advancement towards\r\n civilisation are essentially different. The Declaration of\r\n Independence of New Zealand was signed by the United chiefs of the\r\n Northern Island only (in fact only of the Northern part of that\r\n Island) and it was to them alone that His late Majesty's letter was\r\n addressed on the presentation of their flag; and neither of these\r\n instruments had any application whatsoever to the Southern Islands.\r\n It may be of vast importance to keep this distinction in view, not as\r\n regards the natives, towards whom the same measure of justice must be\r\n dispensed, however their allegiance may have been obtained, but as it\r\n may apply to British settlers, who claim a title to property in New\r\n Zealand as in a free and independent State. I need not exemplify here\r\n the uses that may hereafter be made of this difference in their\r\n condition; but it is obvious that the power of the Crown may be\r\n exercised with much greater freedom in a country over which it\r\n possesses all the rights that are usually assumed by first discoverers,\r\n than in an adjoining State which has been recognised as free and\r\n independent. In the course of my negotiations, too, my proceedings\r\n may be greatly facilitated by availing myself of this disparity, for\r\n with the wild savages in Southern Islands, it appears scarcely\r\n possible to observe even the form of a treaty, and there I might be\r\n permitted to plant the British flag in virtue of those rights of the\r\n Crown to which I have alluded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SECTION OF THE TREATY SIGNATURES.]\r\n\r\nTo this Lord Normanby replied that Captain Hobson had correctly\r\ninterpreted his instructions when he limited his Lordship's remarks\r\nconcerning the independence of the New Zealanders to the tribes\r\ninhabiting the Northern Island. His knowledge respecting the Southern\r\nIsland was too imperfect to allow of his laying down any definite\r\ncourse of action to be pursued there. If it were really as Captain\r\nHobson supposed, uninhabited, or peopled only by a small number of\r\ntribesmen in a savage state, incapable from their ignorance of\r\nentering intelligently into any treaties with the Crown, then the\r\nceremonial of entering into any such engagements with them would be a\r\nmere illusion and pretence which ought to be avoided, and discovery\r\nmight be made the basis of the Crown's claim. Still he had a marked\r\npredilection in favour of a treaty as the only means of affording an\r\neffective protection to the natives; \"but,\" he continued, \"in my\r\ninevitable ignorance of the real state of the case I must refer the\r\ndecision in the first instance to your own discretion, aided by the\r\nadvice you will receive from the Governor of New South Wales.\"\r\n\r\nThe frankness with which Lord Normanby admitted his \"inevitable\r\nignorance\" of native conditions in the South Island is in striking\r\ncontrast to Hobson's confident assurance that they were \"wild savages\r\nwith whom it was scarcely possible to observe even the form of a\r\ntreaty,\" for at this time his intercourse with the southern tribes was\r\nas limited as that of the Chief Secretary's. Nor was his knowledge of\r\nthem any more complete when he issued his proclamation on May 21. He\r\nwas then clearly under the impression that the southern tribes were a\r\npeople physically, intellectually, and socially much inferior to those\r\nwhom he had met in the North; in fact, so much inferior that he did\r\nnot believe them capable of understanding the spirit or the letter of\r\na treaty. Such an opinion could only have been founded upon\r\ninformation conveyed to him at the Bay of Islands, and that by chiefs\r\nwho, glorying in the pride of conquest, were no doubt wont to look\r\nupon their southern enemies as the siftings of the race; as \"the\r\nremnant of their meal.\" It is therefore open to doubt whether Hobson\r\never anticipated any great measure of success when he despatched Major\r\nBunbury to the South, and it is conceivable that the results achieved\r\nby that ambassador were as pleasing to the Lieutenant-Governor as the\r\ninformation was surprising that the Southern Island and the southern\r\npeople had been much misunderstood. The falsity of the impression\r\nunder which Captain Hobson acted, together with all that had gone\r\nbefore, completely undermines the value of his proclamation of May 21,\r\nand M. Guizot was only stating the fact when in answer to his critics\r\nhe declared in the Chamber of Deputies that \"this method of taking\r\npossession (by right of discovery) has never had any serious\r\nconsequences. It could not be regarded as having constituted rights,\r\nand that is so true that the English Government has been the first to\r\nproclaim it.\"\r\n\r\nThe second clause of the treaty proved to be the storm centre of the\r\ncompact. By those natives who took the trouble to reason out the\r\npurpose and effect of the negotiation it was unanimously approved; by\r\nthe land-jobbers it was as unanimously condemned. Guaranteeing as it\r\ndid to the tribes the full and complete possession of their lands,\r\nfisheries, and forests, it complied with the one condition that made\r\nthe treaty tolerable to them; yet by reserving to the Crown the right,\r\nby pre-emption,[167] to become the medium of purchase between the\r\nnatives and the settlers, it provided the contentious point upon which\r\nall who were interested in the acquisition of land concentrated their\r\nattacks. Nor was this opposition shown merely because by a broad sweep\r\nof the pen the speculator's sphere of operations had been materially\r\nlimited for the future, but the hostility became the more vehement\r\nbecause by an equally bold assertion of a great principle of law, the\r\ntreaty called under review all that they had done in the past. The\r\nacknowledgment by the British Crown of the native title to all the\r\nland in New Zealand, whether waste or cultivated, was in the opinion\r\nof many a blunder grievous enough; but that the Crown should claim the\r\nright to scrutinise all titles which had been acquired before\r\nsovereignty was declared, was an excess of zeal which they regarded as\r\nnothing short of preposterous.\r\n\r\nThis feeling of indignation was rampant amongst those who were deeply\r\nimplicated in land speculations when the proclamations were issued at\r\nSydney and the Bay of Islands, declaring null and void all titles\r\nwhich were not derived from the Crown; and their ideas of British\r\nenterprise were even further outraged when on May 28, 1840, Sir George\r\nGipps introduced to his Legislative Council, \"A Bill[168] to empower\r\nthe Governor of New South Wales to appoint Commissioners to examine\r\nand report on claims to grants of land in New Zealand.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to the gigantic pretensions put forward by the New Zealand\r\nCompany there were 1200 claimants whose demands upon the soil of the\r\ncountry varied from a single rood to over 20,000,000 acres. Three of\r\nthese exceeded 1,000,000 acres each; three others were claiming\r\n1,500,000 acres between them; three others comprised more than 25,000\r\nacres each, while upwards of thirty persons expected to be placed in\r\npossession of more than 20,000 acres each, the aggregation of alleged\r\npurchases amounting to 45,976,000 acres. \"Some of these claimants,\"\r\nsays one writer, \"had nothing more to show for their purchases than an\r\nornamental scrawl on a deed which was so phrased as to be unintelligible\r\nto the chiefs who signed it.\" To reduce these wholesale purchases to\r\nsome principle regulated by justice was the purpose of the Government;\r\nto let the dead past bury its dead was the fervent wish of all\r\nthose who had entrenched themselves behind Maori signatures.\r\n\r\nBy the following June 25 the provisions of the Bill had been widely\r\ncirculated, on which date a spirited protest against its enactment was\r\nreceived from a number of gentlemen claiming to be landowners in the\r\nnew colony. This document, which was presented to the Legislative\r\nCouncil by Mr. H. H. Macarthur, set out that the petitioners having\r\nperused certain proclamations in the New South Wales Government\r\n_Gazette_ of January 22, as well as the Bill introduced by the\r\nGovernor, they submitted that their rights and privileges as subjects\r\nof the Queen and as landowners in New Zealand would be unwarrantably\r\nand unconstitutionally invaded by the provisions of the said measure.\r\nThey therefore prayed that they might be heard by the Council in\r\nprotest against such unjust legislation.\r\n\r\nSo reasonable a request was readily acceded to by the members of the\r\nLegislature, and on June 30 Mr. Busby, the former British Resident,\r\nMr. William Charles Wentworth, Mr. A'Beckett, and Mr. Darvall,\r\nbarristers-at-law, were introduced to the Council, and on that and\r\nseveral subsequent days addressed the members in opposition to the\r\nBill.\r\n\r\nThe burden of Mr. Busby's contention in defence of his claim to 50,000\r\nacres, including the site of a township, was that the Bill sought to\r\nlegalise confiscation, and that therefore the principles which it was\r\ndesigned to enact were at variance with and in excess of all that was\r\nsanctioned by the British constitution.[169] No doubt, he said, there\r\nwere many claims to land in New Zealand which would not bear\r\ninvestigation; but contrariwise there were many respectable settlers\r\non the banks of the rivers and shores of the harbours who would be\r\ndeeply injured were the proposed Bill to become law. This injury\r\nwould be all the more ruthless because no attempt had been made by the\r\nGovernment, now become so paternal, to prevent British subjects\r\nacquiring property in New Zealand, as had been done in the case of\r\nthose settlers who had come over from Van Dieman's land to originate\r\nthe settlement at Port Philip. No sooner did it become known that\r\nthese speculators had purchased extensive tracts of country from the\r\naborigines than a proclamation was issued declaring the illegality of\r\ntheir proceedings. No such prohibition had, however, been put upon the\r\nacquisition of property in New Zealand, where the settlers, relying\r\nupon certain acts of repudiation by the British Government, had\r\npurchased from the natives in the belief that they were negotiating\r\nwith an independent people. Mr. Busby proceeded to review the various\r\nstages of New Zealand's history in order to emphasise the events by\r\nwhich the independence of the chiefs and people had been repeatedly\r\nacknowledged, and concluded by asking why the chiefs had been induced\r\nunder the Treaty of Waitangi to surrender the pre-emptive right of\r\npurchase to the Queen if they had never had the right as an\r\nindependent people to dispose of their lands as they pleased?\r\n\r\nMr. Busby was followed by Mr. Wentworth, one of the local Magistrates,\r\nwho was claiming 100,000 acres in the North Island, and practically\r\nthe whole of the South Island except some 3,000,000 acres which he\r\nmagnanimously conceded had been already sold to other purchasers. The\r\nhistory of Mr. Wentworth's claim, which to say the least, was one of\r\nthe most scandalous in the long list of extraordinary transactions\r\nwith the natives, is thus told by Sir George Gipps in his despatch to\r\nthe Chief Secretary for the Colonies,[170] in which he intimated that\r\nin consequence of the part Mr. Wentworth had played in this flagrant\r\nattempt to flout the Government, he desired to withdraw a recommendation\r\nhe had previously made in favour of this gentleman's appointment to\r\nthe Legislative Council.\r\n\r\n \"In the month of February last\" (1840), wrote Sir George, \"seven[171]\r\n chiefs from the Middle Island of New Zealand happening to be in\r\n Sydney, it was suggested to me by the persons who had brought them\r\n here, and under whose protection they were living, that they should\r\n be invited to sign a declaration of willingness to receive Her\r\n Majesty as their sovereign, similar in effect to the declaration\r\n which Captain Hobson was then engaged in obtaining from the chiefs of\r\n the Northern Island. The chiefs in question were accordingly brought\r\n to the Government house, and, through the medium of an interpreter,\r\n the nature of the document they were required to sign was fully\r\n explained to them in the presence of myself, the Colonial Secretary,\r\n and several persons who claimed to have purchased land in the Middle\r\n Island; and amongst other things it was expressly declared to them\r\n that only such purchases of land as should be approved by Her Majesty\r\n would ultimately be confirmed. At the conclusion of this conference a\r\n present of ten sovereigns was made to each of the chiefs, and they\r\n all promised to attend on the next day but one to sign the paper\r\n which was to be prepared for them. On the day appointed, however,\r\n none of them appeared; and in reply to a message that was sent to\r\n them, a short answer was received by one of the Englishmen, under\r\n whose protection they were, that they had been advised to sign no\r\n treaty which did not contain full security for the possession by the\r\n purchasers of all lands acquired from the natives.\r\n\r\n \"It subsequently appeared that it was by the advice of Mr. Wentworth\r\n that they adopted this course of proceeding; and Mr. Wentworth, when\r\n before the Council, acknowledged that he had not only given the\r\n advice, but also that he had subsequently and after the issue of my\r\n proclamation, in conjunction with four or five persons, purchased the\r\n whole of the Middle Island (or all the unsold portion of it) from\r\n these very natives, paying them for it £200 in ready money, with a\r\n promise of a like sum as long as they should live.[172]\r\n\r\n \"Such was the origin of Mr. Wentworth's claim to twenty millions of\r\n acres in the Middle Island,\" continued Sir George, \"and it was the\r\n legality and validity of this transaction that he appeared before the\r\n Council to defend.\"\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of the property at stake naturally excited Mr. Wentworth\r\nto his most eloquent effort, and in an address of considerable length\r\nand subtlety he argued that before the proclamations issued by Sir\r\nGeorge Gipps and Captain Hobson, nullifying all titles to land not\r\nderived from the Queen, could be binding upon British subjects, they\r\nmust be founded upon some law previously existing; and if they were so\r\nfounded then it was the duty of those who had issued them to satisfy\r\nthe Council what that law was. The principle contained in the preamble\r\nof the Bill--that no chiefs, or other individuals of tribes of\r\nuncivilised savages had any right to dispose of the lands occupied by\r\nthem--was, he contended, at variance with British law and with the Law\r\nof Nations. Numerous authorities were marshalled in support of this\r\nview, and also to prove that it mattered nothing whether the New\r\nZealanders were an independent nation or only a few errant tribes\r\nscattered over the country; they still possessed the demesne of the\r\nsoil to do with as they pleased. This being so, those who purchased\r\nland from them were only acting in accordance with the natural rights\r\nof the natives and in compliance with the Law of Nations. According to\r\nVattel--one of the world's most eminent authorities upon the relation\r\nof one nation to another--individuals landing in an uninhabited\r\ncountry might not only establish colonies, but also erect a government\r\nand an empire, and he argued that if such a proceeding was permissible\r\nin an uninhabited country, it resulted _a fortiori_, that it\r\nmight be done in a country that was peopled, provided the natives of\r\nthat country gave their consent thereto. The story of the first New\r\nEngland Settlement under Davenport and others, in 1620, was urged as\r\nconclusive proof that British subjects, unsupported by a Royal\r\nCharter, might form colonies and erect governments, as had been done\r\nin Connecticut, where the government so established had lasted for\r\nover two centuries. He denied that there was any merit in the official\r\nassumption that the Crown had derived sovereignty over the Islands of\r\nNew Zealand by right of discovery. Discovery gave no right of\r\noccupation in an inhabited country, nor would the Law of Nations\r\nacknowledge the property and sovereignty of any nation unless its\r\npossession were real, unless its settlements were actual, or it had in\r\nsome way made practical use of the soil. The Bill rested upon the\r\nprinciple that the native was incompetent to sell his own land, and\r\nthe British subject was incompetent to buy--a principle which he\r\nthought he had clearly disproved. Confiscation was the key-note of the\r\nmeasure. It was a Bill designed to take away property, annul grants,\r\nand to forfeit all landed possessions acquired by British subjects in\r\nNew Zealand. He condemned the Bill absolutely, because he claimed to\r\nhave established on incontestable grounds, and by the aid of\r\nindisputable authorities, the right of British subjects to buy land\r\nfrom the New Zealanders, a right which could not be taken away until\r\nthe Council passed an Act to restrain it. Under these circumstances it\r\nwas highly illegal to proceed to divest parties of their possessions\r\nwithout adequate compensation, such as was given in England when land\r\nwas required for public purposes. The compensation to be given in such\r\ncases must always be awarded by a jury; therefore the proposed Bill\r\nwas clearly repugnant to the laws of England. Only a few days\r\npreviously the Council had passed an Ordinance, making all the laws of\r\nEngland and of the colony of New South Wales applicable to New\r\nZealand. Amongst these was the right of trial by jury of which the\r\nproposed Bill was completely subversive; it took away the right of\r\ntrial by jury; and therefore, declared Mr. Wentworth, the Council\r\ncould not pass it, or if they did, the Judges could not certify to it.\r\n\r\nThese arguments were reiterated and amplified by the two barristers,\r\nMessrs. A'Beckett and Darvell, and on July 9 their official refutation\r\nwas placed before the Council by Sir George Gipps, who on that day\r\ndelivered in reply a speech remarkable for its broad grasp of\r\nconstitutional history, as well as for its fearless declaration of the\r\nattitude adopted by the Crown. It was during the development of this\r\nsmashing rebuttal that the objectors were enlightened as to the three\r\ngreat principles of law upon which the second clause of the treaty was\r\nfounded; \"principles, which, until I heard them here controverted,\"\r\nsaid Sir George, \"I thought were fully admitted, and indeed received\r\nas political maxims.\" Briefly these were:\r\n\r\n 1. That the uncivilised inhabitants of any country have but a\r\n qualified domain over it, or a right of occupancy only; and that,\r\n until they establish amongst themselves a settled form of government,\r\n and subjudicate the ground to their own uses by the cultivation of\r\n it, they cannot grant to individuals, not of their own tribe, any\r\n portion of it, for the simple reason that they have not themselves\r\n any individual property in it.\r\n\r\n 2. That if a settlement be made in any such country by a civilised\r\n power, the right of pre-emption to the soil, or in other words, the\r\n right of extinguishing the native title, is exclusively in the\r\n Government of that power, and cannot be enjoyed by individuals\r\n without the consent of the Government.\r\n\r\n 3. That neither individuals nor bodies of men belonging to any nation\r\n can form colonies, except with the consent and under the direction\r\n and control of their own Government, and that from any settlement\r\n which they may form without the consent of their Government they may\r\n be ousted. That is, so far as British subjects are concerned, they\r\n cannot form colonies without the consent of the Crown.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to closely analyse the first of these declarations,\r\nas whatever may be said of it as a principle of law it was not in any\r\nsense applicable to New Zealand. Logicians may amuse themselves\r\ndiscussing why a people who are capable of granting titles to\r\nindividuals of their own tribes are yet incapable of granting similar\r\nrights or concessions to individuals of other nations; or how the\r\nGovernment of another nation can acquire from those natives a title to\r\nland which it has already declared the natives do not possess and have\r\nno power to give. In other words, it may form sport to the mental\r\nspeculator to discover how a Government can extinguish a native title\r\nwhich that Government has affirmed does not exist, for that is what\r\nthis declaration of principle means if it is to be invested with any\r\nmeaning at all.\r\n\r\nSuch reasoning is at this juncture foreign to our purpose, because,\r\nhowever true it may be that the native lands of New Zealand being held\r\nin common, it was not competent for individual natives to grant titles\r\nto Europeans, seeing that no individual interests had been\r\nascertained, the right of the tribes of New Zealand to dispose of\r\ntheir lands as they pleased was incontestable. As has already been\r\npointed out, they were by no means in such an uncivilised state as to\r\nbe devoid of a form of government adequate in all respects for their\r\nprimitive purposes. Especially was their occupancy and ownership of\r\nland highly systematised. It may be true that they had not\r\n\"subjudicated the ground to their own uses by the cultivation of it,\"\r\nas the term cultivation is freely understood by us, but the waste\r\nspaces were just as valuable, just as necessary to them as the garden\r\npatches. Their forests, their open plains, their wild mountain sides\r\nwere as much the sources of their food-supply as were their _kumara_\r\nfields, the streams, or the open sea, and so definitely was this\r\nunderstood amongst them that every hill and valley was known, named,\r\nand owned under one of their various tenures. There was, in fact, no\r\nside of his tribal life about which the Maori held such clear\r\nconceptions, or was so fixed and determined as the occupancy and\r\nownership of the soil, for which in olden days, as in _Pakeha_ days,\r\nhe was ever ready to fight and, if necessary, to die.\r\n\r\nIf then Sir George Gipps desired to convey to his Council the\r\nimpression that the New Zealanders were incompetent to deal with their\r\nown lands, he was setting up an entirely false hypothesis, an error\r\ninto which he was no doubt led through not being clearly seized of all\r\nthat Maori land tenure implied, the full meaning of which was\r\nafterwards to be debated on many a hard-fought field.\r\n\r\nThat the right of extinguishing the native title rested solely with\r\nthe Crown was a sounder contention, based upon principles deep set in\r\nconstitutional law, and supported by the practice of all colonising\r\nnations. It was the endeavour of Mr. Wentworth, and those associated\r\nwith him, to depreciate the principle of pre-emption by casting at it\r\nthe cheap sneer that it was \"American law,\" and so it was. But it was\r\nBritish law before it was American law, and has only been heard of in\r\nAmerican courts more frequently than in English tribunals, because\r\nquestions incidental to the settlement of the New World have called it\r\nmore frequently into prominence there. Broadly put the principle rests\r\nupon the assumption, dating from feudal times, that the King was the\r\noriginal proprietor of all the land in the kingdom, and the true and\r\nonly source of title. Therefore all valid individual titles must be\r\nderived from the Crown. With the development of constitutional\r\ngovernment the personality of the King has disappeared, but still no\r\nnation will suffer either its own subjects or the subjects of another\r\nnation to set up a title superior to its own. It has thus become a\r\nright exclusively belonging to the Government in its sovereign\r\ncapacity, to extinguish the native title to a country which it may be\r\ncolonising, \"to perfect its own domain over the soil, and to dispose\r\nof it at its own good pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nOnce admitting that the natives of New Zealand had a valid title to\r\nthe soil of the country, and were competent to deal with that title,\r\nthe prerogative of the Crown in exercising the pre-emptive right to\r\nextinguish it under the terms of an equitable treaty was not difficult\r\nto maintain. But the buttress[173] behind the attitude which the\r\nGovernment adopted towards the New Zealand land purchasers was to be\r\nfound in the third declaration of principle enunciated by Sir George\r\nGipps. Here it was laid down \"that neither individuals nor bodies of\r\nmen belonging to any nation can form colonies, except with the\r\nconsent, and under the direction and control of their own Government.\"\r\n\r\nThe fundamental reason which induces nations to hedge its subjects\r\nabout with this restriction, was thus concisely stated by the Select\r\nCommittee of the House of Commons in 1844. Although this Committee\r\nroundly condemned the Treaty of Waitangi as \"a part of a series of\r\ninjudicious proceedings,\" it was yet as hostile to the New Zealand\r\nCompany in seeking to set up a settlement independent of Imperial\r\nauthority, thereby imperilling their own position and prejudicing that\r\nof the Crown.\r\n\r\n When large numbers of British subjects have established themselves in\r\n distant regions, inhabited only by barbarous tribes, it is impossible\r\n for Her Majesty's Government to leave them exposed without protection\r\n to the dangers which their own rashness may draw down upon them, or\r\n to allow them to exercise, without control, and perhaps to abuse the\r\n power which their superior civilisation gives them over the rude\r\n natives of the soil. Hence every new establishment of this kind\r\n involves a new demand upon the naval and military resources of the\r\n Empire, but the undue anticipation of such demands must occasion a\r\n very heavy burden upon the nation, and it therefore follows that the\r\n enterprises of colonisation should only be entered upon with the\r\n sanction and under the authority of the Government.\r\n\r\nOn this ground and on this ground alone the British Government was\r\njustified in calling a halt in the irregular settlement of New\r\nZealand, and if a mistake was made it was not in that the Government\r\nnow interposed their authority,[174] but in that they had not asserted\r\ntheir rights at a much earlier period. In support of this portion of\r\nhis argument Sir George Gipps quoted the opinions of four of the most\r\neminent lawyers in England of that day, Mr. William Burgh, Mr. Thomas\r\nPemberton, Sir William Follett, and Dr. Lushington. He was even\r\nuncharitable enough to use against the New Zealand Company the opinion\r\nof their own legal adviser, Sergeant Wilde, the crushing nature of\r\nthese authorities completely breaking down the pretensions of his\r\nopponents.\r\n\r\n\"I leave the Honourable Members of this Council,\" declared Sir George,\r\n\"to say whether they will take the law from the authorities which I\r\nhave produced or from the learned gentlemen who have been heard at\r\ntheir table; remembering, moreover, that the former were giving their\r\nopinions against their clients, the latter arguing, as they were bound\r\nto do, in favour of them.\"\r\n\r\nSir George also claimed for the British Government the right to\r\nintervene in New Zealand affairs, so far as land titles were\r\nconcerned, on the ground of its immediate contiguity to the colony of\r\nNew South Wales, in support of which claim he quoted an opinion\r\nexpressed by a Committee of the House of Commons in 1837, and in\r\nfurther appeal he might have advanced the fact that in the previous\r\nfifty years Great Britain had expended no less a sum than £8,000,000\r\nupon colonisation in the South Pacific, a fact which was surely\r\nsubstantial enough to create the peculiar rights which are inseparably\r\nassociated with those intimate relations which grow out of\r\nneighbourhood. Finally, he thus summarised the powers which were\r\nsought for in his measure and those which it did not seek:\r\n\r\n The Bill, gentlemen, is not a Bill of spoliation as it has been\r\n described; it is not a Bill to destroy titles, but rather to bestow\r\n titles on persons who at present have none, and who cannot get any\r\n but from the Crown. It is not a Bill to take away any man's\r\n _tenementum_, but to give him a _tenementum_, provided he\r\n can show that he has a fair and equitable claim to it, though not\r\n indeed a _tenementum_ to any one in the lands which were\r\n purchased, or pretended to be purchased, after the issue of my\r\n proclamation and in defiance of it, for not one acre of such land\r\n shall any one ever acquire under it. Nor is it, gentlemen, a Bill to\r\n give Her Majesty any power that she does not already possess; for her\r\n power to disallow these titles is vested in her by virtue of her\r\n prerogative, and of that principle of English law which derives all\r\n landed property from the gift of the Crown. Her Majesty's prerogative\r\n in this matter is about to be exercised, not for the love of power,\r\n not for the lust of patronage, but for the good of her subjects, for\r\n which alone it is given to her; and the exercise of it in this case\r\n will be an additional proof that the prerogative is what it was\r\n elegantly described to be in the course of the pleadings in the\r\n Grenada case, of which we have heard so much, the _decus et tutamen\r\n regni_, the grace, the ornament, the safeguard, not _regis_,\r\n of the King, but _regni_, of the realm. I have not heard one\r\n reasonable and disinterested person object to the main purpose of\r\n this Bill. Of all the witnesses examined before the Committee of the\r\n House of Lords in 1838, no one was so wild as to say that all\r\n purchases from the natives of New Zealand were to be acknowledged; no\r\n one pretended, because the Narraganset Indians sold Connecticut, as\r\n we have been told they did, for a certain number of old coats and\r\n pairs of breeches, or because they sold Rhode Island (as I find they\r\n did), for a pair of spectacles, that therefore Her Majesty is bound\r\n to acknowledge as valid purchases of a similar nature in New Zealand.\r\n The witnesses to whom I have alluded all considered the New\r\n Zealanders as minors, or as wards of Chancery, incapable of managing\r\n their own affairs, and therefore entitled to the same protection as\r\n the law of England affords to persons under similar or analogous\r\n circumstances. To set aside a bargain on the ground of fraud, or of\r\n the incapacity of one of the parties to understand the nature of it,\r\n or his legal inability to execute it, is a proceeding certainly not\r\n unknown to the law of England; nor is it in any way contrary to the\r\n spirit of equity. The injustice would be in confirming any such\r\n bargain; there would indeed be no excuse for Her Majesty's advisers,\r\n if, by the exercise of her prerogative, she were to confirm lands to\r\n persons who pretend to have purchased them at the rate of 400 acres\r\n for a penny; for that is, as near as I can calculate it, the price\r\n paid by Mr. Wentworth and his associates for their twenty millions of\r\n acres in the Middle Island. A great deal was said by this gentleman,\r\n in the course of his address to the Council, of corruption and\r\n jobbery, as well as the love which men in office have for patronage.\r\n But, gentlemen, talk of corruption! talk of jobbery! Why, if all the\r\n corruption which has defiled England since the expulsion of the\r\n Stuarts was gathered into one heap, it would not make up such a sum\r\n as this; if all the jobs which have been done since the days of Sir\r\n Robert Walpole were collected into one job, they would not make so\r\n big a job as the one which Mr. Wentworth asks me to lend a hand in\r\n perpetrating; the job, that is to say, of making to him a grant of\r\n twenty millions of acres at the rate of 100 acres for a farthing! The\r\n Land Company of New South Wales has been said to be a job; one\r\n million of acres at eighteen pence per acre has been thought to be a\r\n pretty good job, but it absolutely vanishes into nothing by the side\r\n of Mr. Wentworth's job. In the course of this gentleman's argument,\r\n he quoted largely from Vattel and the Law of Nations to prove the\r\n right of independent people to sell their lands; and he piteously\r\n complained of the grievous injustice which we should do to the New\r\n Zealanders if we were to deny them the same right; and the Council\r\n may recollect that when I reminded him that he was here to maintain\r\n his own rights and not those of the New Zealanders, he replied, not\r\n unaptly, that as his was a derivative right, it was necessary for him\r\n to show that it had previously existed in the persons from whom he\r\n had derived it; it was, in fact, necessary for him to show that the\r\n right existed in the nine savages, who were lately in Sydney, to sell\r\n the Middle Island, in order to show his own right to purchase it from\r\n them at the rate of 400 acres for a penny! Lastly, gentlemen, it has\r\n been said that the principles on which this Bill is founded are\r\n derived from the times of Cortez and Pizarro--times when not only the\r\n rights of civilised nations, but the rights also of humanity, were\r\n disregarded. To this I answer, that whatever changes (and thank\r\n Heaven they are many) which the progress of religion and\r\n enlightenment have produced amongst us, they are all in favour of the\r\n savage, and not against him. It would be indeed the very height of\r\n hypocrisy in Her Majesty's Government to abstain, or pretend to\r\n abstain, for religion's sake, from despoiling these poor savages of\r\n their lands, and yet to allow them to be despoiled by individuals\r\n being subjects of Her Majesty. It is in the spirit of that\r\n enlightenment which characterises the present age, that the British\r\n Government is now about to interfere in the affairs of New Zealand.\r\n That it interferes against its will, and only under the force of\r\n circumstances, is evident from Lord Normanby's despatch; the objects\r\n for which we go to New Zealand are clearly set forth in it, and\r\n amongst the foremost is the noble one of rescuing a most interesting\r\n race of men from that fate which contact with the nations of\r\n Christendom has hitherto invariably and unhappily brought upon the\r\n uncivilised tribes of the earth. One of the gentlemen who appeared\r\n before you did not scruple to avow at this table, and before this\r\n Council, that he can imagine no motive Her Majesty's Ministers can\r\n have in desiring the acquisition of New Zealand but to increase their\r\n own patronage. The same gentleman is very probably also unable to\r\n imagine any other reason for the exercise of Her Majesty's\r\n prerogative than the oppression of her subjects. These, gentlemen,\r\n may be Mr. Wentworth's opinions. I will not insult you by supposing\r\n they are yours. You, I hope, still believe that there is such a thing\r\n as public virtue, and that integrity is not utterly banished from the\r\n bosoms of men in office. To your hands, therefore, I commit this\r\n Bill. You will, I am sure, deal with it according to your\r\n consciences, and with that independence which you ought to exercise,\r\n having due regard for the honour of the Crown and the interests of\r\n the subject; whilst for myself, in respect to this occupation of New\r\n Zealand by Her Majesty, I may, I trust, be permitted to exclaim, as\r\n did the standard-bearer of the Tenth Legion when Caesar first took\r\n possession of Great Britain, _Et ego certe officium meum Reipublicae\r\n atque Imperatori praestitero_, fearlessly alike of what people may\r\n say or think of me, I will perform my duty to the Queen and to the\r\n public.\r\n\r\nThis forceful presentation of the case for the Crown left the Council\r\nbut one course open to it, and on the following August 4 the Bill had\r\npassed through all its stages and became a colonial statute. Under\r\nits provisions Commissioners in the persons of Messrs. Francis Fisher,\r\nWilliam Lee Godfrey, and Matthew Richmond were appointed and commenced\r\ntheir investigation of land claims at the Bay of Islands. The\r\nseparation of New Zealand from the colony of New South Wales in April\r\n1841, however, put an end to the functions of the Commissioners under\r\nthe measure, and it became necessary to revive their powers under a\r\nNew Zealand statute. In his instructions covering the granting of a\r\nnew Charter to New Zealand as an independent colony, Lord John\r\nRussell, the new Chief Secretary, had sustained the attitude adopted\r\nby his predecessor, Lord Normanby, on the land question. Accordingly,\r\non June 9, 1841, under advice from Lord John, an ordinance was passed\r\nby the Legislative Council assembled at Auckland, repealing the\r\nprevious Act of New South Wales and furnishing Captain Hobson, the now\r\nGovernor of New Zealand, with the requisite power to appoint their\r\nsuccessors. Intelligence had also been received in the meantime that\r\nMr. Spain, an English lawyer, had been appointed Chief Commissioner of\r\nland claims; and under the New Zealand statute only two of the\r\noriginal Commissioners were reappointed, Mr. Fisher having accepted\r\nthe office of Attorney-General to the colony.\r\n\r\nWith the deliberations and adjustments of this Commission we are not\r\nparticularly concerned. What is of importance is that its proceedings\r\nled to a voluminous, and at times acrimonious correspondence between\r\nthe New Zealand Company and Lord Stanley, who, in 1841, succeeded Lord\r\nJohn Russell as Secretary of State for the Colonies in Sir Robert\r\nPeel's cabinet. During the course of this correspondence the Company\r\nboldly maintained that, under an arrangement made with his\r\npredecessor,[175] they were so situated as to be beyond the pale of\r\nthe Commission's enquiries which they said would shake every title in\r\ntheir settlements. They declared that the circumstances in which they\r\nhad acquired the land they were now claiming were such as could not be\r\naffected by the Treaty of Waitangi, they even repudiated the validity\r\nof the treaty itself. On January 24, 1843, Mr. Joseph Somes, as\r\nGovernor of the Company, despatched that celebrated letter to Lord\r\nStanley in which occurred this significant passage: \"We have always\r\nhad very serious doubts whether the Treaty of Waitangi, made with\r\nnaked savages by a Consul invested with no plenipotentiary powers,\r\nwithout ratification by the Crown, could be treated by lawyers as\r\nanything but a praiseworthy device for amusing and pacifying savages\r\nfor the moment.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of the following month a further letter was received from\r\nMr. Somes, in which he specifically denied the application of the\r\ntreaty to the particular possessions of the Company; and in order to\r\ngive a verisimilitude of truth to his argument deliberately made light\r\nof the historical facts connected with the signing of the treaty:\r\n\r\n \"We have not,\" he wrote, \"thought proper, hitherto, to advert to the\r\n Treaty of Waitangi except incidentally. But as we observe that it has\r\n occasionally been dwelt upon by your Lordship as being of some\r\n importance to the view taken by you in opposition to our claims, it\r\n is well that we should not quit the subject without remarking that\r\n your Lordship appears always to speak of that treaty as bearing on\r\n the entire claim of the Company. Now, your Lordship ought to be\r\n apprised of the fact that the Treaty of Waitangi itself applies to no\r\n part of the vast extent of country over which we claim the right of\r\n selection. The chiefs who signed the treaty neither could, nor did,\r\n pretend to cede anything but the northern corner of the Northern\r\n Island. Subsequently, it is true, Captain Hobson procured the\r\n accession to the treaty of chiefs further south. But the alleged\r\n accession of the chiefs within the limits of the Company's\r\n possessions in the Northern Island rests merely on evidence far too\r\n slight and loose to be taken as establishing a fact of such grave\r\n public character; at any rate, half at least of the 20,000,000\r\n affected by our claim lie in the Middle (South) Island; and the\r\n Middle and Stewart's Islands, it is obvious, cannot be affected by\r\n the Treaty of Waitangi, inasmuch as Her Majesty's title to them was\r\n 'asserted' on the grounds of discovery without pretence to any treaty\r\n or cession.\"\r\n\r\nThis attempt to mislead the Minister by a flagrant disregard for the\r\nproceedings of Major Bunbury and all that those proceedings implied,\r\nwas unfortunately but too characteristic of the methods pursued by the\r\nCompany at this time, whose officers had now developed a dexterity in\r\nconjuring with facts against the subtlety of which the Minister could\r\nnot too jealously guard the public interests.\r\n\r\nTo the equivocal attitude adopted by the Company Lord Stanley replied\r\nthrough his Under-Secretary, Mr. Hope, in one of the noblest passages\r\never penned by a British Minister,--a passage in which he sternly\r\nrefused to sacrifice official integrity to mere commercialism or\r\nnational honour to ambitious personal ends:\r\n\r\n \"Lord Stanley,\" wrote Mr. Hope, \"is not prepared, as Her Majesty's\r\n Secretary of State, to join with the New Zealand Company in setting\r\n aside the Treaty of Waitangi, after obtaining the advantages\r\n guaranteed by it, even though it might be made with 'naked savages,'\r\n or though it might be treated by lawyers as 'a praiseworthy device\r\n for amusing and pacifying savages for the moment.' Lord Stanley\r\n entertains a different view of the respect due to the obligations\r\n contracted by the Crown of England, and his final answer to the\r\n demands of the New Zealand Company must be that, so long as he has\r\n the honour of serving the Crown, he will not admit that any person,\r\n or any Government acting in the name of Her Majesty, can contract a\r\n legal, moral, or honorary obligation to despoil others of their\r\n lawful and equitable rights.\"\r\n\r\nFoiled in their efforts to induce the Colonial Minister to award them\r\nthe full measure of their enormous claim without question or enquiry,\r\nthe Company then preferred a claim for compensation against the State\r\non the grounds that the policy of the Colonial Office and the\r\nproceedings of the Government in New Zealand had brought them to the\r\nverge of financial ruin. Still powerful in the House of Commons they\r\nwere able to exert considerable influence there, and in April 1844 a\r\nSelect Committee was set up, with Lord Howick, now one of the\r\nCompany's warmest friends, as Chairman, and an order of reference\r\nwhich authorised them \"to enquire into the State of the Colony of New\r\nZealand, and into the proceedings of the New Zealand Company.\"\r\n\r\nThe Committee sat until July, taking voluminous evidence from many\r\npersons who had some previous knowledge of the country, and when they\r\nmet to formulate their report it was found that they were sharply\r\ndivided on material points. A section of the Committee, led by Messrs.\r\nCardwell and Hope, Lord Stanley's Under-Secretary, endeavoured to so\r\nframe the report as to make amongst others the following acknowledgments:\r\n\r\n That from the time of the discovery by Captain Cook to the beginning\r\n of the year 1840, the independence of New Zealand had never been\r\n questioned by this country, and in 1832 was recognised by the British\r\n Government in a very peculiar and formal manner.\r\n\r\n That the urgent applications made by private individuals from time to\r\n time to the Colonial Office for the adoption of these islands as a\r\n British colony, were reluctantly acceded to by the British Government\r\n in 1839, with a view to preventing the evils arising and apprehended\r\n from irregular and unauthorised settlement.\r\n\r\n That this adoption was effected in the early part of 1840 by an\r\n agreement called the Treaty of Waitangi, made by Captain Hobson with\r\n upwards of 500 chiefs and other natives, claiming and admitted on the\r\n part of this country, to represent the whole population, so far as\r\n regarded the Northern Island; while the other islands, which\r\n contained no population capable of entering into anything resembling\r\n a civil contract, were assumed to the British Crown by the right and\r\n title of discovery.[176]\r\n\r\n That this treaty was made by Captain Hobson in pursuance of\r\n instructions previously received from Home, and that his proceedings\r\n obtained the subsequent approbation of the Government.\r\n\r\n That the natives ceded to the Queen the sovereignty of the Northern\r\n Island, and the Crown secured, in return, to the chiefs and tribes of\r\n New Zealand, and to the respective families and individuals thereof,\r\n the full, exclusive, and undisturbed possession of their lands and\r\n estates, forests, fisheries, and other properties, which they may\r\n collectively and individually possess, so long as it is their wish\r\n and desire to retain the same in their possession.\r\n\r\n That this treaty is binding, in conscience and policy, on the British\r\n Government and is highly valued by the native tribes.\r\n\r\n That although the laws and usages of the natives with regard to the\r\n possession of and title to land are very obscure and complicated, yet\r\n evidence has been adduced to the Committee showing that these laws\r\n and usages are in some sense recognised by the natives, as well among\r\n themselves as in reference to European purchasers, and many instances\r\n have been proved in which they have voluntarily and fully recognised\r\n European titles.\r\n\r\n That while it appears highly probable that much of the soil of New\r\n Zealand will ultimately rest in the British Crown, as land to which\r\n no proprietary title of any kind can be established by an individual,\r\n or by any tribe, yet it is impossible, by any fair construction of\r\n the treaty, to limit the native claims either to the _pas_ or to\r\n the grounds in actual cultivation by the natives at any particular\r\n time.\r\n\r\n That any attempt to carry out in practice any such construction must\r\n alienate the natives from every feeling either of confidence or\r\n affection towards the British Government, and would probably lead to\r\n conflicts of a sanguinary character, or even to an exterminating\r\n warfare between the races, for which the British power in these\r\n Islands is at present wholly inadequate and unprepared.\r\n\r\n That it is not expedient to increase the military force in the\r\n colony, at great expense, for a purpose unjust in itself, and tending\r\n to retard the peaceful settlement of the colony and the civilisation\r\n of the native race.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPTAIN HOBSON'S SIGNATURES TO THE TREATY.\r\n\r\nThese signatures to the various copies of the Treaty used indicate in\r\na pathetic way the progress of Captain Hobson's illness. The final\r\ncopy he was not able to sign, and it was signed by Lieut. Shortland on\r\nhis behalf.]\r\n\r\nThese recommendations of Mr. Cardwell, which also largely reflected\r\nthe opinions of the Government, were energetically opposed by Lord\r\nHowick and his friends, who put forward a counter series of\r\nsuggestions, which just as strongly reflected the views and\r\naspirations of the New Zealand Company, particularly upon the crucial\r\npoint that no acknowledgment should be made of any proprietary rights\r\non the part of the natives in the unoccupied lands of New Zealand.\r\nThey affirmed amongst other things:\r\n\r\n 1. That the conclusion of the Treaty of Waitangi by Captain Hobson\r\n with certain natives of New Zealand, was a part of a series of\r\n injudicious proceedings which had commenced several years previous to\r\n his assumption of the local Government.\r\n\r\n 2. That the acknowledgment by the local authorities of a right of\r\n property on the part of the natives of New Zealand in all wild lands\r\n in those Islands, after the sovereignty had been assumed by Her\r\n Majesty, was not essential to the true construction of the \"Treaty of\r\n Waitangi,\" and was an error which has been productive of very\r\n injurious consequences.\r\n\r\n 3. That means ought forthwith to be adopted for establishing the\r\n exclusive title of the Crown to all land not actually occupied and\r\n enjoyed by natives or held under grants from the Crown, such lands to\r\n be considered as vested in the Crown for the purpose of being\r\n employed in the manner most conducive to the welfare of the\r\n inhabitants, whether natives or Europeans.\r\n\r\nWhen the Committee was asked to determine which of these two rival\r\nreports it would adopt, it was found that opinion was evenly divided,\r\nbut on a division being taken Lord Howick succeeded in defeating his\r\nopponents by the narrow majority of one vote, the voting being as\r\nfollows upon the question proposed by Mr. Roebuck: \"That the Committee\r\nnow proceed to the consideration of the resolutions proposed by the\r\nchairman as the basis of the report.\"\r\n\r\n  Ayes--7.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Milnes.\r\n  Mr. Roebuck.\r\n  Mr. Hawes.\r\n  Mr. Aglionby.\r\n  Mr. Charteris.\r\n  Lord Francis Egerton.\r\n  Lord Ebrington.\r\n\r\n  Noes--6.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Hope.\r\n  Mr. R. Clive.\r\n  Mr. Cardwell.\r\n  Lord Jocelyn.\r\n  Sir Robert Inglis.\r\n  Mr. Wilson Patten.\r\n\r\nIn vain did Mr. Hope endeavour by moving amendments to induce the\r\nCommittee to adopt a view of the Treaty of Waitangi more favourable to\r\nthe natives, but through the divisions of several days the Company\r\nheld its majority, and on July 23 the Committee agreed to the draft\r\nreport proposed by Lord Howick, and which was based on the resolutions\r\npreviously approved. When this report was laid before the House of\r\nCommons it was found that the Committee had traversed the policy\r\nadhered to by the Melbourne and the Peel Governments in its\r\ninterpretation of the Treaty of Waitangi, and that they had taken the\r\nresponsibility of declaring that:\r\n\r\n The evidence laid before your Committee has led them to the conclusion\r\n that the step thus taken (the promotion of the Treaty of Waitangi),\r\n though a natural consequence of previous errors of policy, was a\r\n wrong one. It would have been much better if no formal treaty\r\n whatever had been made, since it is clear that the natives were\r\n incapable of comprehending the real force and meaning of such a\r\n transaction, and it therefore amounted to little more than a legal\r\n fiction, though it has already in practice proved to be a very\r\n inconvenient one, and is likely to be still more so hereafter. The\r\n sovereignty over the Northern Island might have been at once assumed\r\n without this mere nominal treaty, on the ground of prior discovery,\r\n and on that of the absolute necessity of establishing the authority\r\n of the British Crown for the protection of the natives themselves,\r\n when so large a number of British subjects had irregularly settled\r\n themselves in these Islands, as to make it indispensable to provide\r\n some means of maintaining good order amongst them. This was the\r\n course actually pursued with respect to the Middle and Southern\r\n Islands, to which the Treaty of Waitangi does not even nominally\r\n extend, and there is every reason to presume that, owing to the\r\n strong desire the natives are admitted to have entertained for the\r\n security to be derived from the protection of the British Government\r\n and for the advantages of a safe and well-regulated intercourse with\r\n a civilised people, there would have been no greater difficulty in\r\n obtaining their acquiescence in the assumption of sovereignty than in\r\n gaining their consent to the conclusion of the treaty, while the\r\n treaty has been attended with the double disadvantage: first, that\r\n its terms are ambiguous, and in the sense in which they have been\r\n understood highly inconvenient; and next, that it has created a doubt\r\n which could not otherwise have existed, which, though not in the\r\n opinion of your Committee well founded, has been felt and has\r\n practically been attended with very injurious results, whether those\r\n tribes which were not parties to it are even now subject to the\r\n authority of the Crown.\r\n\r\n Your Committee have observed that the terms of the treaty are\r\n ambiguous, and in the sense in which they have been understood, have\r\n been highly inconvenient; in this we refer principally to the\r\n stipulations it contains with respect to the right of property in\r\n land. The information that has been laid before us shows that these\r\n stipulations, and the subsequent proceedings of the Governor,\r\n founded upon them, have firmly established in the minds of the\r\n natives notions which they had but then very recently been taught to\r\n entertain, of their having a proprietary title of great value to land\r\n not actually occupied, and there is every reason to believe that, if\r\n a decided course had at that time been adopted, it would not have\r\n then been difficult to have made the natives understand that, while\r\n they were to be secured in the undisturbed enjoyment of the land they\r\n actually occupied, and of whatever further quantity they might really\r\n want for their own use, all the unoccupied territory of the Islands\r\n was to vest in the Crown by virtue of the sovereignty that had been\r\n assumed.\r\n\r\nThe findings of the Committee were thus so radically opposed to the\r\nestablished views of Lord Stanley upon the construction to be placed\r\nupon the treaty, that the Minister refused to countenance them in any\r\nway, or to ask the House of Commons to become a party to a policy\r\nwhich, had it been enforced, would inevitably have led Britain into\r\none of her little wars, as inglorious as it would have been unjust.[177]\r\n\r\nIn transmitting a copy of the Committee's report to Governor Fitzroy,\r\nthe Chief Secretary stressed in his Despatch of August 13 (1844) the\r\nnarrow margin of votes by which the report had been adopted, and\r\nemphasised the high moral principle that it was still the duty of both\r\nthe Governor and himself to administer the affairs of the colony \"with\r\na due regard to a state of things which we find, but did not create,\r\nand to the expectations founded, not upon what might have been a right\r\ntheory of colonisation, but upon declarations and concessions made in\r\nthe name of the Sovereign of England.\" The power of Parliament was,\r\ntherefore, not invoked to aid the Company in evading its just\r\nobligations to the natives. Their land claims were still to be the\r\nsubject of searching enquiry by the Chief Commissioner, Mr. Spain, and\r\nfor the moment the Treaty of Waitangi was vindicated by the\r\nsteadfastness of the Colonial Minister. But the battle was not\r\nover, the scene of the conflict only was changed. On June 17, 1845,\r\nMr. Charles Buller, then representing Liskeard, and whose long\r\nassociation with Lord Durham and Mr. Gibbon Wakefield had more than\r\nonce brought him into prominence in New Zealand affairs, sought to\r\ninduce the Commons again to discuss both the policy and administration\r\nof the colony on the floor of the House. Then ensued the historic\r\ndebate, during which New Zealand achieved the distinction of claiming\r\nthe exclusive attention of Parliament for three consecutive nights.\r\n\r\nIt would be superfluous to recapitulate here the speeches delivered\r\nduring this memorable discussion, embodied as they are in the records\r\nof the nation; it is, however, worthy of passing remark that for the\r\nsake of some party advantage several prominent members, notably Lord\r\nJohn Russell, chose to reverse all their previous professions on the\r\nsubject of the Treaty of Waitangi, and threw the weight of their\r\ninfluence into the scale against the just recognition of the rights of\r\nthe New Zealand natives. Well might Rusden exclaim: \"On what plea\r\ncould the Whigs abandon the construction put upon the treaty by their\r\nown leaders who made it?\"\r\n\r\nA division being taken, Mr. Buller's motion was defeated, and on\r\nreceipt of this intelligence Governor Fitzroy[178] wrote with\r\nperfectly natural elation to Henry Williams: \"Let me congratulate you\r\non the result of the three nights' sharp debate in the House of\r\nCommons on New Zealand. The Company were beaten by fifty-one votes,\r\nthe integrity of the Treaty of Waitangi being thus secured against all\r\ntheir infamous endeavours, for _that_ was the point at issue.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the events thus far narrated in this chapter had been evolving\r\nfrom the lap of time, Governor Hobson had died,[179] and had been\r\nburied at Auckland. Lieutenant Shortland's brief term of\r\nadministration had been darkened by the Wairau Massacre, the first\r\nfruit of the contempt shown by the Wakefields for the landed rights of\r\nthe natives. His successor, Governor Fitzroy, had long since been\r\ndriven to distraction by the machinations of the Company and the\r\nfailure of the Home authorities to give him needful support in either\r\nmen or money. The crowning disaster of his administration was the\r\nattack upon the town of Kororareka at daylight on March 11, 1845, by\r\nHeke and Kawiti. The House of Commons had been ignorant of this\r\nhappening when it had debated Mr. Buller's motion in the previous\r\nJune, but when the ominous tidings reached England in July, that wary\r\ngentleman sprang once more alertly to the attack by moving: \"That this\r\nHouse regards with regret and apprehension the state of affairs in New\r\nZealand; and that those feelings are greatly aggravated by the want of\r\nany sufficient evidence of a change in the policy which has led to\r\nsuch disastrous results.\"\r\n\r\nThis debate was not less acrimonious than its predecessor, for not\r\nonly was Lord Stanley attacked, but Mr. Stephen, the permanent head of\r\nthe Colonial Department, was assailed with equal virulence. Stanley\r\nhad ere this removed to the House of Lords, and Stephen was precluded\r\nby virtue of his position from defending himself. But for these two\r\nmen, as well as for the honour of the nation, Sir Robert Peel stood in\r\nstalwart defence. He told the House that he was not enamoured of the\r\npolicy which had resulted in the consummation of the Treaty of\r\nWaitangi. For his part he candidly admitted that in his opinion it was\r\na mistake, but since the treaty was an indisputable political fact,\r\nits obligations must not be violated. Lord Melbourne's Government, he\r\nsaid, had with a full sense of their responsibility, entered into the\r\ncompact and England was unquestionably bound by it.[180]\r\n\r\nIn vindication of Lord Stanley he declared that the real purpose\r\nbehind Mr. Buller's motion was an insidious desire to unjustly censure\r\nhis Minister for avowing his determination to carry honourably into\r\neffect the treaty made by his predecessor. Then reverting to the land\r\nquestion he continued: \"After all the volumes of controversy which\r\nhave appeared, the question really resolves itself into this: Shall\r\nthe Government undertake to guarantee in this country, within certain\r\nlimits in New Zealand, a certain amount of land without reference to\r\nthe rights to that land vesting in the natives? This I tell you\r\ndistinctly we will not do, and if the House entertains a different\r\nopinion, it is but right that it should give expression to it. We will\r\nnot undertake, in the absence of surveys and local information as to\r\nthe claims of the natives, to assign to you a million, or any other\r\nnumber of acres, and dispossess the natives by the sword.\"\r\n\r\nIn concluding he again entered upon a vigorous defence of his Colonial\r\nMinister, declaring his continued confidence in Lord Stanley in the\r\nfollowing resolute words: \"I will not do that which the New Zealand\r\nCompany seem to think I might do--undertake to supersede a Minister\r\nwho I believe has discharged his official duties with almost\r\nunexampled ability, and with a sincere desire to promote the interests\r\nof every colony over which he now presides.\"\r\n\r\nInfluenced by the Premier's strenuous advocacy, the House again\r\nrejected Mr. Buller's motion on July 23, but the friends of the\r\nCompany derived some comfort from the knowledge that a despatch had\r\nbeen sent recalling Governor Fitzroy, who, in his anxiety to restore\r\nthe bankrupt finances of the country, had disregarded the Royal\r\ninstructions, and instituted a local currency as well as having taken\r\nthe more serious responsibility of varying the inflexible policy of\r\nthe Government by waiving the pre-emptive right of the Crown[181] to\r\npurchase land from the natives, in the hope of removing the growing\r\ndiscontent and of enhancing the revenue from increasing sales.\r\n\r\nDefeated in Parliament, the Company's next proceeding was almost\r\nhumorous in its hysteria. They procured an opinion from Mr. William\r\nBurge, in which that gentleman averred, on his reputation as a lawyer,\r\nthat the British occupation of New Zealand was from the beginning\r\nunlawful, and based upon no sound constitutional foundation. This\r\nremarkable document they transmitted to Lord Stanley on July 7, in the\r\nhope that he would be so awed by it as to cause him to considerably\r\nmodify the instructions which they were convinced he would, in his\r\nnormal frame of mind, most certainly tender to Captain Grey, whom he\r\nhad selected to succeed Governor Fitzroy. Lord Stanley was made of\r\ndifferent stuff. He suffered no particular trepidation from Mr.\r\nBurge's startling discovery, but merely sent his opinion on to Fitzroy\r\nKelly, Attorney-General, Sir Frederick Thesiger, Solicitor-General,\r\nand to Sir Thomas Wilde, who had been the Attorney-General in Lord\r\nMelbourne's Cabinet when Captain Hobson was sent out to negotiate the\r\nTreaty of Waitangi. These gentlemen averred with equal confidence that\r\nneither the reasons advanced by Mr. Burge, nor any other considerations\r\nwhich had occurred to them, furnished them with any well-founded doubt\r\nupon the question of Britain's sovereignty in New Zealand.\r\n\r\nReinforced by the opinion of this eminent trio, Lord Stanley sent a\r\ncopy to the new Governor, telling him to be guided by it in his\r\nconduct, at the same time instructing him that if the Company\r\nattempted to make capital in the colony out of Mr. Burge's\r\npronouncement, he was to counter the move by giving equal publicity to\r\nthe joint opinion of the three legal advisers of the Crown.\r\n\r\nWhen Captain Grey reached New Zealand on November 14, he found the\r\ncountry seething with discontent. The European population now numbered\r\napproximately 12,000, scattered over widely separated settlements, the\r\nnatives probably numbered not less than 110,000, many of whom were in\r\nopen revolt under Heke and Kawiti; many more were holding their\r\nallegiance in the balance.\r\n\r\nThe mischievous resolutions passed by the Select Committee of the\r\nHouse of Commons in the previous year had ere this percolated to the\r\ncolony, and fired the doubts of the natives as to the sincerity of the\r\nCrown. Governor Fitzroy had used his best endeavours to reassure them,\r\nand in offering terms of peace to Heke he made it the first stipulation\r\nthat the covenants of the Treaty of Waitangi should be binding upon\r\nboth parties. To these advances Heke had sullenly refused to reply.\r\nWith the rebels unyielding, obviously Grey's first duty was to\r\nascertain where he stood with the friendlies and the neutrals. For\r\nthis purpose he summoned a meeting at the Bay of Islands, and amidst\r\nthe ruins of the wrecked town of Kororareka he delivered to the\r\nassembled chiefs one of his characteristic addresses, in which, after\r\nwarning the people against treacherously assisting the rebels, he said:\r\n\r\n In the meantime, I assure the whole of the chiefs that it is the\r\n intention of the Government, most punctually and scrupulously to\r\n fulfil the terms and provisions of the treaty which was signed at\r\n Waitangi on the arrival of Governor Hobson. I have heard that some\r\n persons, evil disposed both towards the Queen of England and the\r\n Chiefs of this country, have told you that by your signing that paper\r\n you lost your lands. This I deny. By that treaty the protection of\r\n the Queen and your possessions are made sure to you. Your lands shall\r\n certainly not be taken from you without your consent. You can sell\r\n your lands to the Crown, or not sell them, just as you think proper,\r\n but, remember, that when once you do sell them, they must be promptly\r\n and justly given up.\r\n\r\nThe professions of the Government's good-will to the natives were\r\nrenewed, they were told of the Queen's solicitation for their material,\r\nmoral, and religious welfare, and once more assurances were given that\r\nequal justice would be meted out to both Maori and European, to which\r\nTamati Waaka Nēne replied: \"It is just.\"\r\n\r\nAs the result of this conference Grey felt that he could rely upon the\r\nloyalty of the friendly natives, and that this adhesion to the Crown\r\ngrew out of the fact that they were, as the Governor expressed it in\r\nhis Despatch, \"Unanimous in desiring protection and support from the\r\nGovernment; that they were quite aware of the advantages conferred\r\nupon them by the annexation of New Zealand to the British Empire, and\r\nthat the large mass of the inhabitants sincerely desired to see peace\r\nand tranquillity restored, so that the Government might be invested\r\nwith that weight and authority which is essentially necessary to\r\nenable it properly to perform its functions.\"[182]\r\n\r\nWith the position of parties both in England and in the colony thus\r\nfirmly determined, it appeared that the Treaty of Waitangi would now\r\nbe accepted as the basis of a settlement of the colony's affairs; but\r\nthese sanguine expectations were speedily doomed to disappointment. By\r\none of those inexplicable revolutions which not infrequently occur in\r\nthe wheel of political fortune, Sir Robert Peel's Ministry was ousted\r\nfrom office in the latter part of June. Lord John Russell came back to\r\npower, and Lord Howick, who in the meantime had succeeded his father\r\nas Earl Grey, became Chief Secretary for the Colonies in the new\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nAs Lord John Russell had so recently modified his views upon the\r\nsubject of the Treaty of Waitangi as to admit of his saying that Maori\r\nrights in land narrowed down to territory \"in actual occupation by\r\nthem,\" the way had been cleared by which his Secretary for the\r\nColonies might put into operation his pet theories for the\r\nnullification of the Treaty of Waitangi.[183] This opportunity came to\r\nhim when it fell to his lot to prepare a new Constitution for the\r\nyoungest of Britain's possessions.\r\n\r\nNew Zealand had now been a colony independent of New South Wales for\r\nthe better part of five years, during which time, under the advantages\r\nof a more or less settled government, she had made phenomenal\r\nprogress. So rapid had been her development, so steadily had her\r\npopulation increased, that in the opinion of many of her most\r\ninfluential Colonists the time had arrived when they should be\r\ninvested with all the privileges of responsible government. With this\r\ndemocratic movement the Governor was in entire sympathy and aided the\r\naspirations of the people by the weight of his influence. The implicit\r\nconfidence which the Home authorities at this period placed in Grey's\r\ndiscretion doubtless led them to more readily acquiesce in the\r\nliberalisation of the Charter granted in 1840, and in conveying to the\r\nGovernor the determination of Parliament, the Colonial Secretary\r\nexplained that the necessity of a fundamental change from the position\r\ncreated when Captain Hobson was appointed had been insisted on by all\r\nparties to the discussion, there being an almost equally unanimous\r\nconcurrence among them that the change should be in the direction of\r\ncalling the settlers to participate much more largely in the business\r\nof legislation and local self-government. He accordingly enclosed on\r\nDecember 23 (1846) the Imperial Act, and the Royal Instructions which\r\nwere to give effect to this determination.\r\n\r\nThe functions of a governor in a Crown Colony are many and various,\r\nand Grey's receipt of this Despatch was perhaps as picturesque as any\r\nevent in his romantic life. There was insurrection at Whanganui--a\r\nreflex of Heke's rebellion in the north--whither Grey had gone to aid\r\nin its quelling, and he was watching from a hill-side a skirmish\r\nbetween the troops and the insurgents when the Chief Secretary's\r\ncommunication was handed to him. He sat down upon the grassy bank, and\r\nwith the crack of rifles and the hiss of bullets ringing in his ears\r\nhe calmly read the fateful document. What the Governor's feelings were\r\nwhen he perused the Charter we need not stay to enquire. Fortunately\r\nhe had been given a discretionary power as to when it should take\r\neffect, and he did not wait long before he determined that its\r\nindefinite suspension was inevitable. Grey's brief experience in New\r\nZealand, as well as his innate love of justice, had taught him to\r\nregard the Treaty of Waitangi as the sheet-anchor of the colony's\r\nsettlement, upon the faithful observance of which it was alone\r\npossible to maintain peace with the Maori.\r\n\r\nIn two vital particulars the new Charter fatally traversed the treaty,\r\nand one can only marvel, in the face of the obvious meaning which\r\nattaches to the plain words of the compact, how any British Minister\r\ncould satisfy himself with the sophistry indulged in by the Colonial\r\nSecretary. A cardinal omission was detected by the Governor in the\r\nfact that no provision was made for the representation of the Maori\r\nrace in the contemplated Parliament, to which, as British subjects,\r\nthey were entitled; but worse than all, Earl Grey had again\r\npromulgated his strangely perverted opinions upon the subject of\r\nnative ownership of lands. The Charter was covered by a lengthy\r\nDespatch in which the Chief Secretary elaborated his views, and in\r\norder that those views may not suffer by condensation they are here\r\nquoted at length. After adverting to the manner in which the various\r\nheads of his instructions had been classified, he proceeds:\r\n\r\n Believing that the instructions, as thus prepared,[184] will be found\r\n to convey their meaning perspicuously and completely, I abstain from\r\n any attempt to recapitulate or explain their provisions. I turn to\r\n other topics on which it seems indispensable that on the present\r\n occasion I should convey to you explanations, for which, of course,\r\n no appropriate place could be found in the legal instruments already\r\n mentioned. I advert especially to what relates to the aborigines of\r\n New Zealand and the settlement of the public lands in those Islands.\r\n I cannot approach this topic without remarking that the protracted\r\n correspondence to which it has given rise, the public debates and\r\n resolutions which have sprung from it, and the enactments and\r\n measures of your predecessors in the Government, have all contributed\r\n to throw into almost inextricable confusion the respective rights and\r\n claims of various classes of individuals amongst the inhabitants of\r\n New Zealand, to render very embarrassing the enquiry in which you\r\n must doubtless be engaged respecting the line of conduct which Her\r\n Majesty's Government expect you to pursue, and at the same time to\r\n make it almost impossible for us to determine with any confidence\r\n what that conduct ought to be, and how far, in a state of affairs so\r\n complicated, it is possible now to act upon the principles to which,\r\n in the absence of these difficulties, I should have prescribed your\r\n adherence. I will not attempt any retrospect of those documents and\r\n proceedings; I should be but adding to the perplexity which I\r\n acknowledge and regret. It will be my attempt rather to explain, as\r\n briefly as the nature of the subject admits, what is the policy\r\n which, if we were unembarrassed by past transactions, it would be\r\n right to follow, and which (so far as any freedom of choice remains\r\n to us) ought still to be adopted, regarding the right of property in\r\n land which should be acknowledged or created, more especially as\r\n affecting the aborigines of New Zealand.\r\n\r\n I enter upon this topic by observing that the accompanying statute,\r\n 9th & 10th Vict., ch. 104, sec. 11, repeals the Australian Land Sales\r\n Act, as far as relates to the lands situate in New Zealand. Thus\r\n there is a complete absence of statutory regulation on the subject.\r\n The Queen, as entitled in right of her Crown to any waste lands in\r\n the colony, is free to make whatever rules Her Majesty may see fit on\r\n the subject. The accompanying Charter accordingly authorises the\r\n Governor to alienate such lands. The accompanying instructions direct\r\n how that power is to be used. I proceed to explain the motives by\r\n which those instructions have been dictated.\r\n\r\n The opinion assumed, rather than advocated, by a large class of\r\n writers on this and kindred subjects is, that the aboriginal\r\n inhabitants of any country are the proprietors of every part of its\r\n soil of which they have been accustomed to make any use, or to which\r\n they have been accustomed to assert any title. This claim is\r\n represented as sacred, however ignorant such natives may be of the\r\n arts or of the habits of civilised life, however small the number of\r\n their tribes, however unsettled their abodes, and however imperfect\r\n or occasional the uses they make of the land. Whether they are\r\n nomadic tribes depasturing cattle, or hunters living by the chase, or\r\n fishermen frequenting the sea-coasts or the banks of rivers, the\r\n proprietary title in question is alike ascribed to them all.\r\n\r\n From this doctrine, whether it be maintained on the grounds of\r\n religion or morality, or of expediency, I entirely dissent. What I\r\n hold to be the true principle with regard to property in land is that\r\n which I find laid down in the following passage from the works of Dr.\r\n Arnold, which I think may safely be accepted as of authority on this\r\n subject, not only on account of his high character, but also because\r\n it was written, not with reference to passing events, or to any\r\n controversy which was at that time going on, but as stating a\r\n principle which he conceived to be of general application:\r\n\r\n \"Men were to subdue the earth: that is, to make it by their labour\r\n what it would not have been by itself; and with the\r\n labour so bestowed upon it came the right of property in it. Thus\r\n every land which is inhabited at all belongs to somebody; that is,\r\n there is either some one person, or family, or tribe, or nation who\r\n have a greater right to it than any one else has; it does not and\r\n cannot belong to anybody. But so much does the right of property go\r\n along with labour that civilised nations have never scrupled to take\r\n possession of countries inhabited by tribes of savages--countries\r\n which have been hunted over, but never subdued or cultivated. It is\r\n true, they have often gone further, and settled themselves in\r\n countries which were cultivated, and then it becomes a robbery; but\r\n when our fathers went to America, and took possession of the mere\r\n hunting grounds of the Indians--of lands on which man had hitherto\r\n bestowed no labour--they only exercised a right which God has\r\n inseparably united with industry and knowledge.\"\r\n\r\n The justness of this reasoning must, I think, be generally admitted,\r\n and if so, it can hardly be denied that it is applicable to the case\r\n of New Zealand, and is fatal to the right which has been claimed for\r\n the aboriginal inhabitants of those islands to the exclusive\r\n possession of the vast extent of fertile but unoccupied lands which\r\n they contain. It is true the New Zealanders, when European settlement\r\n commenced amongst them, were not a people of hunters: they lived, in\r\n a great measure at least, upon the produce of the soil (chiefly\r\n perhaps its spontaneous produce) and practised to a certain extent a\r\n rude sort of agriculture. But the extent of land so occupied by them\r\n was absolutely insignificant when compared with that of the country\r\n they inhabited; the most trustworthy accounts agree in representing\r\n the cultivated grounds as forming far less than one-hundredth part of\r\n the available land, and in stating that millions of acres were to be\r\n found where the naturally fertile soil was covered by primeval\r\n forests or wastes of fern, in the midst of which a few patches\r\n planted with potatoes were the only signs of human habitation or\r\n industry. The islands of New Zealand are not much less extensive than\r\n the British Isles, and capable probably of supporting as large a\r\n population, while that which they actually supported has been\r\n variously estimated, but never, I believe, as high as 200,000 souls.\r\n To contend that under such circumstances civilised men had no right\r\n to step in and take possession of the vacant territory, but were\r\n bound to respect the proprietary title of the savage tribes who dwell\r\n in but were utterly unable to occupy the land, is to mistake the\r\n grounds upon which the right of property in land is founded. To that\r\n portion of the soil, whatever it might be, which they really\r\n occupied, the aboriginal inhabitants, barbarous as they were, had a\r\n clear and undoubted claim; to have attempted to deprive them of their\r\n patches of potato-ground, even so to have occupied the territory as\r\n not to leave them ample space for shifting, as was their habit, their\r\n cultivation from one spot to another, would have been in the highest\r\n degree unjust; but so long as this injustice was avoided, I must\r\n regard it as a vain and unfounded scruple which would have\r\n acknowledged their rights of property in land which they did not\r\n occupy; it is obvious that they could not convey to others what they\r\n did not themselves possess, and that claims to vast tracts of waste\r\n land, founded on pretended sales from them, are altogether untenable.\r\n From the moment that British dominion was proclaimed in New Zealand,\r\n all lands not actually occupied in the sense in which alone\r\n occupation can give the right of possession, ought to have been\r\n considered as the property of the Crown in its capacity of trustee\r\n for the whole community, and it should thenceforward have been\r\n regarded as the right, and at the same time the duty of those duly\r\n authorised by the Crown, to determine in what manner and according to\r\n what rules the land hitherto waste should be assigned and\r\n appropriated to particular individuals. There is another\r\n consideration which leads to the same conclusion. It has never been\r\n pretended that the wide extent of unoccupied land, to which an\r\n exclusive right of property has been asserted on behalf of the native\r\n inhabitants of New Zealand, belonged to them as individuals, it was\r\n only as tribes that they were supposed to possess it, and granting\r\n their title as such to have been good and valid, it was obviously a\r\n right which the tribes enjoyed as independent communities--an\r\n attribute of sovereignty, which, with the sovereignty, naturally and\r\n necessarily was transferred to the British Crown. Had the New\r\n Zealanders been a civilised people this would have been the case--if\r\n these islands, being inhabited by a civilised people, had been added\r\n either by conquest or by voluntary cession to the dominions of the\r\n Queen, it is clear, that according to the well-known principles of\r\n public law, while the property of individuals would have been\r\n respected, all public property, all rights of every description which\r\n have appertained to the previous sovereigns, would have devolved, as\r\n a matter of course, to the new sovereign who succeeded them. It can\r\n hardly be contended that these tribes, as such, possessed rights\r\n which civilised communities could not have claimed.\r\n\r\n Such are the principles upon which, if the colonisation of New\r\n Zealand were only now about to begin, it would be my duty to instruct\r\n you to act; and though I am well aware that in point of fact you are\r\n not in a position to do so, and that from past transactions a state\r\n of things has arisen in which a strict application of these\r\n principles is impracticable, I have thought it right that they should\r\n be thus explicitly stated in this Despatch (as they are in the Royal\r\n instructions to which it refers), in order that you may clearly\r\n understand that, although you may in many respects be compelled to\r\n depart from them, still you are to look to them as the foundation of\r\n the policy which, so far as it is in your power, you are to pursue.\r\n\r\n The imperfect information which alone at this distance I can hope to\r\n obtain as to the actual state of affairs in New Zealand, renders it\r\n impossible for me to venture to prescribe to you how far you are to\r\n go in attempting practically to act upon the principles I have laid\r\n down. I should infer from your own Despatches, as well as from those\r\n of your predecessors, that the right of the Crown could not now be\r\n asserted to large tracts of waste land which particular tribes have\r\n been taught to regard as their own. It appears that you have found it\r\n expedient to admit these pretentions to a considerable extent; and\r\n having done so, no apparent advantage could be suffered to weigh\r\n against the evil of acting in a manner either really or even\r\n apparently inconsistent with good faith. While, however, you\r\n scrupulously fulfil whatever engagements you have contracted, and\r\n maintain those rights on the part of the native tribes to land which\r\n you have already recognised, you will avoid as much as possible any\r\n further surrender of the property of the Crown. I trust also that the\r\n evil which would otherwise arise from the concessions already made,\r\n may to a great degree be neutralised by your strictly maintaining the\r\n exclusive right of the Crown to purchase land from the native tribes\r\n to which it has been assumed that it belongs. This right, resting as\r\n it does not only upon what has been called the \"Treaty of Waitangi,\"\r\n but also upon the general and long-recognised principles of national\r\n law, is one so important that it ought almost at all hazards to be\r\n strictly enforced. To suffer it to be set aside would be to acquiesce\r\n in the ruin of the colony, since it would be fatal to the progressive\r\n and systematic settlement of the country. It is by the sale of land\r\n at more than a nominal price that its appropriation to individuals in\r\n allotments in proportion to their power of making use of it can alone\r\n be secured. It is the mode by which, with least inconvenience and\r\n difficulty, funds can be raised for emigration and for executing\r\n those public works which are necessary for the profitable occupation\r\n of the soil; in short, it is the very foundation on which systematic\r\n colonisation must be based. But if the native tribes are permitted to\r\n sell large tracts of land to individuals for a mere nominal\r\n consideration, it is obvious that so much land will be thrown upon\r\n the market as entirely to defeat the attempt to sell such lands as\r\n the Crown may still retain, at a price sufficient to answer the\r\n objects of the policy I have described.\r\n\r\n The first and most important step which you will have to take with\r\n the view of introducing a regular system with respect to the disposal\r\n of land, will be to ascertain distinctly the ownership of all the\r\n land in the colony. The extent and limits of all which is to be\r\n considered as the property either of individuals, of bodies politic\r\n or corporate, or of the native tribes, must in the first instance be\r\n determined, and the whole of the remainder of the territory will then\r\n be declared to be the Royal demesne. The results of this enquiry\r\n must be carefully registered, and a regular record henceforth\r\n preserved, showing to whom all lands in New Zealand belong. This\r\n measure has been repeatedly and earnestly inculcated on your\r\n predecessors, and I cannot too strongly repeat the same injunction.\r\n\r\nChapter XIII. of the Royal Instructions was devoted to placing into\r\nlegal phraseology the Minister's policy for \"the Settlement of the\r\nwaste lands of the Crown\" and Clause 9 of that Chapter more\r\nparticularly dealt with the method by which the native titles were to\r\nbe ascertained and recognised.\r\n\r\n (9) No claim shall be admitted in the said land Courts on behalf of\r\n the Aboriginal inhabitants of New Zealand to any lands situate within\r\n the said islands, unless it shall be established, to the satisfaction\r\n of such Court, that either by some Act of the Executive Government of\r\n New Zealand as hitherto constituted, or by the adjudication of some\r\n Court of competent jurisdiction within New Zealand, the right of such\r\n aboriginal inhabitants to such lands has been acknowledged and\r\n ascertained, or those from whom they derived the title, have actually\r\n had the occupation of the lands so claimed, and have been accustomed\r\n to use and enjoy the same, either as places of abode or tillage, or\r\n for the growth of crops, or for the depasturing of cattle, or\r\n otherwise for the convenience and sustentation of life, by means of\r\n labour expended thereon.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers in England which supported the New Zealand Company\r\npublished with undisguised exultation Earl Grey's Despatch, and hailed\r\nhim as a Daniel come to judgment.[185] The Maoris regarded the matter\r\nin quite a different light. Here they were being asked to submit for\r\nratification, by an extraneous authority, their lands which they and\r\ntheir forefathers had fought for, and which they had ever guarded with\r\na jealous care that only death itself could terminate; lands which\r\nthey had been told by Captain Hobson and the Missionaries were to be\r\ntheirs to loose or to hold as they pleased; lands of which the Treaty\r\nof Waitangi had solemnly recognised them as already the indisputable\r\nowners. Was this then the much vaunted honour of the Queen? was this\r\nto be the unhappy end of all her high-sounding promises? The fire of\r\nindignation ran through the Maori veins as they contemplated the\r\ndeception; the rumble of discontent grew as the tidings spread; the\r\nbreath of battle was in the air.\r\n\r\nThe position of the Governor was delicate in the extreme, and probably\r\nonly two things stood at this critical juncture between the colony and\r\nwar--the Maori confidence in Grey, and Grey's confidence in himself.\r\n\"What was I to do indeed?\" he afterwards said. \"My instruction was not\r\nalone that of the Colonial Office; but the Constitution had been\r\nsanctioned by Parliament. A man's responsibility in the larger sense\r\nis, after adequate deliberation, to proceed as he determines to be\r\njust and wise. If he has to decide, not for himself only but for\r\nothers, unto future generations, there lies his course all the more.\r\nThere was one clear line for me, simply to hang up the Constitution,\r\nand intimate to the Home authorities my ideas about it.\" In accordance\r\nwith this decision he wrote on August 20 (1847) to his chief, describing\r\nwith that directness of which his pen was capable the ferment into\r\nwhich this impossible statesmanship had thrown the country.\r\n\r\n I have to state to Your Lordship that within the last few days I have\r\n received alarming accounts from various quarters of the island\r\n regarding the excitement created in portions of the country most\r\n densely inhabited by natives, upon the subject of the introduction of\r\n the new Constitution into this country, and the steps that may be\r\n taken regarding the registration of their lands. I am not yet in a\r\n position that would enable me to state whether actual insurrection,\r\n upon an extensive scale is to be immediately apprehended; but I\r\n cannot entertain any doubt that the country is in a very critical\r\n state. I will lose no time in taking such measures as are in my power\r\n to quiet the apprehensions which at present exist, and I will also\r\n delay for some time the introduction of the proposed Constitution,\r\n but I beg again earnestly to press upon your Lordship the advantages\r\n which would result from in so far modifying the proposed Constitution\r\n as to leave the Governor the power of being able certainly to promise\r\n the natives that he will enact any measures which they may request as\r\n essential to their interests, and which the Governor may also\r\n consider to be absolutely requisite to secure the tranquillity of the\r\n country.\r\n\r\nA portion of the Governor's measures to \"quiet the apprehensions\" of\r\nthe Maoris was to despatch Captain Sotheby, then in command of H.M.S.\r\n_Racehorse_, to visit the northern chiefs, and aided by the ever\r\nloyal Waaka Nene he assured them, \"on the authority of His Excellency\r\nthe Governor, that there was no truth in the report that the\r\nGovernment claimed all land not under tillage.\" Subsequently this\r\nofficer invited Earl Grey to reflect upon the rapidity with which this\r\nreport had spread through the North Island, and the dissatisfaction\r\nwhich it had excited, \"even in the minds of those chiefs who had\r\nhitherto been friendly to the British and who had fought on our side.\"\r\n\r\nFrom old Te Wherowhero, of the Waikato, came the following\r\ncharacteristic protest to the Queen, whose honour he would not impugn,\r\nwhose word he would accept:\r\n\r\n O Madam the Queen, hearken to our words, the words of all the chiefs\r\n of Waikato.\r\n\r\n May God grant that you may hold fast our word, and we your word for\r\n ever. Madam listen, news are going about here that your Ministers are\r\n talking of taking away the land of the Native without cause, which\r\n makes our hearts dark. But we do not believe this news, because we\r\n heard from the first Governor that the disposal of the land was with\r\n ourselves. And from the second Governor we heard the same words, and\r\n from this Governor. They have all said the same. Therefore we write\r\n to you that you may be kind to us, to your friends that love you.\r\n Write your thoughts to us, that peace may prevail amongst the natives\r\n of these Islands.[186]\r\n\r\nIn this dignified appeal the chief was joined by Bishop Selwyn,\r\nArchdeacon Maunsell, and Chief Justice Martin in the colony, and by\r\nthe Wesleyan Mission Committee in England, who employed the searching\r\npen of Dr. Beecham to voice their protest.\r\n\r\nHow the Bishop regarded the proposals of the Chief Secretary may be\r\njudged from the following passage in a letter which he subsequently\r\nwrote to his friend, the Rev. E. Coleridge, in England: \"If Lord\r\nGrey's principles had been avowed by the Governor as the rule of his\r\npolicy, the safety of the English settlements could not have been\r\nguaranteed for a single day.\"\r\n\r\nArchdeacon Maunsell, who in 1840 had informed Captain Hobson that the\r\nMissionaries had committed themselves to the promotion of the Treaty\r\nof Waitangi only because of their unshaken faith in the integrity of\r\nthe British Government,[187] was at least entitled to point out that\r\never since the treaty was signed the conduct of the Maori towards the\r\nBritish had been marked by a spirit of chivalry, of friendship, and of\r\ngood faith. \"Why, then,\" he asked, \"does the statesman of a mighty\r\nnation seek to confiscate the guaranteed possessions of our friends\r\nand allies?\" If such should ever happen, his letter concluded, there\r\ncould be no alternative but for the Missionaries in sorrow to leave\r\nthe country, broken and discredited men.\r\n\r\nNor was the kindly, conscientious Martin less emphatic. In a pamphlet,\r\n\"England and the New Zealanders,\" he discusses the danger of thus\r\nshattering the native confidence in Britain's honour. \"In particular,\"\r\nhe states, \"those who have received Christianity are disposed to look\r\nup to us for guidance and government. But let the plan of confiscation\r\nor seizure be once acted on, and all this will be at an end. The worst\r\nsurmises of the natives will have become realities. To them we will\r\nappear to be a nation of liars.\"\r\n\r\nThe Wesleyan Mission Society embodied their views in a memorial, which\r\nthey subsequently deemed worthy of publication,[188] wherein they\r\njustified their right to question the propriety of Earl Grey's policy,\r\nnot only because of the prestige and influence of their Mission, but\r\nbecause that prestige and influence had been solicited in the\r\ninterests of the Treaty of Waitangi by Captain Hobson, at a time when\r\nhis success without it was impossible. They explained that their\r\nsolicitude upon the subject had been greatly increased, if not wholly\r\nproduced by the flood of letters they had received from their\r\nMissionaries in New Zealand, expressing the state of alarm into which\r\nthey had been thrown by the publication of his Lordship's Despatch and\r\nInstructions, and which in their opinion affixed a meaning to the\r\nTreaty of Waitangi very different from that in which it was understood\r\nby the parties principally concerned in its execution. Being\r\napprehensive that any attempt to carry what they regarded as a new\r\ninterpretation of the treaty into effect, would result in the most\r\ndisastrous consequences, they were constrained to make such\r\nrepresentations upon the subject as they had reason to hope would\r\navert the evils which they feared. They then proceeded to set out that\r\nat the commencement of the proceedings adopted by Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment for founding a colony in New Zealand, they distinctly\r\nunderstood that the previous recognition of the independence of New\r\nZealand by the British Government having taken the country out of the\r\ncategory of barbarous tribes and people without a national character\r\nor national rights, the ordinary course pursued in colonisation would\r\nnot be adopted in its case, but that New Zealand would be negotiated\r\nwith as an Independent State, and that the British Crown would not\r\ntake anything from the Aboriginal proprietors which was not ceded on\r\ntheir part by fair and honourable treaty. In support of this view,\r\nthey quoted at length from Lord Normanby's instructions to Captain\r\nHobson, in 1839 and from the subsequent correspondence with him, when\r\nthat officer sought a greater amplification of important points. On\r\nthe authority, then, of the noble gentleman formerly at the head of\r\nthe Colonial Department, they claimed that they were not deceived when\r\nthey understood that the cession of sovereignty in New Zealand was not\r\nto involve the surrender of territory, either in whole or in part;\r\nthat the cession to the Crown of such waste lands as might be\r\nprogressively required for the use of the settlers should be\r\nsubsequently obtained by fair and equal contracts with the natives,\r\nand that no lands were to be claimed for the Crown in New Zealand,\r\nexcept such as might be obtained by purchase from the natives, or by\r\ntheir own free consent. They detailed the overtures which Captain\r\nHobson made to their Missionaries in 1840, when, \"in accordance with\r\ninstructions he had received from the highest authority in the realm,\"\r\nhe requested their assistance in effecting the negotiation with which\r\nhe had been entrusted. The Missionaries at this time, the Committee\r\npointed out, had not read Captain Hobson's instructions, for they had\r\nnot then been published, but they fully understood the claims of the\r\nnatives upon the soil of New Zealand, and the point upon which they\r\nhad to satisfy themselves was whether the proposed treaty was designed\r\nto admit and confirm those claims in the full and unqualified sense in\r\nwhich they were made. The Missionaries knew that the Maoris claimed\r\nthe _entire_ soil of New Zealand.[189] They knew that the entire\r\ncountry was divided amongst the several tribes, that the boundaries of\r\nevery property were accurately defined, and the proprietorship so\r\nvested in each tribe that all the members of the tribe had a\r\nbeneficial interest therein. They therefore knew that at the time the\r\nTreaty of Waitangi was signed there was no land in New Zealand without\r\nan owner, and which would under the principles of public law, be\r\nautomatically transferred to the Crown.\r\n\r\n \"In the view, therefore, of both the Missionaries and the natives,\"\r\n they said, \"the sovereignty and the land were two entirely distinct\r\n things, and to preserve the latter intact, while they surrendered the\r\n former, was the great solicitude of the natives. From Captain Hobson\r\n the Missionaries received the most satisfactory explanation of the\r\n terms of the treaty. It dwelt explicitly on both the sovereignty and\r\n the land, and the interpretation which the Missionaries were\r\n authorised to give of it was that, while the _entire_\r\n sovereignty should be transferred to the British Crown, the\r\n _entire_ land should be secured to the natives. Most certainly\r\n the Missionaries received the fullest assurance that, in surrendering\r\n the sovereignty, the natives would not by that act surrender their\r\n original claims upon any part of the soil. In this sense the chiefs\r\n themselves understood the treaty, as it was propounded to them. They\r\n clearly comprehended its two main features as explained in their own\r\n figurative style, that 'the shadow of the land,' by which they meant\r\n 'the sovereignty,' would pass to the Queen of England, but that the\r\n 'substance,' meaning the land itself, would remain with them.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Missionaries were not alone the source from which the\r\nCommittee proved the correct interpretation of the treaty. The\r\nwitnesses who had given evidence before Earl Grey's own Committee in\r\n1844 were marshalled to their support, the official Despatches were\r\nquoted to the same end, even those of Lord John Russell being referred\r\nto as \"warranting the conclusion that his Lordship designed the treaty\r\nshould be faithfully observed, in the sense in which it was understood\r\nby the natives and Missionaries of both the Church and Wesleyan\r\nSocieties.\" To these was added the invaluable testimony of Lieutenant\r\nShortland, who had been in closest association with Captain Hobson\r\nduring the treaty negotiations, who had been privileged to administer\r\nthe affairs of the colony under it, and who from his close official\r\nconnection with it was peculiarly the man able to say what it meant\r\nand what it did not mean. Shortly before his return to England, the\r\nSelect Committee of the House of Commons had issued their report upon\r\n\"the State of New Zealand and the proceedings of the New Zealand\r\nCompany,\" and so completely did that report misrepresent, in Mr.\r\nShortland's opinion, the true position of affairs, so harmful did he\r\ndeem the resolutions which accompanied that report, that he felt in\r\nduty bound to protest to Lord Stanley against the needless perversion\r\nof the facts. During a lengthy and dispassionate statement of the\r\ncircumstances surrounding the procuration of the treaty--than whom no\r\none knew them better--Mr. Shortland, writing from his quiet retreat at\r\nTorquay, dealt with especial emphasis upon the relation of the\r\nsovereignty to the land:\r\n\r\n Respecting the cession of the sovereignty to the Crown by the\r\n aborigines without a reciprocal guarantee to them of the perfect\r\n enjoyment of their territorial rights, I do not hesitate to say, such\r\n a proposition would not for a moment have been entertained by the\r\n natives, who, during the whole proceedings of the Government at the\r\n first establishment of the colony, manifested a feeling of great\r\n anxiety and mistrust in regard to the security of their lands. Of\r\n this I could produce many instances did space permit, but will\r\n content myself with noticing that the Church and Wesleyan Missionaries\r\n possessing, as they deservedly did before the assumption of\r\n sovereignty by Her Majesty, the unlimited confidence of the natives,\r\n incurred by their aiding the local Government to effect the peaceable\r\n establishment of the colony, the suspicion of the aborigines, who\r\n frequently upbraided the Missionaries with having deceived them,\r\n saying, \"Your Queen will serve us as she has done the black fellows\r\n of New South Wales; our lands will be taken from us, and we shall\r\n become slaves.\" How then could the colony have been founded with the\r\n free and intelligent consent of the native owners of the soil, on any\r\n other terms than those laid down by the Treaty of Waitangi, viewed in\r\n the light in which it has always been understood and acted on by the\r\n local Government.\r\n\r\nWith these and many similar pieces of unimpeachable evidence did the\r\nCommittee press upon the Colonial Secretary the conviction that their\r\nreading and understanding of the treaty was the only one which its\r\n\"large words,\" as Lord Stanley had termed them, would bear. Earl Grey\r\nrelied upon the astute pen of Mr. Herman Merivale, his new\r\nUnder-Secretary to release him from the horns of the dilemma upon\r\nwhich the cold reasoning of the Committee had impaled him. This he did\r\nby referring the memorialists back to an obscure phrase in the Royal\r\nInstructions, which provided that no native claim to land would be\r\nrecognised unless the title had previously been acknowledged and\r\nascertained, \"by some act of the Executive Government of New Zealand\r\nas then constituted or by the adjudication of some court of competent\r\njurisdiction.\" The Treaty of Waitangi was now admitted, and even\r\nasserted by the Under-Secretary to be \"unquestionably an act of the\r\nExecutive Government,\" and therefore it followed that nothing that was\r\nguaranteed by the treaty was imperilled by the Instructions. With a\r\nwealth of argument upon phases of the issue which were not directly\r\nraised by the Memorial,[190] Mr. Merivale was at least able to assure\r\nthe Committee that the Government intended and always had intended to\r\nrecognise the treaty, as they believed, in the same sense in which the\r\nCommittee recognised it. \"They recognise it in both its essential\r\nstipulations, the one securing to those native tribes, of which the\r\nchiefs have signed the treaty, a title to those lands which they\r\npossess according to native usage (whether cultivated or not) at the\r\ntime of the treaty, the other securing to the Crown the exclusive\r\nright of extinguishing such title by purchase.\" Considerable unction\r\nwas claimed for his chief by the Under-Secretary, in that he had\r\ndirected Governor Grey to proceed with all circumspection in giving\r\neffect to the instructions of the Department, but he failed to observe\r\nthat even in his widened interpretation of the treaty, he still\r\nlimited the rights in native lands to those tribes whose chiefs had\r\nsigned the treaty. Those who like Te Heuheu, and Te Wherowhero had\r\nmaintained their independence might still have been subject to\r\nspoliation had this view become the accepted interpretation of the\r\nDepartment, and those who were keenly interested in the fate of the\r\ncolony were not slow to place this construction upon it. The immediate\r\nnecessity for anxiety upon this point was, however, obviated by the\r\nprompt suspension of the Charter by Governor Grey, and upon the\r\nsubmission by him to Downing Street of a more liberal and flexible\r\nConstitution, drafted upon the slopes and amidst the snows of Ruapehu.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARL DERBY.\r\n\r\nFormerly Lord Stanley.]\r\n\r\nEre the brewing storm in New Zealand had burst, the crisis had come in\r\nthe life of Lord John Russell's Ministry, who were defeated on their\r\nMilitia Bill. They were succeeded by the Stanley of old, who in the\r\nperson of Lord Derby, became Premier, with Sir John Pakington as his\r\nColonial Secretary. To him fell the duty of giving legislative effect\r\nto the more workable and equitable Constitution drafted by Governor\r\nGrey, and when the Wesleyan Committee again approached the Colonial\r\nOffice with the regretful assurance that the reply vouchsafed to them\r\nby the noble gentleman who had just vacated the Chief Secretaryship\r\n\"was less satisfactory to the people of New Zealand than it had\r\nappeared to themselves,\" Sir John was able to convey to them through\r\nthe Earl of Desart the gratifying intelligence that in the Bill then\r\nbefore the House there was every provision for the full and complete\r\nrecognition of the principles for which they had so resolutely\r\ncontended.\r\n\r\nConcerning the Third Clause of the treaty, little need be said. By\r\nthis covenant the Queen undertook, in consideration of the cession of\r\nsovereignty and the granting of the pre-emptive right of purchase of\r\nland, to extend to the Maori race her Royal protection, and impart to\r\nthem all the rights and privileges of British subjects. Of the manner\r\nin which this undertaking has been fulfilled, the Maoris have never\r\ncomplained, and they have never had just grounds for complaint. There\r\nis no colour line drawn against the New Zealander in New Zealand. Our\r\ncourts are as open to him as to anyone, and whether he be plaintiff or\r\ndefendant, the same even-handed justice is meted out to him. He\r\ntravels upon our railways, he rides upon our cars, he sits in our\r\ntheatres on equal terms with his _Pakeha_ friend. His children\r\nare educated in our schools and his sons are absorbed into our Civil\r\nService, his chiefs sit at the Governor's table, and his elected\r\nrepresentatives sit in Parliament, where their voice is respected and\r\ntheir vote is valued. The professions are open to him, and there is\r\nno position in Church or State which he may not fill. No more is\r\ndemanded of a Maori than of a European. His passport to society is his\r\ngood behaviour, his participation of civil rights is governed by his\r\ndisposition to become a law-abiding citizen.\r\n\r\nOnly one question now remains to be discussed. In what relation did\r\nthose chiefs stand to the Treaty of Waitangi who refused to sign it?\r\nIt has never been contended that all the chiefs were invited to meet\r\nCaptain Hobson at Waitangi, nor that all were solicited by his agents\r\nto sign the treaty, nor that all who were so solicited agreed to affix\r\ntheir signatures to the document. There was a residuum, which included\r\nsome of the most powerful chiefs in the land, who either had no\r\nopportunity of subscribing their allegiance to the Crown, or who for\r\nreasons of their own held aloof. How were these non-participants\r\naffected by the compact?\r\n\r\nThis question was first raised in its practical application by Taraia,\r\na Tauranga chief, who in December 1842 committed what is believed to\r\nhave been the last act of cannibalism perpetrated in New Zealand.\r\nTaraia was not a signatory to the treaty, and the Government were\r\nsorely exercised as to whether they were justified in claiming\r\njurisdiction over him. An effort had been made by the Aborigines'\r\nProtection Society in London to define the status of these independent\r\nchiefs, by submitting the question to Mr. Joseph Phillimore, an\r\neminent English lawyer, and Mr. Phillimore had given them a qualified\r\nopinion that if there were any chiefs who had preserved their\r\nindependence by refusing to become parties to the treaty, then such\r\nchiefs _may_ not be bound by its obligations, and _may_ be\r\nentitled to distinct and separate consideration. But clearly, in an\r\nabstract sense, there could be no such qualification to the unaltered\r\nstatus of these men. They were still chiefs of an Independent State so\r\nfar as they were concerned, retaining inviolate their _mana_, and\r\nrefusing to be compromised by the concessions made by their fellow\r\nchiefs.\r\n\r\nThe Government, then controlled by Captain Hobson, did not share even\r\nthe qualified view entertained by Mr. Phillimore and those who thought\r\nwith him. They presumed all natives of New Zealand now to be British\r\nsubjects and determined that Taraia must be punished. This valiant\r\ndetermination was not, however, given final effect, not because the\r\nauthorities were dubious of its justice, but because they had become\r\nuncertain as to its practicability; so much so that they subsequently\r\ndeemed it prudent to limit their interference to a warning to that\r\nchief, that he might expect to incur the anger of the Governor upon a\r\nrepetition of his offence. In Taraia's case this reprimand was\r\nsufficient to quiet him, but only a few months later Tongoroa, another\r\nTauranga chief, made war upon his neighbours, and the sore which\r\nlooked as though it had healed was suddenly reopened. Lieutenant\r\nShortland, who had now assumed the post of Acting-Governor, proceeded\r\nto Tauranga to arrest the disturber of the peace, but before the\r\napprehension could be effected his accumulating difficulties were\r\nfurther increased by an unexpected communication from Mr. Clarke, the\r\nchief Protector of the Aborigines, and Mr. Swainson, the Attorney-General.\r\nBoth these gentlemen had previously endorsed the contemplated arrest\r\nof Taraia, but to the amazement of the Acting-Governor they informed\r\nhim that more mature reflection had caused them to reverse their\r\nopinion, and that they now considered the arrest of Tongoroa would be\r\nillegal.\r\n\r\nHurrying back to Auckland, Shortland called a meeting of his Council,\r\nand there sought some enlightenment as to this new view-point of the\r\nMaori status under the treaty. Amongst those consulted was necessarily\r\nMr. Clarke, the erstwhile Missionary, and now Chief Protector of the\r\nAborigines, whose close and constant intercourse with all the tribes\r\ngave him the most favourable facilities for gauging the strength and\r\ndirection of the native aspirations. In the course of his examination\r\nMr. Clarke was asked:\r\n\r\n (1) Do the natives who signed the Treaty of Waitangi acknowledge\r\n themselves to be British subjects?\r\n\r\n To which he replied:--The natives who signed the Treaty of Waitangi,\r\n having been solemnly assured by Her Majesty's representative, the\r\n late Captain Hobson, that they should in the fullest sense of the\r\n term be entitled to all the privileges of British subjects, consented\r\n to be considered as such, with a full understanding that their\r\n allegiance depended upon the British Government fulfilling their\r\n engagements in that treaty.\r\n\r\n (2) How far, and to what extent, do the various tribes in New Zealand\r\n acknowledge the Queen's sovereignty?\r\n\r\n To this Mr. Clarke's answer was:--The natives alone who signed the\r\n treaty acknowledge the Queen's sovereignty, and that only in a\r\n limited sense. The treaty guaranteeing their own customs to them,\r\n they acknowledge a right of interference only in grave cases, such as\r\n war and murder, and all disputes and offences between themselves and\r\n Europeans, and hitherto they have acted on this principle. The\r\n natives who have not signed the treaty consider that the British\r\n Government, in common with themselves, have a right to interfere in\r\n all cases of dispute between their tribes and Europeans, but limit\r\n British interference to European British subjects.\r\n\r\n (3) In your communications with the natives, have you asserted that\r\n they are British subjects, and the right of the Government to\r\n interfere with them as such? and (4) On making that assertion how far\r\n has it been acquiesced in?:--In all my communications with the\r\n natives I have been instructed to assert, and have always asserted,\r\n that they are British subjects, and amenable to British authority, in\r\n which very few, even those who signed the treaty, would acquiesce,\r\n save in matters relating to disputes or depredations upon each other\r\n (viz. differences between Europeans and natives).\r\n\r\n (5) If the Government were to admit that any tribe or tribes of New\r\n Zealanders were not British subjects, and were not amenable to the\r\n laws, what effect do you think that admission would have on the peace\r\n and future colonisation of the colony?:--The admission that the\r\n tribes of New Zealanders were not amenable to British law, would, I\r\n am apprehensive, be destructive to the interests of the natives and\r\n the prosperity of the colony. It would be made use of by designing\r\n men to embarrass the Government, to embroil the natives with each\r\n other and with the Government, which must be alike injurious to both.\r\n Her Majesty's Government having seen fit to colonise New Zealand, it\r\n is now an act of humanity to both natives and Europeans to consider\r\n the whole of the tribes of New Zealand as British subjects, and to\r\n use every honourable and humane means of getting the tribes\r\n universally to cede the sovereignty where it has not been ceded.\r\n\r\n (6) Supposing that we should treat as British subjects, by force,\r\n those tribes, who have uniformly refused to cede the sovereignty to\r\n Great Britain, should we be keeping faith with the principles we\r\n professed when we originally negotiated for the cession of the\r\n sovereignty?:--In treating those tribes as British subjects by force\r\n who have refused to cede the sovereignty to Great Britain, would not\r\n only be considered by the natives as a breach of faith with the\r\n principles originally professed when negotiating for the sovereignty,\r\n but would, I am apprehensive, lead to a destructive war, and although\r\n the result would be destructive to the native race, it would be\r\n inglorious to the British Government, and at variance with the\r\n designs of Her Most Gracious Majesty in adding this interesting\r\n people and country to her Dominions.\r\n\r\nFrom the Protector of the Aborigines who only pretended to interpret\r\nMaori opinion as he gleaned it in his progress through their _pas_ and\r\nsettlements, the Executive turned to their Attorney-General, Mr.\r\nSwainson, for his more recent interpretation of the position as it\r\nappealed to the trained mind of a jurist, and Mr. Swainson only put\r\ninto less direct language the pronouncement of Wiremu Tamihana, the\r\nKing Maker, who during the hey-day of the King movement scorned the\r\nauthority of the Queen over his land: \"I am chief of Ngati-Haua, which\r\nis an independent tribe. My father, Te Waharoa, was chief before me.\r\nNeither he, I, or any of my people signed the treaty, therefore we are\r\nnot bound by it.\" Mr. Swainson's opinion was as follows:\r\n\r\n From the evidence given before the Council by the Protector of the\r\n Aborigines (Mr. Clarke), it appears that, as I have already stated,\r\n there are numerous tribes who have not ceded their sovereign rights\r\n to the Queen, and who do not yet acknowledge her sovereign authority.\r\n For the reasons already given, I think it would be consistent neither\r\n with justice nor with the principles we professed, viz. that we came\r\n here to treat for and not to assume sovereignty, to treat those\r\n tribes in all respects as British subjects, and to impose upon them\r\n our penal code; in this opinion, also, the Protector's opinion\r\n coincides. I am also of opinion that so numerous are these tribes,\r\n and many of them so distant, that were we disposed to do so we have\r\n not the power. At the same time, I am persuaded that the benefits of\r\n British protection, and the laws administered by British judges,\r\n would far more than compensate the natives for the sacrifice of their\r\n independence. These benefits, however, I am equally persuaded, can\r\n only be obtained on the voluntary surrender by them of their own\r\n sovereign rights, and on their \"free and intelligent\" submission to\r\n British authority. To subjugate them would require a large armed\r\n force; but by the employment of persuasion, the influence of example,\r\n and the general spread of civilisation among neighbouring tribes,\r\n there is ground to expect that they will gradually submit themselves\r\n to the operation of British laws. To constantly point out to them the\r\n benefits they will derive from doing so, and to impress upon them, to\r\n use the language of the Secretary of State, the impossibility of Her\r\n Majesty's extending to them an effectual protection unless the Queen\r\n be acknowledged as the Sovereign of their country, or at least of\r\n those districts within, or adjacent to which Her Majesty's subjects\r\n may acquire land or habitations \"is the course, I believe, to be most\r\n calculated to effect the object of establishing an absolute\r\n sovereignty over the whole country.\"\r\n\r\nThough doubtless giving to these expressions of opinion the respectful\r\nconsideration which was their due, the Acting-Governor decided to\r\nassume the responsibility of setting them aside, and following the\r\ndictates of his own judgment. To him it seemed that it would be\r\nfatally weak to admit in the practical administration of the country\r\nthe nice line of distinction drawn by the Attorney-General or\r\nsubscribe to the opinion expressed by Mr. Clarke, \"that every\r\nhonourable and humane means should be used to prevail on tribes to\r\ncede the sovereignty where it has not been ceded,\" as in his judgment\r\nthis would have been an over-ready admission that they were beyond the\r\npale of the British Crown, and no more effectual means could have been\r\nadopted of disseminating the harmful acknowledgment. The troops were\r\naccordingly sent to Tauranga, but no arrests were made. Here prudence\r\nagain prevailed and the officer in charge was instructed only to\r\nemploy the soldiers \"in the general preservation of peace.\" When these\r\nproceedings were reported in due course to Lord Stanley, he warmly\r\nendorsed the view adopted by Lieutenant Shortland[191] and as warmly\r\ncensured Swainson, who was told in the plainest terms that he could\r\nnot be permitted to entertain the views to which he had given\r\nexpression, and hold a public office at the same time.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of abstract reasoning, Lord Stanley was probably wrong, as\r\na matter of practical administration he was probably right, but the\r\ncorrectness of his attitude depended for its success upon the\r\ntactfulness of its application. Fortunately New Zealand has, in the\r\nmain, been blessed with administrators of wide sympathies, and a\r\npaternal parliament has generally, though not always given the native\r\nrace the most indulgent exposition of the treaty. Mistakes may have\r\nbeen made, misapprehensions may have occurred, even technical breaches\r\nof the treaty may have been committed, but since the administration of\r\nnative affairs was handed over to the Colonial Government in 1863\r\nthere have been but few instances of flagrant violation of native\r\nrights. Prior to this date the care and control of the Maori still\r\nvested in the Imperial authorities, even after representative\r\ninstitutions had been granted to the country; and while that condition\r\nlasted there was, unhappily, an all too frequent clashing of the two\r\nraces. With one or two exceptions these conflicts had a common origin\r\nin an over-anxious desire on the part of the Europeans to become\r\npossessed of native land, as opposed to the deep-founded pertinacity\r\nwith which the chiefs clung to their ancestral domains. The first of\r\nthese exceptions was the insurrection of Hone Heke in 1845, which was\r\nnot in its inception a dispute regarding land, but an undisguised\r\nprotest against the exercise of the Queen's sovereignty. Land did\r\nultimately play its complicating part in the disruption, but in its\r\ninitial stages it was the revolt of a volatile man who felt the treaty\r\nhad carried him further than he intended it should lead him; it was\r\nthe protest of an ambitious chief who loved notoriety as much as he\r\nloved his independence. Heke fell upon what now appears to have been\r\nthe weak point in Hobson's negotiations; that while he may have, and\r\ndoubtless did, convey to the natives a clear enough idea of what was\r\nmeant by the sovereignty of the Queen, he does not appear to have\r\ntaken sufficient care to explain with any detail what its possible\r\neffects might be. Assuredly he was not endowed with such a mental\r\nvision as to foresee all that was to happen, nor to conjure up within\r\nhis mind all the changes that were inevitable in evolving a State from\r\na condition of barbarism to one of civilisation. One thing, however,\r\nmust have been obvious both to him and to those who were associated\r\nwith him, that no government could be organised and carried on in a\r\nnew country without a revenue adequate for all its varied purposes.\r\nUnder Lord Normanby's instructions funds were to be temporarily\r\nprovided from New South Wales, but the permanent revenue was to be\r\nraised within New Zealand itself, of which a large part, it was hoped,\r\nwould be derived from the sale of land. Other sources of income in the\r\nway of customs duties and taxation in varied forms must also have been\r\nin contemplation, but we have no evidence that Captain Hobson ever\r\ntook occasion to explain to the people that sovereignty would cost\r\nthem something; that revenue which had been falling into the hands of\r\nthe chiefs would be diverted into the coffers of the State, and that\r\nwith the surrender of their independence they must also surrender the\r\nlevies which they had been making upon the whalers.\r\n\r\nIt is conceivable that had this surrender of a means to opulence been\r\nclearly contemplated by the chiefs as a part of the colonising scheme\r\nthose at the Bay of Islands would have been the more easily reconciled\r\nto it by the natural expectation that even larger sums would be\r\nflowing in to them from the sales of land. If these anticipations ever\r\nexisted they were doomed to disappointment, for instead of entering\r\nupon an active campaign of land-buying the Governor suspended the\r\npurchases he should have made, and wasted his money on a site for a\r\ntown, while the rigid enforcement of the pre-emptive right acquired by\r\nthe Crown closed the market against the buyers of open country lands.\r\nThis restriction was felt to be not without its element of injustice;\r\nfor upon a more critical examination of the terms of the treaty it was\r\nfound that though the Crown claimed the exclusive right to extinguish\r\nthe native title, nothing had been determined as to the price to be\r\npaid or as to the time within which the purchase should be made. Thus,\r\nchiefs like Heke, who had been in receipt of substantial sums by way\r\nof anchorage money from the shipping found their perquisites\r\nappropriated by the State, while they derived no compensating benefit\r\nfrom the sale of land.\r\n\r\nThe first flush of disappointment which surged within the breast of\r\nHeke as he contemplated the unexpected effects of the new power was\r\nfed by the angry adventurers and thwarted speculators, who, in their\r\nchagrin at the interception of their schemes, had no compunction in\r\ninciting him to a course which ultimately led to a declaration of\r\nhostility against the Queen and to open war against the Crown.\r\n\r\nNot so the Waitara war of 1860, which found its origin not so much in\r\na desire to violate the treaty, as in a blundering endeavour to\r\nobserve its most important provision. The taking up of arms by Wiremu\r\nKingi was not in its spirit rebellion against the Queen's sovereignty,\r\nbut a reply to the Governor's attempt to divest him of his rights by\r\ninsisting upon purchasing land from one whom Wiremu contended could\r\nnot by any application of native law be constituted the owner. There\r\nwas on the part of the natives the greatest reluctance to resort to\r\narms, their desire being to test the disputed point of ownership\r\nbefore a properly constituted Commission; but when these overtures\r\nwere rejected and the Governor held on his headstrong way, they felt\r\nthere was no course compatible with their high-strung sense of\r\ndignity, but to refer the momentous issue to the final arbitrament of\r\nwar. The story of the Waitara campaign is too well known to need\r\nrecapitulation here, but in the opinion of many of those skilled in\r\nthe intricacies of Maori land tenure it was a blunder of the first\r\nmagnitude, for which Governor Gore-Browne, and not the Colonial\r\nParliament was wholly responsible. If, then, the war was unjust, the\r\nconfiscation of native land which followed upon the suppression of\r\nwhat was called rebellion was branded with the same injustice.\r\n\r\nAnd just as one wrong perpetuates itself in the form of others, this\r\nconfiscation has ever since burned deep into the hearts of the\r\nTaranaki natives, and led in the early eighties to what is known as\r\nthe Te Whiti movement. Like his predecessor, Wiremu Kingi, Te Whiti\r\nwas a much-misunderstood man. For this state of misconception he may\r\nhave himself been largely accountable, for as a concession to the\r\nMaori love of the mysterious he so combined religion with his\r\npolitics, and dealt so freely in the mystic, that it was frequently\r\ndifficult to separate intangible prophecy from the things that really\r\nmattered in his material policy. But shorn of all its grotesqueness\r\nthe movement which centred round the Parihaka prophet and his uncle\r\nTohu was not a repudiation of the Treaty of Waitangi, nor was it a\r\nrevolt against the authority of the Queen. At its base lay the\r\ngrievance, or the fancied grievance, which was before them every day\r\nin the shape of the confiscated lands. There upon the wide Waimate\r\nPlains they saw European homesteads whose occupancy was in their eyes\r\na crime against Maori rights. Te Whiti felt he had two things to do.\r\nHe had to assert his right to those lands, and he had to agitate for\r\njustice. He accordingly sent his faithfuls to plough up the fields of\r\nthe farmers and the lawns of the settlers, in the mistaken hope that\r\nhe would be able to force the issue before a competent tribunal and\r\nthere determine who had broken the treaty--the Maori or the _Pakeha_.\r\n\r\nThe Government of that day saw things differently. They had no desire\r\nto exhume the remains of past mistakes with a possibility of being\r\ncalled upon to repair them at a cost of much treasure and more\r\ndignity. They preferred to stand upon the settled policy of their\r\npredecessors, and instead of sending a Commission to discover what was\r\nat the back of the prophet's mind, they sent troops and took him\r\nprisoner. Te Whiti may have been a dreamer, he may have been a babbler\r\nof vain things, but he was never a rebel, nor the maker of rebels; but\r\nfor saying \"I love my land\" he was legislated into rebellion, and made\r\nto appear as a criminal.\r\n\r\nIn the same way the King movement of 1857 only became rebellion when\r\nthe Crown made it so. Two primary causes operated to call into\r\nexistence this political power, the creation of Wiremu Tamihana's[192]\r\ngenius, which for over fifty years was a potent influence in the Maori\r\nlife of the Waikato. For upwards of fifteen years the colony had been\r\nfollowing with more or less exactitude the terms of the treaty, and\r\nduring this time the State had exercised its power of pre-emption in a\r\nmanner which the more enlightened Maoris now began to regard with\r\ndisfavour. When Lord Normanby despatched Captain Hobson to found the\r\ncolony he anticipated no opposition to the practice of buying land\r\nfrom the natives at a low price and selling it again to the colonists\r\nat a large advance on what the Crown had paid. For a time these\r\nanticipations were confirmed by results, but now the fathers of the\r\nrace, jealous of the rapid increase of the Europeans, and alarmed at\r\nthe equally rapid diminution of their lands, began to adopt a\r\ndifferent view. Rather than part for a few shillings with property\r\nwhich they knew would be sold for as many pounds, they determined to\r\nexercise their right under the treaty, and refuse any longer to\r\nsanction the large transactions in which they had been engaged with\r\nthe Crown.\r\n\r\nTheir eyes, too, had been opened by the Waitara war. Here a single\r\nindividual had embroiled the whole of the Ngati-Awa tribe in a\r\nsanguinary conflict with the Government, by insisting upon selling\r\nland to which his title was contested. These unauthorised sales, said\r\nthe chiefs, must cease, and no individual should, by his avarice, have\r\nthe power to involve the people in war. To crystallise this\r\ndetermination into a practical act of statesmanship Wiremu Tamihana\r\nconceived the idea of a Maori King, who was to be, not antagonistic\r\nto, nor a substitute for the Queen, but the arbiter and judge in all\r\ninternal disputes, as well as the mouthpiece as to land which the\r\ntribes as a whole were or were not prepared to sell. \"I do not desire\r\nto cast the Queen from this Island, but from my piece of land. I am\r\nthe person to overlook my piece\" was how Wiremu Tamihana once publicly\r\nstated his attitude towards the Crown. The King movement was thus a\r\nLand League and not a rebellion, and as the Maoris had the right to\r\nwithhold their land from sale if they so pleased, their adherence to\r\nthis restrictive policy was no more illegal than the establishment of\r\na Trades Union or a Political Association. The movement did not become\r\nmilitant until after the invasion of the Waitara by the British\r\ntroops, when many of the Waikato natives rose in sympathy with Wiremu\r\nKingi, and the battle followed them back to their gates. Then the\r\nauthorities began to realise what a compelling truth there was in the\r\nmaxim of Bishop Selwyn: \"Nothing is easier than legally and peacefully\r\nto extinguish a native title; nothing is harder than to extinguish a\r\nnative war.\"\r\n\r\nWorsted, though not disgraced, in the field, the dissatisfied Maoris\r\nhave since sought to secure the full measure of political justice to\r\nwhich they believe themselves entitled by more constitutional methods.\r\nAmongst their dreams has been a native Parliament sitting in the\r\nTreaty House, at Waitangi, to approve measures for the betterment of\r\nthe race, which measures would be afterwards adopted by the Government\r\nand given the effect of law. This, however, has been nothing more than\r\na dream. Little better was the _Kotahitanga_, or union, in 1892,\r\nof all the tribes in the north, exclusive of the Kingites who still\r\nremained loyal to their monarchal authority. The policy upon which\r\nthis new union was founded was that of inducing the Government to\r\ncease purchasing native lands, and to set aside as a reserve for the\r\nbenefit of the present and all future Maori generations the\r\nconsiderable areas of native land still unsold. Nor was this all.\r\nLegislation had been passed, not specially directed against, but not\r\nexcepting the native race, placing restrictive conditions upon the\r\noyster fisheries of the country, and this the leaders of the movement\r\nheld to be a breach of the second clause of the treaty, which\r\nguaranteed to them not only the free use and control of their lands\r\nand their forests, but of their fisheries also. The deprivation of\r\ntheir right to freely gather food from the sea and the sea-shore was,\r\ntogether with other grievances, sufficient to galvanise them into\r\npolitical activity, and the _Kotahitanga_ was formed with the meteoric\r\nHone Heke[193] at its head. The Native Rights Bill was introduced by\r\nhim and rejected by Parliament, but the movement was not without its\r\nfruits, for in 1900 part of their purpose was achieved in the\r\nconcessions made by the Government in the Native Land Administration\r\nAct and the Maori Councils Act.\r\n\r\nWith the accomplishment of these aims, and the early death of Heke,\r\nthe _Kotahitanga_ has failed to preserve its former vitality; but\r\nbrief as was its career, it must be recorded of it that in its\r\ninception and activities it was, as most Maori movements have been,\r\nnot an organisation designed to aid in the evasion of the treaty, but\r\nrather to insist upon the due observance of its contracts.\r\n\r\nFew Legislatures in the world have had a more difficult task than has\r\nfallen to the lot of that of New Zealand in legislating for the Maori\r\nso as to preserve his nationality, his rights, his liberties, and yet\r\nnot bar the progress of the European state. That it has been\r\nembarrassed times without number by the treaty is undoubted, and\r\ntherefore it is the more to its credit that the diplomatic bargain\r\nwhich has now held good for the better part of a century should have\r\nbeen so little violated. The treaty has been the broad foundation upon\r\nwhich the intricate structure of native legislation has been reared\r\nthrough all these years; and if there has ever been as there must have\r\nbeen under changing conditions trespass upon the strict letter of the\r\ncompact, it is safe to assert that this variation has only occurred\r\nwhen Parliament has been honestly satisfied that the wider interests\r\nof the State as a whole demanded the departure. At no time has the\r\nLegislature been callously unmindful of the true spirit of the treaty,\r\nor careless of the great trust imposed upon it as the guardian\r\nof native rights.[194] This commendable endeavour to observe that\r\n\"justice which is the paramount interest of all men and all\r\nCommonwealths\" has finally led to a universal acceptance of the treaty\r\nby the native race as the basis of their civil and political\r\nprivileges. So far is this the fact, that to-day the Maori is more\r\ninsistent upon a due observance of its covenants than is the European.\r\nThe present generation of natives accept it unquestioningly; and long\r\nbefore the \"Old Guard\" of objectors had passed away they, too, were\r\nbeginning to realise that the sacrifice of their independence was more\r\nthan compensated for by the protection of the British flag. They felt\r\nthe irresistible sweep of the white tide that had surged upon their\r\nshores, and much as they might regret the passing of their ancient\r\n_mana_, they were compelled to acknowledge the force of truth in\r\nthe figurative statement of their diminishing power once propounded to\r\nthem by Mr. Busby: \"How can the little pebble dam the stream? how can\r\nthe single tree stand against the storm?\"\r\n\r\n[156] \"One cannot but laud the moderation of the English Puritans who\r\nfirst established themselves in New England. Although provided with a\r\ncharter from their Sovereign, they purchased of the savages the land\r\nthey required to occupy. This praiseworthy example was followed by\r\nWilliam Penn, and the colony of Quakers which he conducted into\r\nPennsylvania.\"--Vattel.\r\n\r\n[157] The real discoverer of New Zealand was probably a Polynesian.\r\n\r\n[158] Stowell in his _Maori-English Tutor_ thus defines\r\n_mana_:\r\n\r\n  I speak of potency, the right\r\n  To order things as I may deem;\r\n  I, nothing wanting, have the might\r\n  Which clothes authority supreme.\r\n\r\nSurely as much power as is possessed by any crowned head, and more\r\nthan is possessed by some.\r\n\r\n[159] For some years after the treaty was signed the red blanket was\r\nconsidered amongst the Maoris the hall-mark of distinction, and no\r\nchief who had not received the \"treaty blanket\" was admitted to the\r\nselect circle of their counsels.\r\n\r\n[160] The Kohimarama Conference was summoned at Auckland in July 1860,\r\nby Governor Gore Browne, \"to afford an opportunity of discussing with\r\nhim various matters connected with the welfare and advancement of the\r\ntwo races dwelling in New Zealand.\" It was attended on the opening day\r\nby 112 chiefs from all parts of the country, and next to the meeting\r\nat Waitangi in 1840 is the most important native conference ever\r\nheld.\r\n\r\n[161] \"When casuists afterwards strove to qualify the terms accorded\r\nto the Maoris, the words _tino rangatiratanga_ foiled them.\r\n_Tino_ is an intense expression of fulness, comprehension, and\r\nprecision, and _rangatiratanga_ included all the rights of\r\nchieftainship.\"--Rusden.\r\n\r\n[162] In 1841 a Mrs. Robertson, her two children, and a half-caste\r\nwere murdered at the Bay of Islands by a native named Maketu. The case\r\nwas heard at the first Criminal sitting of the Supreme Court in New\r\nZealand, presided over by Chief-Justice Martin, and was watched with\r\nthe keenest interest by the natives.\r\n\r\n[163] Writing on this point to Lord Stanley in a letter dated Torquay,\r\nJanuary 18, 1845, Lieutenant Shortland remarks: \"I was present at the\r\nseveral meetings of the natives at Waitangi, Hokianga, and Kaitaia for\r\nthe purpose of considering the treaty, and the impression on my mind\r\nat the time was, that the subject was fully understood by them, and\r\nthey were quite aware of the nature of the transaction in which they\r\nwere engaged. I was so impressed with this idea, and so struck with\r\nthe shrewdness and intelligence of many of their remarks at the first\r\nmeeting at Waitangi, that at the subsequent ones I noted down the\r\nspeeches of the chiefs, which all serve to show that the natives not\r\nonly understood the treaty, but that they were peculiarly sensitive\r\nwith regard to every question affecting their lands.\"\r\n\r\n[164] The question of the title to the lands claimed by the\r\nNantes-Bordelaise Company was not dealt with by the New Zealand Land\r\nClaims Commissioners, and became the subject of protracted diplomatic\r\nnegotiations with the French Government. Finally, in 1845, Lord\r\nStanley directed the issue of a grant for 30,000 acres. This area was\r\nafterwards sold to the New Zealand Company, and on the surrender of\r\nits charter the unsold portion became the property of the Crown.\r\n\r\n[165] These two vessels were crossing the line when Captain Hobson\r\ntook possession of the North Island by virtue of the Treaty of\r\nWaitangi.\r\n\r\n[166] _Vide_ his letter to Captain Lavaud, September 20, 1841.\r\n\r\n[167] In his judgment in the case, Regina _v._ Symonds, delivered\r\nin 1847, the late Mr. Justice Chapman laid it down that the\r\npre-emptive right to buy was not limited to the \"first refusal,\" but\r\nconsisted in the right to buy before all others: _i.e._ that the\r\nCrown enjoyed the exclusive right of extinguishing the native title.\r\n\r\n[168] The Bill was passed on August 4. It enacted that all titles to\r\nland in New Zealand were to be absolutely null and void except such as\r\nwere, or might be, allowed by the Queen. The Governor was to appoint\r\ncommissioners to examine and report on all claims to grants of land\r\nwhich might be referred to them by him. They were to be guided by the\r\nreal justice and good conscience of the case. Certain lands, those\r\nreserved for the site of a town or village, for purposes of defence,\r\nor any other public purpose, were not to be recommended by the\r\nCommissioners for grants, but compensation in the shape of other lands\r\nmight be arranged. The claimant had to prove that he had made a\r\npurchase, and there was to be some relation between the quantity of\r\nland granted and the sum expended on its purchase, but as a general\r\nrule no claimant was to receive more than 2560 acres.\r\n\r\n[169] Mr. Busby laid off a portion of his property on the bank of the\r\nWaitangi River as a township, which he dignified by the name of\r\nVictoria. Here he marked off streets, squares, and reserves for public\r\nbuildings, the lots being sold to Sydney speculators and settlers at\r\nKororareka at the rate of from £100 to £400 per acre. Over seventy\r\nyears have elapsed since then, but the great city which was to be is\r\nstill unsubstantial, rude boulders are its cathedrals, and the cabbage\r\npalms wave over its empty market-place.\r\n\r\n[170] Despatch to Lord John Russell, August 16, 1840.\r\n\r\n[171] Amongst these was Tu Hawaiki, the Otago chief, who afterwards\r\nsigned the treaty at the request of Major Bunbury.\r\n\r\n[172] \"In consequence of the animadversions made by me in Council on\r\nthis proceeding of Mr. Wentworth, and particularly of my having said\r\nthat he had, in my opinion, exposed himself to a prosecution for a\r\nconspiracy, Mr. Wentworth has thought proper to resign his commission\r\nas a Magistrate, and (to use his own expression) to separate himself\r\nentirely from any official connection with my Government.\"--_Vide_\r\nthe above Despatch, August 16, 1840.\r\n\r\n[173] \"The more completely Lord Normanby admits the right of the\r\nchiefs to the sovereignty and soil of New Zealand the more fully must\r\nhe rely on the third principle upon which I have said this Bill is\r\nfounded, namely, that Englishmen cannot found colonies without the\r\nconsent of the Crown, and can obtain no titles to lands in colonies\r\nbut from the Crown.\"--Extract from Sir G. Gipps' speech.\r\n\r\n[174] For a further exposition of this point the reader is referred to\r\nwhat has been called the \"classic\" judgment of the late Mr. Justice\r\nChapman in Regina _v._ Symonds, 1847.\r\n\r\n[175] In November 1840 Lord John Russell entered into an agreement\r\nwith the Company, by which they were to become entitled to select out\r\nof the extensive domain claimed by them one acre for every 5s. they\r\ncould prove they had expended upon colonisation in New Zealand. A Mr.\r\nPennington, a London accountant, was appointed to discover what the\r\nCompany's expenditure had been. He reported that they had expended, as\r\nfar as could be ascertained, the sum of £200,000, which on the basis\r\nof the arrangement entered into would have entitled them to select,\r\napproximately, 1,000,000 acres. This the Company asserted to Lord\r\nStanley was a final determination of their rights, and that they were\r\n_ipso facto_ entitled to the land. Lord Stanley, however, held\r\nthat the Company still had to show that they had lawfully and\r\nequitably extinguished the native title over this area, and that for\r\nthis purpose their land must come under investigation by the\r\nCommission. The correspondence is embodied in the Parliamentary papers\r\nof the period.\r\n\r\n[176] Both sides of the Committee appear to have disregarded Major\r\nBunbury's proceedings, not because they had no constitutional value,\r\nbut probably because they were not sufficiently posted in the facts.\r\n\r\n[177] In October 1845, Governor Fitzroy wrote to Lord Stanley: \"I\r\ncannot believe that those most dangerous resolutions of the House of\r\nCommons (Committee) in 1844 respecting unoccupied land, can be adopted\r\nby Her Majesty's Government, but if such should be the fatal case, the\r\nnative population will unite against the settlers and the destruction\r\nof the colony as a field for emigration must result.\"\r\n\r\n[178] _Vide_ his letter to Archdeacon Henry Williams, November\r\n11, 1845.\r\n\r\n[179] Governor Hobson died at 12.15 A.M. on September 10,\r\n1842, at Auckland. Amongst a large section of the Northern Maoris the\r\nbelief was current that he had been _makutaed_ (bewitched) by an\r\nold _tohunga_ (priest) at a banquet, the _tohunga_ being\r\ninstigated by the section of natives who were opposed to the treaty.\r\n\r\n[180] In the previous debate Sir Robert had said: \"If ever there was a\r\ncase where the stronger party was obliged by its position to respect\r\nthe demands of the weaker it was the engagements contracted under such\r\ncircumstances with these native chiefs.\"\r\n\r\n[181] _Vide_ his Ordinance of March 26, 1844. For an able\r\njustification of this measure the reader is referred to Mr. George\r\nClarke's _Final Report_, 1846, the manuscript of which is in the\r\nHocken Collection at Dunedin. The pre-emptive right was finally\r\nabrogated in the Native Land Act of 1862.\r\n\r\n[182] _Vide_ his Despatch to Lord Stanley, December 10, 1845.\r\n\r\n[183] In this he was further assisted by the fact that Mr. Hawes, who\r\nhad been prominent with him in the interests of the New Zealand\r\nCompany, became his Under-Secretary, and Mr. Buller became Lord-Advocate.\r\n\r\n[184] For a critical analysis of Earl Grey's policy at this period,\r\nthe reader is referred to L. A. Chamerovzow's work, _The New Zealand\r\nQuestion_, 1848.\r\n\r\n[185] One writer declared that, \"by Earl Grey's Constitution the\r\nhumbug Treaty of Waitangi is very properly laid on the shelf.\" Another\r\nreferred to it as \"sweeping away all the Treaty of Waitangi nonsense.\"\r\n\r\n[186] Te Wherowhero, who had refused to sign the Treaty of Waitangi,\r\nwas greatly influenced by Governor Grey, and this petition is\r\ninteresting as showing that the chief was beginning to recognise the\r\nsovereignty of the Queen as the accepted order of things.\r\n\r\n[187] \"As was anticipated, the chiefs would not enter into the treaty\r\nwithout the advice of their religious instructors. The Wesleyan chiefs\r\nsaid, in effect, to their Missionaries: 'We do not know the Queen of\r\nEngland, but we know you, and can trust you. If you say that the British\r\nGovernment speaks true about the land, we will believe you, for we\r\nknow you will not deceive us.' The Society's Missionaries, understanding\r\nthat the primary object of the British Government was to throw the\r\nshield of protection over the New Zealand people, and believing that\r\nthe measure proposed was the best for preserving the natives from the\r\nevils by which they were threatened, could not hesitate to assure\r\ntheir people, that, when once the faith of the British Government was\r\npledged, it would be maintained inviolate.\"--_Vide_ Wesleyan Mission\r\nCommittee's Letter to Earl Grey, 1848.\r\n\r\n[188] Correspondence between the Wesleyan Missionary Committee and the\r\nRight Hon. Earl Grey, 1848.\r\n\r\n[189] In a letter received at the Mission House after the Committee's\r\nMemorial had been prepared, the Rev. Thomas Buddle, writing from\r\nAuckland, on July 3, 1847, remarked in reference to lands having no\r\nnative claimants: \"No such lands have yet been discovered in this\r\nIsland. I question much whether there is an acre that has no owner.\"\r\nThe testimony of other Missionaries in the same direction, was, the\r\nCommittee asserted, \"clear and express.\"\r\n\r\n[190] It is instructive to observe that the treaty is no longer\r\ndescribed as \"what has been called the Treaty of Waitangi,\" as it was\r\nin Earl Grey's Despatch, but is now spoken of with respect by Mr.\r\nMerivale as \"The Treaty of Waitangi.\"\r\n\r\n[191] \"I do not think it necessary or convenient to discuss with Mr.\r\nSwainson the justice or the policy of the course which the Queen has\r\nbeen advised to pursue. For the present purpose it is sufficient to\r\nsay Her Majesty has pursued it. All the territories comprised within\r\nthe Commissions for the Government of New Zealand, and all persons\r\ninhabiting those territories, are and must be considered as being to\r\nall intents and purposes within the dominions of the British\r\nCrown.\"--_Vide_ Lord Stanley's Despatch to Acting-Governor\r\nShortland.\r\n\r\n[192] William Thompson, son of Te Waharoa, known as the King-maker.\r\n\r\n[193] A grand-nephew of the chief who led the war of 1845.\r\n\r\n[194] The confiscation of Taranaki lands following upon the Waitara\r\nwar might be held by some to be an exception to this rule, but that\r\nwould depend upon the view taken of the justification for the war. The\r\nbreaches of the treaty, real or alleged, which have occurred in\r\nconnection with the Waitara war and since, have been vigorously stated\r\nby Mr. G. W. Rusden in his _Aureretanga_, published in 1888.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following petitions to the late Queen are interesting as being the\r\nmore recent protests of the Maoris against what they regard as\r\nbreaches of the Treaty of Waitangi.

H. Gordon, G.C.M.G._\r\n\r\nDOWNING STREET, _August 8, 1882_.\r\n\r\nSIR--I have the honour to transmit to you, to be laid before\r\nyour Government, a copy of a memorial to the Queen, which was handed\r\nto me by certain Maori chiefs, complaining of alleged breaches by the\r\nNew Zealand Government of the Treaty of Waitangi, with a printed\r\ntranslation of the same, which I received in a letter from the Rev. P.\r\nWalsh of Parnell, Auckland. I also enclose a newspaper extract, which\r\ngives a brief but fairly accurate account of an interview which I held\r\nwith these chiefs and several members of Parliament, and others who\r\naccompanied them on the occasion.\r\n\r\nI request that you will lay these papers before your Government. You\r\nwill invite them to favour me with any observations they may wish to\r\nmake in regard to the memorial.--I have, etc.,\r\n\r\nKIMBERLEY.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Sir A. H. Gordon.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Her Majesty VICTORIA, the Good Queen of England, and the\r\nEmpress of India, Greeting.\r\n\r\nGo forth, O our messenger, on the soft airs of affection to remote\r\nlands, across the ocean that was trodden by Tawhaki,[195] to Victoria,\r\nthe Queen of England, whose fame for graciousness has extended to all\r\nthe kingdoms of the world, including New Zealand. O Mother, the\r\nreceiver of the sentiments of the great peoples and the small peoples\r\nunder the shade of your authority, Salutations! May the Almighty\r\npreserve you on your Throne, and may men applaud you for your goodness\r\nto your peoples living in these Islands, who are continually directing\r\ntheir eyes toward you, the mother who is venerated by them.\r\n\r\nO Mother, the Queen! on account of the desire to protect these\r\nIslands, your father sent hither, in 1840, Captain Hobson. At that\r\ntime the enlightened administration of England was discovered by us,\r\nand the Maori chiefs came to the conclusion that England, in\r\npreference to other countries, should be the protector of New\r\nZealand--to protect and cherish the Maori tribes of New Zealand. The\r\nconclusion brought about the treaty of Waitangi, and the appointment\r\nof the first Governor, Captain Hobson.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the ignorance of some tribes, including Hone Heke,\r\nthe flagstaff was cut down at Maiki, Bay of Islands, for the tribes in\r\nquestion imagined that the flag was the symbol of land confiscation.\r\nNevertheless, there was no blood in the flagstaff which had been cut\r\ndown, making it needful to raise armies to fight the Maoris. If the\r\nNative chiefs had been summoned to a conference at that time, and\r\nmatters had been explained to them, there would have been no war; but\r\nthe Europeans flew as birds to make war against Heke, which brought\r\nabout the blood-shedding of both Europeans and Maoris.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1860 another evil was brought upon the Maori tribes by the\r\nGovernor himself, who, without any grounds, drove Wiremu Kingi from\r\nhis own lands at Waitara, and this war about land renewed the shedding\r\nof both European and Maori blood. On this occasion, O Mother, the\r\nQueen! the grievous lamentation of this Island was raised, and you\r\nrecalled, in consequence, Governor Gore-Browne, whose administration\r\nclosed here. It was said by the Europeans that William King did wrong\r\nin opposing the Governor; that if William King and party had appealed\r\nto the Supreme Court, the Government act in that case would have been\r\ncondemned. Hence the knowledge of the Taranaki tribes taking up that\r\nopinion, and retaining it up to the capture of Te Whiti and others,\r\nwho did not oppose in fight the Government when it went with an army\r\nto Parihaka, to enkindle Maori strife, thereby endeavouring to find a\r\nbasis to make the Maoris do wrong, and then confiscate their lands.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1862, you, O Queen, sent hither Governor Grey to calm down\r\nthe rain and the wind,[196] so that the sea of both races should be\r\nstill. Governor Grey possessed much wisdom: he understands the Maori\r\nlanguage, also the Maori customs. Notwithstanding, when he came the\r\nsecond time as Governor of these Islands, he rushed hastily away to\r\nTaranaki, and gave instructions for road-making on Maori territory,\r\nthereby bringing about a war and the slaying of many of both races. In\r\nthe year 1863 the war was carried into Waikato, and the Maoris\r\nthroughout the Island were unaware as to the reason why war had been\r\nmade on the Waikato. Now, O Queen, the Waikatos had formed a land\r\nleague, in accordance with the Treaty of Waitangi, to preserve their\r\nnative authority over the land, which principle is embodied in the\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\nO, the Queen! you do not consider that act of retaining their land to\r\nbe unjust; but the Government of New Zealand held it to be wrong,\r\ninasmuch as war was declared against the Waikatos, and the\r\nconfiscation of their land followed, although the Waikatos had no\r\ndesire to fight--the desire came from the Governor and his council.\r\nWhen the Waikatos were overpowered, armies of soldiers went forth to\r\nengender strife against the Maoris at Tauranga, at Te Awa-o-te Atua at\r\nWhakatana, at Ohiwa, at Opotiki, at Turanganui, at Ahuriri, at\r\nWhanganui, at Waimate, and various other places. The motive impelling\r\nthe projectors of these deeds to execute this work was a desire to\r\nconfiscate the Maori lands, and to trample under the soles of their\r\nfeet the Treaty of Waitangi. While these proceedings were being\r\ncarried out, the weeping people wept, the lamenting people lamented,\r\nthe agonised people were in agony, the saddened people were in\r\nsadness, while they held the Treaty of Waitangi as a basis on which\r\nthe voice of the Maoris could be made known to you, O Queen.\r\n\r\nBut the people of New Zealand declared that the fighting and the\r\nconfiscation of land which brought calamity, and made your Maori\r\nchildren orphans, were sanctioned by you, O Queen. We did not believe\r\nthe utterances of the Europeans as to the wrongs we suffered, that\r\nthey were brought upon us by your queenly authority; but our decision\r\nwas that such acts were not sanctioned by you, O Queen, whose\r\nbenevolence towards the Maori people is well known. The disorderly\r\nwork referred to has been carried into practice, so that a path might\r\nbe opened up to Europeans to seize Maori lands.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1881, a new plan was devised by the Government to enkindle\r\nstrife in respect to the Maoris. Armies were sent to Parihaka to\r\ncapture innocent men that they might be lodged in prison; to seize\r\ntheir property and their money, to destroy their growing crops, to\r\nbreak down their houses, and commit other deeds of injustice. We pored\r\nover the Treaty of Waitangi to find the grounds on which these evil\r\nproceedings of the Government of New Zealand rested, but we could find\r\nnone. Some of the European inhabitants of this Island disapproved of\r\nthese injurious doings to Maori men; and it was vaguely rumoured that\r\nSir Arthur Gordon, the Governor, refused to approve of these acts.\r\nMany other evils have been discovered by our hearts, therefore have we\r\nconsidered right, O Mother, the Queen, to pray that you will not\r\npermit increased evils to come upon your Maori children in New\r\nZealand, but to graciously sanction the appointment of a Royal English\r\nCommission to abrogate the evil laws affecting the Maori people, and\r\nto establish a Maori Parliament, which shall hold in check the\r\nEuropean authorities who are endeavouring to set aside the Treaty of\r\nWaitangi; to put a bridle also in the mouth of Ministers for Native\r\nAffairs who may act as Ministers have done at Parihaka, so that all\r\nmay be brought back to obey your laws; and to prevent the continued\r\nwrongs of land matters which are troubling the Maori people through\r\ndays and years; and to restore to the Maoris those lands which have\r\nbeen wrongfully confiscated according to the provisions of the Treaty\r\nof Waitangi; and to draw forth from beneath the many unauthorized acts\r\nof the New Zealand Parliament the concealed treaty, that it may now\r\nassert its own dignity.\r\n\r\nIn this year, 1881, we, O the Queen, built a House of Assembly at the\r\nBay of Islands, and the great symbol therein is a stone memorial, on\r\nwhich has been engraved the articles of the Treaty of Waitangi, so\r\nthat eyes may look thereon from year to year. Two invitations were\r\nsent to the Governor, requesting him to unveil the stone Treaty\r\nMemorial. He did not accede to the request. Perhaps his disinclination\r\narose from the fact that the Europeans had disregarded the principles\r\nembodied in the treaty, because in you, O Queen, is vested the sole\r\nauthority affecting the Waitangi Treaty. Should you authorize, O\r\nMother, the Queen, the appointment in England of a Royal English\r\nCommission, under your queenly seal, to investigate the wrongdoings of\r\nboth races, then will you rightly be informed, O Mother, as to what is\r\njust and what is false.\r\n\r\nIt is believed by us, O Queen, that you have no knowledge as to the\r\ndeeds of wrong that gave us so much pain, and which create lamentation\r\namong the tribes; but if, in your graciousness, a Maori Parliament is\r\nset up, you will, O Queen, be enabled clearly to determine what is\r\nright and what is wrong, what is evil and what is good, in the\r\nadministrations of the two races in these Islands.\r\n\r\nO Mother, the Queen, there are no expressions of disaffection towards\r\nyou by the Maori tribes, including the tribes of the King; but they\r\nrevere, only revere your Majesty; and the search after you, O Queen,\r\nhas induced us to send this petition to England by the hands of the\r\npersons appointed by our Committee, who will see your very countenance\r\nand hear your words.\r\n\r\nO Mother, the Queen, do not suppose that the sufferings under which we\r\nlabour are light. Many wrongs are felt by various tribes, but the\r\nfollowing are some which have come under our own notice:--(1) The\r\nfighting between the Maoris and the New Zealand Company in the year\r\n1841-42 was brought about by land disputes, and Mr. Wakefield fell in\r\nthe strife. (2) The war against Te Rangihaeata in the year 1842-1843:\r\na land dispute also was the origin; and some of Rangihaeata's people\r\nwere wrongly executed, their deaths being opposed to the English law,\r\nand contrary to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi. (3) The war\r\nagainst Heke and Kawiti in 1844-45, caused by land sales and the\r\nwithholding of the anchorage money at Bay of Islands, was contrary to\r\nthe second article of the Treaty of Waitangi. (4) The fighting between\r\nthe chiefs Te Hapuku and Te Moananui in 1848-1849 brought about by\r\nland purchasing on behalf of the Government. (5) The war against\r\nWiremu Kingi on account of the block of land named Waitara, at\r\nTaranaki. (6) The war against the Waikatos in 1863, extending to the\r\nyear 1870. (7) The fight among the Ngatitautahi tribe in 1879, four\r\nNatives killed, the strife being occasioned by the land purchases of\r\nGovernment, a portion of £700,000 having been scattered over our lands\r\nby Government Agents in 1875. (8) The capture of two hundred innocent\r\nmen of Te Whiti in 1879-81. (9) The incarceration of Te Whiti and his\r\npeople in 1881-82, who were guiltless of any crime.\r\n\r\nThe following, O Queen, are references to New Zealand Ordinances put\r\nforth and said to be against the principles contained in the Treaty of\r\nWaitangi: (1) The making of unauthorized laws relating to Maori\r\nlands--namely, the Land Acts of 1862, 1865, 1873, 1880--which Acts\r\nwere not assented to by the Native chiefs in all parts of the Island.\r\nNor is there any basis in the Treaty of Waitangi for these laws, which\r\ncontinuously bring upon our lands and upon our persons great wrongs.\r\n(2) The Immigration and Public Works Act, and the borrowing of\r\n£700,000 expended here and there to confuse the Maoris and their\r\ntitles to land.\r\n\r\nO Mother, the Queen, these other things, and many of the laws that are\r\nbeing carried into effect are, according to Maori ideas, very unjust,\r\ncreating disorder amongst us, giving us heart-pangs and sadness of\r\nspirit to your Maori children, who are ever looking towards you, most\r\ngracious Queen; and it is averred by men of wisdom that these matters\r\nwhich weigh so heavily upon us are in opposition to the great and\r\nexcellent principles of the Treaty of Waitangi.\r\n\r\nMay you be in health, O Mother, the Queen! May the Almighty bring down\r\nupon you, upon your family, and upon the whole of your people the\r\nexalted goodness of Heaven, even up to the termination of your sojourn\r\nin this world, and in your inheritance in the home of sacred rest!\r\n\r\nMay you live, is the prayer of your children in the Island of New\r\nZealand.\r\n\r\n  PARORE TE AWHA,\r\n  HARE HONGI HIKA,\r\n  MAIHI PARAONE KAWITI,\r\n  KINGI HORI KIRA,\r\n  MANGONUI REWA,\r\n  HIRINI TAIWHANGA,\r\n  WIREMU PUHI TE HIHI,\r\n  HAKENA PARORE.\r\n\r\n  For the Native people of New Zealand.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAORI CHIEFS IN LONDON\r\n\r\nYesterday afternoon, a deputation of Maori chiefs, accompanied by\r\nnumerous friends of the Aborigines' Protection Society, waited upon\r\nthe Earl of Kimberley (Secretary of State for the Colonies) at the\r\nColonial Office, for the purpose of seeking redress of grievances\r\nunder which Native tribes, it is alleged, suffer in New Zealand. The\r\nMaori chiefs, three in number, were attired in English dress. They\r\nappeared intelligent men, one of them having his face much tattooed.\r\nTheir names were Wiremu Puhi te Hihi, Hirini Taiwhanga, and Hakena\r\nParore. There were present Sir T. Fowell Buxton; Mr. W. H. James,\r\nM.P.; Mr. T. Fry, M.P.; Sir Wilfred Lawson, M.P.; Sir D. Wedderburn,\r\nM.P.; Mr. W. Rathbone, M.P.; Mr. A. M'Arthur, M.P.; Mr. Alderman\r\nFowler, M.P.; Mr. Brogden, M.P.; Mr. Cropper, M.P.; Mr. Thomasson,\r\nM.P.; the Bishop of Nelson, the Rev. T. Grace (late of New Zealand),\r\nMr. Froome Talfourd, Mr. C. Hancock, Mr. W. Wilson, Mr. G. W. Rusden,\r\nMr. Da Costa, Mr. F. W. Chesson (Secretary of the Aborigines'\r\nProtection Society).\r\n\r\nMr. F. W. Chesson read a letter from Bishop Abraham (the late Bishop\r\nof Wellington) in which he stated that in 1852, Sir John Packington,\r\nbeing the Colonial Minister, framed a Constitution for New Zealand\r\nabsolutely ignoring the 60,000 Natives, who then outnumbered the\r\nEnglish, and who were by the Treaty of Waitangi proclaimed to be as\r\nmuch subjects of the Queen as the English. No Native could vote unless\r\nhe chanced to have a Crown grant, which only a very few had, and this\r\nwas a direct violation of the treaty. It was not till about the year\r\n1865 that four or five Natives were admitted into the Houses of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Nelson then explained the objects the deputation had in\r\nview. He said the three Maori chiefs present had brought with them a\r\npetition to the Queen, signed by Native chiefs, asking for the\r\ninvestigation and redress of grievances under which they laboured, and\r\nthey were desirous of presenting it to Her Majesty, at the same time\r\nrequesting the acceptance of some presents, according to the Maori\r\ncustom. They complained of the incarceration of Te Whiti and his\r\npeople, who, it was alleged, were guiltless of any crime, and also\r\nthat the reserve of land promised had not been properly secured to\r\nthem. The treatment of Te Whiti was the more extraordinary considering\r\nhow much had been condoned in the case of disloyal Natives, while\r\nthroughout the whole of the disturbances he had never been in arms\r\nagainst the Government, but had prevented war, in the full confidence\r\nthat his legal position and claim would be gone into.\r\n\r\nThe petition addressed to \"The Good Queen of England and the Empress\r\nof India,\" and which saluted Her Majesty, \"whose fame for graciousness\r\nhad extended to all the nations of the world,\" as Mother of the Maori\r\ntribes, was then handed to Lord Kimberley.\r\n\r\nLord Kimberley asked whether the petition had been presented to the\r\nGovernor or the Government of New Zealand.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Nelson--\"I think it has not been so presented.\"\r\n\r\nLord Kimberley pointed out that the memorial ought to have been\r\npresented to the Governor and the Government of New Zealand in the\r\nfirst instance, in order to enable him to have their views on the\r\nquestion; and he remarked that under the present circumstances he\r\ncould give no definite answer to the petition.\r\n\r\nThe three Maori chiefs then spoke in their own language, their\r\nstatements being interpreted by the Rev. Mr. Grace. One of the chiefs\r\n(Hirini Taiwhanga) apparently understood a little English, although\r\ndeclining to converse in that tongue. Firstly, they complained that\r\nthe Treaty of Waitangi had not been upheld, and urged that it should\r\nbe maintained, and the English and Native races governed according to\r\nit; secondly, they desired that steps should be taken to unite more\r\nclosely the English and the Native race, instead of the latter being\r\ntreated by the former as a horse treated his enemy--kicking him away;\r\nand, thirdly, they were much concerned at the treatment to which their\r\nfellow-countryman, Te Whiti, was subjected, and they wished him to be\r\nset at liberty.\r\n\r\nIn reply to a question put by Lord Kimberley as to the reason why the\r\npetition had not been presented to the New Zealand Government--\r\n\r\nWiremu Puhi te Hihi said the omission was due to the haste the chiefs\r\nmade to present the Petition to the Queen, as they had heard reports\r\nthat her life had been attempted by assassins. He added that he was\r\nperfectly aware that Her Majesty had given the New Zealand Government\r\npower to deal with its domestic affairs, but he thought the Government\r\nat New Zealand had not acted as the Queen would have done under\r\nsimilar circumstances. He further stated that the Native grievances\r\nextended throughout the Island.\r\n\r\nLord Kimberley requested the interpreter to tell the chiefs that to\r\npass over the Colonial Government, and to endeavour to induce the\r\nImperial Government to act independently, would not tend to the union\r\nof the English and Native races.\r\n\r\nOne of the chiefs (Hakena Parore) said the chiefs had no wish to\r\nignore the New Zealand Government, and they were doing their utmost to\r\ndiminish drunkenness among the Native tribes by means of total\r\nabstinence societies.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilfrid Wilson (of New Zealand) said there was reason to believe\r\nthat some of the Native chiefs who signed the Treaty of Waitangi were\r\nnot the owners of land, and there was a large number of chiefs who\r\nowned land that did not sign the treaty.\r\n\r\nSir T. Fowell Buxton, having observed that a good deal might turn on\r\nthe question whether the treaty was obsolete or not--\r\n\r\nLord Kimberley said the treaty was very simple, and provided that the\r\npossession of land was to be respected. It was not the duty of the\r\nColonial Office to advise the Queen in reference to local matters like\r\nthe present. The management of the land of New Zealand was absolutely\r\nhanded over to the New Zealand Government, and the Queen was advised\r\nby the Ministers of the colony with regard to these matters, and not\r\nby himself, as there could not be two governments for one country. It\r\nhad been decided, as more likely to conduce to the peace of the\r\ncountry, that the affairs of New Zealand should be managed at the\r\ncolony rather than in Downing Street. He had a strong conviction that\r\nthe course was right. The question now raised by the deputation\r\nappeared to be connected with confiscations arising out of wars, and\r\nthe treaty would not be concerned in such confiscations, but the point\r\nwas whether they were just. Having received the petition, he should\r\ntransmit it to the Colonial Government, and ask them to state their\r\nviews with regard to it. It might be thought desirable to issue\r\nanother Royal Commission, but that step rested with the Colonial\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nAt the request of His Lordship, the Interpreter told the chiefs that\r\nthe Queen took a great interest in the welfare of the Native\r\npopulation of New Zealand, and it was a matter of great satisfaction\r\nto Her Majesty that of late years there had been no wars or bloodshed\r\nbetween the two races, which was a happy omen for the future.\r\n\r\nThe deputation then retired.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Premier to His Excellency the Administrator_\r\n\r\nMinisters have had under consideration the despatch from the Secretary\r\nof State, dated the 8th August last, enclosing copy of a memorial to\r\nthe Queen from certain Maori chiefs of New Zealand, and inviting this\r\nGovernment to favour him with any observations they may wish to make\r\nthereupon.\r\n\r\nThe memorial professes to be signed \"For the Native people of New\r\nZealand.\" After full enquiry, Ministers have ascertained that but few\r\nMaoris were aware that such a memorial was to be presented; and that\r\nseveral of those who knew what was intended have no sympathy with the\r\nproceedings of Hirini Taiwhanga, from whom the memorial emanated.\r\n\r\nTaiwhanga belongs to Nga-Puhi, the principal tribe in the northern\r\npart of the North Island. He is not a man of any rank; and he has no\r\nimportance beyond what he has gained in consequence of his abilities\r\nand education. As an intelligent boy, he was educated under the\r\ndirection of the late Bishop Selwyn; and, subsequently it being\r\ndesired to push forward Native youths of promise, he was after due\r\ninstruction appointed by the Government a licensed surveyor. The\r\nappointment was not a success; and in June 1872, his license was\r\nrevoked, in consequence of malpractices, reported by the Inspector of\r\nSurveys and two Judges of the Native Land Court.\r\n\r\nThe Government had for several years been making efforts to establish\r\nschools in Native districts for the education of Maori children, and\r\nin 1877 Taiwhanga was appointed master of such a school at his native\r\nsettlement Kaikohe. His remuneration was a capitation allowance; but\r\nhis conduct in this position was so bad that the school had to be\r\nbroken up. He neglected his work, absented himself from the school and\r\nfrom the settlement, and, by rendering grossly false returns of the\r\nnumber of children attending the school, he obtained money not due to\r\nhim for capitation. Taiwhanga's conduct in other transactions has been\r\nequally open to condemnation.\r\n\r\nThe other two members of the deputation also belong to Nga-Puhi. One\r\nis a grandson and the other a nephew of Parore, a Nga-Puhi chief of\r\nhigh family and of great respectability. He is upwards of ninety years\r\nof age, and was induced by Taiwhanga to provide the money to take his\r\nrelatives as a deputation to England to see the Queen. The men\r\nthemselves are respectable, but have not taken a leading position in\r\ntheir tribe.\r\n\r\nThe only object in giving these particulars is to enable the Secretary\r\nof State to form an opinion as to the weight that should attach to the\r\nstatements and proceedings of the deputation.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the \"wrongs\" detailed in the memorial, Ministers desire\r\nto point out that the first six have reference to transactions during\r\nthe time Native affairs in New Zealand were under the control and\r\nmanagement of the Imperial Government, through their officer, the\r\nGovernor of the colony. A full history of these transactions will no\r\ndoubt be found in the Parliamentary papers, Imperial and Colonial, in\r\nthe Colonial Office; and on reference to such papers, it will be seen\r\nhow little reason the Maoris have to complain.\r\n\r\nThe \"wrong\" standing as No. 7 in the memorial, has relation to a\r\ndispute between two tribes in reference to land, with which the\r\nGovernment of the colony had no connection, and for which they were\r\nnot in any way responsible.\r\n\r\nNos. 8 and 9 refer to recent transactions, for which the Colonial\r\nGovernment were entirely responsible. A full account, and the\r\njustification of the Government's conduct, will be found in the\r\ndocuments from time to time transmitted through the Governor to the\r\nSecretary of State.\r\n\r\nThe special legislation referred to in the memorial as \"unauthorised\r\nlaws relating to Maori lands ... not assented to by the Native chiefs\r\nin all parts of the Island,\" and as having no \"basis in the Treaty of\r\nWaitangi,\" is not restrictive but enabling. The object of the Native\r\nLand Acts enumerated was to provide a special tribunal for the\r\ndetermination of Native title; to relieve the Maori owners from the\r\nmonopoly held by the Government; and to enable them to sell their\r\nlands to whomsoever they pleased. In no way are the provisions of the\r\nActs compulsory. The Maoris were and are at liberty to avail\r\nthemselves of the powers conferred, or to abstain from doing so, at\r\ntheir pleasure.\r\n\r\nIt may be stated that, with the exception of lands confiscated for\r\nrebellion, no land whatever has been taken from the Maoris by the\r\nGovernment. With the exception stated, all lands acquired from Natives\r\nby Government have been acquired from willing sellers, and fully paid\r\nfor. The £700,000 referred to has been paid to them, besides other\r\nlarge sums, for what was to them unprofitable waste.\r\n\r\nThe general legislation of the colony as to the Maoris has been more\r\nthan just--it has been exceptionally favourable to them. When laws\r\nhave been made applicable to the people of the colony, the object has\r\nin many instances been to except the Maoris from their stringency; and\r\nthere is no instance in which they have been placed in a less\r\nfavourable position than the European population. Of the many laws on\r\nthe statute-book of the colony which bear out this statement, one\r\nillustration may be mentioned: the Maoris are specially exempted from\r\nall direct taxes on both real and personal property.\r\n\r\nIt may, indeed, with confidence be asserted generally that there is\r\nnot, and has not been, anything on the statute-book of the colony, or\r\nin the conduct of the Colonial Legislature, as regards the Maoris, to\r\nwhich reasonable exception can be taken.\r\n\r\nFRED WHITAKER.\r\n\r\nWELLINGTON, _December 12, 1882._\r\n\r\n\r\n_His Excellency the Administrator to the Secretary of State for the\r\nColonies_\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT HOUSE, WELLINGTON, _December 16, 1882_.\r\n\r\nMY LORD--With reference to Your Lordship's despatch, No. 33,\r\nof 8th August 1882, transmitting a copy of a memorial to the Queen\r\nfrom certain Maori chiefs of New Zealand, and enclosing a newspaper\r\nextract giving an account of an interview held by Your Lordship with\r\nthose chiefs, and several Members of Parliament and others, I have the\r\nhonour to enclose a memorial from the Prime Minister, Mr. Whitaker,\r\nwhich he has forwarded to me in consequence of the invitation to him\r\nto make observations on the memorial, which invitation was conveyed to\r\nhim by Your Lordship's directions, as already stated in my despatch,\r\nNo. 88, of November 5, 1882.--I have, etc.\r\n\r\nJAMES PRENDERGAST.\r\n\r\nThe Right Hon. the Secretary of State for the Colonies.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Secretary of State for the Colonies to His Excellency the\r\nGovernor_\r\n\r\nCOLONIAL OFFICE, DOWNING STREET, _February 17, 1883_.\r\n\r\nSIR--I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your\r\ndespatch, No. 102, of the 16th December last, transmitting a\r\nmemorandum from the Prime Minister, Mr. Whitaker, on the subject of a\r\nmemorial placed in the hands of my predecessor, by certain Maori\r\nchiefs of New Zealand for presentation to the Queen, complaining of\r\nalleged breaches by the New Zealand Government of the Treaty of\r\nWaitangi, and praying for the appointment of a Royal Commission in\r\nconnection with the laws of the colony affecting the Maoris, and for\r\nthe establishment of a Maori Parliament.\r\n\r\nHaving given these papers my attentive consideration, I request that\r\nyou will cause the petitioners to be informed that their petition,\r\nwhich has now been reported on by the Colonial Government, has been\r\nlaid before the Queen, who was pleased to receive it very graciously;\r\nbut that I have been unable to advise Her Majesty to give any\r\ndirections for a compliance with the prayer of the memorialists.--I\r\nhave, etc.\r\n\r\nDERBY.\r\n\r\nThe Officer administering the Government of New Zealand.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Native Office to Parore te Awha and others_\r\n\r\n(Translation)\r\n\r\nNATIVE OFFICE, WELLINGTON, _April 17, 1883_.\r\n\r\nFRIENDS--In reference to the petition which you and certain\r\nother Natives have addressed to Her Majesty the Queen, complaining of\r\nalleged breaches by the New Zealand Government of the Treaty of\r\nWaitangi, and praying for the appointment of a Royal Commission in\r\nconnection with the laws of the colony affecting the Maoris, and for\r\nthe establishment of a Maori Parliament, I am instructed to acquaint\r\nyou that His Excellency the Governor has received a despatch, bearing\r\ndate 17th February from the Secretary of State for the Colonies, upon\r\nthe subject of your petition.\r\n\r\nIn his despatch, Lord Derby requests that you should be informed that\r\nthe petition, which has been reported on by the Colonial Government,\r\nhas been laid before the Queen, who was pleased to receive it very\r\ngraciously.

I have received your letter\r\nacquainting me with the result of the petition taken by Wiremu Reweti\r\nte Puhi, Hihi Parore, Hirini Rawiri Taiwhanga, and Hakena te Parore to\r\nEngland. I myself sent those persons to England to lay our grievances\r\nbefore the Queen--that is, before all her governing power--because all\r\nthe grievances that we, the Maoris, suffer from arise from the colony\r\nof New Zealand; hence our petition for the establishment of a Native\r\nParliament in New Zealand. It was not done with the object of\r\ntrampling on the authority of the Government of New Zealand. No! but\r\nwe think that the Queen's authority should be exercised directly over\r\nus. We, the Maori people, are entirely subject to the authority of our\r\nmost gracious Queen Victoria. The leading people in England say that\r\nit is the Europeans of New Zealand who oppress the Maori people. Well\r\nthen, friend, do you write to me on the receipt of this letter. May\r\nGod protect us both.--From your sincere Friend,\r\n\r\nPARORE TE AWHA.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORIAL OF TAWHIAO AND OTHERS TO THE QUEEN\r\n\r\n_The Right Hon. the Earl of Derby to Sir W. F. D.

Jervois, G.C.M.G., C.B., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nENCLOSURE (Confidential)\r\n\r\nSalutations!--May the Queen and her family long live! May her\r\nGovernment and the people of England live! May God protect you!\r\n\r\nThis is an address from the Maori chiefs to the people of England.\r\nStrangers landed on a strange land:\r\n\r\nWe, the Maori chiefs of New Zealand, have come to this distant land\r\ninto your presence, on account of the great disaster which has\r\novertaken your Maori race, which is beloved by the Queen and the\r\npeople of England. Accordingly we have now swum the Ocean of Kiwa,\r\nwhich lies between us, and have reached England in safety, the source\r\nand fountain of authority, to the place where the Queen lives, that\r\nshe may redress the ills of the Maori race inflicted on them by the\r\nGovernment of New Zealand, who have not directed their attention to\r\nright those wrongs up to the present time, and those wrongs are still\r\nbeing committed; nor is it because the Maoris are adhering to evil\r\npractices, and so causing trouble between the two races; and\r\ntherefore, owing to this continued inattention of the Government, this\r\nis presented as an appeal to the highest authority. And because there\r\nwas a tender regard displayed by the Queen to her Maori race, as shown\r\nin the Treaty of Waitangi, therefore it is well that those contracts\r\nand these ills should be brought before you for your consideration.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the words of the Queen were, that Victoria, Queen of England,\r\nin her kind regard to the chiefs and the tribes of New Zealand,\r\nsecured that their rights of chieftainship and their lands should be\r\nestablished to them, and that peace should be made with them.\r\n\r\nSecondly, that the Queen of England shall order and consent that the\r\nchiefs and tribes of New Zealand preserve their chieftainships, their\r\nlands, their villages, their forests, and their fisheries.\r\n\r\nThirdly, that the Government of the Queen shall consent and order that\r\nthe Queen shall protect the Maoris of New Zealand, and shall give them\r\nher laws in like manner as they are given to the people of England.\r\n\r\nBut these contracts have been trampled upon by the Government without\r\nexception. The first case of the Government purchasing land was in the\r\nyear 1855. They paid a deposit for lands to some tribes without\r\nknowing whether the lands belonged to them, and much land in the\r\nWaikato, Hawke's Bay, and other places was bought in this manner; and\r\nin consequence the Maoris drew a boundary at the Mangatawhiri River,\r\nto separate the ground still held by the Maoris, and set up a head,\r\nnamely, Potatau[197]--of the Maori people, who should prevent disputes\r\nbetween the Natives who sold and those who retained their lands,\r\nalways acknowledging the supremacy of the Queen; and this provision\r\nwas made over all lands throughout Taranaki, Taupo, and other parts.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1858 the Government purchased Waitara from Te Teira,\r\nWiremu Kingi, the paramount chief of that tribe, prohibiting the sale;\r\nbut the Government sanctioned the purchase from Te Teira. Wiremu Kingi\r\ndrove off the surveyors, and the Government waged war throughout\r\nTaranaki and confiscated the land.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1863 a proclamation was issued by the Government that all\r\nthe Natives adhering to the resolve not to part with their lands\r\nshould retire across the boundary-line at Mangatawhiri; they went and\r\nthe Government followed them across the boundary and fought them.\r\nAnother Proclamation from the Government declared that the Waikato\r\nchiefs adhering to the Queen should aid General Cameron, and that the\r\nGovernment would protect their persons, their lands, and their\r\nproperty. Te Wheoro and his tribe aided General Cameron up to the very\r\nlast, but their lands (amounting to about 200,000 acres) and property\r\nwere confiscated, and a very little portion of the land was returned;\r\nthe bulk was sold by the Government to the English, and up to the\r\npresent day no compensation has been made. For the property destroyed\r\nthe Court ordered compensation to be made; but the Government refused\r\nto comply.\r\n\r\nThe question of the lands thus seized was laid before the Committee of\r\nMaori Affairs of the House of Parliament in the year 1879, and again\r\nin the years 1880 and 1881, and the unanimous reply was made that the\r\nGovernment should specially appoint a Commission to investigate that\r\nseizure; but the Government refused to accede to this proposal.\r\n\r\nOn the seizure of the lands at Taranaki in the year 1863, a law was\r\nmade that seven years were to be allowed for the Government to place\r\nsettlers on the land, but failing to do so within that time, that the\r\nland should revert to the Maoris. The year 1870 arrived, and the\r\nGovernment had failed to settle the land, and the land was returned by\r\nthe Native Minister, Donald M'Lean, who said that the Government\r\nshould purchase the land at 5s. or 7s. per acre; but the Government\r\ndid not purchase it.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1879 the Government began to seize the land without any\r\npretext, arrested Te Whiti and party in their homes, destroyed their\r\nhouses, rooted up their crops, and removed their goods, surveyed the\r\nland, put it into the market, and it was bought by the English, and\r\nvery small portions were returned to the Natives. For twelve months\r\nTe Whiti and party were imprisoned and were never tried; they were\r\nthen released, but are still under some restraining law of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nWhen the lands in the South Island were bought by a Commission from\r\nthe Queen the Commission stipulated that, on the Maoris consenting to\r\nthe conditions, the villages, the fisheries, and one acre in every ten\r\nshould be reserved to the Maoris, and to this the Maoris agreed; but\r\non the completion of the sale the conditions were and have been\r\ndisallowed down to the present time. A Commission was instituted in\r\nthe year 1879; but the Government was not pleased to give effect to\r\nits awards.\r\n\r\nRespecting the land at Kawhia. Before the establishment of the\r\nGovernment some Europeans resided at Kawhia; the Maoris allowed their\r\nresidence for the purpose of trade, and rent was paid to the Natives\r\nby these Europeans; the Maoris in ignorance signed their names, and,\r\nas they paid for the goods received, were unaware that their names\r\nwere obtained for a purpose. On arrival of fresh Europeans the lands\r\nwere sold to the new arrivals, and these demanded a Crown grant from\r\nthe Government, which was granted, though the Maoris were kept in\r\nignorance of the transaction: and thus the Government dealt with the\r\nground and ultimately bought it for themselves, and not until it was\r\nbeing surveyed were the Maoris aware that their land was alienated.\r\nNor did the Government enquire of the Maoris whether the claims of the\r\nEuropeans were just, and the Maoris condemned the transaction.\r\n\r\nThe Government submitted a Bill to Parliament to authorise them to put\r\nthe land into the market, and the Bill was passed by the Parliament,\r\nthe Maori members dissenting, and submitting a letter to the Governor,\r\nasking him to withhold his consent to the Bill, and the letter was\r\nforwarded to the Queen. In the year 1883 the land was thrown into the\r\nmarket by the Government, and the Kawhia River was buoyed; the Maoris\r\nthen gathered together to prevent this, and Tawhiao[198] said to the\r\nGovernment, through the Native Minister, Mr. Bryce, \"Let the staking\r\nof the river be done by him.\" But Mr. Bryce refused, and all the land\r\nwas surveyed by the Government, and soldiers were placed on the land\r\nof the King, and works were pushed forward on the King's land, and the\r\nGovernment said that they, acting with Rewi and party, should decide\r\nthe boundary of the King's land, to which Rewi and party agreed. When\r\nthat was settled the Government commenced operations, not confining\r\nthemselves to what was agreed upon, at which Rewi severed himself from\r\nany further connection with the operations of the Government, when he\r\nsaw that the King party suffered loss; and this is an example of the\r\nconduct of the Government in all their transactions in Maori matters.\r\n\r\nThe Native Land Court was instituted in the year 1866 by the\r\nGovernment, and that measure for dealing with Maori lands was adopted\r\nin order to destroy the rights of the Maoris over their own land,\r\nrights secured to them by the Queen in the Treaty of Waitangi.\r\n\r\nA fresh rule was thus established, by which the Court had full powers,\r\nits authority was entirely in European hands, and the Maoris were\r\ndenied all authority. It was established that ten persons were to be\r\nallowed claims over any section of ground, the majority were to rest\r\nsatisfied with no land to live on, and the lands were ultimately\r\nalienated by purchase. Another rule was set up by the Court, that if\r\nthe claimants failed to present themselves to the Court the land\r\nshould be handed over to others, and thus the lands were sold,\r\nincluding the lands, the homesteads, and the plantations, and the real\r\nowners of the land were left destitute. When the Maori race asked that\r\nthey might be allowed to deal with their own lands by means of their\r\nown committees, the Government declined. In cases where Europeans\r\npurchased land from Maoris who received money for lands not theirs,\r\nthe purchase thus made was established to the purchasers. Assessors\r\nwere, indeed, appointed for the Court, but they had no power to say\r\nanything with regard to the lands dealt with by the Court. Te Wheoro\r\nwas the first Assessor thus summoned in the year 1866; but when he saw\r\nthese faults he left it in the year 1872.\r\n\r\nThe rights of the chiefs over their own lands were disallowed by the\r\nGovernment, and the positions of the chiefs, in accordance with their\r\nMaori customs, was swept away; for the chiefs had the power to secure\r\nthe land for themselves and their tribes, lest the land and the\r\npersons should be lost (by other tribes seizing it) and their rights\r\nwere reduced to an equality with ordinary persons, and their words\r\nwere allowed no weight in retaining their land or in directing the\r\naffairs of their own tribes: but the Government gave the rights of\r\nruling to all kinds of persons, and the ruling of these persons,\r\npossessing no tribal rights in the eyes of the race itself, was\r\nauthorised, the Government merely regarding their own appointments in\r\nrespect to these lands; and thus the Government were able to set aside\r\nand ignore the chiefs.\r\n\r\nMaori Assessors were appointed by the Government to rule their own\r\nMaori race; only they had no powers. All powers of establishing and\r\ndirecting were retained by the Government, and even this is now being\r\nset aside.\r\n\r\nMaori representatives were established by the Government, but a\r\nprohibitive rule was made by which the number of members were limited\r\nto four, and, though the Maoris demanded a representation proportionate\r\nto their numbers, this has been refused by the Government up to the\r\npresent time; and these members have only nominal power and are unable\r\nto redress the Maori wrongs, and yet the Europeans have only an equal\r\nstatus with the Maoris. The commission charged by the Government on\r\nthe monies paid for Maori lands, whether sold or leased, exceeds 25\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nThe payments arising from gold-bearing lands--_i.e._ 10s. per\r\nminer's right, and duties on goods--are taken by the Government, and\r\nnone are returned to the Maori race, nor are the Maoris allowed any\r\nvoice in directing these taxes; all are taken by the Government for\r\nthe benefit of the Europeans, and the Maoris are left out of all\r\nconsideration; and the result of all this is that the Government have\r\ntaken the lands, the persons, and the rights of the Maori; the Maoris\r\nstill lay claim to their rights, and this has been a cause of trouble,\r\nand troubles have also come on other Europeans, as happened at Marunui\r\nand other places throughout the whole Island, all from these acts of\r\nthe Government. A Commission sat to investigate these wrongs at\r\nNapier. Te Wheoro, another Maori, and two Europeans sat, but the\r\nEuropeans and the Maoris failed to agree, no decision was arrived at,\r\nand the lands were lost, and the Maoris, frightened at such dealings,\r\nretired to a remnant of the land of their ancestors in the King\r\nCountry, and yet they are being even now pursued.\r\n\r\nTe Wheoro rose in the Parliament of 1880, and, addressing the\r\nGovernment, asked them to give to the Maoris the office of Minister of\r\nMaori Affairs, then filled by Mr. Bryce, inasmuch as it was a post for\r\nthe Maoris, and yet Europeans alone filled the office, though Maori\r\nnames were mentioned for the office; and this is a wrong done to the\r\nMaoris, inasmuch as the Queen had given them rights. Mr. Bryce replied\r\nthat the office should never belong to the Maoris.\r\n\r\nTherefore we and our race have determined, and to us, the representatives\r\nof the tribes of New Zealand, has been assigned the work of crossing\r\nthe ocean and of bringing our wrongs to the Queen and people of\r\nEngland, in whose hands lay the words of life and death, that they\r\nshould send and give to the Maori race laws whereby they may live,\r\nlike as our friends the Europeans who sent and asked to have a\r\nParliament of their own, and which was agreed to by the Queen; the\r\nMaoris remaining in ignorance that their friends (the Europeans) had\r\nasked for a Parliament subsequent to the Treaty of Waitangi.\r\n\r\nTherefore we pray for our Maori race that our Queen may cherish us,\r\nthat she may accede to this our prayer, and grant to us, her Maori\r\nrace, these humble requests. And firstly, that you will resolutely\r\nconsent to grant a Government to your Maori subjects, to those who are\r\nliving on their own lands or those of their ancestors, and within the\r\nlimits of Maori territory, that they may have power to make laws\r\nregarding their own lands and race, lest they perish by the ills which\r\nhave come upon them; that they may be empowered so to direct\r\nthemselves and their own lands lest they be altogether destroyed by\r\nthe practices of the Government, unknown and not evident to the\r\nMaoris; and that also the Maoris possessing lands contiguous to the\r\nEuropeans should have those lands brought under the direction of the\r\nsaid Maori Government, for there are many tribes who thus own land,\r\nand which they will not long hold unless thus brought under Maori\r\nGovernment; and these Maoris are those who are suffering most at the\r\npresent time, and they will be unable to save themselves unless some\r\nsuch means are taken for their preservation.\r\n\r\nSecondly, that the Queen and her Government consent to the appointment\r\nof a Maori Commissioner, appointed by the Queen, one of the Maori\r\nrace, one adhering to the Queen, an upright man, who shall act as\r\nmediator between the Maori and European races in matters touching the\r\nleasing and selling of the lands of your Maori subjects, who shall\r\ninvestigate the laws made by the Maori Government, make them feasible,\r\nand to write his opinion to your Governor and to you also for your\r\nconfirmation, lest the Maori legislation be at variance with that of\r\nthe Government, and lest the Maori should fail to carry out the laws\r\nof the Government respecting them.\r\n\r\nThirdly, that the greater portion of the taxes levied on your Maori\r\nsubjects be returned to them, to enable them to carry on their\r\nGovernment, granted by you to your Maori subjects, in those parts\r\nwhich are Maori territory.\r\n\r\nFourthly, that the European Judges in the Native Land Court be\r\nsuperseded, and that your Maori race be then permitted to direct their\r\nown affairs in that Court; that they may be empowered to appoint\r\ntheir own Judges over their own lands, lest they be all lost by the\r\npresent doings of the Court; that they may be able to deal with these\r\nlands in accordance with their own customs, apportioning to each tribe\r\ntheir share, and, having made all ready for leasing or selling, to\r\nsubmit all rulings to the Commissioner appointed by you, that he may\r\nlook into the whole affair and see that no injurious effects come upon\r\nthe Maori, and then he is to submit all to your Governor for\r\nconfirmation.\r\n\r\nFifthly, that the lands wrongly obtained by the Government be returned\r\nto us. That all may be in accordance with the concessions made in the\r\nWaitangi Treaty and all other contracts made with your Maori subjects.\r\nThat the Queen and her Government also appoint some person from\r\nEngland--a person independent of the Government of New Zealand--who\r\nshall carefully investigate those wrongs, and if he finds them in\r\naccordance with what we have now presented before you, that then he\r\nshould decide whether the lands of your wronged subjects be returned\r\nor a compensation be made for part of it.\r\n\r\nWe, your Maori race, confidently rely on the Treaty of Waitangi, on\r\nits provisions and force, and we will be led by those provisions in\r\nthese matters for which we have now swum the ocean of Kiwa, and we\r\npray in the presence of the Queen that she will confirm her words\r\ngiven in that treaty, that it may not be trampled upon by the\r\nGovernment of New Zealand in anything they may do to annul that treaty.\r\n\r\nLet the Queen live! Here we conclude. May God preserve you!\r\n\r\n  TAWHIAO,\r\n  WIREMU TE WHEORO,\r\n  PATARA TE TUHI,\r\n  TOPIA TUROA,\r\n  HORI ROPIHANA.\r\n\r\nI hereby certify that the above is a true translation of the petition,\r\nmade by me this 15th day of July 1884.\r\n\r\nFRED H. SPENCER, Clerk in Holy Orders.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir W. F. D. Jervois to the Right Hon. the Earl of Derby_\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT HOUSE, WELLINGTON, _March 28, 1885_.\r\n\r\nMY LORD--With reference to Your Lordship's Despatch, No. 46,\r\ndated the 9th August last, concerning a memorial from Maori chiefs, I\r\nhave the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a memorandum from my\r\nMinisters. I also enclose copies of the Acts of the Colonial\r\nParliament referred to therein.\r\n\r\nI regret that I have been unable to send Your Lordship an earlier\r\nreply. The delay, however, has been caused by the fact that the Native\r\nMinister desired to visit the Maori districts before my Government\r\nfurnished me with a memorandum on the subject. Full reports of the\r\nseveral meetings held by him with the Natives will be forwarded by the\r\nnext mail.\r\n\r\nI beg to refer Your Lordship to my Despatch, No. 9, dated the 1st\r\nMarch 1884, in which I have stated my own views with regard to the\r\nposition of the Native race in this colony.--I have, etc.\r\n\r\nWM. F. DRUMMOND JERVOIS.\r\n\r\nThe Right Hon. the Earl of Derby.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM FOR HIS EXCELLENCY\r\n\r\nMinisters present their respectful compliments to the Governor, and\r\nbeg to inform His Excellency that they have considered the memorial\r\nfrom Maori chiefs referred to in the despatch from Lord Derby, No. 46,\r\nof 9th August 1884.\r\n\r\nMinisters are of opinion that they would least embarrass Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment by referring only to the period since 1865, when Her\r\nMajesty's troops were removed, when for the first time the colony was\r\nleft to manage the Natives without interference by the representatives\r\nof Her Majesty in the colony. It is quite certain that since that\r\nperiod there has been no infraction of the Treaty of Waitangi. As it\r\nis clear that if there was an infraction previously Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment and Imperial funds would be liable for the same, Ministers\r\ndeem it more respectful not to express an opinion on the subject, but\r\nto leave Her Majesty's Advisers in Great Britain to arrive at their\r\nown conclusions.\r\n\r\nAs to the provisions of section 71 of the Constitution Act (15 and 16\r\nVict. cap. 72), Ministers would remark that it appears from the very\r\nterms of the section that the Imperial Parliament contemplated that\r\nthat section should only be used for a short time and under the then\r\nspecial circumstances of the colony. The words used in the section\r\nare, \"It may be expedient,\" \"Should for the present be maintained.\" So\r\nfar as allowing the laws, customs, and usages of the Natives in all\r\ntheir relations to and dealings with each other to be maintained,\r\nMinisters would point out that this has been the policy of all the\r\nNative Land Acts. The Courts that have to deal with Native land--and\r\nit is the land that to the Natives seems the most important--decide\r\naccording to Native customs or usages (_vide_ \"Native Land Courts Act,\r\n1880,\" section 24; see also sections 5 and 6 of \"The Native Lands\r\nFrauds Prevention Act, 1881,\" and section 6 of \"The Native Land Laws\r\nAmendment Act, 1883\").\r\n\r\nRegarding the proclamation of Native districts the County of Waipa is\r\npractically a Native district, and if the Natives desired such a form\r\nof local government as the Counties Act affords, there would be no\r\ndifficulty in granting their request by the Colonial Parliament. What,\r\nhowever, the petitioners desire is really the setting-up of a\r\nParliament in certain parts of the North Island which would not be\r\nunder the control of the General Assembly of New Zealand. Seeing that\r\nin the Legislative Council and the House of Representatives the\r\nNatives are represented by able chiefs, and that they have practically\r\nno local affairs to look after that cannot be done by their\r\nCommittees--local bodies recognised by the Government--Ministers do\r\nnot deem it necessary to point out the unreasonableness and absurdity\r\nof such a request.\r\n\r\nMinisters have not deemed it necessary to go seriatim through the\r\nallegations of the petition and show their unsubstantiality. A former\r\nPremier, Sir Frederick Whitaker, specially dealt with a petition very\r\nsimilar to the one now under consideration (see memorandum, 12th\r\nDecember 1882, addressed to His Excellency the Governor, in Appendix\r\nto the Journals of the House of Representatives, A-6, page 5); and a\r\nformer Native Minister, Mr. Bryce, wrote a memorandum referring to the\r\nalleged ill-treatment of the Maoris (see memorandum for His\r\nExcellency, 11th January 1884, A-1, page 11, in Appendix, vol. i.,\r\n1884). The despatch of Your Excellency, No. 9, of the 1st March 1884,\r\nforwarding the memorandum of Mr. Bryce, also combated the statements\r\nof the Maori chiefs who had petitioned.\r\n\r\nMinisters do not consider that there is any allegation in this\r\npetition that has not been before the Imperial Government, replied to\r\nby the colony, and dealt with before.\r\n\r\nROBERT STOUT.\r\n\r\nWELLINGTON, _March 12, 1885_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Right Hon. the Earl of Derby to Sir W. F. D. Jervois_\r\n\r\nDOWNING STREET, _June 23, 1885_.\r\n\r\nSIR--I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Despatch,\r\nNo. 39, of the 28th of March, transmitting a memorandum from your\r\nMinisters in reference to the memorial of the Maori chiefs, which was\r\npresented on the occasion of the interview which took place at this\r\noffice on the 23rd July 1884.\r\n\r\nI request that you will inform Tawhiao and the other chiefs who signed\r\nthe memorial that, as stated in the letter to them of the 13th August\r\nlast, the attention of the Government of New Zealand was called to the\r\nrepresentations which it contains, and that the reply of your\r\nAdvisers--a copy of which I request you to transmit to them at the\r\nsame time--has been received and considered by Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe questions to which the memorial relates have also been discussed\r\nin the House of Commons with many expressions of sympathy for the\r\nMaori race, and of belief that their interests and their customs would\r\nbe guarded and respected by the Government of New Zealand. The\r\nfeeling, at the same time, appeared to be general that while the\r\nGovernment of the Queen in this country has no longer its former power\r\nand responsibility in regard to the internal affairs of New Zealand,\r\nit should use its good offices with the Colonial Government with the\r\nview of obtaining for the Natives all the consideration which can be\r\ngiven to them.\r\n\r\nI trust that all who sympathise with and wish well to the Maoris will\r\nagree that it is most important for them to understand clearly that\r\nunder the present Constitution of New Zealand the government of all\r\nHer Majesty's subjects in the islands is controlled by Ministers\r\nresponsible to the General Assembly, in which the Natives are\r\nefficiently represented by persons of their own race, and that it is\r\nno longer possible to advise the Queen to interfere actively in the\r\nadministration of Native affairs any more than in connection with\r\nother questions of internal government. I observe, however, with\r\nsatisfaction that it is in contemplation to increase the number of the\r\nNative representatives.\r\n\r\nAlthough, therefore, Her Majesty's Government cannot undertake to give\r\nyou specific instructions as to the applicability at the present time\r\nof any particular stipulations of a treaty which it no longer rests\r\nwith them to carry into effect, they are confident--as I request that\r\nyou will intimate to your Ministers--that the Government of New\r\nZealand will not fail to protect and to promote the welfare of the\r\nNatives by a just administration of the law, and by a generous\r\nconsideration of all their reasonable representations. I cannot doubt\r\nthat means will be found of maintaining to a sufficient extent the\r\nrights and institutions of the Maoris without injury to those other\r\ngreat interests which have grown up in the land, and of securing to\r\nthem a fair share of that prosperity which has of necessity affected\r\nin many ways the conditions of their existence.--I have, etc.,\r\n\r\nDERBY.\r\n\r\nGovernor Sir W.

I wrote back to\r\nthe Secretary of State, and enclosed a memorandum from the Government\r\nof New Zealand. The Secretary of State has again written to me, and\r\nrequested me to send to you copies of these letters. I therefore\r\nenclose translations.\r\n\r\nYou will see from the last letter of the Secretary of State that he\r\nsays that the Government of all Her Majesty's subjects in New Zealand,\r\nMaori as well as European, is controlled by Ministers responsible to\r\nthe Parliament at Wellington, in which there are Maori representatives,\r\nand that the Government in London cannot interfere in the internal\r\naffairs of the colony.--From your Friend,\r\n\r\nWM.

Greeting to you, and all the honourable\r\nmembers of the Parliament of the colony!\r\n\r\nYou have written to inform me of the receipt by the Government of New\r\nZealand of a despatch from Lord Derby, in which he acknowledges the\r\nreceipt of the letter expressing the satisfaction of the Ngatikahungunu\r\nat the principles laid down by us and Lord Derby in England.\r\n\r\nFriend, I did send such a letter to Lord Derby, and the information\r\ncontained in Lord Derby's despatch to you is correct--namely, that he\r\ndoes not doubt that any well-founded complaints on the part of the\r\nMaoris will be dealt with fairly by the Government of New Zealand, to\r\nwhich Her Majesty has given over the whole question.\r\n\r\nFriend, I am greatly pleased at the receipt of your letter. I was\r\nabsent at Mohaka, the Wairoa, and the Mahia, where I went to make\r\nknown the principles laid down by us and Lord Derby, in order that my\r\nMaori tribes might hear my report of my visit to England. On my return\r\nfrom England I addressed the Maoris, and the people of my district\r\nwere greatly pleased with what I told them. It is true that they have\r\njoined the Blue Ribbon Army,[199] and keep it faithfully.\r\n\r\nFriend, continue to carry out a policy that will benefit the\r\nMaoris in accordance with what Lord Derby said--namely, that any\r\nwell-founded complaints on the part of the Maoris will be dealt with\r\nfairly by the Government of New Zealand--and justify Her Majesty's\r\naction in giving over the whole question to be dealt fairly with by\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nI know what course of policy would be beneficial to the Maori people\r\nand establish friendly relations.

I have received your letter of the 27th of August,\r\nwith the copies of communications from yourself, your Ministers, and\r\nHer Majesty's Government relative to the subject-matter of the\r\npetition from the Maori people that I and my fellow Native chiefs took\r\nto lay before Her Majesty's Government and the people of England. In\r\nyour letter you inform us of one only of the words of Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment--namely, that the government of all Her Majesty's subjects\r\nin New Zealand is controlled by Ministers responsible to the\r\nParliament. Your so informing us is well. But you did not also inform\r\nus of another important word of the Government of England with\r\nreference to the Maori people--namely, that you should intimate to\r\nyour Government that they should protect and promote the welfare of\r\nthe Natives by a generous consideration of all their reasonable\r\nrepresentations. Well, we see that these directions from the\r\nGovernment of England are no mere random words, but have a bearing\r\nupon the petition, which petition your Ministers said had no\r\nsignificance, and that England would not interfere. Your\r\ncommunications and those of the Government of England have been\r\ncirculated among the Maori people of this Island.\r\n\r\nHowever, with reference to the statement made by your Ministers that\r\nthey do not consider that there is any allegation in this petition\r\nthat they have not answered before, I and my fellow Native chiefs\r\nwould say, Where are the replies taking exception to those petitions?\r\nAnd why are they not quoted in connection with this petition for the\r\nconsideration of the Native people? And who is it that can say that\r\nthe complaints raised in those petitions are similar to those made in\r\nthis?\r\n\r\nAnd, further, with reference to the statement that since 1865 England\r\nceased to interfere in the management of affairs in New Zealand, and\r\nleft them to be managed by the Government of New Zealand, it may be\r\nso. But the Maori people are not aware of the reasons that led their\r\n_Pakeha_ friends to apply to have the sole management of affairs\r\nin New Zealand; and the assent thereto of the Queen's Government was\r\ngiven without considering the Maori people, or making any inquiries of\r\nthem. Because the right of governing and the occupation of the Island\r\nby Europeans dates from the Treaty of Waitangi; and it was left to the\r\nchiefs, the _hapus_ of the Native people, and Her Majesty to\r\ncarry out the provisions of the Treaty of Waitangi, which became a\r\ncovenant on the descendants.\r\n\r\nAnd, further, with reference to the statement made by your Ministers\r\nthat \"there has been no infraction of the Treaty of Waitangi,\" we\r\nwould ask what portion of the Treaty of Waitangi, what _hapus_,\r\nor what chiefs placed the authority over the Native lands under the\r\nNative Land Court, or gave the Europeans the sole power to deal with\r\nMaori lands in that Court, as stated in the paragraph respecting the\r\nNative Land Court in that petition.\r\n\r\nAnd, further, with reference to the statement respecting the presence\r\nof Native members in the Legislature, the status of those members was\r\npointed out in the petition: Taking the basis of population, one\r\nNative member is returned for more than twenty thousand persons,\r\nwhereas one European member is returned for every five thousand. When,\r\nindeed, have the applications of those members for increased\r\nrepresentation been acceded to by that Parliament? When, indeed, have\r\nthe applications of those members to have the grievances of the Native\r\npeople redressed been acceded to by that Parliament? When, indeed,\r\nhave the applications of those members asking that the Natives should\r\nhave the power of administering their own lands been acceded to by\r\nthat Parliament? Well, it is seen that the reason why the Government\r\nadmitted Natives there (into Parliament) as members was merely in\r\norder that it could be said that Natives dealt with the wrongs now\r\npractised on the Maori people, and in order, too, that such wrongs\r\nshould not be looked into, and finally to abolish those members.\r\n\r\nAnd, further, with reference to the statement made by the Minister\r\nthat Kawhia is a Native district: Well, if the Government really\r\nconsidered it to be such, why, then, did they assume to themselves the\r\nright to do certain acts in that district, such as establishing a\r\nmilitary post on Native lands, which was a menace to the Maori people?\r\n\r\nWhen, indeed, have the Government paid any heed to the application of\r\nTawhiao and the people of that district desiring that Tawhiao should\r\nhave the management of matters in that district?\r\n\r\nDo you forward a copy of this letter to Her Majesty's Government.\r\nSufficient.\r\n\r\nKING TAWHIAO.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency the Governor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir W.

That the Treaty of Waitangi shall continue in force, by which the\r\nauthority (_mana_) of the chiefs of the Maori people was assured\r\nto them, and which also confirms and guarantees Maori people the\r\nfull, exclusive, and undisturbed possession and control of their\r\nlands, and declares that the Maori people shall be maintained in their\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n2. That the powers conferred by the Act of the year 1852 should be\r\nmaintained--viz. that a council or councils should be set up, and\r\ninvested with power and full authority, and that it shall be lawful\r\nfor Her Majesty to authorise such councils.\r\n\r\n3. That the Maori people of Ao-tea-roa (New Zealand) shall act\r\ntogether under the law above mentioned.\r\n\r\n4. That the Maori committees, authorised by the laws above referred\r\nto, shall be zealous in the performance of their duties.\r\n\r\n5. That no wrong proceedings or operations of the Government towards\r\nthe Maori people shall be sanctioned.\r\n\r\n6. That the Native Land Courts Act should be repealed, and that it be\r\nleft to the Maoris themselves to adjudicate on their own lands.\r\n\r\n7. That this _runanga_ (council) shall persist in its efforts to\r\nhave the directions given by the Government of the Queen to the\r\nGovernment of New Zealand carried out--viz. that the rights and\r\ninterests of the Maori people shall be guarded and respected. (This\r\nresolution was unanimously carried by the _runanga_: \"Although\r\nthe Government of England has nothing to do with the affairs of New\r\nZealand, still the Government of the Queen will instruct the\r\nGovernment of New Zealand to devise some measures whereby justice may\r\nbe done to the Maori people and their interests promoted, and that the\r\nGovernor should be questioned concerning these instructions from\r\nEngland.\")\r\n\r\n8. That the chiefs attending this meeting be deputed to put the\r\nquestion to the Governor.\r\n\r\n9. That each tribe should subscribe money for the purchase of a press\r\nto print for circulation reports of what are done and said by the\r\nMaori people.\r\n\r\n10. That power be given to each committee to deal with lands in its\r\nown district.\r\n\r\nThese are the Resolutions that were carried.\r\n\r\nKing Tawhiao's reply in reference to the Resolutions was: \"I thank you\r\nfor an assent to the resolutions. I thank you, every one of you, for\r\nyour discussions upon those resolutions which have been formed by you\r\nin accordance with your own wishes. I have carefully watched your\r\ndiscussions. There was but one tendency of all your discussions, which\r\ncorresponds exactly with the object I had in view in inviting you to\r\nthis meeting. Be zealous in lifting up and in sustaining (measures\r\nfor the benefit) of both these islands. Hearken ye! The views held by\r\nthe English people in England are precisely the same as those held by\r\nthe Maori people in New Zealand.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Hon. the Native Minister to Tawhiao_\r\n\r\n(Translation)\r\n\r\nAUCKLAND, _April 17, 1886_.\r\n\r\nFRIEND--I have the honour to enclose you the reply of the\r\nGovernor to the resolutions presented by the deputation (sent by you)\r\nto His Excellency on the 9th instant. There is one point in the\r\nresolutions on which I desire to offer an explanation. In the\r\ntranslation of Lord Derby's despatch made in the Native Department in\r\nWellington some of the terms are incorrectly rendered. A correct\r\ntranslation has been made and handed to Major Te Wheoro. The despatch\r\nitself is in your possession, and there can be no doubt of its\r\nmeaning, which is fully explained in the memorandum of His\r\nExcellency.--From your friend,\r\n\r\nJ. BALLANCE.\r\n\r\nTo Tawhiao.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum from Sir W. F. D. Jervois to the Hon. the Minister for\r\nNative Affairs_\r\n\r\nThe enclosed replies to certain questions submitted to me in a\r\nmemorandum from several Maori chiefs who waited upon me on the 9th\r\ninstant with a view of laying before me resolutions passed at a Native\r\nmeeting previously held at Whatiwhatihoe are transmitted to the\r\nMinister for Native Affairs for communication to the chiefs concerned.\r\n\r\nIn forwarding the paper to the chiefs, I request that you will inform\r\nthem that I was greatly pleased at the loyal sentiments expressed by\r\nthem at their interview with me towards Her Most Gracious Majesty the\r\nQueen, as well as the confidence they exhibited towards myself as her\r\nrepresentative. I also beg that you will convey to Tawhiao, and all\r\nthe chiefs concerned, how much I rejoice at the cordial feeling they\r\nexhibit towards the Government of New Zealand.\r\n\r\nW. F. DRUMMOND JERVOIS.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT HOUSE, AUCKLAND, _April 14, 1886_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM RELATING TO RESOLUTIONS PASSED AT A NATIVE MEETING HELD\r\nAT WHATIWHATIHOE ON THE 4TH APRIL 1886.\r\n\r\nReferring to the Resolutions in the order submitted in a paper laid\r\nbefore His Excellency the Governor by a deputation of Maori chiefs on\r\nthe 9th April: 1. The Treaty of Waitangi vested the _mana_ in Her\r\nMajesty the Queen, and secures to the Natives their land. That treaty,\r\nin its essential elements, has been faithfully kept by the colony. A\r\nmodification was made in it by which the Natives obtained the right of\r\nselling their lands to persons outside the Government, whereas under\r\nthe treaty the Government had the sole right of purchasing Native\r\nlands. This modification, the only one made in the treaty, was,\r\nhowever, introduced at the request of the Maoris themselves. The\r\nrights of the Maori people have been carefully preserved.\r\n\r\n2. This appears to refer to section 71 of the Constitution Act, where\r\nreference is made to Native councils. It must be observed, however,\r\nthat the section is not mandatory, as will be seen from the clause\r\nitself, and from such terms as, \"it may be expedient,\" and \"should for\r\nthe present be maintained.\" Local self-government has been extended to\r\nthe Native people in the form of Committees under the Act of 1883.\r\nThese Committees have power to ascertain titles to Native lands, and\r\nto hear and decide civil cases by agreement, and, in fact, may be said\r\nto be Courts of Arbitration. Their usefulness is being proved, and a\r\nlarge majority of the Native people appreciate them and are using\r\nthem. It has been found by experience, however, with regard to titles\r\nto land, that there is often great jealousy of the committees, and\r\nthat the Natives prefer to have the land adjudicated on by the Land\r\nCourts. (This remark applies also to Resolution 6.) If any other form\r\nof Maori council than that which now exists is desired under the\r\nclause of the Constitution Act referred to, it can only be obtained by\r\nAct of Parliament of New Zealand.\r\n\r\nNo observations are necessary to Resolutions 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9.\r\n\r\n7. This Resolution apparently refers to Lord Derby's despatch of the\r\n23rd June 1885, but does not convey a correct impression of the terms\r\nof that document. No directions are contained in the despatch. Lord\r\nDerby expressly says that \"under the present Constitution of New\r\nZealand the government of all Her Majesty's subjects in the islands is\r\ncontrolled by Ministers responsible to the General Assembly, in which\r\nthe Natives are efficiently represented by persons of their own race,\r\nand that it is no longer possible to advise the Queen to interfere\r\nactively in the administration of Native affairs, any more than in\r\nconnection with other questions of internal government.\" The\r\nresolution states that there is an \"instruction\" contained in the\r\ndespatch; but there is none. On the contrary, Lord Derby expressly\r\nrecognises the right of the New Zealand Government to deal with the\r\ninternal affairs of the colony without interference. The words of Lord\r\nDerby, where he refers to the Native people, are as follows: \"It (the\r\nImperial Government) should use its good offices with the Colonial\r\nGovernment with the view of obtaining for the Natives all the\r\nconsideration which can be given to them.\" The particular request that\r\nLord Derby makes, and it is only in the nature of a request, is \"that\r\nthe Government of New Zealand will not fail to protect and to promote\r\nthe welfare of the Natives by a just administration of the law, and by\r\na generous consideration of all their reasonable representations.\" He\r\nadds, \"I cannot doubt that means will be found of maintaining to a\r\nsufficient extent the rights and institutions of the Maoris without\r\ninjury to those other great interests which have grown up in the land,\r\nand of securing to them a fair share of that prosperity which has of\r\nnecessity affected in many ways the conditions of their existence.\"\r\nThe policy advocated by Lord Derby has been and is being carried out.\r\nA proof of this is to be found in the fact that an overwhelming\r\nmajority of the Natives are satisfied with the administration of their\r\naffairs by the Government of New Zealand.\r\n\r\nJOHN JERVOIS, Private Secretary.\r\n\r\nSigned by order of His Excellency the Governor. Government House,\r\nAuckland, 14th April 1886.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Court of Appeal of New Zealand.\r\n\r\nTAMIHANA KOROKAI AND OTHERS _v._ THE SOLICITOR-GENERAL\r\n\r\n  1912.\r\n  July 23, 24, 25.\r\n  Oct. 7.\r\n\r\n  C.A.\r\n\r\n  Coram.\r\n  Stout, C.-J.\r\n  Williams, J.\r\n  Edwards, J.\r\n  Cooper, J.\r\n  Chapman, J.\r\n\r\n  Skerrett, K.C., Morison and Fell for the plaintiffs.\r\n  Solicitor-General (Salmond) and Ostler for the defendant.\r\n\r\nSTOUT, C.-J.--This is a special case stated pursuant to Rule 245 of\r\nour Code of Civil Procedure. Neither party, however, asks that all the\r\nquestions framed in the case should be answered. Indeed both ask that\r\nsome of the questions should not be answered. The point in dispute\r\nbetween the parties is a narrow one. The plaintiff contends that he\r\nhas a statutory right to go to the Native Land Court claiming under\r\nthe Native Land Act a freehold title. The Solicitor-General contends\r\nthat if he, as Solicitor-General, says the land, that is the bed of\r\nLake Rotorua, is Crown land that concludes the matter, and the Native\r\nLand Court cannot proceed to make any inquiries as to whether the land\r\nis native customary land. That is the matter in contention, and it\r\nappears to me that it is the only question that this Court has at\r\npresent to decide.\r\n\r\nIt may be necessary to refer very shortly as to how the question has\r\narisen. In 1835 there were many English people settled in the most\r\nnortherly part of New Zealand. English Church Missionaries had been\r\nthere for some years, they landed first in 1814; and there were\r\ntraders and whalers and others that had made New Zealand their home.\r\nOne called Charles Baron de Thierry, in Marquesas, claimed that he was\r\nsovereign chief of New Zealand. He so informed Mr. James Busby, who\r\nhad been appointed British Resident in New Zealand, and Mr. Busby\r\nthereupon took steps to deny any such sovereignty. He and other\r\nEnglish residents saw the Native chiefs and they formed what was\r\ncalled a Confederation. The thirty-five head chiefs or heads of tribes\r\nin the most northern parts of New Zealand, that is all the country\r\nlying north of the Firth of Thames, joined in a declaration that\r\nNew Zealand was an independent state under the name of the \"United\r\nTribes of New Zealand.\" Mr. Busby sent a copy of this declaration to\r\nthe Under-Secretary of State in London, and Lord Glenelg, the\r\nSecretary of State for the Colonies, wrote to the Governor of New\r\nSouth Wales regarding the declaration. The Governor was directed to\r\ninform the chiefs \"With reference to the desire which the chiefs have\r\nexpressed on this occasion to maintain a good understanding with His\r\nMajesty's subjects, it will be proper that they should be assured in\r\nHis Majesty's name that he will not fail to avail himself of every\r\nopportunity of showing his goodwill and of affording to those chiefs\r\nsuch support and protection as may be consistent with a due regard to\r\nthe just rights of others, and to the interests of His Majesty's\r\nsubjects.\"\r\n\r\nMeantime the eligibility of New Zealand as a colony was being\r\ndiscussed both in New South Wales and in England, and ultimately in\r\n1840 Captain Hobson, R.N., was despatched to New Zealand with two\r\ncommissions, one as British Consul, and the other as Lieutenant-Governor.\r\nHe reached the Bay of Islands on the 29th of January 1840, and on the\r\n5th and 6th of February the Treaty of Waitangi was signed by many\r\nchiefs, then assembled at Waitangi in the Bay of Islands. The treaty\r\nstates, _inter alia_: \"Her Majesty, therefore, being desirous to\r\nestablish a settled form of civil government with a view to avert the\r\nevil consequences which must result from the absence of the necessary\r\nlaws and institutions alike to the native population and to her\r\nsubjects, has been graciously pleased to empower and authorise me,\r\nWilliam Hobson, a Captain in Her Majesty's Royal Navy, Consul and\r\nLieutenant-Governor of such parts of New Zealand as may be or\r\nhereafter shall be ceded to Her Majesty to invite the confederated and\r\nindependent chiefs of New Zealand to concur in the following articles\r\nand conditions.\"\r\n\r\nThen follow three articles. The first article deals with the cession.\r\nIt is as follows: \"The chiefs of the Confederation of the United\r\nTribes of New Zealand, and the separate and independent chiefs who\r\nhave not become members of the confederation, cede to Her Majesty the\r\nQueen of England, absolutely and without reservation, all the rights\r\nand powers of sovereignty which the said confederation or individual\r\nchiefs respectively exercise or possess or may be supposed to exercise\r\nor possess over their respective territories as the sole sovereigns\r\nthereof.\"\r\n\r\nThe second and the third articles are as follows: \"Her Majesty the\r\nQueen of England confirms and guarantees to the chiefs and tribes of\r\nNew Zealand and to the respective families and individuals thereof,\r\nthe full, exclusive, and undisturbed possession of their lands and\r\nestates, forests, and fisheries, and other properties which they may\r\ncollectively or individually possess, so long as it is their wish and\r\ndesire to retain the same in their possession: but the chiefs of the\r\nunited tribes and the individual chiefs yield to Her Majesty the\r\nexclusive right of pre-emption over such lands as the proprietors\r\nthereof may be disposed to alienate, at such prices as may be agreed\r\nupon between the respective proprietors and persons appointed by Her\r\nMajesty to treat with them in that behalf.\" The third is as follows:\r\n\"(3) In consideration thereof, Her Majesty the Queen of England\r\nextends to the natives of New Zealand her royal protection, and\r\nimparts to them all the rights and privileges of British subjects.\"\r\n\r\nCopies of the treaty were taken to various parts of both islands, and\r\nthe chiefs throughout New Zealand signed it, and to the present day\r\nthe treaty is regarded as their Magna Charta. The Lieutenant-Governor\r\non the 21st May 1840 issued a proclamation, proclaiming and declaring\r\nthat after the date of the treaty the full sovereignty of the North\r\nIsland of New Zealand vested in Her Majesty, Queen Victoria, her heirs\r\nand successors for ever.\r\n\r\nA further proclamation was issued on the same day proclaiming and\r\ndeclaring that all the Islands of New Zealand vested in Her Majesty,\r\nthat is, including all country between 34° 30´ north to 47° 10´ south\r\nlatitude and between 166° 5´ to 179° east longitude. A mistake was\r\nmade in this proclamation in that it proclaimed from 34° 30´ north\r\ninstead of as was intended 34° 30´ south. The ground of the\r\nproclamation over the South Island was that of discovery. Since then\r\nit has been recognised that the lands in the islands not sold by the\r\nnatives belonged to the natives. All the old authorities are agreed\r\nthat for every part of land there was a native owner. Two authorities\r\nmay be cited. Bishop Selwyn said as follows: \"Three points then seem\r\nto be clear on this subject: (1) That there was originally a distinct\r\nowner for every habitable spot in the Northern Island: (2) That these\r\nclaims have been complicated by the obvious causes of inheritance and\r\nmarriage without forms of conveyance or bequest: (3) That the rights\r\nof ownership whether in one or many joint proprietors were not\r\nalienable without the consent of the tribe.\"\r\n\r\nThe late Sir William Martin, formerly Chief-Justice of New Zealand,\r\nsaid: \"So far as yet appears the whole surface of the islands, or as\r\nmuch of it as is of any value to man, has been appropriated by the\r\nnatives, and, with the exception of the part they have sold, is held\r\nby them as property. Nowhere was any piece of land discovered or heard\r\nof (by the commissioners) which was not owned by some person or set of\r\npersons.... There might be several conflicting claimants of the same\r\nland: but however the natives might be divided amongst themselves as\r\nto the validity of any one of the several claims, still no man doubted\r\nthat there was in every case a right of property subsisting in some\r\none of the claimants. In this Northern Island at least it may now be\r\nregarded as absolutely certain that, with the exception of lands\r\nalready purchased from the Natives, there is not an acre of land\r\navailable for purposes of colonisation, but has an owner amongst the\r\nNatives according to their own customs.\"\r\n\r\nThe Governor and the Legislature of New Zealand accepted this\r\nposition, and numerous ordinances and acts of Parliament have been\r\npassed to enable the Maoris to transmute their customary title into\r\nfreehold. The position all along assumed has been that the lands are\r\nvested in the Crown, and until the Crown issues a freehold title the\r\ncustomary titles cannot be recognised; but that the Crown will give to\r\nall who prove that the land was theirs a freehold title. The Crown has\r\nnot assumed that land could be taken or kept by the Crown from the\r\nNatives, unless the natives ceded their rights to the Crown. Thousands\r\nof purchases in both islands have been made by the Crown, and\r\nthousands of deeds of cession are in existence. The reason why the\r\nCrown did not recognise any title in the land till a grant from the\r\nCrown had issued is dealt with in the classic judgment of the late Mr.\r\nJustice H. S. Chapman, delivered in 1847 in the case of Reg. _v._\r\nSymonds, and in the judgment of the then Chief-Justice Sir William\r\nMartin, who agreed with the judgment of Mr. Justice Chapman. After\r\ntheir judgments, the Imperial Parliament in the New Zealand\r\nConstitution Act (15 and 16 Vict. c. 72, sec. 73) recognised the\r\nnative title. Section 73 of that Act is as follows: \"It shall not be\r\nlawful for any person other than Her Majesty, her heirs and\r\nsuccessors, to purchase or in any wise acquire or accept from the\r\naboriginal Natives land of or belonging to, or used or occupied by\r\nthem in common as tribes or communities, or to accept any release or\r\nextinguishment of the rights of such aboriginal Natives in any such\r\nland as aforesaid: and no conveyance or transfer, or agreement for the\r\nconveyance or transfer of any such land, either in perpetuity or for\r\nany term or period, either absolutely or conditionally, and either in\r\nproperty or by way of lease or occupancy, and no such release or\r\nextinguishment as aforesaid, shall be of any validity or effect,\r\nunless the same be made to, or entered into with and accepted by Her\r\nMajesty, her heirs or successors. Provided always that it shall be\r\nlawful for Her Majesty, her heirs and successors, by instructions\r\nunder the signet and royal sign manual, or signified through one of\r\nHer Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State to delegate her\r\npowers of accepting such conveyances or agreements, releases, or\r\nrelinquishments, to the Governor of New Zealand, or the superintendent\r\nof any province within the limits of such colony, and to prescribe or\r\nregulate the terms of such conveyances or agreements, releases or\r\nextinguishments shall be accepted.\"\r\n\r\nThat the Crown in New Zealand recognised that it could not treat the\r\nNative land--that is, the land over which the Natives had not given up\r\ntheir rights of cession--as Crown in the fullest sense is plain from\r\nvarious things done: (1) In 1862 the first Act to provide for the\r\nascertainment of the ownership of Native lands, and for granting\r\ncertificates of title therein, and for regulating the disposal of\r\nNative lands was passed. The preamble is as follows: \"Whereas by the\r\nTreaty of Waitangi entered into by and between Her Majesty and the\r\nchiefs of New Zealand, it was among other things declared that Her\r\nMajesty confirmed and guaranteed to the chiefs and tribes of New\r\nZealand and the respective families and individuals thereof the full,\r\nexclusive, and undisturbed possession of their lands and estates,\r\nwhich they collectively or individually held so long as it should be\r\ntheir desire to retain the same: And it was further declared that the\r\nchiefs yielded to Her Majesty the exclusive right of pre-emption over\r\nsuch lands as the proprietors thereof might be disposed to alienate:\r\nAnd whereas it would greatly promote the peaceful settlement of the\r\ncolony and the advancement and the civilisation of the Natives if\r\ntheir rights to land were ascertained, defined, and declared, and if\r\nthe ownership of such lands when so ascertained, defined, and declared\r\nwere assimilated as nearly as possible to the ownership of land\r\naccording to British law: And whereas with a view to the foregoing\r\nobjects, Her Majesty may be pleased to waive in favour of the Natives\r\nso much of the said Treaty of Waitangi as reserves to Her Majesty the\r\nright of pre-emption of their lands, and to establish Courts and to\r\nmake other provision for ascertaining and defining the rights of the\r\nNatives to their lands, and for otherwise giving effect to the\r\nprovisions of the Act: And it is expedient that the General Assembly\r\nof New Zealand should facilitate the said objects by enacting such\r\nprovisions as are hereinafter contained.\"\r\n\r\n(2) When the natives committed rebellion or were guilty of\r\ninsurrection, a special Act was passed allowing the Governor in\r\nCouncil to take their lands. See _inter alia_ the New Zealand\r\nSettlements Act, 1863. A few of the sections may be cited: \"2.\r\nWhenever the Governor in Council shall be satisfied that any Native\r\ntribe or section of a tribe or any considerable number thereof has\r\nsince the first day of January 1863 been engaged in rebellion against\r\nHer Majesty's authority, it shall be lawful for the Governor in\r\nCouncil to declare that the district within which any land being the\r\nproperty or being in the possession of such tribe or section or\r\nconsiderable number thereof shall be situate, shall be a district\r\nwithin the provisions of this Act, and the boundaries of such district\r\nin like manner to define and vary as he shall think fit.\"\r\n\r\n\"3. It shall be lawful for the Governor in Council from time to time\r\nto set apart within any such district eligible sites for settlements\r\nfor colonisation, and the boundaries of such settlements to define and\r\nvary.\"\r\n\r\n\"4. For the purposes of such settlements the Governor in Council may\r\nfrom time to time reserve or take any land within such district, and\r\nsuch land shall be deemed to be Crown land, freed and discharged from\r\nall title interest, or claim of any person whomsoever as soon as the\r\nGovernor in Council shall have declared that such land is required for\r\nthe purposes of this Act, and is subject to the provisions thereof.\"\r\n\r\nSection 5 provided for compensation to persons whose land has been\r\ntaken, provided that they had not been in rebellion.\r\n\r\n(3) Before Native land was treated as Crown land, open for sale and\r\nsettlement, proclamations were generally made so declaring the land\r\nopen. See, for example, section 6 of the Immigration and Public Works\r\nAct, 1873, and section 247 of the Land Act, 1885.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to point out that if the Crown in New Zealand had\r\nnot conserved the Native rights and carried out the treaty a gross\r\nwrong would have been perpetrated. Since the recognition of the Native\r\nrights so often made, there may have been interference by legislation\r\nwith Native land, both before and after the ascertainment of title.\r\nIf, however, there were such interferences, they have been based on\r\nthe theory of eminent domain. There have been statutes passed\r\nproviding how Native lands may be leased, but a similar kind of\r\ninterference has been witnessed in the United Kingdom in the case of\r\nthe Irish Land Acts and the Scottish Crofters' Statutes. Such\r\ninterferences did not destroy the title of Natives. Native lands and\r\nfreehold lands belonging to persons of the white race have also been\r\ntaken under such a theory when it appeared it was for the interest of\r\nthe State to do so. In such cases compensation has been awarded. To\r\ninterfere with Native lands, merely because they are Native lands, and\r\nwithout compensation, would of course be such an act of spoliation and\r\ntyranny that this Court ought not to assume it to be possible in any\r\ncivilised community.\r\n\r\nThe decision of _Wi Parata v. Bishop of Wellington_, 3 J.R.,\r\nN.S., S.C. 72, does not derogate from that position. It only\r\nemphasised the decision in _Reg. v. Symonds_, that the Supreme\r\nCourt could take no cognisance of treaty rights not embodied in a\r\nstatute, and that Native Customary Title was a kind of tenure that the\r\nCourt could not deal with. In the case of _Tamaki v. Baker_\r\n(1901), A.C. 561, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council\r\nrecognised, however, that the Natives had rights under our statute law\r\nto their customary lands.\r\n\r\nThe Native Land Act, 1909, has various sections dealing with the\r\ncustomary land of the Maoris (sections 84, 85, 86, and 87). What was\r\nthe need of such sections if a declaration by a law officer of the\r\nCrown was all that was necessary to say that the land claimed as\r\nCustomary Native Land was Crown Land? Section 88 is significant in\r\nthis connection. It states \"(1) for the purpose of recovering\r\npossession of customary land from any person in wrongful occupation\r\nthereof, and for the purpose of preventing any trespass or other\r\ninjury thereto, or of recovering damages for any such trespass or\r\ninjury, all such land shall be deemed to be Crown Lands within the\r\nmeaning of the Land Act, 1908. (2) No action or other proceeding,\r\nother than a proceeding by or on behalf of the Crown under the last\r\npreceding subsection, shall be brought in any Court by any person for\r\nthe recovery of the possession of customary land, or for damages or an\r\ninjunction in respect of any trespass, or injury to such land.\"\r\nSections 90 and 91 show that the customary titles are recognised:\r\nsection 90 reads: \"The Native Land Court shall have exclusive\r\njurisdiction to investigate the title to customary land, and to\r\ndetermine the relative interests of the owners thereof.\" Section 91 is\r\nas follows: \"Every title to and interest in customary land shall be\r\ndetermined according to the ancient custom and usage of the Maori\r\npeople, so far as the same can be ascertained.\" Section 92 shows the\r\njurisdiction of the Native Land Court. Formerly there was something\r\nmore required than an order of a Native Land Court to make an\r\neffective title. At one time His Excellency the Governor had to sign a\r\nCrown grant and at another time a certificate of title.\r\n\r\nI am of opinion that the Native Land Act recognises that the Natives\r\nhave a right to their customary titles. There are in my opinion only\r\nthree things that can prevent the Native Land Court entering on an\r\nenquiry as to such customary title.\r\n\r\n(1) A proclamation of the Governor under a statute, such as has been\r\nprovided in many Acts, and is so provided in section 85 of the Native\r\nLand Act, 1909.\r\n\r\n(2) A prohibition by the Governor under section 100 of the Native Land\r\nAct, 1909.\r\n\r\n(3) Proof that the land has been ceded by the true owners or that a\r\nCrown grant has been issued.\r\n\r\nI know of no statutory authority that the Attorney-General as\r\nAttorney-General or the Solicitor-General as Solicitor-General has to\r\ndeclare that the land is Crown land. The Attorney-General and the\r\nSolicitor-General are both high officers of State. They are legal\r\nofficers, and they can appear as solicitors or counsel for the Crown,\r\nbut there their functions and powers end. Their statement as to what\r\nis Crown property unless made in accordance with some statutory power,\r\nis of no avail. If in an action they put in a plea to that effect, it\r\nwould have to be proved like any other pleading of a party to the\r\naction. The Solicitor-General has failed to cite any authority that\r\nthe mere statement of the legal adviser of the Crown, or the Crown's\r\nAttorney or Solicitor-General, was to be taken as a true averment\r\nwithout proof.\r\n\r\nWhat the customary title to the bed of Lake Rotorua may be must be\r\nconsidered and determined by the only Court in New Zealand that has\r\njurisdiction to deal with Native titles--the Native Land Court. At\r\ncommon law there may be an ownership of the bed of navigable rivers or\r\nlakes that are non-tidal. See Kent's _Commentaries_, vol. iii. p.\r\n427, note (_d_). The case of _Mueller v. Taupiri Coal Mines,\r\nLtd._, 20 N.Z.L.R. 89, turned on the effect of a grant under the\r\nLand Acts.\r\n\r\nI am of opinion that it is not necessary specifically to answer the\r\nquestions put, but only to say that the plaintiff and his people have\r\na right to go to the Native Land Court to have their title\r\ninvestigated, and that the Native Land Court can only be prevented\r\nfrom performing its statutory duty, first, under the Native Land Act,\r\nsecondly, on proof in that Court that the lands are Crown Lands freed\r\nfrom the customary title of the Natives, or, thirdly that there is a\r\nCrown title to the bed of the lake.\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.--The contention of the Solicitor-General is that in all\r\ncases where land is claimed by natives to be held by them under their\r\ncustoms and usages, and they seek to have their titles ascertained by\r\nthe Native Land Court, and a title in fee simple granted to them, the\r\nSolicitor-General, by virtue of the prerogative right of the Crown,\r\nand apart from any statutory authority, could at any time step in and\r\nprevent proceedings being taken or continued. The arguments in support\r\nof this contention are that when New Zealand was annexed to Great\r\nBritain all the land in New Zealand became vested in the Crown, by\r\nvirtue of its prerogative; that the Treaty of Waitangi is binding only\r\nupon the honour of the Crown, and can be disregarded at the discretion\r\nof the Crown; and that, although there may be a statutory recognition\r\nof the Native title, there is no such statutory recognition as would\r\noperate as against the Crown. Even if these arguments were sound it by\r\nno means follows that the contention of the Solicitor-General can be\r\nsupported.... There is nothing in the Governor's commission or in the\r\nRoyal instructions which expressly authorises him to interfere on\r\nbehalf of the Crown to prevent the exercise of rights given to natives\r\nby the statute law of the Dominion. Has he then, by virtue of his\r\ncommission, an implied power so to interfere?... There is a special\r\nreason why the power now claimed should not be implied. The power now\r\nclaimed is by an act of state to disregard rights given by statutes\r\nwhich have been passed to carry out treaty obligations binding upon\r\nthe honour of the Crown. If the Crown has this power, it is exercised\r\non the advice of the responsible Minister of the Crown. Whether it\r\nshould be so exercised or not is a matter affecting the honour of the\r\nCrown, not merely as the Sovereign of this Dominion, but as the\r\nSovereign of the British Empire. It was with the Sovereign of the\r\nBritish Empire that the Treaty of Waitangi was entered into. Whether\r\nImperial obligations should or should not be observed is a matter of\r\nImperial concern for the responsible advisers of the Crown in Great\r\nBritain to decide upon and not for the advisers of the Governor here,\r\nunless the power of deciding has been expressly delegated to the\r\nGovernor. Even if the power had been so delegated the Court would\r\nproperly require some evidence beyond the mere statement of the\r\nAttorney- or Solicitor-General that the authority of the Crown was\r\nbeing exercised.... I agree with the conclusion arrived at by His\r\nHonour, that rights given to natives by statute to have their\r\ncustomary titles determined can only be divested in the manner\r\nprescribed by statute. The rights given to natives by sections 90 to\r\n93 inclusive of \"The Native Land Act, 1909,\" to have a legal estate in\r\nfee simple in possession vested in the persons found to be entitled\r\nare rights expressly given against the Crown. If these sections do not\r\nbind the Crown they are meaningless and inoperative. The Crown is a\r\nparty to the statute. It is difficult to see how, when rights which\r\nexpressly affect pre-existing rights of the Crown are created by\r\nstatute, the Crown upon the passing of the statute can disregard the\r\nrights so created, and exercise its pre-existing rights as if the\r\nstatute had not been passed.\r\n\r\nEDWARDS, J.--In support of his contention that the bed of the lake\r\ncannot be the subject of a Native title under Maori customs and\r\nusages, the Solicitor-General relies upon the inherent improbability\r\nthat there was any intention, either by the Treaty of Waitangi or by\r\nthe statutes relating to native lands, to recognise any such right. To\r\nhold that there is such a right would be, the Solicitor-General\r\ncontends, to destroy the right of navigation in all non-tidal waters\r\nto the great detriment of the public. Such considerations might well\r\nhave induced those responsible for the Treaty of Waitangi to have so\r\nframed that document as to preclude any claim by natives to the\r\nexclusive possession of land covered by navigable non-tidal waters. It\r\nmay even be suggested that the words of the treaty, which guarantee to\r\nthe Maoris \"the full, exclusive, and undisturbed possession of their\r\nlands and estates, forests, fisheries, and other properties,\" were\r\nintended to reserve to the natives merely the right to fish in\r\nnon-tidal waters, without recognising in them any property in the land\r\ncovered by such waters. It is quite possible--indeed not\r\nimprobable--that there never was any Maori custom or usage which\r\nrecognised any greater right in land covered by navigable non-tidal\r\nwaters than this. That is a question which neither the Supreme Court\r\nnor this Court can determine. If there never was any such custom or\r\nusage prior to the Treaty of Waitangi, then the Crown will get the\r\nadvantage of that when that question has been determined by the Native\r\nLand Court, or in the last resort by the Judicial Committee of the\r\nPrivy Council. But if there was such a custom or usage, the treaty, so\r\nfar as it is effective, is sufficient to preserve it. The treaty, like\r\nevery other instrument, must be construed in accordance with the plain\r\nlegal significance of the words used, and the Courts cannot speculate\r\nas to whether or not those words were used in another sense not\r\napparent upon the face of the instrument, or necessarily to be\r\ninferred from the subject with reference to which they are used. A\r\nlake, in contemplation of the English law, is merely land covered by\r\nwater, and will pass by the description of land. _Bristow v. Cormican_\r\n(3 A.C. 641); _Johnston v. O'Neill_ (1911, A.C. 552). Whatever rights\r\nwere conserved to the Maoris by the Treaty of Waitangi were fully\r\nrecognised by \"The Native Lands Act, 1862,\" which recited the treaty,\r\nand was enacted with the declared object of giving effect to it.... In\r\nmy opinion it is clear that if the Crown desires to set up its title,\r\nas a bar to the investigation by the Native Land Court in its ordinary\r\njurisdiction of claims by natives, it must either be prepared to prove\r\nits title, or it must be able to rely upon a proclamation in\r\naccordance with the terms of the 85th section of \"The Native Land Act,\r\n1909.\"\r\n\r\nCOOPER, J.--I have had the advantage of reading and considering the\r\njudgment of His Honour, the Chief Justice, and, upon substantially the\r\nsame grounds as are expressed by His Honour in that judgment, I have\r\narrived at the same conclusion.\r\n\r\nI have very little to add.\r\n\r\n\"The Land Act, 1908,\" contains the statutory provisions regulating the\r\nadministration of Crown lands in New Zealand. In respect of Native\r\nlands, section 2 brings within the category of Crown lands only those\r\n\"Native lands which have been ceded to His Majesty by the Natives on\r\nbehalf of His Majesty, or otherwise acquired in freehold from the\r\nNatives on behalf of His Majesty, or have become vested in His Majesty\r\nby right of his prerogative.\"\r\n\r\nCustomary lands owned by natives, which have not been ceded to His\r\nMajesty or acquired from the native owners on behalf of His Majesty,\r\ncannot in my opinion be said to be land vested in His Majesty by right\r\nof his prerogative. It is true that, technically, the legal estate is\r\nin His Majesty, but this legal estate is held subject to the right of\r\nthe natives, recognised by the Crown to the possession and ownership\r\nof the customary lands, which they have not ceded to the King, and\r\nwhich His Majesty has not acquired from them.\r\n\r\nSection 338 of the Act draws a clear distinction between Native lands\r\nand Crown lands. Under subsection (1) of that section, where the\r\nGovernor is satisfied that Native lands have been acquired by the\r\nCrown, he shall by proclamation declare such lands to be Crown lands,\r\nand under subsection (2), when such lands have been so acquired, he\r\nmay give effect to any stipulation in the instrument of sale or\r\ntransfer to His Majesty for the reservation to the natives of any part\r\nof such lands, and may reserve or grant such portions in manner\r\nrequired by the natives.\r\n\r\nSection 88 of \"The Native Land Act, 1909,\" which has been referred to\r\nby His Honour also, recognises that these lands are not \"Crown lands.\"\r\nThey are only deemed to be Crown lands for the one purpose, namely,\r\nthat if any person is in possession of or trespassing upon, or\r\ninjuring the lands against the interest of the Native owners, then,\r\nfor the purpose of protecting the Native owners the Crown may under\r\nthe Land Act take proceedings against such wrongdoers. Even this\r\nprovision is a guarded one, for subsection (3) of that section\r\nexpressly provides that nothing in it contained shall take away or\r\naffect any jurisdiction conferred upon the Native Land Court.\r\n\r\nCHAPMAN, J.--I agree with the judgments which have been read. It has\r\nbeen argued that the Treaty of Waitangi was an international treaty\r\nentered into with chiefs having the sovereignty. The contrary opinion\r\nwas pronounced by the Supreme Court in _Wi Parata v. The Bishop of\r\nWellington_ (3 N.Z. Jur. N.S. 72). The terms employed and the mode\r\nof execution of the treaty leave it at least an open question whether\r\nit was so regarded at the time. It professes to be made with certain\r\nfederated chiefs and certain chiefs who are not federated, but it does\r\nnot state over what territories they exercised authority, though the\r\ntext of the treaty seems to suggest that it was contemplated that it\r\nshould be made with several chiefs who might possibly be regarded, and\r\nwere provisionally and hypothetically treated as sovereigns of their\r\nrespective territories. Later it became a matter of general knowledge,\r\nderived, I presume, from maps prepared pursuant to section 21 of \"The\r\nNative Land Act, 1873,\" that there are eighteen or twenty tribes in\r\nNew Zealand. If that be so the numerous signatories of the Treaty of\r\nWaitangi can hardly be described as sovereign chiefs. I agree that if\r\nthey had been explicitly so declared by Her Majesty's government, or\r\nhad been so treated in a course of political transactions that would\r\nhave been sufficient to make them so, and that their numbers and their\r\nindividual unimportance would not have rendered this impossible,\r\nprovided that in each case there was a sovereign to a territory.\r\n_Hemchand Devchand v. Azam Sakaral Chhotamlal_ (1906, A.C. 212).\r\nThe whole current of authorities shows, however, that the question of\r\nthe origin of the sovereignty is immaterial in connection with the\r\nrights of private persons professing to claim under the provisions of\r\nthe treaty of cession. _Cook v. Sprigg_ (1899, A.C. 572). Such a\r\ntreaty only becomes enforceable as part of the municipal law if and\r\nwhen it is made so by legislative authority. That has not been done.\r\nThe sense in which the treaty has received legislative recognition I\r\nwill refer to later.... From the earliest period of our history, the\r\nrights of the natives have been conserved by numerous legislative\r\nenactments. Section 10 of 9 and 10 Vict. cap. 103, called an Act to\r\nmake further provision for the Government of the New Zealand Islands\r\n(Imperial, 1846), recognises the laws, customs, and usages of the\r\nnatives which necessarily include their customs respecting the holding\r\nof land. Section 1 of 10 and 11 Vict. cap. 112, called an Act to\r\npromote colonisation in New Zealand and to authorise a loan to the New\r\nZealand Company (Imperial, 1847), recognises the claims of the\r\naboriginal inhabitants to the land. To the same effect is the whole\r\nbody of colonial legislation. The expressions \"land over which the\r\nNative title has not been extinguished\" and \"land over which the\r\nNative title has been extinguished\" (familiar expressions in colonial\r\nlegislation), are both pregnant with the same declaration. In the\r\njudgment of the Privy Council in _Nireaha Tamaki v. Baker_ (1901, A.C.\r\n561), importance is attached to these and similar declarations in\r\nconsidering the effect of colonial legislation. There the whole of the\r\nlegislation from the date of the constitution is summarised. This\r\nsummary includes the principal colonial Acts. Referring to section 5\r\nof \"The Native Rights Act, 1865,\" their Lordships say: \"The\r\nLegislation, both of the Imperial Parliament and of the Colonial\r\nLegislature is consistent with this view of the construction of 'The\r\nNative Rights Act,' and one is rather at a loss to know what is meant\r\nby such expressions as 'Native title,' 'Native lands,' 'owners,' and\r\n'proprietors,' or the careful provision against sale of Crown lands\r\nuntil the Native title has been extinguished, if there be no such\r\ntitle cognizable by the law, and no title therefore to be\r\nextinguished.\" I might refer further to less precise but equally\r\nimportant expressions, such as \"tribal lands,\" in \"The Native Land\r\nAct, 1873,\" section 21. The various statutory recognitions of the\r\nTreaty of Waitangi mean no more, but they certainly mean no less than\r\nthese recognitions of native rights.\r\n\r\n[195] Tawhaki, the God-man, whose name frequently occurs in all the\r\nancient mythology of the Maori race.\r\n\r\n[196] Rain and wind--figurative expressions denoting wars and tumults.\r\n\r\n[197] Te Wherowhero Potatau, the first Maori king.\r\n\r\n[198] Tawhiao, the second Maori king.\r\n\r\n[199] A Total Abstinence organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS RELIC OF THE TREATY CAME INTO THE AUTHOR'S POSSESSION AFTER\r\nTHE VOLUME WAS PRINTED AND IS NOW INSERTED AS A SUPPLEMENT.\r\n\r\n_No te 30 o nga ra o Hanuere, 1840_\r\n\r\n_E taku hoa aroha,_\r\n\r\n_Tenei ano taku ki a koe; na, tenei ano tetahi kaipuke manawa kua u\r\nmai nei, me tetahi Rangatira ano kei runga, no te Kuini o Ingarani ia,\r\nhei Kawana hoki mo tatou.
