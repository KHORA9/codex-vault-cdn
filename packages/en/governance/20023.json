I.--1837-1843\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON\r\nJOHN MURRAY, ALBEMARLE STREET, W.\r\n1908\r\n\r\n_Copyright in Great Britain and Dependencies, 1907, by_ H.M. THE KING.\r\n\r\n_In the United States by_ Messrs LONGMANS, GREEN & CO.\r\n\r\n_All rights reserved._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nEntrusted by His Majesty the King with the duty of making a selection\r\nfrom Queen Victoria's correspondence, we think it well to describe\r\nbriefly the nature of the documents which we have been privileged to\r\nexamine, as well as to indicate the principles which have guided us\r\nthroughout. It has been a task of no ordinary difficulty. Her Majesty\r\nQueen Victoria dealt with her papers, from the first, in a most\r\nmethodical manner; she formed the habit in early days of preserving\r\nher private letters, and after her accession to the Throne all her\r\nofficial papers were similarly treated, and bound in volumes. The\r\nPrince Consort instituted an elaborate system of classification,\r\nannotating and even indexing many of the documents with his own hand.\r\nThe result is that the collected papers form what is probably the most\r\nextraordinary series of State documents in the world. The papers which\r\ndeal with the Queen's life up to the year 1861 have been bound\r\nin chronological order, and comprise between five and six hundred\r\nvolumes. They consist, in great part, of letters from Ministers\r\ndetailing the proceedings of Parliament, and of various political\r\nmemoranda dealing with home, foreign, and colonial policy; among these\r\nare a few drafts of Her Majesty's replies. There are volumes concerned\r\nwith the affairs of almost every European country; with the history\r\nof India, the British Army, the Civil List, the Royal Estates, and all\r\nthe complicated machinery of the Monarchy and the Constitution. There\r\nare letters from monarchs and royal personages, and there is further\r\na whole series of volumes dealing with matters in which the\r\nPrince Consort took a special interest. Some of them are arranged\r\nchronologically, some by subjects. Among the most interesting volumes\r\nare those containing the letters written by Her Majesty to her uncle\r\nLeopold, King of the Belgians, and his replies.[1] The collection\r\nof letters from and to Lord Melbourne forms another hardly less\r\ninteresting series. In many places Queen Victoria caused extracts,\r\ncopied from her own private Diaries, dealing with important political\r\nevents or describing momentous interviews, to be inserted in the\r\nvolumes, with the evident intention of illustrating and completing the\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: A set of volumes containing the Queen's letters\r\n    to Lord John Russell came into our hands too late to be made\r\n    use of for the present publication.]\r\n\r\nIt became obvious at once that it was impossible to deal with these\r\npapers exhaustively. They would provide material for a historical\r\nseries extending to several hundred volumes. Moreover, on the other\r\nhand, there are many gaps, as a great deal of the business of State\r\nwas transacted by interviews of which no official record is preserved.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty the King having decided that no attempt should be made to\r\npublish these papers _in extenso_, it was necessary to determine upon\r\nsome definite principle of selection. It became clear that the only\r\nsatisfactory plan was to publish specimens of such documents as\r\nwould serve to bring out the development of the Queen's character and\r\ndisposition, and to give typical instances of her methods in dealing\r\nwith political and social matters--to produce, in fact, a book for\r\nBritish citizens and British subjects, rather than a book for\r\nstudents of political history. That the inner working of the unwritten\r\nconstitution of the country; that some of the unrealised checks and\r\nbalances; that the delicate equipoise of the component parts of our\r\nexecutive machinery, should stand revealed, was inevitable. We have\r\nthought it best, throughout, to abstain from unnecessary comment and\r\nillustration. The period is so recent, and has been so often traversed\r\nby historians and biographers, that it appeared to us a waste of\r\nvaluable space to attempt to reconstruct the history of the years\r\nfrom which this correspondence has been selected, especially as Sir\r\nTheodore Martin, under the auspices of the Queen herself, has dealt so\r\nminutely and exhaustively with the relations of the Queen's innermost\r\ncircle to the political and social life of the time. It is tempting,\r\nof course, to add illustrative anecdotes from the abundant Biographies\r\nand Memoirs of the period; but our aim has been to infringe as little\r\nas possible upon the space available for the documents themselves,\r\nand to provide just sufficient comment to enable an ordinary reader,\r\nwithout special knowledge of the period, to follow the course of\r\nevents, and to realise the circumstances under which the Queen's\r\nchildhood was passed, the position of affairs at the time of her\r\naccession, and the personalities of those who had influenced her in\r\nearly years, or by whom she was surrounded.\r\n\r\nThe development of the Queen's character is clearly indicated in the\r\npapers, and it possesses an extraordinary interest. We see one of\r\nhighly vigorous and active temperament, of strong affections, and with\r\na deep sense of responsibility, placed at an early age, and after a\r\nquiet girlhood, in a position the greatness of which it is impossible\r\nto exaggerate. We see her character expand and deepen, schooled by\r\nmighty experience into patience and sagacity and wisdom, and yet never\r\nlosing a particle of the strength, the decision, and the devotion with\r\nwhich she had been originally endowed. Up to the year 1861 the\r\nQueen's career was one of unexampled prosperity. She was happy in her\r\ntemperament, in her health, in her education, in her wedded life, in\r\nher children. She saw a great Empire grow through troubled times in\r\nliberty and power and greatness; yet this prosperity brought with it\r\nno shadow of complacency, because the Queen felt with an increasing\r\ndepth the anxieties and responsibilities inseparable from her great\r\nposition. Her happiness, instead of making her self-absorbed, only\r\nquickened her beneficence and her womanly desire that her subjects\r\nshould be enabled to enjoy a similar happiness based upon the same\r\nsimple virtues. Nothing comes out more strongly in these documents\r\nthan the laborious patience with which the Queen kept herself informed\r\nof the minutest details of political and social movements both in her\r\nown and other countries.\r\n\r\nIt is a deeply inspiring spectacle to see one surrounded by every\r\ntemptation which worldly greatness can present, living from day to\r\nday so simple, vivid, and laborious a life; and it is impossible to\r\nconceive a more fruitful example of duty and affection and energy,\r\ndisplayed on so august a scale, and in the midst of such magnificent\r\nsurroundings. We would venture to believe that nothing could so deepen\r\nthe personal devotion of the Empire to the memory of that great Queen\r\nwho ruled it so wisely and so long, and its deeply-rooted attachment\r\nto the principle of constitutional monarchy, as the gracious act of\r\nHis Majesty the King in allowing the inner side of that noble life and\r\ncareer to be more clearly revealed to a nation whose devotion to their\r\nancient liberties is inseparably connected with their loyalty to the\r\nThrone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITORIAL NOTE\r\n\r\n\r\nOur special thanks, for aid in the preparation of these volumes, are\r\ndue to Viscount Morley of Blackburn, who has read and criticised\r\nthe book in its final form; to Mr J.

At the time of her\r\nbirth, it existed in two branches, of which, the one ruled over what\r\nwas called the Duchy of Brunswick, the other over the Electorate\r\n(since 1815 the Kingdom) of Hanover, and had since 1714 occupied the\r\nthrone of England. There had been frequent intermarriages between the\r\ntwo branches. The Dukes of Brunswick were now, however, represented\r\nonly by two young princes, who were the sons of the celebrated Duke\r\nwho fell at Quatre-Bras. Between them and the English Court there was\r\nlittle intercourse. The elder, Charles, had quarrelled with his uncle\r\nand guardian, George IV., and had in 1830 been expelled from his\r\ndominions. The obvious faults of his character made it impossible for\r\nthe other German princes to insist on his being restored, and he had\r\nbeen succeeded by his younger brother William, who ruled till his\r\ndeath in 1884. Both died unmarried, and with them the Ducal family\r\ncame to an end. One Princess of Brunswick had been the wife of George\r\nIV., and another, Augusta, was the first wife of Frederick I., King\r\nof Würtemberg, who, after her death, married a daughter of George III.\r\nThe King of Würtemberg was also, by his descent from Frederick Prince\r\nof Wales, first cousin once removed of the Queen. We need only notice,\r\nin passing, the distant connection with the royal families of Prussia,\r\nthe Netherlands, and Denmark. The Prince of Orange, who was one of the\r\npossible suitors for the young Queen's hand, was her third cousin once\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE HOUSE OF SAXE-COBURG-GOTHA]\r\n\r\nThe House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, to which the Queen belonged on her\r\nmother's side, and with which she was to be even more intimately\r\nconnected by her marriage, was one of the numerous branches into which\r\nthe ancient and celebrated House of Wettin had broken up. Since the\r\n11th century they had ruled over Meissen and the adjoining districts.\r\nTo these had been added Upper Saxony and Thuringia. In the 15th\r\ncentury the whole possessions of the House had been divided between\r\nthe two great branches which still exist. The Albertine branch\r\nretained Meissen and the Saxon possessions. They held the title of\r\nElector, which in 1806 was exchanged for the title of King. Though\r\nthe Saxon House had been the chief protectors of the Reformation,\r\nFrederick Augustus I. had, on being elected to the throne of Poland,\r\nbecome a Roman Catholic; and thereby the connection between the two\r\nbranches of the House had to a great extent ceased. The second line,\r\nthat of the Ernestines, ruled over Thuringia, but, according to the\r\ncommon German custom, had again broken up into numerous branches,\r\namong which the Duchies of Thuringia were parcelled out. At the time\r\nof the Queen's birth there were five of these, viz., Gotha-Altenburg,\r\nCoburg-Saalfeld, Weimar-Eisenach, Meiningen, and Hildburghausen. On\r\nthe extinction of the Gotha line, in 1825, there was a rearrangement\r\nof the family property, by which the Duke of Hildburghausen received\r\nAltenburg, Gotha was given to the Duke of Coburg, and Saalfeld with\r\nHildburghausen added to Meiningen. These four lines still exist.\r\n\r\nThe Ernestine princes had, by this constant division and sub-division,\r\ndeprived themselves of the opportunity of exercising any predominant\r\ninfluence, or pursuing any independent policy in German affairs; and\r\nthough they had the good fortune to emerge from the revolution with\r\ntheir possessions unimpaired, their real power was not increased. Like\r\nall the other princes, they had, however, at the Congress of Vienna,\r\nreceived the recognition of their full status as sovereign princes of\r\nthe Germanic Confederation. Together they sent a single representative\r\nto the Diet of Frankfort, the total population of the five\r\nprincipalities being only about 300,000 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIt was owing to this territorial sub-division and lack of cohesion\r\nthat these princes could not attach to their independence the\r\nsame political importance that fell to the share of the larger\r\nprincipalities, such as Hanover and Bavaria, and they were\r\nconsequently more ready than the other German princes to welcome\r\nproposals which would lead to a unification of Germany.\r\n\r\nIt is notable that the line has produced many of the most enlightened\r\nof the German princes; and nowhere in the whole of Germany were the\r\nadvantages of the division into numerous small States so clearly seen,\r\nand the disadvantages so little felt, as at Weimar, Meiningen, Gotha,\r\nand Coburg.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE HOUSE OF COBURG]\r\n\r\nThe House of Coburg had gained a highly conspicuous and influential\r\nposition, owing, partly, to the high reputation for sagacity and\r\ncharacter which the princes of that House had won, and partly to\r\nthe marriage connections which were entered into about this time by\r\nmembers of the Coburg House with the leading Royal families of Europe.\r\nWithin ten years, Princes of Coburg were established, one upon the\r\nthrone of Belgium, and two others next to the throne in Portugal and\r\nEngland, as Consorts of their respective Queens.\r\n\r\nBy the first marriage of the Duchess of Kent, the Queen was also\r\nconnected with a third class of German princes--the Mediatised, as\r\nthose were called who during the revolution had lost their sovereign\r\npower. Many of these were of as ancient lineage and had possessed as\r\nlarge estates as some of the regnant princes, who, though not always\r\nmore deserving, had been fortunate enough to retain their privileges,\r\nand had emerged from the revolution ranking among the ruling Houses of\r\nEurope. The mediatised princes, though they had ceased to rule, still\r\nheld important privileges, which were guaranteed at the Congress\r\nof Vienna. First, and most important, they were reckoned as\r\n\"_ebenburtig_,\" which means that they could contract equal marriages\r\nwith the Royal Houses, and these marriages were recognised as valid\r\nfor the transmission of rights of inheritance. Many of them had vast\r\nprivate estates, and though they were subjected to the sovereignty of\r\nthe princes in whose dominions these lay, they enjoyed very important\r\nprivileges, such as exemption from military service, and from\r\nmany forms of taxation; they also could exercise minor forms of\r\njurisdiction. They formed, therefore, an intermediate class. Since\r\nGermany, as a whole, afforded them no proper sphere of political\r\nactivity, the more ambitious did not disdain to take service with\r\nAustria or Prussia, and, to a less extent, even with the smaller\r\nStates. It was possible, therefore, for the Queen's mother, a Princess\r\nof Saxe-Coburg, to marry the Prince of Leiningen without losing caste.\r\nHer daughter, the Princess Feodore, the Queen's half-sister, married\r\nErnest, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, and thus established an\r\ninteresting connection with perhaps the most widely-spread and most\r\ndistinguished of all these families. The House of Hohenlohe would\r\nprobably still have been a reigning family, had not the Prince of\r\nHohenlohe preferred to fight in the Prussian army against Napoleon,\r\nrather than receive gifts from him. His lands were consequently\r\nconfiscated and passed to other princes who were less scrupulous.\r\nThe family has given two Ministers President to Prussia, a General in\r\nchief command of the Prussian army, a Chancellor to the German Empire,\r\nand one of the most distinguished of modern military writers. They\r\nheld, besides their extensive possessions in Würtemberg and Bavaria,\r\nthe County of Gleichen in Saxe-Coburg.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: FAMILY CONNECTIONS]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen therefore that the Queen was intimately connected with\r\nall classes that are to be found among the ruling families of Germany,\r\nthough naturally with the Catholic families, which looked to Austria\r\nand Bavaria for guidance, she had no close ties. But it must be borne\r\nin mind that her connection with Germany always remained a personal\r\nand family matter, and not a political one; this was the fortunate\r\nresult of the predominance of the Coburg influence. Had that of the\r\nHouse of Hanover been supreme, it could hardly have been possible\r\nfor the Queen not to have been drawn into the opposition to the\r\nunification of Germany by Prussia, in which the House of Hanover was\r\nbound to take a leading part, in virtue of its position, wealth, and\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\nIt will be as well here to mention the principal reigning families of\r\nEurope to which Queen Victoria was closely allied through her mother.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess of Kent's eldest brother, Ernest, Duke of Saxe-Coburg,\r\nwas the father of Albert, Prince Consort. Her sister was the wife of\r\nAlexander, Duke of Würtemberg. The Duchess of Kent's nephew, Ferdinand\r\n(son of Ferdinand, the Duchess's brother), married Maria da Gloria,\r\nQueen of Portugal, and was father of Pedro V. and Luis, both\r\nsubsequently Kings of Portugal.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess's third brother, Leopold (afterwards King of the\r\nBelgians), married first the Princess Charlotte, daughter of George\r\nIV., and afterwards the Princess Louise Marie, eldest daughter of\r\nKing Louis Philippe. Prince Augustus (son of Ferdinand, the Duchess\r\nof Kent's brother) married another daughter of Louis Philippe, the\r\nPrincess Clémentine, while Prince Augustus's sister, Victoria, married\r\nthe Duc de Nemours, a son of Louis Philippe. Another nephew, Duke\r\nFriedrich Wilhelm Alexander, son of the Duchess of Würtemberg, married\r\nthe Princess Marie, another daughter of Louis Philippe.\r\n\r\nThus Queen Victoria was closely allied with the royal families of\r\nFrance, Portugal, Belgium, Saxe-Coburg, and Würtemberg.\r\n\r\nOn turning to the immediate Royal Family of England, it will be seen\r\nthat the male line at the time of the Queen's accession was limited to\r\nthe sons, both named George, of two of the younger brothers of George\r\nIV., the Dukes of Cumberland and Cambridge. The sons of George III.\r\nplayed their part in the national life, shared the strong interest in\r\nmilitary matters, and showed the great personal courage which was a\r\ntradition of the family.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE ENGLISH ROYAL FAMILY]\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that abstention from active political life\r\nhad been in no sense required, or even thought desirable, in members\r\nof the Royal House. George III. himself had waged a life-long struggle\r\nwith the Whig party, that powerful oligarchy that since the accession\r\nof the House of Hanover had virtually ruled the country; but he did\r\nnot carry on the conflict so much by encouraging the opponents of the\r\nWhigs, as by placing himself at the head of a monarchical faction. He\r\nwas in fact the leader of a third party in the State. George IV. was\r\nat first a strong Whig, and lived on terms of the greatest intimacy\r\nwith Charles James Fox; but by the time that he was thirty, he had\r\nsevered the connection with his former political friends, which had\r\nindeed originally arisen more out of his personal opposition to his\r\nfather than from any political convictions. After this date he became,\r\nwith intervals of vacillation, an advanced Tory of an illiberal\r\ntype. William IV. had lived so much aloof from politics before his\r\naccession, that he had had then no very pronounced opinions, though he\r\nwas believed to be in favour of the Reform Bill; during his reign his\r\nTory sympathies became more pronounced, and the position of the Whig\r\nMinistry was almost an intolerable one. His other brothers were men\r\nof decided views, and for the most part of high social gifts. They not\r\nonly attended debates in the House of Peers, but spoke with emotion\r\nand vigour; they held political interviews with leading statesmen, and\r\nconsidered themselves entitled, not to over-rule political movements,\r\nbut to take the part in them to which their strong convictions\r\nprompted them. They were particularly prominent in the debates on the\r\nCatholic question, and did not hesitate to express their views with an\r\nenergy that was often embarrassing. The Duke of York and the Duke of\r\nCumberland had used all their influence to encourage the King in his\r\nopposition to Catholic Emancipation, while the Duke of Cambridge had\r\nsupported that policy, and the Duke of Sussex had spoken in the House\r\nof Lords in favour of it. The Duke of York, a kindly, generous man,\r\nhad held important commands in the earlier part of the Revolutionary\r\nwar; he had not shown tactical nor strategical ability, but he was for\r\nmany years Commander-in-Chief of the Army, and did good administrative\r\nwork in initiating and carrying out much-needed military reforms. He\r\nhad married a Prussian princess, but left no issue, and his death,\r\nin 1827, left the succession open to his younger brother, the Duke of\r\nClarence, afterwards King William IV., and after him to the Princess\r\nVictoria.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE ROYAL DUKES]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Kent was, as we shall have occasion to show, a strong Whig\r\nwith philanthropic views. But the ablest of the princes, though also\r\nthe most unpopular, was the Duke of Cumberland, who, until the birth\r\nof the Queen's first child, was heir presumptive to the Throne. He had\r\nbeen one of the most active members of the ultra-Tory party, who had\r\nopposed to the last the Emancipation of the Catholics and the Reform\r\nBill. He had married a sister-in-law of the King of Prussia, and lived\r\nmuch in Berlin, where he was intimate with the leaders of the military\r\nparty, who were the centre of reactionary influences in that\r\ncountry, chief among them being his brother-in-law, Prince Charles of\r\nMecklenburg.\r\n\r\nIn private life the Duke was bluff and soldier-like, of rather a\r\nbullying turn, and extraordinarily indifferent to the feelings of\r\nothers. \"Ernest is not a bad fellow,\" his brother William IV. said of\r\nhim, \"but if anyone has a corn, he will be sure to tread on it.\" He\r\nwas very unpopular in England.\r\n\r\nOn the death of William IV. he succeeded to the throne of Hanover, and\r\nfrom that time seldom visited England. His first act on reaching his\r\nkingdom was to declare invalid the Constitution which had been\r\ngranted in 1833 by William IV. His justification for this was that his\r\nconsent, as heir presumptive, which was necessary for its validity,\r\nhad not at the time been asked. The act caused great odium to be\r\nattached to his name by all Liberals, both English and Continental,\r\nand it was disapproved of even by his old Tory associates. None the\r\nless he soon won great popularity in his own dominions by his zeal,\r\ngood-humour, and energy, and in 1840 he came to terms with the\r\nEstates. A new Constitution was drawn up which preserved more of the\r\nRoyal prerogatives than the instrument of 1833. Few German princes\r\nsuffered so little in the revolution of 1848. The King died in 1851,\r\nat the age of eighty, and left one son, George, who had been blind\r\nfrom his boyhood. He was the last King of Hanover, being expelled by\r\nthe Prussians in 1866. On the failure of the Ducal line of Brunswick,\r\nthe grandson of Ernest Augustus became heir to their dominions, he and\r\nhis sons being now the sole male representatives of all the branches\r\nof the House of Brunswick, which a few generations ago was one of the\r\nmost numerous and widely-spread ruling Houses in Germany.[1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: Of the daughters of George III., Princess Amelia\r\n    had died in 1810, and the Queen of Würtemberg in 1828; two\r\n    married daughters survived--Elizabeth, wife of the Landgrave\r\n    of Hesse-Homburg, and Mary, who had married her cousin, the\r\n    Duke of Gloucester, and lived in England. There were also two\r\n    unmarried daughters, the Princesses Augusta and Sophia, living\r\n    in England.]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Sussex was in sympathy with many Liberal movements, and\r\nsupported the removal of religious disabilities, the abolition of the\r\nCorn Laws, and Parliamentary Reform.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cambridge was a moderate Tory, and the most conciliatory\r\nof all the princes. But for more than twenty years he took little part\r\nin English politics, as he was occupied with his duties as Regent of\r\nHanover, where he did much by prudent reforms to retain the allegiance\r\nof the Hanoverians. On his return to England he resumed the position\r\nof a peacemaker, supporting philanthropic movements, and being a\r\ngenerous patron of art and letters. He was recognised as \"emphatically\r\nthe connecting link between the Crown and the people.\" Another member\r\nof the Royal Family was the Duke of Gloucester, nephew and son-in-law\r\nof George III.; he was more interested in philanthropic movements than\r\nin politics, but was a moderate Conservative, who favoured Catholic\r\nEmancipation but was opposed to Parliamentary Reform.\r\n\r\nThus we have the spectacle of seven Royal princes, of whom two\r\nsucceeded to the Throne, all or nearly all avowed politicians of\r\ndecided convictions, throwing the weight of their influence and\r\nsocial position for the most part on the side of the Tory party,\r\nand believing it to be rather their duty to hold and express strong\r\npolitical opinions than to adopt the moderating and conciliatory\r\nattitude in matters of government that is now understood to be the\r\ntrue function of the Royal House.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: INDEPENDENCE OF THE QUEEN]\r\n\r\nThe Queen, after her accession, always showed great respect and\r\naffection for her uncles, but they were not able to exercise any\r\ninfluence over her character or opinions.\r\n\r\nThis was partly due to the fact that from an early age she had imbibed\r\na respect for liberal views from her uncle Leopold, King of the\r\nBelgians, to whom she was devoted from her earliest childhood, and for\r\nwhom she entertained feelings of the deepest admiration, affection,\r\nand confidence; but still more was it due to the fact that, from the\r\nvery first, the Queen instinctively formed an independent judgment\r\non any question that concerned her; and though she was undoubtedly\r\ninfluenced in her decisions by her affectionate reliance on her chosen\r\nadvisers, yet those advisers were always deliberately and shrewdly\r\nselected, and their opinions were in no case allowed to do more than\r\nmodify her own penetrating and clear-sighted judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nMEMOIR OF QUEEN VICTORIA'S EARLY YEARS\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDRINA VICTORIA, Queen of Great Britain and Ireland and Empress\r\nof India, was born on Monday, 24th May 1819, at Kensington Palace.\r\n\r\nHer father, Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn (1767-1820), the\r\nfourth son of George III., was a man of decided character, kindly,\r\npious, punctual, with a strict sense of duty and enlightened ideas. He\r\nwas a devoted soldier, and, as Queen Victoria once said, \"was proud of\r\nhis profession, and I was always taught to consider myself a soldier's\r\nchild.\" He had a wide military experience, having served at\r\nGibraltar, in Canada, and in the West Indies. He had been mentioned in\r\ndespatches, but was said to be over-strict in matters of unimportant\r\ndetail. His active career was brought to an end in 1802, when he had\r\nbeen sent to Gibraltar to restore order in a mutinous garrison. Order\r\nhad been restored, but the Duke was recalled under allegations of\r\nhaving exercised undue severity, and the investigation which\r\nhe demanded was refused him, though he was afterwards made a\r\nField-Marshal.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of advanced Liberal ideas. He had spoken in the House\r\nof Lords in favour of Catholic Emancipation, and had shown himself\r\ninterested in the abolition of slavery and in popular education. His\r\ntastes were literary, and towards the end of his life he had even\r\nmanifested a strong sympathy for socialistic theories.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the death of the Princess Charlotte, 6th November 1817,\r\nthe married sons of King George III. were without legitimate children,\r\nand the surviving daughters were either unmarried or childless.\r\nAlliances were accordingly arranged for the three unmarried Royal\r\nDukes, and in the course of the year 1818 the Dukes of Cambridge,\r\nKent, and Clarence led their brides to the altar.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE DUKE AND DUCHESS OF KENT]\r\n\r\nThe Duchess of Kent (1786-1861), Victoria Mary Louisa, was a daughter\r\nof Francis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. She was the widow of Emich\r\nCharles, Prince of Leiningen,[1] whom she had married in 1803, and who\r\nhad died in 1814, leaving a son and a daughter by her.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: _Leiningen_, a mediatised princely House of\r\n    Germany, dating back to 1096. In 1779 the head of one of\r\n    the branches into which it had become divided, the Count of\r\n    Leiningen-Dachsburg-Hardenburg, was raised to the rank of\r\n    a prince of the Empire, but the Peace of Lunéville (1801)\r\n    deprived him of his ancient possessions, extending about\r\n    232 miles on the left bank of the Rhine. Though no longer an\r\n    independent Prince, the head of the House retains his rank and\r\n    wealth, and owns extensive estates in Bavaria and Hesse.]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Kent died prematurely--though he had always been a\r\nconspicuously healthy man--at Sidmouth, on the 23rd of January 1820,\r\nonly a week before his father.\r\n\r\nA paper preserved in the Windsor archives gives a touching account of\r\nthe Duke's last hours. The Regent, on the 22nd of January, sent to him\r\na message of solicitude and affection, expressing an anxious wish for\r\nhis recovery. The Duke roused himself to enquire how the Prince was in\r\nhealth, and said, \"If I could now shake hands with him, I should die\r\nin peace.\" A few hours before the end, one who stood by the curtain\r\nof his bed heard the Duke say with deep emotion, \"May the Almighty\r\nprotect my wife and child, and forgive all the sins I have committed.\"\r\nHis last words--addressed to his wife--were, \"Do not forget me.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duchess of Kent was an affectionate, impulsive woman, with more\r\nemotional sympathy than practical wisdom in worldly matters. But her\r\nclaim on the gratitude of the British nation is that she brought up\r\nher illustrious daughter in habits of simplicity, self-sacrifice, and\r\nobedience.\r\n\r\nAs a testimony to the sincere appreciation entertained by the\r\npoliticians of the time for the way in which the Duchess of Kent had\r\nappreciated her responsibilities with regard to the education of a\r\nprobable heir to the Crown of England, we may quote a few sentences\r\nfrom two speeches made in the House of Commons, in the debate\r\nwhich took place (27th May 1825) on the question of increasing the\r\nParliamentary annuity paid to the Duchess, in order to provide duly\r\nfor the education of the young Princess.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Robinson, afterwards Lord Ripon,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n  \"The position in which this Princess stood with respect to the\r\n  throne of the country could not fail to make her an object of\r\n  general interest to the nation. He had not himself the honour\r\n  of being acquainted with the Duchess of Kent, but he believed\r\n  that she had taken the greatest pains with her daughter's\r\n  education. She had been brought up in principles of piety and\r\n  morality, and to feel a _proper_ sense, he meant by that an\r\n  humble sense, of her own dignity, and the rank which probably\r\n  awaited her. Perhaps it might have been fit to have brought\r\n  this matter before Parliament at an earlier period.\"\r\n\r\nMr Canning said:\r\n\r\n  \"All parties agreed in the propriety of the Grant, and if\r\n  Government had anything to answer for on this point, it was\r\n  for having so long delayed bringing it before the House. There\r\n  could not be a greater compliment to Her Royal Highness than\r\n  to state the quiet unobtrusive tenor of her life, and that\r\n  she had never made herself the object of public gaze, but had\r\n  devoted herself to the education of her child, whom the House\r\n  was now called upon to adopt.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: EARLY REMINISCENCES]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1872 Queen Victoria wrote down with her own hand some\r\nreminiscences of her early childhood, the manuscript of which is\r\npreserved at Windsor, and which may be quoted here.\r\n\r\n\"My earliest recollections are connected with Kensington Palace,\r\nwhere I can remember crawling on a yellow carpet spread out for that\r\npurpose--and being told that if I cried and was naughty my 'Uncle\r\nSussex' would hear me and punish me, for which reason I always\r\nscreamed when I saw him! I had a great horror of _Bishops_ on account\r\nof their wigs and _aprons_, but recollect this being partially\r\ngot over in the case of the then Bishop of Salisbury (Dr Fisher,\r\ngreat-uncle to Mr Fisher, Private Secretary to the Prince of Wales),\r\nby his kneeling down and letting me play with his badge of Chancellor\r\nof the Order of the Garter. With another Bishop, however, the\r\npersuasion of showing him my 'pretty shoes' was of no use. Claremont\r\nremains as the brightest epoch of my otherwise rather melancholy\r\nchildhood--where to be under the roof of that beloved Uncle--to listen\r\nto some music in the Hall when there were dinner-parties--and to go\r\nand see dear old Louis!--the former faithful and devoted Dresser and\r\nfriend of Princess Charlotte--beloved and respected by all who knew\r\nher--and who doted on the little Princess who was too much an idol in\r\nthe House. This dear old lady was visited by every one--and was the\r\nonly really devoted Attendant of the poor Princess, whose governesses\r\npaid little real attention to her--and who never left her, and was\r\nwith her when she died. I used to ride a donkey given me by my Uncle,\r\nthe Duke of York, who was very kind to me. I remember him well--tall,\r\nrather large, very kind but extremely shy. He always gave me beautiful\r\npresents. The last time I saw him was at Mr Greenwood's house, where\r\nD. Carlos lived at one time,--when he was already very ill,--and he\r\nhad Punch and Judy in the garden for me.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: EARLY REMINISCENCES]\r\n\r\n\"To Ramsgate we used to go frequently in the summer, and I remember\r\nliving at Townley House (near the town), and going there by steamer.\r\nMamma was very unwell. Dear Uncle Leopold went with us.\r\n\r\n\"To Tunbridge Wells we also went, living at a house called Mt.\r\nPleasant, now an Hotel. Many pleasant days were spent here, and the\r\nreturn to Kensington in October or November was generally a day of\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n\"I was brought up very simply--never had a room to myself till I was\r\nnearly grown up--always slept in my Mother's room till I came to the\r\nThrone. At Claremont, and in the small houses at the bathing-places,\r\nI sat and took my lessons in my Governess's bedroom. I was not fond of\r\nlearning as a little child--and baffled every attempt to teach me my\r\nletters up to 5 years old--when I consented to learn them by their\r\nbeing written down before me.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: GEORGE IV.]\r\n\r\n\"I remember going to Carlton House, when George IV. lived there, as\r\nquite a little child before a dinner the King gave. The Duchess of\r\nCambridge and my 2 cousins, George and Augusta, were there. My Aunt,\r\nthe Queen of Würtemberg (Princess Royal), came over, in the year '26,\r\nI think, and I recollect perfectly well seeing her drive through the\r\nPark in the King's carriage with red liveries and 4 horses, in a _Cap_\r\nand evening dress,--my Aunt, her sister Princess Augusta, sitting\r\n_opposite_ to her, also in evening attire, having dined early with the\r\nDuke of Sussex at Kensington. She had adopted all the German fashions\r\nand spoke broken English--and had not been in England for many\r\nmany years. She was very kind and good-humoured but very large and\r\nunwieldy. She lived at St James's and had a number of Germans with\r\nher. In the year '26 (I think) George IV. asked my Mother, my Sister\r\nand me down to Windsor for the first time; he had been on bad terms\r\nwith my poor father when he died,--and took hardly any notice of the\r\npoor widow and little fatherless girl, who were so poor at the time\r\nof his (the Duke of Kent's) death, that they could not have travelled\r\nback to Kensington Palace had it not been for the kind assistance of\r\nmy dear Uncle, Prince Leopold. We went to Cumberland Lodge, the King\r\nliving at the Royal Lodge. Aunt Gloucester was there at the same\r\ntime. When we arrived at the Royal Lodge the King took me by the hand,\r\nsaying: 'Give me your little paw.' He was large and gouty but with a\r\nwonderful dignity and charm of manner. He wore the wig which was so\r\nmuch worn in those days. Then he said he would give me something for\r\nme to wear, and that was his picture set in diamonds, which was worn\r\nby the Princesses as an order to a blue ribbon on the left shoulder. I\r\nwas very proud of this,--and Lady Conyngham pinned it on my shoulder.\r\nHer husband, the late Marquis of Conyngham, was the Lord\r\nChamberlain and constantly there, as well as Lord Mt. Charles (as\r\nVice-Chamberlain), the _present_ Lord Conyngham.\r\n\r\n\"None of the Royal Family or general visitors lived at the Royal\r\nLodge, but only the Conyngham family; all the rest at Cumberland\r\nLodge. Lady Maria Conyngham (now dead, first wife to Lord Athlumney,\r\ndaughter of Lord Conyngham), then quite young, and Lord Graves\r\n(brother-in-law to Lord Anglesey and who afterwards shot himself on\r\naccount of his wife's conduct, who was a Lady of the Bedchamber), were\r\ndesired to take me a drive to amuse me. I went with them, and Baroness\r\n(then Miss) Lehzen (my governess) in a pony carriage and 4, with 4\r\ngrey ponies (like my own), and was driven about the Park and taken to\r\nSandpit Gate where the King had a Menagerie--with wapitis, gazelles,\r\nchamois, etc., etc. Then we went (I think the next day) to Virginia\r\nWater, and met the King in his phaeton in which he was driving the\r\nDuchess of Gloucester,--and he said 'Pop her in,' and I was lifted\r\nin and placed between him and Aunt Gloucester, who held me round\r\nthe waist. (Mamma was much frightened.) I was greatly pleased, and\r\nremember that I looked with great respect at the scarlet liveries,\r\netc. (the Royal Family had crimson and green liveries and only the\r\nKing scarlet and blue in those days). We drove round the nicest part\r\nof Virginia Water and stopped at the Fishing Temple. Here there was\r\na large barge and every one went on board and fished, while a band\r\nplayed in another! There were numbers of great people there, amongst\r\nwhom was the last Duke of Dorset, then Master of the Horse. The King\r\npaid great attention to my Sister,[2] and some people fancied he\r\nmight marry her!! She was very lovely then--about 18--and had charming\r\nmanners, about which the King was extremely particular. I afterwards\r\nwent with Baroness Lehzen and Lady Maria C. to the Page Whiting's\r\ncottage. Whiting had been at one time in my father's service. He lived\r\nwhere Mr Walsh now does (and where he died years ago), in the small\r\ncottage close by; and here I had some _fruit_ and amused myself by\r\ncramming one of Whiting's children, a little girl, with peaches. I\r\ncame after dinner to hear the band play in the Conservatory, which\r\nis still standing, and which was lit up by coloured lamps--the King,\r\nRoyal Family, etc., sitting in a corner of the large saloon, which\r\nstill stands.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: The Princess Feodore of Leiningen, afterwards\r\n    Princess of Hohenlohe, Queen Victoria's half-sister.]\r\n\r\n\"On the second visit (I _think_) the following year, also in summer,\r\nthere was a great encampment of tents (the same which were used at\r\nthe Camp at Chobham in '53, and some single ones at the Breakfasts at\r\nBuckingham Palace in '68-9), and which were quite like a house, made\r\ninto different compartments. It rained dreadfully on this occasion,\r\nI well remember. The King and party dined there, Prince and Princess\r\nLieven, the Russian Ambassador and Ambassadress were there.\r\n\r\n\"I also remember going to see Aunt Augusta at Frogmore, where she\r\nlived always in the summer.\r\n\r\n\"We lived in a very simple, plain manner; breakfast was at half-past\r\neight, luncheon at half-past one, dinner at seven--to which I came\r\ngenerally (when it was no regular large dinner party)--eating my bread\r\nand milk out of a small silver basin. Tea was only allowed as a great\r\ntreat in later years.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DUCHESS OF SAXE-COBURG-SAALFELD]\r\n\r\n\"In 1826 (I think) my dear Grandmother, the Dowager Duchess of\r\nSaxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, came to Claremont, in the summer. Mamma and my\r\nsister went on part of the way to meet her, and Uncle Leopold I think\r\nhad been to fetch her as far as Dover. I recollect the excitement and\r\nanxiety I was in, at this event,--going down the great flight of steps\r\nto meet her when she got out of the carriage, and hearing her say,\r\nwhen she sat down in her room, and fixed her fine clear blue eyes on\r\nher little grand-daughter whom she called in her letters 'the flower\r\nof May,' 'Ein schönes Kind'--'a fine child.' She was very clever and\r\nadored by her children but especially by her sons. She was a good deal\r\nbent and walked with a stick, and frequently with her hands on her\r\nback. She took long drives in an open carriage and I was frequently\r\nsent out with her, which I am sorry to confess I did not like, as,\r\nlike most children of that age, I preferred running about. She was\r\nexcessively kind to children, but could not bear naughty ones--and I\r\nshall never forget her coming into the room when I had been crying and\r\nnaughty at my lessons--from the next room but one, where she had\r\nbeen with Mamma--and scolding me severely, which had a very salutary\r\neffect. She dined early in the afternoon and Uncle Leopold asked many\r\nof the neighbours and others to dinner to meet her. My brother Prince\r\nLeiningen came over with her, and was at that time paying his court\r\nto one of her ladies, Countess Klebelsberg, whom he afterwards\r\nmarried--against the wish of his grandmother and mother--but which was\r\nafterwards quite made up. In November (I think, or it may have been\r\nat the end of October) she left, taking my sister with her back to\r\nCoburg. I was very ill at that time, of dysentery, which illness\r\nincreased to an alarming degree; many children died of it in the\r\nvillage of Esher. The Doctor lost his head, having lost his own child\r\nfrom it, and almost every doctor in London was away. Mr Blagden came\r\ndown and showed much energy on the occasion. I recovered, and remember\r\nwell being very cross and screaming dreadfully at having to wear, for\r\na time, flannel next my skin. Up to my 5th year I had been very much\r\nindulged by every one, and set pretty well _all_ at defiance. Old\r\nBaroness de Späth, the devoted Lady of my Mother, my Nurse Mrs Brock,\r\ndear old Mrs Louis--_all_ worshipped the poor little fatherless child\r\nwhose future then was still very uncertain; my Uncle the Duke of\r\nClarence's poor little child being alive, and the Duchess of Clarence\r\nhad one or two others later. At 5 years old, Miss Lehzen was placed\r\nabout me, and though she was most kind, she was very firm and I had\r\na proper respect for her. I was naturally very passionate, but always\r\nmost contrite afterwards. I was taught from the first to beg my maid's\r\npardon for any naughtiness or rudeness towards her; a feeling I have\r\never retained, and think every one should _own_ their fault in a kind\r\nway to any one, be he or she the lowest--if one has been rude to or\r\ninjured them by word or deed, especially those below you. People will\r\nreadily forget an insult or an injury when others _own_ their fault,\r\nand express sorrow or regret at what they have done.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE EDUCATION OF THE PRINCESS]\r\n\r\nIn 1830 the Duchess of Kent wished to be satisfied that the system of\r\neducation then being pursued with the Princess was based on the right\r\nlines, and that due moral and intellectual progress was being made.\r\nA memorandum, carefully preserved among the archives, gives an\r\ninteresting account of the steps which she took to this end.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LETTER TO THE BISHOPS]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION]\r\n\r\nThe Duchess therefore brought the matter under the consideration\r\nof those whom, from their eminent piety, great learning, and high\r\nstation, she considered best calculated to afford her valuable advice\r\nupon so important a subject. She stated to the Bishops of London\r\nand Lincoln[3] the particular course which had been followed in the\r\nPrincess's education, and requested their Lordships to test the\r\nresult by personal examination. The nature and objects of Her Royal\r\nHighness's appeal to these eminent prelates will be best shown by the\r\nfollowing extracts from her letter to the Bishops:--\r\n\r\n  \"'The Princess will be eleven years of age in May; by the\r\n  death of her revered father when she was but eight months old,\r\n  her sole care and charge devolved to me. Stranger as I then\r\n  was, I became deeply impressed with the absolute necessity of\r\n  bringing her up entirely in this country, that every feeling\r\n  should be that of Her native land, and proving thereby my\r\n  devotion to duty by rejecting all those feelings of home and\r\n  kindred that divided my heart.\r\n\r\n  \"'When the Princess approached her fifth year I considered it\r\n  the proper time to begin in a moderate way her education--an\r\n  education that was to fit Her to be either the Sovereign of\r\n  these realms, or to fill a junior station in the Royal Family,\r\n  until the Will of Providence should shew at a later period\r\n  what Her destiny was to be.\r\n\r\n  \"'A revision of the papers I send you herewith will best shew\r\n  your Lordships the system pursued, the progress made, etc. I\r\n  attend almost always myself every lesson, or a part; and as\r\n  the Lady about the Princess is a competent person, she assists\r\n  Her in preparing Her lessons for the various masters, as\r\n  I resolved to act in that manner so as to be Her Governess\r\n  myself. I naturally hope that I have pursued that course most\r\n  beneficial to all the great interests at stake. At the present\r\n  moment no concern can be more momentous, or in which the\r\n  consequences, the interests of the Country, can be more at\r\n  stake, than the education of its future Sovereign.\r\n\r\n  \"'I feel the time to be now come that what has been done\r\n  should be put to some test, that if anything has been done in\r\n  error of judgment it may be corrected, and that the plan for\r\n  the future should be open to consideration and revision. I do\r\n  not presume to have an over-confidence in what I have done; on\r\n  the contrary, as a female, as a stranger (but only in birth,\r\n  as I feel that this is my country by the duties I fulfil, and\r\n  the support I receive), I naturally desire to have a candid\r\n  opinion from authorities competent to give one. In that view I\r\n  address your Lordships; I would propose to you that you advert\r\n  to all I have stated, to the papers I lay before you, and that\r\n  then you should personally examine the Princess with a view of\r\n  telling me--\r\n\r\n    \"'1. If the course hitherto pursued in Her education has\r\n        been the best; if not, where it was erroneous.\r\n\r\n    \"'2. If the Princess has made all the Progress she should\r\n       have made.\r\n\r\n    \"'3. And if the course I am to follow is that you would\r\n       recommend, and if not in what respect you would\r\n       desire a change, and on what grounds.\r\n\r\n  \"'Mr Davys[4] will explain to you the nature of the Princess's\r\n  religious education, which I have confided to him, that\r\n  she should be brought up in the Church of England as by\r\n  Law established. When she was at a proper age she commenced\r\n  attending Divine Service regularly with me, and I have every\r\n  feeling, that she has religion at Her heart, that she is\r\n  morally impressed with it to that degree, that she is less\r\n  liable to error by its application to Her feelings as a Child\r\n  capable of reflection. The general bent of Her character\r\n  is strength of intellect, capable of receiving with ease,\r\n  information, and with a peculiar readiness in coming to a very\r\n  just and benignant decision on any point Her opinion is asked\r\n  on. Her adherence to truth is of so marked a character that I\r\n  feel no apprehension of that Bulwark being broken down by any\r\n  circumstance.\r\n\r\n  \"'I must conclude by observing that as yet the Princess is not\r\n  aware of the station that she is likely to fill. She is aware\r\n  of its duties, and that a Sovereign should live for others;\r\n  so that when Her innocent mind receives the impression of Her\r\n  future fate, she receives it with a mind formed to be sensible\r\n  of what is to be expected from Her, and it is to be hoped, she\r\n  will be too well grounded in Her principles to be dazzled with\r\n  the station she is to look to.'\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: Charles James Blomfield, Bishop of London,\r\n    1828-1853, and John Kaye, Bishop of Lincoln, 1827-1853.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: The Rev. George Davys, the Princess's instructor,\r\n    afterwards successively Dean of Chester and Bishop of\r\n    Peterborough.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe examination was undertaken by the Bishops, with highly\r\nsatisfactory results. Their report says:\r\n\r\n  \"The result of the examination has been such as in our opinion\r\n  amply to justify the plan of instruction which has been\r\n  adopted. In answering a great variety of questions proposed to\r\n  her, the Princess displayed an accurate knowledge of the most\r\n  important features of Scripture History, and of the leading\r\n  truths and precepts of the Christian Religion as taught by\r\n  the Church of England, as well as an acquaintance with the\r\n  Chronology and principal facts of English History remarkable\r\n  in so young a person. To questions in Geography, the use of\r\n  the Globes, Arithmetic, and Latin Grammar, the answers which\r\n  the Princess returned were equally satisfactory.\r\n\r\n  \"Upon the whole, we feel no hesitation in stating our opinion\r\n  that the Princess should continue, for some time to come, to\r\n  pursue her studies upon the same plan which has been hitherto\r\n  followed, and under the same superintendence. Nor do we\r\n  apprehend that any other alterations in the plan will be\r\n  required than those which will be gradually made by the\r\n  judicious director of Her Highness's studies, as the mind\r\n  expands, and her faculties are strengthened.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: RESULT OF EXAMINATION]\r\n\r\nThe Duchess of Kent referred all this correspondence to the Archbishop\r\nof Canterbury.[5] His memorandum is preserved; it states he has\r\nconsidered the Report, and further, has himself personally examined\r\nthe Princess. He continues:\r\n\r\n  \"I feel it my duty to say that in my judgment the plan of Her\r\n  Highness's studies, as detailed in the papers transmitted to me by\r\n  command of your Royal Highness, is very judicious, and particularly\r\n  suitable to Her Highness's exalted station; and that from the\r\n  proficiency exhibited by the Princess in the examination at which\r\n  I was present, and the general correctness and pertinency of her\r\n  answers, I am perfectly satisfied that Her Highness's education\r\n  in regard to cultivation of intellect, improvement of talent, and\r\n  religious and moral principle, is conducted with so much care and\r\n  success as to render any alteration of the system undesirable.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: Dr William Howley.]\r\n\r\nThe Princess was gradually and watchfully introduced to public life,\r\nand was never allowed to lose sight of the fact that her exalted\r\nposition carried with it definite and obvious duties. The following\r\nspeech, delivered at Plymouth in 1832, in answer to a complimentary\r\ndeputation, may stand as an instance of the view which the Duchess of\r\nKent took of her own and her daughter's responsibilities:--\r\n\r\n  \"It is very agreeable to the Princess and myself to hear the\r\n  sentiments you convey to us. It is also gratifying to us to be assured\r\n  that we owe all these kind feelings to the attachment you bear the\r\n  King, as well as to his Predecessors of the House of Brunswick, from\r\n  recollections of their paternal sway. The object of my life is\r\n  to render the Princess worthy of the affectionate solicitude she\r\n  inspires, and if it be the Will of Providence she should fill a higher\r\n  station (I trust most fervently at a very distant day), I shall\r\n  be fully repaid for my anxious care, if she is found competent to\r\n  discharge the sacred trust; for communicating as the Princess does\r\n  with all classes of Society, she cannot but perceive that the greater\r\n  the diffusion of Religion, Knowledge, and the love of freedom in a\r\n  country, the more orderly, industrious, and wealthy is its population,\r\n  and that with the desire to preserve the constitutional Prerogatives\r\n  of the Crown ought to be co-ordinate the protection of the liberties\r\n  of the people.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: CLAREMONT]\r\n\r\nThe strictness of the _régime_ under which the Princess was brought\r\nup is remarkable; and it is possible that her later zest for simple\r\nsocial pleasures is partly to be accounted for by the austere routine\r\nof her early days. In an interesting letter of 1843 to the Queen,\r\nrecalling the days of their childhood, Princess Feodore, the Queen's\r\nhalf-sister, wrote--\r\n\r\n\"Many, many thanks, dearest Victoria, for your kind letter of the\r\n7th from dear Claremont. Oh I understand how you like being there.\r\nClaremont is a dear quiet place; to me also the recollection of the\r\nfew pleasant days I spent during my youth. I always left Claremont\r\nwith tears for Kensington Palace. When I look back upon those years,\r\nwhich ought to have been the happiest in my life, from fourteen\r\nto twenty, I cannot help pitying myself. Not to have enjoyed the\r\npleasures of youth is nothing, but to have been deprived of all\r\nintercourse, and not one cheerful thought in that dismal existence of\r\nours, was very hard. My only happy time was going or driving out with\r\nyou and Lehzen; then I could speak and look as I liked. I escaped\r\nsome years of imprisonment, which you, my poor darling sister, had\r\nto endure after I was married. But God Almighty has changed both\r\nour destinies most mercifully, and has made us _so_ happy in our\r\nhomes--which is the only real happiness in this life; and those years\r\nof trial were, I am sure, very useful to us both, though certainly not\r\npleasant. Thank God they are over!... I was much amused in your last\r\nletter at your tracing the _quickness_ of our tempers in the female\r\nline up to Grandmamma,[6] but I must own that you are _quite right_!\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: Augusta Caroline Sophia, Dowager-Duchess\r\n    of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, a Princess of Reuss Ebersdorf\r\n    (1757-1831).]\r\n\r\nBut if there was little amusement, there was, on the other hand, great\r\ndevotion; the Princess, as a child, had that peculiar combination\r\nof self-will and warm-heartedness which is apt to win for a child a\r\nspecial love from its elders. The Princess Feodore wrote to the Queen,\r\nin 1843--\r\n\r\n\"... Späth[7] wished _me_ to thank you for the coronation print, as\r\nshe could not write to you or Albert _now_, she says! why, I don't\r\nsee. There certainly never was such devotedness as hers, to all our\r\nfamily, although it sometimes shows itself rather foolishly--with you\r\nit always was a sort of idolatry, when she used to go upon her knees\r\nbefore you, when you were a child. She and poor old Louis did all\r\nthey could to spoil you, if Lehzen had not prevented and scolded them\r\nnicely sometimes; it was quite amusing.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: Baroness Späth, Lady-in-Waiting to the Duchess of\r\n    Kent.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: WILLIAM IV.]\r\n\r\nThe Princess was brought up with exemplary simplicity at Kensington\r\nPalace, where her mother had a set of apartments. She was often at\r\nClaremont, which belonged to her uncle Leopold, King of the Belgians;\r\nholidays were spent at Ramsgate, Tunbridge Wells, Broadstairs, and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn June 1830 George IV. died, and William IV. succeeded to the Throne.\r\nHe had no legitimate offspring living; and it consequently became\r\npractically certain that if the Princess outlived her uncle she would\r\nsucceed him on the Throne. The Duchess of Kent's Parliamentary Grant\r\nwas increased, and she took advantage of her improved resources to\r\nfamiliarise the Princess with the social life of the nation. They paid\r\nvisits to historic houses and important towns, and received addresses.\r\nThis was a wise and prudent course, but the King spoke with ill-humour\r\nof his niece's \"royal progresses.\" The chief cause of offence was that\r\nthe Princess was not allowed by the Duchess of Kent to make her public\r\nappearances under his own auspices, as he not unnaturally desired.\r\nHe also began to suspect that the Princess was deliberately kept\r\naway from Court; a painful controversy arose, and the Duchess\r\nbecame gradually estranged from her brother-in-law, in spite of the\r\naffectionate attempts of Queen Adelaide to smooth matters over. His\r\nresentment culminated in a painful scene, in 1836, when the King, at\r\na State banquet at Windsor, made a speech of a preposterous character;\r\nspeaking of the Duchess, who sat next him, as \"that person,\" hinting\r\nthat she was surrounded with evil advisers, and adding that he should\r\ninsist on the Princess being more at Court. The Princess burst into\r\ntears; the Duchess sate in silence: when the banquet was over, the\r\nDuchess ordered her carriage, and was with difficulty prevailed upon\r\nto remain at Windsor for the night. The King went so far in May 1837\r\nas to offer the Princess an independent income, and the acceptance of\r\nthis by the Princess caused the Duchess considerable vexation; but the\r\nproject dropped. The King died in the following month, soon after the\r\nPrincess had attained her legal majority; he had always hoped that the\r\nDuchess would not be Regent, and his wish was thus fulfilled.\r\n\r\nIt is no exaggeration to say that the accession of the Princess\r\nVictoria reinstated the English monarchy in the affections of the\r\npeople. George IV. had made the Throne unpopular; William IV. had\r\nrestored its popularity, but not its dignity. Both of these kings were\r\nmen of decided ability, but of unbalanced temperament. In politics\r\nboth kings had followed a somewhat similar course. George IV. had\r\nbegun life as a strong Whig, and had been a close friend of Fox. Later\r\nin life his political position resolved itself into a strong dislike\r\nof Roman Catholic Relief. William IV. had begun his reign favourably\r\ninclined to Parliamentary Reform; but though gratified by the personal\r\npopularity which his attitude brought him in the country, he became\r\nalarmed at the national temper displayed. It illustrates the tension\r\nof the King's mind on the subject that, when he was told that if the\r\nReform Bill did not pass it would bring about a rebellion, he replied\r\nthat if it did bring about a rebellion he did not care: he should\r\ndefend London and raise the Royal Standard at Weedon (where there\r\nwas a military depôt); and that the Duchess of Kent and the Princess\r\nVictoria might come in if they could.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: CHARACTER AND TEMPERAMENT]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: SYMPATHY WITH MIDDLE CLASSES]\r\n\r\nThe reign of William IV. had witnessed the zenith of Whig efficiency.\r\nIt had seen the establishment of Parliamentary and Municipal Reform,\r\nthe Abolition of Slavery, the new Poor Law, and other important\r\nmeasures. But, towards the end of the reign, the Whig party began\r\nsteadily to lose ground, and the Tories to consolidate themselves.\r\nLord Melbourne had succeeded Lord Grey at the head of the Whigs, and\r\nthe difference of administration was becoming every month more and\r\nmore apparent. The King indeed went so far as abruptly to dismiss his\r\nMinisters, but Parliament was too strong for him. Lord Melbourne's\r\nprinciples were fully as liberal as Lord Grey's, but he lacked\r\npractical initiative, with the result that the Whigs gradually\r\nforfeited popular estimation and became discredited. The new reign,\r\nhowever, brought them a decided increase of strength. The Princess had\r\nbeen brought up with strong Whig leanings, and, as is clear from\r\nher letters, with an equally strong mistrust of Tory principles and\r\npoliticians.\r\n\r\nA word may here be given to the Princess's own character and\r\ntemperament. She was high-spirited and wilful, but devotedly\r\naffectionate, and almost typically feminine. She had a strong sense\r\nof duty and dignity, and strong personal prejudices. Confident, in a\r\nsense, as she was, she had the feminine instinct strongly developed of\r\ndependence upon some manly adviser. She was full of high spirits, and\r\nenjoyed excitement and life to the full. She liked the stir of London,\r\nwas fond of dancing, of concerts, plays, and operas, and devoted to\r\nopen-air exercise. Another important trait in her character must be\r\nnoted. She had strong monarchical views and dynastic sympathies,\r\nbut she had no aristocratic preferences; at the same time she had no\r\ndemocratic principles, but believed firmly in the due subordination\r\nof classes. The result of the parliamentary and municipal reforms of\r\nWilliam IV.'s reign had been to give the middle classes a share in\r\nthe government of the country, and it was supremely fortunate that the\r\nQueen, by a providential gift of temperament, thoroughly understood\r\nthe middle-class point of view. The two qualities that are most\r\ncharacteristic of British middle-class life are common sense and\r\nfamily affection; and on these particular virtues the Queen's\r\ncharacter was based; so that by a happy intuition she was able to\r\ninterpret and express the spirit and temper of that class which,\r\nthroughout her reign, was destined to hold the balance of political\r\npower in its hands. Behind lay a deep sense of religion, the religion\r\nwhich centres in the belief in the Fatherhood of God, and is impatient\r\nof dogmatic distinctions and subtleties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nQUEEN VICTORIA'S RELATIONS AND FRIENDS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be held to have been one of the chief blessings of Queen\r\nVictoria's girlhood that she was brought closely under the influence\r\nof an enlightened and large-minded Prince, Leopold, her maternal\r\nuncle, afterwards King of the Belgians. He was born in 1790, being the\r\nyoungest son of Francis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and his youth\r\nwas spent in the Russian military service. He had shown talent and\r\ncourage in the field, and had commanded a battalion at Lützen and\r\nLeipsic. He had married, in 1816, the Princess Charlotte, only child\r\nof George IV. For many years his home was at Claremont, where the\r\nPrincess Charlotte had died; there the Princess Victoria spent many\r\nhappy holidays, and grew to regard her uncle with the most devoted\r\naffection, almost, indeed, in the light of a father. It is said that\r\nPrince Leopold had hoped to be named Regent, if a Regency should be\r\nnecessary.[1] He was offered, and accepted, the throne of Greece in\r\n1830, but shrank from the difficulties of the position, and withdrew\r\nhis acceptance upon the plea that Lord Aberdeen, who was then Foreign\r\nSecretary, was not prepared to make such financial arrangements as he\r\nconsidered satisfactory.[2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: A practical proof of his interest in his niece\r\n    may be found in the fact that for years he contributed\r\n    between three and four thousand a year to the expenses of her\r\n    education, and for necessary holidays by the sea, at a time\r\n    when the Duchess of Kent's Parliamentary Grant was unequal to\r\n    the increasing expenses of her household.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: Greece after having obtained autonomy was in a\r\n    practically bankrupt condition, and the Powers had guaranteed\r\n    the financial credit of the country until it was able to\r\n    develop its own resources.]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe from the correspondence that King Leopold\r\nseems for many years to have continued to regret his decision; it was\r\nnot that he did not devote himself, heart and soul, to the country of\r\nhis adoption, but there seems to have been a romantic element in his\r\ncomposition, which did not find its full satisfaction in presiding\r\nover the destinies of a peaceful commercial nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE KING OF THE BELGIANS]\r\n\r\nIn 1831, when Louis Philippe, under pressure from Lord Palmerston,\r\ndeclined the throne of Belgium for his son the Duc de Nemours, Prince\r\nLeopold received and accepted an offer of the Crown. A Dutch invasion\r\nfollowed, and the new King showed great courage and gallantry in an\r\nengagement near Louvain, in which his army was hopelessly outnumbered.\r\nBut, though a sensitive man, the King's high courage and hopefulness\r\nnever deserted him. He ruled his country with diligence, ability, and\r\nwisdom, and devoted himself to encouraging manufactures and commerce.\r\nThe result of his firm and liberal rule was manifested in 1848, when,\r\non his offering to resign the Crown if it was thought to be for\r\nthe best interests of the country, he was entreated, with universal\r\nacclamation, to retain the sovereignty. Belgium passed through the\r\ntroubled years of revolution in comparative tranquillity. King Leopold\r\nwas a model ruler; his deportment was grave and serious; he was\r\nconspicuous for honesty and integrity; he was laborious and upright,\r\nand at the same time conciliatory and tactful.\r\n\r\nHe kept up a close correspondence with Queen Victoria, and paid her\r\nseveral visits in England, where he was on intimate terms with\r\nmany leading Englishmen. It would be difficult to over-estimate the\r\nimportance of his close relations with the Queen; by example and\r\nprecept he inspired her with a high sense of duty, and from the first\r\ninstilled into her mind the necessity of acquainting herself closely\r\nwith the details of political administration. His wisdom, good sense,\r\nand tenderness, as well as the close tie of blood that existed between\r\nhim and the Queen, placed him in a unique position with regard to her,\r\nand it is plain that he was fully aware of the high responsibility\r\nthus imposed upon him, which he accepted with a noble generosity. It\r\nis true that there were occasions when, as the correspondence reveals,\r\nthe Queen was disposed to think that King Leopold endeavoured to\r\nexercise too minute a control over her in matters of detail, and even\r\nto attempt to modify the foreign policy of England rather for the\r\nbenefit of Belgium than in the best interests of Great Britain; but\r\nthe Queen was equal to these emergencies; she expressed her dissent\r\nfrom the King's suggestions in considerate and affectionate terms,\r\nwith her gratitude for his advice, but made no pretence of following\r\nit.\r\n\r\nFor her aunt, Queen Adelaide, the Princess Victoria had always felt\r\na strong affection; and though it can hardly be said that this gentle\r\nand benevolent lady exercised any great influence over her more\r\nvigorous and impetuous niece, yet the letters will testify to the\r\ncloseness of the tie which united them.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: QUEEN ADELAIDE]\r\n\r\nQueen Adelaide was the eldest child of George, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen;\r\nher mother was a princess of Hohenlohe-Langenburg.\r\n\r\nAt the age of twenty-six she was married to the Duke of Clarence, then\r\nin his fifty-third year, without any preliminary courtship. They\r\nlived for a year in Hanover, and then principally at Bushey Park. Two\r\ndaughters were born to them, the elder of whom lived only a few hours;\r\nthe younger, Princess Elizabeth, died in the first year of her age.\r\nTheir married life was a happy one, in spite of the disparity of\r\nage. Queen Adelaide was a woman of a deeply affectionate disposition,\r\nsensible, sympathetic, and religious. She had a very definite ideal of\r\nthe duties of a wife and a Queen; she made it her pleasure to meet and\r\nanticipate, as far as possible, her husband's wishes; and her husband,\r\nhasty and choleric though he was, repaid her with tender affection. To\r\nsuch an extent did the Queen merge her views in those of her husband,\r\nthat she passed at one time through a period of general unpopularity.\r\nIt was believed that she was adverse to Reform, and used her influence\r\nagainst it. She was mobbed in the streets at the time when the Reform\r\nagitation was at its height; and it is said that when the Melbourne\r\nMinistry of 1834 was dismissed, London was (owing to an unjustifiable\r\ncommunication of Lord Brougham to the _Times_) placarded with posters\r\nbearing the words, \"The Queen has done it all!\"\r\n\r\nIt is a pathetic instance of the irony of fate that Queen Adelaide\r\nshould have thus been supposed to desire to take an active part in\r\npolitics. It is obvious, from her letters, that she had practically\r\nno political views at all, except a gentle distrust of all proposed\r\nchanges, social or political. Her one idea of her position as Queen\r\nwas to agree with any expression of opinion that fell from the King.\r\nShe was fond of music, and took a deep interest in her religious\r\nduties and in all that concerned the welfare of the Protestant\r\ncommunion. But apart from this, her interests were entirely domestic\r\nand personal, and her letters reveal her character in the most\r\namiable light. Her devotion to the King, and the tender and respectful\r\ndiffidence with which she welcomed her niece to the Throne, show a\r\nvery sweet nature.\r\n\r\nThe rest of her life, after King William's death, was passed to a\r\ngreat extent under invalid conditions, though she was only forty-four\r\nat the time of her niece's accession. She travelled a good deal in\r\nsearch of health, and lived a quiet life in England, surrounded by\r\na small but devoted circle of friends and relations. Her personal\r\npopularity with the nation became very great, not only for the simple\r\nkindliness of her life, but for her splendid munificence; it is said\r\nthat her public subscriptions often exceeded £20,000 a year. She died\r\nin December 1849. Queen Victoria was very much attached to her gentle,\r\nsimple-minded, and tender-hearted aunt, and treated her with the\r\nutmost consideration and an almost daughterly affection.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: BARONESS LEHZEN]\r\n\r\nAnother person who had a large share in forming the Queen's character\r\nwas Louise Lehzen, the daughter of a Hanoverian clergyman, who came\r\nto England as governess to Princess Feodore of Leiningen, Queen\r\nVictoria's half-sister, shortly before the Queen's birth. In 1824\r\nshe became governess to the Princess Victoria. In 1827 George IV.\r\nconferred upon her the rank of a Hanoverian Baroness. When the Duchess\r\nof Northumberland, in 1830, was appointed the Princess's official\r\ngoverness, she remained as lady in attendance. The Princess was\r\ndevoted to her, but \"greatly in awe of her.\" She remained at Court\r\nafter the accession till 1842, without holding an official position,\r\nand then returned to Germany, where she died in 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: BARON STOCKMAR]\r\n\r\nBaron Stockmar was another of the interesting personalities who came\r\ninto very close contact with the Queen in her early years. He was\r\nforty-nine at the time of the accession, but he had come to England\r\nmore than twenty years before as private physician to Prince Leopold.\r\nHe endeared himself to the Princess Charlotte, who died holding his\r\nhand. He afterwards became Prince Leopold's private secretary, and\r\ntook a prominent part as the Prince's representative in the successive\r\nnegotiations with regard to his candidature for the thrones of Greece\r\nand Belgium. Upon the accession of Queen Victoria, Stockmar joined\r\nthe Court in a private capacity, and for fifteen months he held an\r\nunofficial position as her chief adviser. There was a general feeling\r\nof dislike in the minds of the English public to the German influences\r\nthat were supposed to be brought to bear on the Queen; and Lord\r\nMelbourne found it necessary to make a public and categorical denial\r\nof the statement that Stockmar was acting as the Queen's private\r\nsecretary. But the statement, if not technically, was virtually\r\ntrue. Stockmar lived at Court, had interviews with the Queen and her\r\nMinisters, and though he industriously endeavoured to efface himself,\r\nyet there is no doubt that he was consulted on most important\r\nquestions. In 1838, he had been entrusted by King Leopold, with the\r\nQueen's knowledge and consent, with a mission of great delicacy: he\r\nwas asked to accompany Prince Albert on a tour in Italy, with the idea\r\nof completing his education, and in order to satisfy himself that\r\nthe Prince would be a worthy Consort for the Queen. This task he\r\ndischarged admirably, and became the most confidential and trusted of\r\nall the Prince's friends. There are many letters of Stockmar's to the\r\nPrince extant, which prove that Stockmar never shrank from speaking\r\nthe plainest truth to the Prince on matters of duty and faults of\r\ntemperament, without any courtier-like attempt to blink criticism\r\nthat might have been unpalatable. The Prince had the generosity and\r\nhumility to value this trait of Stockmar's very highly, to such an\r\nextent that Stockmar's influence possessed if anything too great a\r\npreponderance. Stockmar had jealously nursed two profound political\r\nideals--the unity of Germany under Prussia, and the establishment of\r\nclose relations between Germany and England. He induced Prince Albert,\r\nheavily burdened as he was with work, to devote almost too much time\r\nand thought to the former of these aims. Stockmar was a profound\r\nstudent of social and constitutional questions. He had made a close\r\nstudy of English political institutions; but though he grasped the\r\nconstitutional theory of the English Throne, and saw that the first\r\nnecessity for the Sovereign was to hold a position independent of\r\nparty, he never clearly understood that the Monarch should keep as\r\nfar as possible clear of political details. Stockmar's view of the\r\nposition was that the Sovereign should be practically Premier as well;\r\nand much of the jealousy that was felt, on various occasions, at\r\nthe position which Prince Albert assumed with regard to political\r\nsituations, is referable to Stockmar's influence.\r\n\r\nHe was a very able man, with immense political knowledge, and without\r\npersonal ambition; Lord Palmerston, who was no friend to Stockmar's\r\ntheory of government, admitted that he was the most disinterested man\r\nhe had ever encountered. Stockmar's ambition was to achieve his\r\nown political ideals, and to modify the course of events in what he\r\nconceived to be beneficial directions; he was entirely indifferent\r\nto the trappings of power, and this very disinterestedness made his\r\ninfluence more supreme.\r\n\r\nHe suffered all his life from feeble health and a hypochondriacal\r\ntendency, and was genuinely fond of retirement and quiet life. He\r\ncertainly deserved the devoted confidence reposed in him by Prince\r\nAlbert and the Queen; it may perhaps be questioned whether his own\r\n_doctrinaire_ bias did not make itself too strongly felt, in the\r\nminuteness with which Prince Albert dealt with English politics; but\r\nthe net result of his influence was that the danger, which lies in\r\nwait for strictly constitutional Sovereigns, was averted--the danger,\r\nthat is, of leaving the administration of State affairs in the hands\r\nof specialists, and depriving it of the wise control and independent\r\ncriticism which only the Crown can adequately supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\r\n\r\nTO CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nQueen Victoria, from the very first, took great pleasure in filing\r\nthe correspondence addressed to her. There are many volumes of letters\r\nreceived from her various relations. We have thought it best to give\r\nsome of Queen Adelaide's early letters; they indicate in a remarkable\r\nmanner the growing estrangement between King William IV. and the\r\nDuchess of Kent. In the earlier letters the King enquires very\r\naffectionately after the Duchess, and constant mention is made of\r\npresents sent to her; but the references made to her become less\r\nfrequent and colder, till at last the King contents himself with\r\nsending messages only to the Princess. But the letters of Queen\r\nAdelaide are always written in a strain of touching devotion and\r\naffection, and reveal her as a woman of large heart and great\r\nsimplicity of character.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: KING LEOPOLD]\r\n\r\nBut the most interesting series of letters are the Queen's own\r\ncorrespondence with King Leopold, of which several hundred are\r\npreserved. The letters, too, received by her from the King of the\r\nBelgians are preserved in their entirety.\r\n\r\nThe letters which the Queen wrote to King Leopold are of extraordinary\r\ninterest; she kept up an unbroken correspondence with him, and spoke\r\nfreely of all that was in her mind. Two points are worthy of special\r\nmention: though she was early convinced of the necessity of holding an\r\nindependent constitutional position in politics she mentions the Tory\r\nparty with undisguised mistrust; and further, the name of King William\r\nhardly ever occurs until his last illness.\r\n\r\nKing Leopold's early letters reveal his character in the most amiable\r\nlight. He familiarised the Queen with all the complicated details of\r\nforeign politics; he gave her the most sensible and wise advice; he\r\nwarned and encouraged her; he answered her enquiries with the minutest\r\ncare: and the warm affection to which he gave frequent expression is a\r\nvery sacred and beautiful thing to contemplate.\r\n\r\nWe have selected several of the Princess Victoria's letters to the\r\nKing of the Belgians before her accession, because they throw a\r\nremarkable light upon her temperament. In the first place, they reveal\r\nthe deep affectionateness of her character, and, what is still more\r\nremarkable at her age, her frankness and outspokenness in expressing\r\nher feelings.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, they show with what interest and eagerness the\r\nPrincess was following the course of foreign politics. Her view was\r\nnaturally a personal one, but it may be said that there can have been\r\nvery few, if any, girls in England, of the Princess's age, who were\r\ntaking any interest at all in Continental affairs. It is true that\r\nKing Leopold had early impressed upon the Princess that it was a\r\nduty to become acquainted with the course of current events; but the\r\nletters show that the interest she felt was congenial and innate, and\r\ndid not spring from a sense of duty. The allusions to home politics\r\nare not so frequent, but still show that here also her attention was\r\nalert.\r\n\r\nThirdly, they reveal her abounding vitality, her love of life and\r\namusement, her devotion to music, and the simple unspoilt zest with\r\nwhich she threw herself into all that surrounded her.\r\n\r\nThere is a special interest which attaches to the correspondence\r\nbetween Queen Victoria and King Leopold after the Accession. The\r\nletters reveal, as no other documents could do, the monarchical point\r\nof view. However intimate may be the relations between a Sovereign\r\nand a subject, there is bound to appear a certain discretion, and\r\neven condescension, on the one hand, and on the other a due degree of\r\ndeference. But here we have the remarkable spectacle of two monarchs,\r\nboth of eminent sagacity, and both, so to speak, frankly interested in\r\nthe task of constitutional government, corresponding freely on all the\r\ndifficulties and problems inseparable from their momentous task,\r\nand with an immense sense of their weighty responsibilities. It is\r\nimpossible to exaggerate the deep and abiding interest of such a\r\ncorrespondence; and the seriousness, the devotion, the public spirit\r\nthat are displayed, without affectation or calculated impressiveness,\r\nmake the whole series of letters singularly memorable.\r\n\r\nThe King of the Belgians had married Princess Louise of Orleans,\r\ndaughter of Louis Philippe, in 1832. She was only seven years older\r\nthan the Princess Victoria, who grew to regard her with the tenderest\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nThe letters from Queen Louise are very numerous. A few are in French,\r\nbut they are mostly written in brisk, lively English, not always very\r\ncorrect, either in construction or in spelling. They are full of small\r\nfamily details--the movements of various relations, the improvement in\r\nher brothers' looks, Court festivities, the childish ailments of her\r\nlittle boys, the journeys and expeditions, recollections of Windsor,\r\ntheir visitors, elaborate descriptions of dresses--interesting to\r\nread, but difficult to select from. They are full of heart-felt\r\nexpressions of the sincerest affection for \"your dear Majesty,\" a\r\nquaint phrase that often occurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PRINCE ALBERT]\r\n\r\nAfter their marriage in 1840, Prince Albert naturally became the\r\nQueen's confidential Secretary.\r\n\r\nA close study of the Queen's correspondence reveals the character of\r\nthe Prince in a way which nothing else could effect. Traces of\r\nhis untiring labour, his conscientious vigilance, his singular\r\ndevotedness, appear on every page. There are innumerable memoranda in\r\nhis own hand; the papers are throughout arranged and annotated by him;\r\nnothing seems to have escaped him, nothing to have dismayed him. As\r\nan instance of the minute laboriousness which characterised the Royal\r\nhousehold, it may be mentioned that there are many copies of important\r\nletters, forwarded to the Prince for his perusal, the originals of\r\nwhich had to be returned, written not only by the Prince himself, but\r\nby the Queen under his direction. But besides keeping a vigilant eye\r\nupon politics, the Prince took the lead in all social and educational\r\nmovements of the time, as well as devoting a close and continuous\r\nattention to the affairs of Europe in general, and Germany in\r\nparticular. It is obvious from the papers that the Prince can hardly\r\never have taken a holiday; many hours of every day must have been\r\ndevoted by him to work; yet he was at the same time a tender husband\r\nand father, always ready with advice and sympathy, and devoted to\r\nquiet domestic life.\r\n\r\nAfter the Queen's marriage the correspondence becomes far more\r\nvoluminous. It is difficult to exaggerate the amount of conscientious\r\nlabour bestowed by the Queen and the Prince Consort on all matters\r\nwhich concerned the welfare of the nation. The number of documents\r\nwhich passed through their hands, and which were carefully studied by\r\nthem, was prodigious.\r\n\r\nThe drafts of the Queen's replies to letters are in many cases in the\r\nhandwriting of the Prince Consort, but dated by herself, and often\r\ncontaining interlinear corrections and additions of her own. Whether\r\nthe Queen indicated the lines of the replies, whether she dictated the\r\nsubstance of them, or whether they contain the result of a discussion\r\non the particular matter, cannot be precisely ascertained. But\r\nthey contain so many phrases and turns of expression which are\r\ncharacteristic of her outspoken temperament, that it is clear that\r\nshe not only followed every detail, but that the substance of\r\nthe communication bore in most cases the impress of her mind. A\r\nconsiderable number of the drafts again are in her own hand, with\r\ninterlinear corrections and additions by the Prince; and these so\r\nstrongly resemble in style the drafts in the handwriting of the\r\nPrince, that it is clear that the Queen did not merely accept\r\nsuggestions, but that she had a strong opinion of her own on important\r\nmatters, and that this opinion was duly expressed.\r\n\r\nOne fact must, however, be borne in mind. It happens in many cases\r\nthat a correspondence on some particular point seems to be about to\r\nlead up to a definite conclusion, but that the salient and decisive\r\ndocument is absent. In these cases it is clear that the matter was\r\nsettled at a personal interview; in many cases the Prince prepared\r\na memorandum of an important interview; but there are a considerable\r\nnumber of such correspondences, where no record is preserved of the\r\neventual solution, and this incompleteness is regrettable, but, by the\r\nnature of the case, inevitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LEADING STATESMEN IN 1837]\r\n\r\nThe young Queen, on coming to the Throne, had little technical\r\nknowledge of the details of diplomacy, but she already had a real and\r\nintelligent acquaintance with foreign affairs, though it was rather\r\npersonal than political, and, as we have seen, was more inspired by\r\nher interest in the fortunes and position of her numerous maternal\r\nrelations than by the political views of her paternal relatives. Among\r\nthe English statesmen of the day there were few who were qualified\r\nto help and instruct her. The two men who for over twenty years\r\nalternately guided the foreign policy of the country were Lord\r\nAberdeen and Lord Palmerston. They represented two opposed schools.\r\nLord Aberdeen, a Peelite, was naturally and by tradition inclined to\r\ndesire harmonious relations with all foreign Powers, and to abstain,\r\nas far as was consistent with maintaining British interests, from any\r\nsort of intervention in European affairs; Palmerston was a disciple of\r\nCanning, who had definitely broken with the principles of the Congress\r\nof Vienna, and openly avowed his approval of a policy of intervention,\r\nto any extent short of actual war, in the interests of liberty and\r\ngood government. The only other man who had any title to speak with\r\nauthority on foreign affairs was the Duke of Wellington, who had held\r\nthe seals as Foreign Secretary for a few months in 1834 and 1835. He\r\nhad, however, lost much of the reputation for political sagacity which\r\nhe had held at the time when he was the arbiter of Europe and virtual\r\nruler of France. Moreover, being, as he was, a much occupied man, with\r\nvaried business to transact, and at the mercy of his almost excessive\r\nconscientiousness, he held himself to a considerable extent aloof\r\nfrom current politics, though he never lost his absorbing interest in\r\nContinental affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n1821-1835\r\n\r\n\r\n[The first letter ever received by Queen Victoria appears to be the\r\nfollowing little note, written by the Duchess of Clarence, afterwards\r\nQueen Adelaide, in May 1821, when the Princess entered upon her third\r\nyear. It is pathetic to recollect that the Duchess's surviving child,\r\nPrincess Elizabeth, had died, aged three months, in March of the same\r\nyear.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LITTLE HEART,--I hope you are well and don't forget Aunt\r\nAdelaide, who loves you so fondly.\r\n\r\nLoulou and Wilhelm[1] desire their love to you, and Uncle William\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nGod bless and preserve you is the constant prayer of your most truly\r\naffectionate Aunt,\r\n\r\nADELAIDE.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: Princess Louise and Prince William of\r\n    Saxe-Weimar, children of Duchess Ida of Saxe-Weimar (sister\r\n    of the Duchess of Clarence).

She is at all times ready and disposed to sacrifice her\r\ncomfort and inclinations to see others happy. She values goodness,\r\nmerit, and virtue much more than beauty, riches, and amusements. With\r\nall this she is highly informed and very clever; she speaks and writes\r\nEnglish, German and Italian; she speaks English very well indeed.\r\nIn short, my dear Love, you see that I may well recommend her as an\r\nexample for all young ladies, being Princesses or not.\r\n\r\nNow to her appearance. She is about Feodore's height, her hair\r\nvery fair, light blue eyes, of a very gentle, intelligent and kind\r\nexpression. A Bourbon nose and small mouth. The figure is much like\r\nFeodore's but rather less stout. She rides very well, which she proved\r\nto my great alarm the other day, by keeping her seat though a horse of\r\nmine ran away with her full speed for at least half a mile. What she\r\ndoes particularly well is dancing. Music unfortunately she is not\r\nvery fond of, though she plays on the harp; I believe there is some\r\nidleness in the case. There exists already great confidence and\r\naffection between us; she is desirous of doing everything that can\r\ncontribute to my happiness, and I study whatever can make her happy\r\nand contented.\r\n\r\nYou will see by these descriptions that though my good little wife is\r\nnot the tallest Queen, she is a very great prize which I highly value\r\nand cherish....\r\n\r\nNow it is time I should finish my letter.

I know that you\r\nhave been very studious, but now comes the time when the judgment must\r\nform itself, when the character requires attention; in short when the\r\nyoung tree takes the shape which it retains afterwards through life.\r\n\r\nTo attain this object it is indispensable to give some little time _to\r\nreflection_. The life in a great town is little calculated for such\r\npurposes; however, with some firmness of purpose it can be done.\r\n\r\n_Self-examination_ is the most important part of the business, and\r\na very useful mode of proceeding is, for instance, every evening to\r\nrecapitulate the events of the day, and the motives which made one act\r\noneself, as well as to try to guess what might have been the motives\r\nof others. Amiable dispositions like yours will easily perceive\r\nif your own motives _were good_. Persons in high situations must\r\nparticularly guard themselves against selfishness and vanity. An\r\nindividual in a high and important situation will easily see a great\r\nmany persons eager to please the first, and to flatter and encourage\r\nthe last. Selfishness, however, makes the individual itself miserable,\r\nand is the cause of constant disappointment, besides being the surest\r\nmeans of being disliked by everybody.\r\n\r\nVanity, on the other hand, is generally artfully used by ambitious and\r\ninterested people to make one a tool for purposes of their own, but\r\ntoo often in opposition with one's own happiness and destruction of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nTo learn to know oneself, to judge oneself with truth and\r\nimpartiality, must be the great objects of one's exertion; they are\r\nonly attainable by constant and cool self-examination.\r\n\r\nThe position of what is generally called great people has of late\r\nbecome extremely difficult. They are more attacked and calumniated,\r\nand judged with less indulgence than private individuals. What they\r\nhave lost in this way, they have not by any means regained in any\r\nother. Ever since the revolution of 1790 they are much less secure\r\nthan they used to be, and the transition from sovereign power to\r\n_absolute want_ has been as frequent as sudden.\r\n\r\nIt becomes, therefore, necessary that the character should be so\r\nformed as not to be intoxicated by greatness and success, nor\r\ncast down by misfortune. To be able to do so, one must be able to\r\nappreciate things according to their real value, and particularly\r\navoid giving to trifles an undue importance.\r\n\r\nNothing is so great and clear a proof of unfitness for greater and\r\nnobler actions, than a mind which is seriously occupied with trifles.\r\n\r\nTrifling matters may be objects of amusement and relaxation to a\r\nclever person, but only a weak mind and a mean spirit consider trifles\r\nas important. The good sense must show itself by distinguishing what\r\nis and what is not important.\r\n\r\nMy sermon is now long enough, my dear child. I strongly recommend it,\r\nhowever, to your reflection and consideration.\r\n\r\nMy gift consists in a set of views of the former Kingdom of the\r\nNetherlands, out of which you will be able to discover all those of\r\nthe present Belgium.\r\n\r\nLet me soon hear from you; and may God bless and preserve you. Ever,\r\nmy dear Love, your affectionate Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: VISIT TO HEVER CASTLE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nTUNBRIDGE WELLS, _14th September 1834._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--Allow me to write you a few words, to express\r\nhow thankful I am for the very kind letter you wrote me. It made me,\r\nthough, very sad to think that all our hopes of seeing you, which we\r\ncherished so long, this year, were over. I had so hoped and wished to\r\nhave seen you again, my _beloved_ Uncle, and to have made dearest\r\nAunt Louisa's acquaintance. I am delighted to hear that dear Aunt has\r\nbenefited from the sea air and bathing. We had a very pretty party to\r\nHever Castle yesterday, which perhaps you remember, where Anne Boleyn\r\nused to live, _before she lost her head_. We drove there, and rode\r\nhome. It was a most beautiful day. We have very good accounts from\r\ndear Feodore, who will, by this time, be at Langenburg.\r\n\r\nBelieve me always, my dearest Uncle, your very affectionate and\r\ndutiful Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: HISTORICAL READING]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to the Princess Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _18th October 1834._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST LOVE,--I am happy to learn that Tunbridge Wells has done\r\nyou good. Health is the first and most important gift of Providence;\r\nwithout it we are poor, miserable creatures, though the whole earth\r\nwere our property; therefore I trust that you will take great care of\r\nyour own. I feel convinced that air and exercise are most useful for\r\nyou. In your leisure moments I hope that you study a little; history\r\nis what I think the most important study for you. It will be difficult\r\nfor you to learn human-kind's ways and manners otherwise than from\r\nthat important source of knowledge. Your position will more or less\r\nrender practical knowledge extremely difficult for you, till you get\r\nold, and still if you do not prepare yourself for your position, you\r\nmay become the victim of wicked and designing people, particularly at\r\na period when party spirit runs so high. Our times resemble most those\r\nof the Protestant reformation; then people were moved by religious\r\nopinions, as they now undoubtedly are by political passions.\r\nUnfortunately history is rarely written by those who really were\r\nthe chief movers of events, nor free from a party colouring; this\r\nis particularly the case in the works about English history. In that\r\nrespect France is much richer, because there we have authenticated\r\nmemoirs of some of the most important men, and of others who really\r\nsaw what passed and wrote it down at the time. Political feelings,\r\nbesides, rarely created _permanent_ parties like those in England,\r\nwith the exception, perhaps, of the great distinctions of Catholics\r\nand Protestants. What I most should recommend is the period before the\r\naccession of Henry IV. of France to the throne, then the events after\r\nhis death till the end of the minority of Louis XIV.; after that\r\nperiod, though interesting, matters have a character which is more\r\npersonal, and therefore less applicable to the present times. Still\r\neven that period may be studied with some profit to get knowledge of\r\nmankind. _Intrigues_ and _favouritism_ were the chief features of that\r\nperiod, and Madame de Maintenon's immense influence was very nearly\r\nthe cause of the destruction of France. What I very particularly\r\nrecommend to you is to study in the Memoirs of the great and good\r\nSully[12] the last years of the reign of Henry IV. of France, and the\r\nevents which followed his assassination. If you have not got the work,\r\nI will forward it to you from hence, or give you the edition which I\r\nmust have at Claremont.\r\n\r\nAs my paper draws to a close, I shall finish also by giving you my\r\nbest blessings, and remain ever, my dearest Love, your faithfully\r\nattached Friend and Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 12: Maximilien, Duc de Sully, was Henry's Minister\r\n    of Finance. A curious feature of the Memoirs is the fact that\r\n    they are written in the second person: the historian recounts\r\n    the hero's adventures to him.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE PRINCESS'S READING]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nTUNBRIDGE WELLS, _22nd October 1834._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--You cannot conceive how happy you have made me, by\r\nyour very kind letter, which, instead of tiring, delights me beyond\r\neverything. I must likewise say how very grateful I feel for the kind\r\nand excellent advice you gave me in it.\r\n\r\nFor the autographs I beg to return my best thanks. They are\r\nmost valuable and interesting, and will be great additions to my\r\ncollections. As I have not got Sully's Memoirs, I shall be delighted\r\nif you will be so good as to give them to me. Reading history is one\r\nof my greatest delights, and perhaps, dear Uncle, you might like to\r\nknow which books in that line I am now reading. In my lessons with the\r\nDean of Chester,[13] I am reading Russell's _Modern Europe_,[14] which\r\nis very interesting, and Clarendon's _History of the Rebellion_. It\r\nis drily written, but is full of instruction. I like reading different\r\nauthors, of different opinions, by which means I learn not to lean on\r\none particular side. Besides my lessons, I read Jones'[15] account\r\nof the wars in Spain, Portugal and the South of France, from the year\r\n1808 till 1814. It is well done, I think, and amuses me very much. In\r\nFrench, I am now in _La Rivalité de la France et de l'Espagne_, par\r\nGaillard,[16] which is very interesting. I have also begun Rollin.[17]\r\nI am very fond of making tables of the Kings and Queens, as I go on,\r\nand I have lately finished one of the English Sovereigns and their\r\nconsorts, as, of course, the history of my own country is one of\r\nmy first duties. I should be fearful of tiring you with so long an\r\naccount of myself, were I not sure you take so great an interest in my\r\nwelfare.\r\n\r\nPray give my most affectionate love to _dearest_ Aunt Louisa, and\r\nplease say to the Queen of the French and the two Princesses how\r\ngrateful I am for their kind remembrance of me.\r\n\r\nBelieve me always, my dearest Uncle, your very affectionate, very\r\ndutiful, and most attached Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 13: The Rev.

You will not, I hope, think me very\r\ntroublesome if I venture to ask for two more autographs which I should\r\nvery particularly like to have; they are Mme. de Sévigné's[19] and\r\nRacine's; as I am reading the letters of the former, and the tragedies\r\nof the latter, I should prize them highly.

I am perhaps rather strangely situated for a\r\npreaching--somewhat in the style of those old camp preachers who held\r\nforth to many thousand people on some heath in Scotland. I am also\r\non an immense heath, surrounded by 16,000 men, mostly young and\r\ngay, cooking, singing, working, and not very like the stern old\r\nCovenanters; however, I shall try. First of all, let me congratulate\r\nyou that it passed happily and well off. Secondly, let me entreat you\r\nto look with a serious and reflective mind on the day which is past.\r\nMany are the religions, many the shades of those religions, but it\r\nmust be confessed the principles of the Christian religion are the\r\nmost perfect and the most beautiful that can be imagined.... There is\r\none virtue which is particularly Christian; this is the knowledge of\r\nour own heart in _real humility_. _Hypocrisy_ is a besetting sin of\r\nall times, but _particularly of the present_, and many are the wolves\r\nin sheep's clothes. I am sorry to say, with all my affection for old\r\nEngland, the very _state of its Society and politics_ renders many in\r\nthat country _essentially humbugs and deceivers_; the _appearance_ of\r\nthe thing is generally _more_ considered than the _reality_; provided\r\nmatters go off well, and opinion may be gained, the _real good is\r\nmatter of the most perfect indifference_. Defend yourself, my dear\r\nlove, against this system; let your dear character always be true\r\nand loyal; this does not _exclude prudence_--worldly concerns are\r\nnow unfortunately so organised that you _must be cautious_ or you may\r\ninjure yourself and others--but it does not prevent the being sterling\r\nand true. Nothing in persons gives greater reliance, greater weight,\r\nthan when they are known to be _true_. From your earliest childhood\r\nI was anxious to see in you this important virtue _saved_ and\r\n_developed_, and Lehzen will still be able to recollect that. If it is\r\nGod's pleasure that you should once[21] fill the arduous situation to\r\nwhich you seem destined, you will find the importance of what I now\r\nsay to you. And when others may tremble to have at last their real\r\ncharacter found out, and to meet all the contempt which they may\r\ndeserve, your mind and heart will be still and happy, because it will\r\nknow that it acts honestly, that truth and goodness are the motives of\r\nits actions. I press you now against my heart; may God bless you as\r\nI wish and hope it, and may you always feel some affection for your\r\nsincerely devoted camp preacher and Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 20: The Princess was confirmed at the Chapel Royal,\r\n    on 30th July 1835.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 21: King Leopold not infrequently uses \"once\" like\r\n    the Latin _olim_, as referring to any indefinite date in the\r\n    future as well as in the past. \"Some day\" is what is intended\r\n    here.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\r\n\r\nTO CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE year 1836 was not an eventful one at home; the Whig Ministry were\r\ntoo weak to carry measures of first-rate importance, and could hardly\r\nhave maintained themselves in power against the formidable opposition\r\nof Sir Robert Peel without the support of O'Connell. Parliament was\r\nchiefly occupied by the consideration of the Secret Societies in\r\nIreland, Tithes, Municipal Corporations, and such matters; the\r\nMarriage Act, and the Act for the Registration of Births have probably\r\nbeen the most important measures of the year to the country. Troubles\r\nwhich were destined to become more acute arose in Lower Canada and\r\nJamaica, both taking the form of disputes between the executive and\r\nthe legislature.\r\n\r\nOn the continent of Europe, affairs were more disturbing. Several\r\nattempts were made on the life of the King of the French, while an\r\nabortive insurrection with a view of establishing a military empire\r\nwas made by Louis Bonaparte at Strasburg. The Prince was allowed to\r\nleave the country and go to the United States, but his accomplices\r\nwere detained for trial. In Algiers the French Government determined\r\nto prosecute operations against the Arab Chief Abd-el-Kader, and they\r\nsent an expedition to Constantin.\r\n\r\nHolland and Belgium were occupied with a dispute about their boundary\r\nline, the cession to Belgium of Luxemburg being the chief point\r\nof difference. The difficulties that arose in passing an important\r\nMunicipal Act for Belgium caused King Leopold temporarily to regret he\r\nhad not accepted the throne of Greece.\r\n\r\nPortugal was still convulsed by revolutionary agitation. Dom Pedro,\r\nthe eldest son of King John VI., had been proclaimed Emperor of Brazil\r\nin his father's lifetime, and had abdicated the throne of Portugal in\r\nfavour of his daughter Donna Maria, a child seven years old, while Dom\r\nMiguel, his younger brother, who had acted in opposition to his father\r\nin Portugal, claimed the throne for himself. Dom Pedro had agreed that\r\nhis daughter should marry Miguel, who was in 1827 appointed Regent.\r\nMiguel, had he acted wisely, might have maintained himself on\r\nthe throne, but Dom Pedro, who had been expelled from Brazil by a\r\nrevolution, took active steps to recover the Portuguese throne for\r\nhis daughter, and equipped an expedition for that end with English and\r\nFrench volunteers. In this way, Donna Maria, who had spent part of her\r\nexile in England, and formed a friendship with the Princess Victoria,\r\nwas through British instrumentality placed on her throne, but still\r\ncould only maintain herself with difficulty against Miguel. She was a\r\nfew weeks older than the Princess Victoria, and had recently lost her\r\nfirst husband, the Duc de Leuchtenberg. She was married by proxy on\r\nthe 1st of January 1836, and in person on the 9th of April, to Prince\r\nFerdinand of Saxe-Coburg.\r\n\r\nThere was also a disputed succession in Spain, where by the ancient\r\nlaw women might succeed to the throne. Ferdinand VII., who had revoked\r\nthe Pragmatic Sanction of 1711 and restored the former system, died in\r\n1833, leaving no son. His elder daughter Isabella, then three years\r\nof age, was proclaimed Queen (her mother Christina being appointed\r\nRegent), and Isabella's claims were recognised by England and France.\r\nThe late King's brother, Don Carlos, taking his stand upon the Salic\r\nLaw as established by the Pragmatic Sanction, raised the standard of\r\nrevolt and allied himself with Dom Miguel, the young Queens Maria\r\nand Isabella mutually recognising each other, and being supported by\r\nFrance and England against the \"Holy Alliance\" of Austria, Russia, and\r\nPrussia. A seven years' civil war resulted, which did not end\r\ntill, from sheer exhaustion, the Carlists had to cease fighting the\r\nChristinos, as the loyal party was called. The English Government in\r\nthe previous year had sanctioned the enlistment of 10,000 men; who,\r\ncommanded by Colonel (afterwards Sir de Lacy) Evans, landed at San\r\nSebastian in August to assist the Christinos. A British auxiliary\r\ncontingent was already with the Spanish army, while a naval squadron\r\nunder Lord John Hay was active on the coast. Mendizabal was Prime\r\nMinister at the beginning of the year 1836, and was succeeded in May\r\nby Isturitz. Riots took place at Madrid, and Isturitz fled to France;\r\nCalatrava succeeding him, assisted by Mendizabal. The Christino cause\r\ndid not much advance during the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n1836\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to the Princess Victoria._\r\n\r\n_4th March 1836._\r\n\r\nMY DEARLY BELOVED CHILD,--You wrote me again a long, _dear_, _good_\r\nletter, like all those which I received from your kind hands.

They will set off on the 7th, arrive at Paris\r\non the 8th, and leave it again on the 12th.... Fernando[1] has still a\r\nvery bad cold; change of air is likely to cure that. The stay here has\r\ndone Fernando a great deal of good, and it cannot be denied that he is\r\nquite another person.

As concerning the \"fatigues\" we are said to\r\nhave undergone, they were none to me, and made me very happy; I only\r\nwish they could have lasted longer, for all, all is over now, and our\r\n_beloved_ Ferdinand[2] himself leaves our shores this _very_ morning.\r\nWe accompanied them all on Sunday, where we took a final leave of our\r\ndear Ferdinand, and I cannot tell you how sorry I was, and am, to see\r\nhim go, for I love him dearly. He is so truly excellent, kind,\r\nand good, and endears himself so much by his simplicity and\r\ngood-heartedness! I may venture to say, that no one has his prosperity\r\nand happiness more at heart than I have. I am extremely sanguine about\r\nhis success. He goes there full of courage, spirits, and goodwill,\r\nand being naturally clever and observant, I doubt not that with good\r\ncounsel, and prudence, he will do very well. _Your_ kind advice will\r\nbe of the greatest and most important use to him, the more so as he is\r\nso exceedingly fond of you.... Ferdinand leaves behind him here a most\r\nfavourable impression on all parties, for _I_ have even _heard_ from\r\nsome great Tories themselves that there was a great feeling _for_ him\r\nin this country.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: See _ante_, p. 45.

You will like our two Coburg cousins also, I think; they are more\r\nmanly than I think the two others are, after the description. I am\r\nvery fond of them both. Ernest is my favourite, although Albert\r\nis much handsomer, and cleverer too, but Ernest is so honest and\r\ngood-natured. I shall be very curious to hear your opinion upon\r\nthem....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nKENSINGTON PALACE, _26th April 1836._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST, BEST UNCLE,-- ... You will, I am sure, have been delighted\r\nwith M. de Neumann's[3] account of the complete success of our dear\r\nFerdinand. All has gone off better than even our most sanguine hopes\r\ncould have desired. He is much pleased with the good Queen, and she is\r\ndelighted with him, and M. de Neumann says that they are already quite\r\nhappy together. This is really a great blessing, but I fear that all\r\nthe _exterior_ affairs are not in quite _so_ good a state. I hope,\r\nhowever, that the good people will not make any more difficulties\r\nabout Fernando's being Commander-in-Chief, as I hear from all accounts\r\nit is necessary he should be so....\r\n\r\nUncle Ernest and my cousins will probably come here in the beginning\r\nof next month, I hear, and will visit you on their return.\r\n\r\nYou ask me about Sully's Memoirs, and if I have finished them. I have\r\nnot finished them, but am reading them with great interest, and find\r\nthere is a great deal in them which applies to the present times, and\r\na great deal of good advice and reasoning in them. As you say, very\r\ntruly, it is extremely necessary for me to follow the \"events of the\r\nday,\" and to do so impartially. I am always both grateful and happy\r\nwhen you give me any advice, and hope you will continue to do so as\r\nlong as I live.\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear you approve my singing, and I cannot tell you how\r\ndelightful it would be for me, if you could join with us. _À propos_,\r\ndear Uncle, you did not answer what I said to you in a former letter\r\nabout your visiting us again. You know, dear Uncle, that this is a\r\nsubject upon which I am very _earnest_ and _very_ eager, and as the\r\nsummer approaches I grow more and more anxious about it. You know,\r\nalso, that _pleasure_ does more good than a hundred walks and rides.\r\n\r\nBelieve me always, my dearest Uncle, your truly devoted and attached\r\nNiece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: Baron Neumann, who acted as Minister\r\n    Plenipotentiary during the absences of Prince Esterhazy,\r\n    succeeded him as Austrian Minister in 1842.

The relations of the Queen and the King, therefore, to\r\nthe God-knows-what degree, are to come in shoals and rule the land,\r\nwhen _your relations_ are to be _forbidden_ the country, and that\r\nwhen, as you know, the whole of your relations have ever been very\r\ndutiful and kind to the King. Really and truly I never heard or saw\r\nanything like it, and I hope it will a _little rouse your spirit_;\r\nnow that slavery is even abolished in the British Colonies, I do not\r\ncomprehend _why your lot alone should be to be kept, a white little\r\nslavey in England_, for the pleasure of the Court, who never bought\r\nyou, as I am not aware of their having gone to any expense on that\r\nhead, or the King's even having _spent a sixpence for your existence_.\r\nI expect that my visits in England will also be prohibited by an Order\r\nin Council. Oh consistency and political or _other honesty_, where\r\nmust one look for you!\r\n\r\nI have not the least doubt that the King, in his passion for the\r\nOranges, will be _excessively rude to your relations_; this, however,\r\nwill not signify much; they are _your guests_ and not _his_, and will\r\ntherefore _not_ mind it....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: King Leopold had for some time cherished a hope\r\n    of uniting the Princess Victoria in marriage with her cousin,\r\n    Prince Albert of Coburg.

King\r\n    William naturally opposed a scheme which he knew met with\r\n    the approval of his sister-in-law. He accordingly invited\r\n    the Prince of Orange and his two sons at the same time, and\r\n    favoured the candidature of the younger son, Prince Alexander.\r\n    The King (it is believed) went so far as to say that no\r\n    other marriage should ever take place, and that the Duke of\r\n    Saxe-Coburg and his son should never put foot in the country;\r\n    they should not be allowed to land, and must go back whence\r\n    they came.\r\n\r\n    The Prince of Orange had himself been a candidate for the hand\r\n    of Princess Charlotte, and had no reason to be friendly to\r\n    King Leopold, of whom it is recorded that he said, \"Voilà un\r\n    homme qui a pris ma femme et mon royaume.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: ARRIVAL OF PRINCE ALBERT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\n_23rd May 1836._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,-- ... Uncle Ernest and my cousins arrived here on\r\nWednesday, _sains et saufs_. Uncle is looking remarkably well, and my\r\ncousins are most delightful young people. I will give you no detailed\r\ndescription of them, as you will so soon see them yourself. But I\r\nmust say, that they are both very amiable, very kind and good, and\r\nextremely merry, just as young people should be; with all that,\r\nthey are extremely sensible, and very fond of occupation. Albert is\r\nextremely handsome, which Ernest certainly is not, but he has a most\r\ngood-natured, honest, and intelligent countenance. We took them to the\r\nOpera on Friday, to see the _Puritani_, and as they are excessively\r\nfond of music, like me, they were in perfect ecstasies, having never\r\nheard any of the singers before....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PRINCE ALBERT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\n_7th June 1836._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--These few lines will be given to you by my dear\r\nUncle Ernest when he sees you.\r\n\r\nI must thank you, my beloved Uncle, for the prospect of _great_\r\nhappiness you have contributed to give me, in the person of dear\r\nAlbert.

They do your spirit of invention honour, and it is\r\na very good plan to draw subjects from books or plays which interest\r\nyou. You will feel the loss of a pleasant society in the old Palace,\r\nthe more so as your relations are good unsophisticated people, a thing\r\nwhich one does not so often meet with. I suppose that part of your\r\nLondon amusements will soon be over. You were going to Windsor,\r\nwhich you will probably have left by this time. I hope you were very\r\nprudent; I cannot disguise from you, that though the inhabitants are\r\ngood-natured people, still that I think you want all your natural\r\ncaution with them. Never permit yourself to be induced to tell them\r\nany opinion or sentiment of yours which is _beyond the sphere of\r\ncommon conversation_ and its ordinary topics. Bad use would be made\r\nof it against yourself, and you cannot in that subject be too much\r\nguarded. I know well the people we have to deal with.

You know that in England\r\nthe Sovereign is the head of the Church, and that the Church looks\r\nupon the Protestant religion as it is established as the _State_\r\nReligion. In times like the present, when the Crown is already a good\r\ndeal weakened, I believe that it is of importance to maintain as much\r\nas possible this state of affairs, and I believe that you will do\r\nwell, whenever an occasion offers itself to do so without affectation,\r\nto express your sincere interest for the Church, and that you\r\ncomprehend its position and count upon its good-will. The poor Church\r\nwill be a good deal persecuted, I have no doubt, but it would be\r\ndesirable that the men belonging to it should be united, _sensible_,\r\nand moderate....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nRAMSGATE, _14th November 1836._\r\n\r\n...

I like Mrs. Hutchinson's Life of her\r\nhusband[13] only _comme cela_; she is so dreadfully violent. She and\r\nClarendon are so totally opposite, that it is quite absurd, and I only\r\nbelieve the _juste milieu_....\r\n\r\nYour speech interested me very much; it is very fine indeed; you wrote\r\nit yourself, did you not?\r\n\r\nBelgium is indeed the happiest country in the world, and it is _all,\r\nall_ owing to your _great care_ and _kindness_. \"Nous étions des\r\nenfans perdus,\" General Goblet[14] said to me at Claremont, \"quand le\r\nRoi est venu nous sauver.\" And so it is....\r\n\r\nPray, dear Uncle, say everything most kind from me to Ernest and\r\nAlbert, and believe me, always, your affectionate Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA.\r\n\r\nPray, dear Uncle, is the report of the King of Naples' marriage to the\r\nArchduchess Theresa true?

Poor Charles X. is dead, it is said of the cholera. I regret\r\nhim; few people were ever kinder to me than the good old man. He was\r\nblinded by certain absolute ideas, but a good man, and deserving to\r\nbe loved. History will state that Louis XVIII. was a most liberal\r\nmonarch, reigning with great mildness and justice to his end, but that\r\nhis brother, from his despotic and harsh disposition, upset all\r\nthe other had done, and lost the throne. Louis XVIII. was a clever,\r\nhard-hearted man, shackled by no principle, very proud and false.\r\nCharles X. an honest man, a kind friend, an honourable master, sincere\r\nin his opinions, and inclined to do everything that is right. That\r\nteaches us what we ought to believe in history as it is compiled\r\naccording to ostensible events and results known to the generality of\r\npeople. Memoirs are much more instructive, if written honestly and not\r\npurposely fabricated, as it happens too often nowadays, particularly\r\nat Paris.... I shall not fail to read the books you so kindly\r\nrecommend. I join you a small copy of our very liberal Constitution,\r\nhitherto conscientiously executed--no easy matter. You may communicate\r\nit to your Mother; it is the best answer to an infamous Radical or\r\nTory-Radical paper, the _Constitutional_, which seems determined to\r\nrun down the Coburg family. I don't understand the meaning of it;\r\nthe only happiness poor Charlotte knew was during her short wedded\r\nexistence, and there was but one voice on that subject, that we\r\noffered a bright prospect to the nation. Since that period I have\r\n(though been abused, and vilified merely for drawing an income which\r\nwas the consequence of a Treaty ratified by both Houses of Parliament,\r\nand that without one dissenting voice, a thing not very likely to\r\nhappen again) done everything to see England prosperous and powerful.\r\nI have spared her, in 1831, much trouble and expense, as _without\r\nmy coming here very serious complications, war and all the expensive\r\noperations connected with it_, must have taken place. I give the whole\r\nof my income, without the reservation of a farthing, to the country; I\r\npreserve unity on the Continent, have frequently prevented mischief at\r\nParis, and to thank me for all that, I get the most scurrilous abuse,\r\nin which the good people from _constant practice so much excel_....\r\nThe conclusion of all this--and that by people whose very existence\r\nin political life may be but of a few years' standing--is scurrilous\r\nabuse of the Coburg family. I should like to know what harm the Coburg\r\nfamily has done to England? But enough of this. Your principle is very\r\ngood; one must not mind what newspapers say. Their power is a fiction\r\nof the worst description, and their efforts marked by the worst faith\r\nand the greatest untruths. If all the Editors of the papers in the\r\ncountries where the liberty of the press exists were to be assembled,\r\nwe should have a _crew_ to which you would _not_ confide a dog that\r\nyou would value, still less your honour and reputation....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: REVOLUTION AT LISBON]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE PRINCESS'S NAME]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\n_21st November 1836._\r\n\r\nMY MOST DEARLY BELOVED UNCLE,--You cannot imagine how happy you have\r\nmade me by your very dear, kind, long, and interesting letter of the\r\n18th, which I received yesterday morning, and for which I beg you\r\nto accept my _very warmest_ and best thanks. You know, I think, my\r\ndearest Uncle, that _no_ creature on earth _loves_ you _more_ dearly,\r\nor has a higher sense of admiration for you, than I have. Independent\r\nof all that you have done--which I never, never can be grateful enough\r\nfor--my love for you exceeds all that words can express; it is innate\r\nin me, for from my earliest years the name of _Uncle_ was the dearest\r\nI knew, the word _Uncle_, _alone_, meant no other but you!\r\n\r\nYour letter is so interesting and instructive that I could read it\r\nover and over again. I hope, dear Uncle, you will in process of time\r\ngive me the _aperçu_ you mention, which would be so very interesting\r\nfor me.\r\n\r\nI cannot tell you how distressed I was by the late unfortunate\r\n_contre-révolution manquée_ at Lisbon,[15] and how sorry I was to see\r\nby the letter you wrote me, that you were still unaware of it on the\r\n18th. Mamma received a letter from Lord Palmerston yesterday morning,\r\nwhich she has sent you, and which is consolatory, I think. He speaks\r\nin the highest terms of our beloved Ferdinand, which proves that he\r\nbecomes daily more and more worthy of his arduous situation, and says\r\nthat the Queen's situation \"is better than it was,\" less bad than it\r\nmight have been \"after such an affair,\" and not so good as it would\r\nhave been had poor Donna Maria waited patiently till all was ripe for\r\naction. Dietz[16] wrote Mamma a most desponding letter, so much so,\r\nthat had we not got Lord Palmerston's letter we must have thought\r\nall, all was over.[17] I hope, dear Uncle, you will tell _me_ _your_\r\nfeeling about the whole, which will only satisfy me; no one else\r\ncould, for I take an interest in Ferdinand's welfare as though he were\r\nmy brother.\r\n\r\nAllow me, dearest Uncle, to say a few words respecting my _name_, to\r\nwhich you allude. You are aware, I believe, that about a year after\r\nthe accession of the _present_ King there was a desire to change my\r\nfavourite and dear name _Victoria_ to that of _Charlotte_, also _most\r\ndear_, to which the King willingly consented. On its being told me, I\r\nsaid nothing, though I felt grieved beyond measure at the thought of\r\nany change. Not long after this, Lord Grey, and also the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, acquainted Mamma that the country, having been accustomed\r\nto hear me called Victoria, had become used to it, _enfin_, _liked\r\nit_, and therefore, to my great delight, the idea of a change was\r\ngiven up.[18]\r\n\r\nI was sure the death of old Charles X. would strike you....\r\n\r\nI thank you much for the _Constitution de la Belgique_. Those attacks\r\non you are infamous, but must not be minded; they are the language\r\nof a _few jealous_, _envious_ people. _En revanche_, I enclose a\r\nparagraph from a speech of O'Connell's[19] I think worth your reading.\r\n\r\nPray, dearest Uncle, say everything most kind to my beloved and\r\ndearest Aunt, and thank her in my name for her kind letter, which I\r\nshall answer on Friday. I am happy she and the dear little man are\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, always, your most devoted and affectionately attached\r\nNiece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 15: Prince Ferdinand was appointed\r\n    Commander-in-Chief of the Portuguese army on the advice of\r\n    the Duc de Terceira, then Prime Minister.

Later in the year the Queen, assisted by Palmella,\r\n    Terceira, and Saldanha, made a counter-move, believing that\r\n    the people of Lisbon would support her, and proposed to\r\n    dismiss her Ministers; she had, however, been misled as to the\r\n    popular aid forthcoming, and had to give up the struggle, Sá\r\n    da Bandeira becoming Prime Minister.

I have begun since a few days Lord Clive's\r\nLife, by Sir John Malcolm,[20] which is very interesting, as it gives\r\nmuch insight into the affairs of India, over parts of which, I fear,\r\nit would be well to throw a _veil_.

The Conservative opposition to the Melbourne\r\nMinistry was strengthened before the meeting of Parliament by a great\r\nspeech by Sir Robert Peel at Glasgow, and Lord Brougham later on\r\nemerged from his retirement to become the able and venomous critic of\r\nhis former friends. The Government failed to carry important measures\r\non Church Rates and Irish Municipal Corporations, while the Radical\r\ngroup pressed persistently their favourite motions in support of\r\nthe Ballot, and against the Property qualification of members,\r\nPrimogeniture, the Septennial Act, the Bishops' seats and Proxy Voting\r\nin the House of Lords. The Ministry was saved from shipwreck by the\r\ndemise of the Crown and by the accession of the Princess Victoria,\r\nwho, on attaining her legal majority a month earlier, had received\r\nmarked signs of enthusiastic popular favour.\r\n\r\nThe General Election in the Autumn did not materially affect the\r\nposition of parties, the Radicals losing and O'Connell gaining\r\nseats; but the prestige of Lord Melbourne was increased by the unique\r\nposition he now held in reference to the Sovereign. Parliament was\r\nopened in person by the Queen on 20th November, and the Civil List\r\ndealt with, the amount allocated being £385,000 as against £510,000 in\r\nthe late reign (of which £75,000, formerly paid in pensions, was now\r\nstruck off, and other arrangements made).\r\n\r\nFor some time past the state of Canada had caused grave anxiety. By\r\nan Act of 1791, it had been divided into Upper and Lower Canada, each\r\nwith a Governor, Council, and House of Representatives, Lower Canada\r\nbeing in the main French, while Upper Canada was occupied by British\r\nsettlers. Friction first arose in the former, between the nominee\r\nCouncil and the popular Assembly, the Assembly declining to pay the\r\nsalaries of officials whom they had censured, but whom the Executive\r\nhad retained in their posts. Mr Papineau, who had been Speaker of\r\nthe Assembly, was leader in the popular movement. Lord Gosford, the\r\nGovernor of Lower Canada, dismissed some Militia officers who had\r\ntaken part in political demonstrations, and warrants were issued for\r\nthe apprehension of certain members of the Assembly, on the charge\r\nof high treason: within a short time the discontented party broke out\r\ninto rebellion. The course which events would take in Upper Canada\r\nwas for a time doubtful. Sir Francis Head, the Governor, placed his\r\nregular troops at the service of Lord Gosford, preferring to rely on\r\nthe militia. This unusual action was successful, but was not approved\r\nby the Colonial Office. The state of affairs became very alarming at\r\nthe close of the year, when it was announced in Parliament that Lord\r\nGosford had resigned and that Sir John Colborne (afterwards Lord\r\nSeaton) had been appointed to succeed him.\r\n\r\nIn France the confederates of Louis Napoleon in the Strasburg outbreak\r\nwere tried and acquitted; a treaty was concluded at Tafna with\r\nAbd-el-Kader, but negotiations for a similar agreement with Achmet Bey\r\nwere less successful, and operations were continued against Constantin\r\nwith successful results, the town being carried by an assault on 13th\r\nOctober, with some loss of officers and men on the French side.\r\n\r\nAffairs continued unsettled in the Peninsula. In Spain General Evans\r\nwas defeated near San Sebastian, but afterwards, in conjunction with\r\nLord John Hay, captured Irun, the frontier town. Don Carlos\r\nmeanwhile marched on Madrid, but was encountered by Espartero,\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Christinos, who was Prime Minister for a\r\nbrief period during the year. The British legion was dissolved, and\r\nEvans returned to England.\r\n\r\nIn Portugal the English were becoming unpopular for their supposed\r\nintervention: Ferdinand, the Queen's consort, who was naturally\r\nbelieved to be in harmony with the British Cabinet, acted tactlessly\r\nin accepting the Commandership-in-Chief, and internal hostilities\r\ncontinued throughout the year.\r\n\r\nIn Hanover a reactionary step was taken by King Ernest, who had\r\nsucceeded his brother, William IV. of England, on the throne of\r\nHanover; by letters patent he abrogated the Constitution of 1833, an\r\naction which, imperfect and open to criticism though the Constitution\r\nwas, naturally aroused anxiety among the supporters of representative\r\ninstitutions throughout Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n1837\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\n_16th January 1837._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,-- ... We saw Van de Weyer[1] on Tuesday, and his\r\nconversation was most interesting. He praises our dear Ferdinand\r\nmost exceedingly, but as for the poor Queen, what he told us does not\r\nredound much to her credit; one good quality, however, she has, which\r\nis her excessive fondness for and real _obedience_ to Ferdinand. She\r\nis unfortunately surrounded by a _camarilla_[2] who poison her ears,\r\nand fetter all her actions; poor soul! she is _much_ to be pitied.\r\nAbout Lavradio[3] you will also have, I fear, heard but too much.\r\nHonesty and single-heartedness seems to have left Portugal. Van de\r\nWeyer is so clear in all that he says, so sensible, so quiet, so\r\nclever, and, last but not least, so agreeable; I hope we shall soon\r\nsee him again. You see, dear Uncle, how much interest I take in\r\nPortugal; but I must say that I think every one who knows dear\r\nFerdinand, and particularly who loves him as I do, must feel a very\r\ndeep interest as to the fate of the unhappy country in which he is\r\ndestined to play so prominent and difficult a part.\r\n\r\nI have been reading to-day a very clever speech of Sir Robert Peel's\r\n(not a political one) to the University at Glasgow, on the occasion of\r\nhis being elected Lord Rector of that college. There is another speech\r\nof his at the dinner at Glasgow which _is political_, but which I have\r\nnot yet read....[4]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: Sylvain Van de Weyer (b. 1802) was, in 1830,\r\n    Belgian Plenipotentiary at the Conference of London. He\r\n    returned to his own country and became Foreign Minister.\r\n    His exertions contributed greatly to render successful the\r\n    candidature of Prince Leopold for the throne of Belgium. The\r\n    King appointed him Belgian Minister in London, to which post\r\n    he returned in 1851, and held it till 1867. He was treated by\r\n    the Queen until his death in 1874 as a very intimate friend\r\n    and adviser.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: _I.e._ a clique.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: The Portuguese Statesman who had gone to Gotha\r\n    to arrange the Queen's marriage, and was destined to act in a\r\n    similar manner for her son in 1857.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: Sir R.

At a civic banquet given in Sir R. Peel's honour, he\r\n    expounded the principles of Conservative Reform.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: SPAIN AND PORTUGAL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\n_23rd January 1837._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,-- ... The affairs of the Peninsula are indeed very\r\ndistressing,[5] and what you tell me in your letter of the 20th, as\r\nalso in the former one, is highly interesting and, alas! but too true.\r\nI trust, not withstanding what you say, I may yet live to see Spain\r\nand Portugal settled. But I greatly fear that the time is far distant.\r\n\r\nDo you know Mendizabal?[6] I saw him at our house in 1835. Alava[7]\r\npresented him to us; he is a tall, dark, fine, and clever-looking man.\r\nI remember his being so much struck with my likeness to Donna Maria,\r\nwhich I was not aware was the case. Pray, dear Uncle, may I ask you a\r\nsilly question?--is not the Queen of Spain[8] rather clever? You know\r\nher, and what do you think of her? And do you know what sort of people\r\nare about poor little Queen Isabel?[9] Poor, good Donna Maria! I feel\r\nmuch for her; her education was one of the worst that could be. As\r\nlong as those Ficalhos and Melos remain about her, nothing can be\r\ndone. Could they not be got rid of in time?\r\n\r\nI was sorry to see that the French Chambers were rather stormy.[10]\r\n\r\nI thank you much for the list of the ball of the 18th, which must\r\nhave been very splendid. The last ball _I_ was at was our own, and\r\nI concluded that very ball at half-past three in the morning with a\r\ncountry dance, Albert being my partner.\r\n\r\nPray, dear Uncle, tell both young gentlemen, with my kindest love,\r\nthat I _often_ think of that night and of many other pleasant evenings\r\nwe passed together. The singing will come all in time. Who is their\r\nsinging-master? I wish they had my worthy Lablache. I sing regularly\r\nevery evening, as I think it better to do so every day to keep\r\nthe voice manageable. Oh, my beloved Uncle, could you join us, how\r\ndelightful that would be! How I should delight in singing with you all\r\nour favourite things from _La Gazza_, _Otello_, _Il Barbiere_, etc.,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe little Cousin[11] must be a little love: oh, could I but see him\r\nand play with him! Pray, dear Uncle, does he know such a thing as that\r\nhe has got an Aunt and Cousin on the other side of the water? ...\r\n\r\nPray, dear Uncle, have you read Sir R. Peel's two speeches? I wish you\r\nwould, and give me your opinion of them.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: Some interesting observations on these events may\r\n    be read in Borrow's _Bible in Spain_.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: Don Juan Alvarez y Mendizabal (1790-1853),\r\n    Spanish politician and financier.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: Miguel Ricardo di Alava (1771-1843), Spanish\r\n    General; he acted as the representative of Spain at Paris, at\r\n    the Court of the Bourbons; he was a great friend of the Duke\r\n    of Wellington, and was with him at his headquarters during the\r\n    Peninsular War.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: The Queen Regent, Christina.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: Then six years old; she died in 1904.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 10: This was in reference to the trial at Strasburg\r\n    of the confederates of Prince Louis Bonaparte (afterwards\r\n    Napoleon III.) in his abortive attempt to establish a military\r\n    despotism on 30th October.

I am very sorry that the Portuguese news are\r\nstill so very unfavourable; I trust that, in time, things will come\r\nright. The Portuguese are, as you say, a most inconceivable set of\r\nselfish politicians.\r\n\r\nOur friend, Mr Hume,[12] made a most violent speech at a dinner given\r\nto him and old George Byng[13] at Drury Lane last week.[14] He called\r\nSir R. Peel and some other Tories \"the cloven foot,\" which I think\r\nrather strong. I think that _great_ violence and striving such a pity,\r\non both sides, don't you, dear Uncle? They irritate one another so\r\nuselessly by calling one another fools, blockheads, liars, and so\r\nforth for no purpose. I think violence so bad in everything. They\r\nshould imitate you, and be calm, for you have had, God knows! enough\r\ncause for irritation from your _worthy_ Dutch neighbours and others.\r\nYou will, I fear, laugh at my _politics_, but I like telling _you_ my\r\nfeelings, for you alone can put me right on such subjects.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 12: Joseph Hume, leader of the Radical party, was\r\n    now M.P. for Middlesex.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 13: George Byng, for many years Member for\r\n    Middlesex, was great-grandson of William Wentworth, Earl of\r\n    Strafford, of the 1711 creation.

I am sorry to see so much violence in England at\r\nthis moment; I consider it as the most lamentable circumstance, as it\r\nrenders matters so very difficult to settle. Besides, the poor Crown\r\nis more or less the loser in all this, as it generally ends with the\r\nabolition of something or other which might have proved useful for the\r\ncarrying on of Government. A rule which you may thus early impress on\r\nyour mind is, that people are far from acting generally according to\r\nthe dictates of their interests, but oftener in consequence of their\r\npassions, though it may even prove injurious to their interests.\r\nIf the Tory part of Parliament could have brought themselves to act\r\nwithout passion, much in the reform of Parliament might have been\r\nsettled much more in conformity with their best interests. I was\r\nauthorised, in 1831, to speak in this sense to the Duke of Wellington\r\nby Lord Grey;[15] the effect would have been highly beneficial to\r\nboth parties, but passion made it impossible to succeed. This is a\r\ndangerous part of the business, and we must see during the present\r\nsession of Parliament if parties are grown wiser. I fear they are not.\r\nThe business of the highest in a State is certainly, in my opinion,\r\nto act with great impartiality and a spirit of justice for the good of\r\nall, and not of this or that party.[16]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 15: This refers to the rejection of the Reform Bill\r\n    by the House of Lords in 1831; as a consequence, mobs broke\r\n    the windows of Apsley House, and fired Nottingham Castle.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16: On 14th April 1837, Sir Robert Peel wrote to J.\r\n    W. Croker:-- ... \"We are, in short, in this state of things.\r\n    All the convictions and inclinations of the Government are\r\n    with their Conservative opponents. Half their actions and all\r\n    their speeches are with the Radicals.\" (_Croker Papers_, ii.\r\n    306.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nCLAREMONT, _6th February 1837._\r\n\r\nMY BELOVED UNCLE,-- ... I do not know quite for certain when we leave\r\nthis place, but I should think to-day week. You must be pleased, dear\r\nUncle, I think, for we shall have been _six months_ in the country\r\nnext Thursday, as we left town on the 10th of August last, and I am\r\nsure you will stand by me for my having my season fully, as you may\r\nunderstand that my _Operatic_ and _Terpsichorean_ feelings are pretty\r\nstrong, now that the season is returning, and I have been a very good\r\nchild, not even _wishing_ to come to town till now. We shall certainly\r\ncome here for the Easter week.\r\n\r\nDr Clark[17] arrived here quite happy last night, bringing the news\r\nthat Van de Weyer had had the best news from Lisbon he had received\r\nsince his return, that all had gone off quietly, that Ferdinand was\r\ndaily gaining popularity, and that both he and the Queen had been very\r\nwell received at the theatre. The man who threw a stone at Ferdinand\r\nwas a Frenchman, whom, it seems, Ferdinand had relieved with money\r\nover and over again. A fine specimen of gratitude!\r\n\r\nI hope and trust with you that there will be less violence in\r\nParliament this year, but much is to be feared.\r\n\r\nYou will miss my good cousins Ernest and Albert very much, I am sure;\r\nI hope you will instil into them to take enough exercise and not to\r\nstudy too much.\r\n\r\nThere were two questions in my last letter but one, which you have\r\nnot answered, dear Uncle. They are: 1st, What you think of the Queen\r\nChristina of Spain, what opinion _you_ have of her, as one cannot\r\nbelieve _reports_? 2nd, If you know what sort of people are about\r\npoor little Queen Isabel, and if she is being _well_ or _ill_ brought\r\nup?...\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 17: Afterwards Sir James Clark, and\r\n    Physician-in-Ordinary to the Queen.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: A DINNER PARTY]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE THRONE OF GREECE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\n_14th March 1837._\r\n\r\n... We had a dinner on Saturday which amused me, as I am very fond\r\nof _pleasant_ society, and we have been for these last three weeks\r\nimmured within our old palace, and I longed sadly for some gaiety.\r\nAfter being so very long in the country I was preparing to go out in\r\nright earnest, whereas I have only been _twice_ to the play since our\r\nreturn, which is marvellous! However, we are to have another dinner\r\nto-morrow, and are going to the play and Opera. After Easter I trust\r\nI shall make ample amends for all this solitariness. I hope to begin\r\nsinging with Lablache shortly after Easter. But to return to last\r\nSaturday's dinner. We had the Archbishop of Dublin,[18] a clever but\r\nsingular man, and his lady; Lord Palmerston, with whom I had much\r\npleasant and amusing conversation after dinner--you know how agreeable\r\nhe is; then Lady Cadogan,[19] who enquired much after you and Aunt\r\nLouise; Lord and Lady Rosebery,[20] Mr and Mrs E. Stanley,[21] Lord\r\nMorpeth,[22] Lord Templetown,[23] Sir John Cam Hobhouse,[24] Dr\r\nLushington,[25] and Mr Woulfe,[26] the Solicitor-General for Ireland,\r\na Roman Catholic and a very clever man. Lady Cadogan, who is not long\r\ncome back from Paris, says that the Duke of Orleans has been going out\r\nvery little and is remarkably well. I saw a report in the papers that\r\nhe and the Duc de Nemours were coming over here, which I fear is not\r\ntrue; I wish it was....\r\n\r\nThere is one thing in your former letter which I must answer, or,\r\nrather, more advert to. You said to me, that if it was not for me, you\r\nwould regret Greece very much. Now, I assure you, dearest Uncle, you\r\nought not to regret it, though there is not a doubt that _Greece_\r\nwould be much happier were you there. But I have heard from various\r\npeople who have been staying in Greece that they very soon got to like\r\nthe Turks much better than the Greeks, who are very untrue, and are\r\nquite banditti-like; then, again, the country, though undoubtedly fine\r\nin parts, is a rocky and barren country, and also you are constantly\r\nexposed to the effects of the Plague, that most dreadful of all evils;\r\nand then, lastly, how very, very far you would be, how cut off from\r\nall those who are dear to you, and how exposed to dangers of all\r\nkinds!\r\n\r\nI much grieve that they are quarrelling so much in the French\r\nChambers.[27] I must now conclude.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18: Richard Whateley, formerly Principal of St Alban\r\n    Hall, and Drummond Professor of Political Economy at Oxford.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 19: Louisa Honoria, wife of the third Earl, and\r\n    sister of Joseph, first Lord Wallscourt.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 20: Archibald, fourth Earl of Rosebery, and Anne\r\n    Margaret, his second wife, daughter of the first Viscount\r\n    Anson.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 21: Edward Stanley, afterwards fourteenth Earl of\r\n    Derby, thrice Prime Minister.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 22: Chief Secretary for Ireland.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 23: John Henry, first Viscount, formerly M.P. for\r\n    Bury St Edmunds.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 24: Sir John Cam Hobhouse, a Radical, and a friend\r\n    of Byron, at whose wedding he acted as best man; he was\r\n    imprisoned in 1819 for breach of privilege.

The elder Prince was\r\nmuch interested about his _frère_, and anxious to see him; at first,\r\nhowever, he declared after a long contemplation, \"_pas beau frère!_\"\r\nNow he thinks better of him, but makes a very odd little face when he\r\nsees him. The name of the little one will be Philippe Eugène Ferdinand\r\nMarie Clément Baudouin (Baldwin)--a name of the old Counts of\r\nFlanders--Léopold Georges. My Aunt, who is his godmother, wished\r\nhe should be called Philippe in honour of his grandfather, and\r\nas Philippe _le Bon_ was one of the most powerful Princes of this\r\ncountry, I gave him the name with pleasure. Eugène is her own name,\r\nFerdinand that of Chartres, Marie of the Queen and also of Princess\r\nMarie, Clément of Princess Clémentine; Léopold your Aunt wished, and\r\nGeorge in honour of St George of England and of George IV. Probably I\r\nshall hereafter give to Léopold the title of Duke of Brabant, and to\r\nPhilippe that of Count of Flanders, both fine old titles.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 28: Philippe, second son of King Leopold, afterwards\r\n    Count of Flanders.

You have been the subject of all sorts of\r\nnewspaper paragraphs; your good and sensible way of looking on these\r\nvery creditable productions _will be of use to you_. If the press says\r\nuseful things, and makes observations which merit attention, there\r\nis no doubt that sometimes, though God knows very rarely, something\r\nuseful may be gleaned from them. But when you see its present state,\r\nwhen the one side says black and the other white, when the opposite\r\npolitical characters are treated by their respective antagonists as\r\nrogues, fools, blockheads, wretches, and all the other names in which\r\nthe English political dictionary is so _very rich_, one stands like\r\nthe ass, between two bundles of hay, considerably embarrassed which\r\nought to be chosen....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE PRINCESS'S ESTABLISHMENT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to the Princess Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _11th April 1837._\r\n\r\n... As I believe the visit at Windsor is fixed for the 15th, I hope\r\nthis letter will arrive in time. Perhaps the King will speak to you\r\nabout the necessity of forming you an establishment.[29]... Your\r\nposition, having a Mother with whom you very naturally remain, would\r\nrender a _complete_ independent establishment perhaps matter of _real_\r\ninconvenience; still something like that which Charlotte had will\r\nbecome desirable. My idea, if it meets with your approbation, would\r\nbe this: The Duchess of Northumberland would remain your first Lady,\r\nBaroness Lehzen would fill a position similar to that of Mrs Campbell,\r\nwho had been Charlotte's governess in her younger days, and the\r\nDean[30] would step into the position which good Dr Short[31] held.\r\nAn Equerry, I do not think--as you will not go out without your\r\nMother--you would require. On the other hand, it may become matter\r\nof examination if you will perhaps like to have some young ladies\r\nattendants in the style of Lady Catherine Jenkinson;[32] should this\r\nbe your wish, it would become necessary to make very good choices,\r\nelse perhaps you would derive more trouble than comfort from the\r\narrangement; _cela va sans dire_, that the choice could only be\r\nmade by yourself, and that nobody should be given you _against_ your\r\nwishes. Should the King speak to you on the subject, I would at once\r\nexpress this my wish if you should approve some such arrangement,\r\nand beg him to let _you choose_. Resist mildly but _positively_ any\r\nnomination of a Gentleman other than the Dean; it is highly probable\r\nthat any other would be put about you as a spy, and turn out at all\r\nevents a great bore, which is better avoided....\r\n\r\nI received a messenger from Coburg. I enclose the letters and also\r\na packet with fans. Ever, my beloved child, your faithfully attached\r\nUncle and Friend,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 29: The Princess was to attain her legal majority on\r\n    24th May.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 30: George Davys, the Princess Victoria's\r\n    instructor, Dean of Chester, and afterwards Bishop of\r\n    Peterborough.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 31: Thomas Vowler Short, Rector of St George's,\r\n    Bloomsbury, appointed in 1841 Bishop of Sodor and Man.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 32: Lady Catherine Jenkinson, daughter of the Earl\r\n    of Liverpool, soon after the Queen's accession married Colonel\r\n    Francis Vernon Harcourt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\n_12th April 1837._\r\n\r\n... What you say about the newspapers is very true and very\r\nflattering. They are indeed a curious compound of truth and untruth. I\r\nam so used to newspaper nonsense and attacks that I do not mind it in\r\nthe least....\r\n\r\nHow happy I am that that beloved Aunt is going on so well and does not\r\nsuffer from the cold, as also the _jeune Philippe_. Leopold must\r\nbe great fun with his Aunt Marie;[33] does he still say \"_pas beau\r\nfrère!_\" or is he more reconciled to his brother? It is very noble in\r\nthe Duc de Nemours to have thus given up his _apanage_;[34] I am sorry\r\nthere were such difficulties about it.

Sir Henry Hardinge's[35] motion was quite\r\nlost, I am happy to say, and don't you think, dearest Uncle, that\r\nit has almost done good, as it proves that the Tories have lost all\r\nchance of getting in? It was a trial of strength, and the Ministry\r\nhave triumphed. I have been reading in the papers, what I suppose you\r\nalready know, that it is believed that the Lords _will_ pass the Irish\r\nCorporation Bill;[36] and also that Ministers mean to drop for the\r\npresent the question about Church Rates,[37] as the Radicals, being\r\nangry with Ministers relative to the Canada business, would not\r\nsupport them well.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 35: On a motion for going into supply, Sir H.\r\n    Hardinge proposed an amendment censuring the Government for\r\n    the authorisation of the raising of a force of Volunteers to\r\n    assist the Spanish Government, and for the method in which\r\n    that force had been organised. The amendment was lost by a\r\n    majority of 36, on 19th April.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 36: The Irish Municipal Bill, to convert\r\n    Corporations of Municipalities into Electoral Councils, was\r\n    introduced in the House of Commons on the 15th of February.\r\n    The Bill was opposed by the Conservatives, but passed the\r\n    House of Commons. In the Lords an amendment of Lyndhurst's\r\n    struck out the constructive clauses, and the Act became, on\r\n    the 18th of May, an Act for the Abolition of Municipalities\r\n    in Ireland. Lord John Russell brought forward a motion to\r\n    reconstruct the Bill. But the Peers declined to pass it, and\r\n    it was postponed.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 37: As Ministers only obtained a majority of 5 in a\r\n    house of 569, the measure was dropped.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to the Princess Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _28th April 1837._\r\n\r\n... I hope you occupy yourself with the several great questions which\r\nagitate parties. I think a good mode will be to talk concerning them\r\nsometimes with the Dean. He is a good moderate man, and still well\r\nable to give you sufficient information. From conversation with clever\r\npeople, such as dine sometimes with you, much may be very usefully\r\ngathered, and you will do well to attend to this. I am no enemy to\r\nthis way of instruction, and have seen people who were sharp enough\r\nto profit wonderfully by it. You hear in this way the opinions of a\r\nvariety of persons, and it rests with your own good sense to classify\r\nand appreciate them....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MINISTERIAL ANXIETY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\n_2nd May 1837._\r\n\r\n... You may depend upon it that I shall profit by your excellent\r\nadvice respecting Politics. Pray, dear Uncle, have you read Lord\r\nPalmerston's speech concerning the Spanish affairs,[38] which he\r\ndelivered the night of the division on Sir Henry Hardinge's motion? It\r\nis much admired. The Irish Tithes question came on last night in the\r\nHouse of Commons,[39] and I am very anxious for the morning papers,\r\nto see what has been done. Lord Melbourne looks remarkably well, Lord\r\nPalmerston not very well, and as for poor little Lord John Russell,\r\nhe is only a shadow of himself. It must be dreadfully fagging work for\r\nthem; they sit so very late too, for when the Spanish question came\r\non, the division only took place at four o'clock in the morning, and I\r\nsaw them at the Drawing-Room the same day afterwards....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 38: Lord Palmerston indignantly asked whether\r\n    England should continue to fulfil her engagement with the\r\n    Queen of Spain, or disgracefully abandon an ally whom she had\r\n    pledged herself to succour.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 39: The Irish Tithe Bill, a measure to facilitate\r\n    the collection of tithes, was abandoned because the Tories\r\n    would not consent to any secular appropriation of Church\r\n    revenues, and the Whigs would not consent to the withdrawal\r\n    of their amendments. A remarkable feature in the Bill was a\r\n    proposal that a portion of every clergyman's income should be\r\n    applied to education, as was already prescribed by a former\r\n    Act.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\n_9th May 1837._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--It was very kind of you to write to me from your\r\nnew château; I hardly ventured to hope for my usual letter, and yet I\r\nshould have been much disappointed had I not received it. I am sorry\r\nthat the house is so bad, but hope you will have found a good position\r\nfor a new one....\r\n\r\nPray, dearest Uncle, may I ask such an indiscreet question as, if\r\nMajor Stroekens is a clever man; he was so nervous and embarrassed\r\nwhen he came here, that I could not make him out. He brought me a very\r\nnice letter from Donna Maria.\r\n\r\nI am anxiously waiting to hear the issue of the battle between\r\nthe Carlists and Christinos, which is, they say, to decide a great\r\ndeal.[40]\r\n\r\nNow farewell, dearest Uncle.

Believe me, always, your affectionate Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA.\r\n\r\nOld Pozzo[41] dined here last Wednesday, and he gave me a long, I\r\nmust say clever, dissertation about the state of France, during\r\ndinner-time.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 40: After an obstinate investment by the Carlists,\r\n    Espartero had relieved Bilbao on Christmas Day, 1836.

The thing I am most curious to learn\r\nis what the King proposed to you concerning your establishment....\r\nI shall reserve my opinion till I am better informed, but by what\r\nI heard I did not approve of it, because I thought it ill-timed.\r\nStockmar will be able to do much. Two things seem necessary; not to be\r\nfettered by any establishment other than what will be _comfortable\r\nto you_, and then to avoid any breach with your mother. I have\r\nfully instructed Stockmar, and I must say he left me in such good\r\ndisposition that I think he will be able to be of great use to you.\r\nThe great thing is to act without precipitation and with caution. The\r\nKing seems better again. I am very curious to know what he proposed;\r\nyou will have it in your power to modify his proposition, as it is\r\ndifficult your _approbation_ should be dispensed with; it would be a\r\ngreat fault in your situation to _submit_ to this.... They seemed to\r\nthink the King dying, which does not appear to be the case. Be steady,\r\nmy good child, and _not_ put out by _anything_; as long as I live _you\r\nwill not want a faithful friend and supporter_....\r\n\r\nHere your somewhat curious little soul has at least the outlines of\r\nthings....\r\n\r\n_26th._--I received yesterday the whole of the papers concerning the\r\nKing's propositions.[42] I approve your letter to the King, as it\r\nis amiable and generous, and this in your position will always tell\r\nfavourably. I think that if _he_ is well advised he will chiefly\r\nconsult _your wishes_. This is the footing on which you must place\r\nmatters. It is not worth while to be told that one is in some sort\r\nof age when the consequence is that you are not consulted in what\r\nconcerns you most personally. Avoid in future to say much about\r\nyour great _youth_ and _inexperience_. Who made the letter? Was it\r\nyourself, or came it from your Mother? You have now the Baron at your\r\nelbow, and even your Mother was most anxious for his arrival. _Speak\r\nsometimes with him_; it is necessary to accustom you to the thing.\r\n\r\nAbout the King's health.[43] I am doubtful what to think. We have\r\nforeseen the case and treated it formerly. The great thing would be to\r\nmake no change, to keep Ministers and everything as it is, and to gain\r\ntime; in this way _no one is hurt and no amour-propre blessé_.\r\nFor this reason I lean to your keeping, to begin with, Sir Herbert\r\nTaylor[44] for your _official_ secretary, though I am not quite\r\n_decided_ on the subject. He knows the manner in which the _daily\r\nbusiness_ is carried on; this is important. I believe him, and have\r\nfound him to be an honest man, that would do for State matters; it\r\nwould not be required that he should be your _confidential_ adviser.\r\nNow I conclude, and send you this letter through Stockmar. My best\r\nregards to Lehzen. Ever your faithful Uncle and Friend,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 42: The King had offered the Princess an\r\n    establishment of £10,000 a year, independent of her mother.\r\n    This was accepted, to the great vexation of the Duchess of\r\n    Kent, but the arrangement was not carried into effect.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 43: King William's health was at this time causing\r\n    much anxiety.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 44: Private Secretary to King William IV.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: BIRTHDAY REJOICINGS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\n_26th May 1837._\r\n\r\n... The demonstrations of affection and kindness from all sides\r\ntowards me on my birthday, were most gratifying. The parks and streets\r\nwere crowded all day as though something very extraordinary had\r\nhappened. Yesterday I received twenty-two Addresses from various\r\nplaces, all very pretty and loyal; one in particular was very well\r\nwritten which was presented by Mr. Attwood[45] from the Political\r\nUnion at Birmingham.\r\n\r\nI am delighted to hear Stockmar is at length arrived; he reached\r\nLondon on Wednesday, and we shall see him to-day.\r\n\r\nHow distressed I am that poor dear Ernest[46] has been so ill! Thank\r\nGod! that he is now better.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish affairs have turned out better than you had expected; the\r\ntriumphant capture of Irun[47] was a great thing for the Christinos.\r\n\r\nThe King is much better.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 45: Thomas Attwood founded in 1829 the Birmingham Political\r\n    Union, which helped to pass the Reform Act. Previously he had been\r\n    known for his opposition to the Orders in Council, and the resumption\r\n    of cash payments. Birmingham elected him without opposition in 1832,\r\n    and he sat till 1840.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 46: Prince Ernest of Saxe-Coburg.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 47: The frontier town of Spain, near St Sebastian,\r\n    captured, 16th May, by the Christinos, supported by British\r\n    troops.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: ADVICE AND ENCOURAGEMENT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to the Princess Victoria._\r\n\r\nTUILERIES, _7th June 1837._\r\n\r\n... The _entrée_[48] last Sunday was something remarkably splendid; we\r\nsaw it from the Tuileries, as we had nothing to do with the business\r\nitself, and your Aunt's rank would have clashed with that of the\r\nDuchess of Orleans. The effect of all this on the people of this great\r\ntown has been _very great_, and evidently much ground has been solidly\r\nregained. The King, getting out of that sort of confinement in which\r\nit was necessary to keep, has gained much in personal comfort, and\r\nalso in a political point of view; because to have a King who cannot\r\nshow himself without being shot at, is a state of society which lowers\r\nhis authority....\r\n\r\nFor the present the best plan is to continue to act as you have\r\ndone hitherto; to avoid quarrels, but also to stick _firmly to your\r\nresolution when once_ taken. The violence which is sometimes shown is\r\nso well known to you, you know also so well that you have nothing\r\nto fear from these people, that _you must keep up your usual cool\r\nspirit_, whatever may be tried in the House to _teaze you out of it_.\r\nI mean to wait some more detailed accounts of what is going on in\r\nEngland before I give my opinion on what ought to be done in the case\r\nthat the King's disease should take a more fatal turn.\r\n\r\nAs I told you before, however, when we treated this subject verbally\r\nand in writing, I believe it to be your interest to act very mildly,\r\n_to begin by taking everything as the King leaves it_. By this system\r\nyou avoid disappointing those whose hopes may remain unchanged, as\r\nyour own choices, as it were, are not yet made. Parties, which at\r\npresent are so nearly balanced, remain _in statu quo_, and you gain\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nI must conclude now this letter. My winding up is, keep your mind\r\n_cool_ and _easy_; be _not alarmed_ at the prospect of becoming\r\nperhaps sooner than you expected Queen; aid will not be wanting, and\r\nthe great thing is that you should have some honest people about you\r\nwho have your welfare _really at heart_. Stockmar will be in this\r\nrespect all we can wish, and we must hope that _useful_ occupation\r\nwill prevent his health from suffering. Now once more God bless you.\r\nEver, my dear child, your faithful Uncle and Friend,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 48: The entry into Paris of the Duke and Duchess of\r\n    Orleans, who had been married at Fontainebleau on May 30th.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE ACCESSION IMMINENT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to the Princess Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _15th June 1837._\r\n\r\nMY BELOVED CHILD,--I hope that to-day will not pass over without\r\nbringing me a letter from you. In the meantime I will begin this\r\nepistle, which will go by a messenger of my own to-morrow. In every\r\nletter I shall write to you I mean to repeat to you, as a _fundamental\r\nrule_, _to be courageous, firm and honest, as you have been till now_.\r\nYou may count upon my faithful good offices in all difficulties,\r\nand you have at your command Stockmar, whose _judgment_, _heart_, and\r\n_character_ offer all the guarantees we can wish for. I wish nothing\r\nbut to see you _happy and prosperous_, and by Sunday I shall probably\r\nwrite you a long letter, which will enter into details about most\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nMy object is that you should be no one's _tool_, and though young, and\r\nnaturally not yet experienced, your good natural sense and the _truth_\r\nof your character will, with faithful and proper advice, get you very\r\nwell through the difficulties of your future position, should it be\r\nthe will of Providence to take the King from this earthly life. Of his\r\nreal position I am still not quite able to judge, there being so much\r\ncontradictory in the reports. Be this as it may, the great thing for\r\nyou is, not to be hurried into important measures, and to _gain time_.\r\nA new reign is always a time of hope; everybody is disposed to see\r\nsomething for his own wishes and prospects. The policy of a new\r\nSovereign must therefore be to act in such a manner as to hurt as\r\nlittle as possible the _amour-propre_ of people, to let circumstances\r\nand the force of things bring about the disappointments which no human\r\npower could prevent coming sooner or later: that they should come as\r\n_late_ as possible is in your interest. Should anything happen to the\r\nKing before I can enter more fully into the necessary details, limit\r\nyourself to _taking kindly_ and in a _friendly_ manner the present\r\nAdministration into your service. They are _naturally friendly to your\r\ninterests_, _as you are in fact the only possible Sovereign of the\r\nwhole family_, with the exception of the Duke of Sussex, they can\r\n_serve_ with _sincerity_ and _attachment_. This is of great importance\r\nto you, as it is by no means the same thing to have people who aid and\r\nassist you with feelings of real attachment, or merely from cold and\r\ncalculating motives of political expediency and self-interest.\r\nThis being done, no other step should be taken without consulting\r\nseriously. The very time which is necessary to attain this end is\r\nfavourable to you, as it is your greatest interest for the _present\r\nmoment_ to act most cautiously and to gain as much _time_ as possible.\r\nIn high positions it is excessively difficult to _retrace_ a false\r\nmove to get out of a mistake; and there exists very rarely, except in\r\ntime of war and civil feuds, a necessity for an _immediate_ decision.\r\nYour part must be, to resume once more what I said before, to\r\nremain as long as possible _agreeable_ to all parties, and after the\r\nformation of the Ministry, to be most careful how you take any measure\r\nof importance....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE KING'S ILLNESS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\n_16th June 1837._\r\n\r\nMY BELOVED UNCLE,--... I cannot say how happy I am that the _entrée\r\npublique_ into Paris succeeded so well, and that the dear King was\r\nso well received; I trust he will now at last be rewarded for all the\r\ntroubles and anxiety he has had ever since 1830. Lord Palmerston said\r\nthat the French say that _l'assassinat est hors de mode_. I hope and\r\ntrust in Heaven that this may be the case, and _for ever_!\r\n\r\nYou know, of course, dear Uncle, how _very ill_ the King is; it\r\nmay _all be over_ at _any moment_, and yet _may_ last a few days.\r\nConsequently, we have not been out anywhere in public since Tuesday,\r\n6th, and since Wednesday all my lessons are stopped, as the news may\r\narrive very suddenly....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to the Princess Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _17th June 1837._\r\n\r\nMY BELOVED CHILD,--... I shall to-day enter on the subject of what is\r\nto be done when the King ceases to live. The moment you get official\r\ncommunication of it, you will entrust Lord Melbourne with the office\r\nof retaining the present Administration as your Ministers. You will do\r\nthis in that honest and kind way which is quite your own, and say some\r\nkind things on the subject. The fact is that the present Ministers are\r\nthose who will serve you personally with the greatest _sincerity_ and,\r\nI trust, attachment. For them, as well as for the Liberals at large,\r\nyou are the _only_ Sovereign that offers them _des chances d'existence\r\net de durée_. With the exception of the Duke of Sussex, there is\r\nno _one_ in the family that offers them anything like what they can\r\nreasonably hope from you, and your immediate successor, with the\r\nmustaches,[49] is enough to frighten them into the most violent\r\nattachment for you.\r\n\r\n... The irksome position in which you have lived will have the merit\r\nto have given you the habit of _discretion_ and _prudence_, as in your\r\nposition you never can have _too much_ of either. Great measures of\r\nState I hope you will be able to avoid at first. I have already--if\r\nyou would read it over, and perhaps let Stockmar see it--written to\r\nyou some months ago on the subject of the necessity of maintaining the\r\ninfluence of conservative principles, and of protecting the Church.\r\nYou will do well to keep both objects in view. You will do wisely\r\nby showing yourself attached to the English Protestant Church as it\r\nexists in the State; you are particularly where you are, because you\r\nare a Protestant. I know you are averse to persecution, and you are\r\nright; miss, however, _no opportunity_ to show your sincere feeling\r\nfor the existing Church; it is _right_ and _meet_ that you should do\r\nso. I must repeat that you will do well as long as it will be possible\r\nto hurt no one's hopes or prospects. That this will not always, or\r\nvery long, be possible is the consequence of the state of parties;\r\nstill, one may be frank and honest, and still kind to all. Concerning\r\nforeign policy I shall write on some future occasion. In the meantime\r\nI trust you will protect the two Queens in the Peninsula, who are\r\nmiserably ill off. I am sure, with your good sense you will not find\r\nit difficult to judge questions yourself. I cannot too much recommend\r\nthis, as it will then become a habit, and even an amusement to you.\r\nCultivate always a genuine feeling of right and wrong, and be very\r\ntrue and honourable in your dealings; this gives great strength. I\r\nhave taken into consideration the advantage or disadvantage of my\r\ncoming over to you _immediately_. The result of my _examen_ is that I\r\nthink it better to visit you later. If, however, you wanted me at any\r\ntime, I should come in a moment. People might fancy I came to enslave\r\nyou, while I glory in the contrary; and, thirdly, that they might be\r\njealous, or _affect_ it at least, of my coming, as if I thought of\r\nruling the realm for _purposes of my own_....\r\n\r\nI am now at the end, I think, of what I had to say. May Heaven bless\r\nyou and keep up your spirits. Ever, my beloved child, your faithful\r\nUncle and Friend,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\nPardon the hurry in which this letter was written.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 49: The Duke of Cumberland.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE KING'S CONDITION HOPELESS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\n_19th June 1837._\r\n\r\nMY DEARLY BELOVED UNCLE,--Your _kind_ and _dear_ letter, containing\r\n_most wholesome_, _prudent_, _sound_ and _excellent_ advice, was given\r\nme by our _good_ and _invaluable honest_ friend, Stockmar, and I beg\r\nyou to accept my best thanks for it. Before I say anything else, let\r\nme tell you how happy and thankful I am to have Stockmar here; he\r\nhas _been_, and _is_, of the _greatest_ possible use, and be assured,\r\ndearest Uncle, that he possesses my _most entire confidence_!\r\n\r\nThe King's state, I may fairly say, is _hopeless_; he may _perhaps_\r\nlinger a few days, but he cannot recover _ultimately_. Yesterday the\r\nphysicians declared he could not live till the morning, but to-day he\r\nis a little better; the great fear is his _excessive_ weakness and\r\nno _pulse_ at all. Poor old man! I feel sorry for him; he was always\r\npersonally kind to me, and I should be ungrateful and devoid of\r\nfeeling if I did not remember this.\r\n\r\nI look forward to the event which it seems is likely to occur soon,\r\nwith calmness and quietness; I am not alarmed at it, and yet I do\r\nnot suppose myself quite equal to all; I trust, however, that with\r\n_good-will_, _honesty_, and _courage_ I shall not, at all events,\r\n_fail_. Your advice is most excellent, and you may depend upon it I\r\nshall make use of it, and follow it, as also what Stockmar says. I\r\n_never showed_ myself, _openly_, to belong to _any party_, and I _do\r\nnot_ belong to any party. The Administration will undoubtedly be well\r\nreceived by me, the more so as I have _real_ confidence in them, and\r\nin particular in Lord Melbourne, who is a straightforward, honest,\r\nclever and good man.\r\n\r\nI need not add much more, dearest Uncle, but that I trust that the\r\nall-powerful Being who has so long watched over my destinies will\r\nguide and support me, in whatever situation and station it may please\r\nHim to place me!...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE ACCESSION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _20th June 1837._\r\n\r\nViscount Melbourne[50] presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and\r\nbeing aware that your Majesty has already received the melancholy\r\nintelligence of the death of his late Majesty, will do himself the\r\nhonour of waiting upon your Majesty a little before nine this morning.\r\nViscount Melbourne has requested the Marquis of Lansdowne[51] to\r\nname eleven as the hour for the meeting of the Council at Kensington\r\nPalace.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 50: Lord Melbourne, so far as can be augured from\r\n    his handwriting, which is extremely difficult to decipher,\r\n    appears always to have written his own name _Melburne_.

I am, as you\r\nmay suppose, deeply affected by all the sad scenes I have gone through\r\nlately; but I have the great comfort to dwell upon the recollection of\r\nthe perfect resignation, piety, and patience with which the dear King\r\nbore his trials and sufferings, and the truly Christian-like manner of\r\nhis death.\r\n\r\nExcuse my writing more at present, my heart is overwhelmed and my\r\nhead aches very much. Accept the assurance of my most affectionate\r\ndevotion, and allow me to consider myself always as your Majesty's\r\nmost affectionate Friend, Aunt, and Subject,\r\n\r\nADELAIDE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN'S JOURNAL]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN'S FIRST COUNCIL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extract from the Queen's Journal._\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 20th June 1837._\r\n\r\nI was awoke at 6 o'clock by Mamma, who told me that the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury and Lord Conyngham were here, and wished to see me. I got\r\nout of bed and went into my sitting-room (only in my dressing-gown)\r\nand _alone_, and saw them. Lord Conyngham (the Lord Chamberlain)\r\nthen acquainted me that my poor Uncle, the King, was no more, and had\r\nexpired at 12 minutes past 2 this morning, and consequently that I\r\nam _Queen_. Lord Conyngham knelt down and kissed my hand, at the same\r\ntime delivering to me the official announcement of the poor King's\r\ndemise. The Archbishop then told me that the Queen was desirous that\r\nhe should come and tell me the details of the last moments of my poor\r\ngood Uncle; he said that he had directed his mind to religion, and had\r\ndied in a perfectly happy, quiet state of mind, and was quite prepared\r\nfor his death. He added that the King's sufferings at the last were\r\nnot very great but that there was a good deal of uneasiness. Lord\r\nConyngham, whom I charged to express my feelings of condolence and\r\nsorrow to the poor Queen, returned directly to Windsor. I then went to\r\nmy room and dressed.\r\n\r\nSince it has pleased Providence to place me in this station, I shall\r\ndo my utmost to fulfil my duty towards my country; I am very young\r\nand perhaps in many, though not in all things, inexperienced, but I am\r\nsure that very few have more real goodwill and more real desire to do\r\nwhat is fit and right than I have.\r\n\r\nBreakfasted, during which time good, faithful Stockmar came and talked\r\nto me. Wrote a letter to dear Uncle Leopold and a few words to dear\r\ngood Feodore. Received a letter from Lord Melbourne in which he said\r\nhe would wait upon me at a little before 9. At 9 came Lord Melbourne,\r\nwhom I saw in my room, and of _course quite alone_, as I shall\r\n_always_ do all my Ministers. He kissed my hand, and I then acquainted\r\nhim that it had long been my intention to retain him and the rest of\r\nthe present Ministry at the head of affairs, and that it could not be\r\nin better hands than his. He again then kissed my hand. He then read\r\nto me the Declaration which I was to read to the Council, which he\r\nwrote himself, and which is a very fine one. I then talked with him\r\nsome little time longer, after which he left me. He was in full\r\ndress. I like him very much, and feel confidence in him. He is a very\r\nstraightforward, honest, clever and good man. I then wrote a letter to\r\nthe Queen. At about 11 Lord Melbourne came again to me, and spoke to\r\nme upon various subjects. At about half-past 11 I went downstairs and\r\nheld a Council in the red saloon.\r\n\r\nI went in of course quite alone and remained seated the whole time.\r\nMy two Uncles, the Dukes of Cumberland and Sussex, and Lord Melbourne\r\nconducted me. The Declaration, the various forms, the swearing in of\r\nthe Privy Councillors, of which there were a great number present,\r\nand the reception of some of the Lords of the Council, previous to the\r\nCouncil, in an adjacent room (likewise alone) I subjoin here. I was\r\n_not_ at all nervous and had the satisfaction of hearing that people\r\nwere satisfied with what I had done and how I had done it. Received\r\nafter this, audiences of Lord Melbourne, Lord John Russell, Lord\r\nAlbemarle (Master of the Horse), and the Archbishop of Canterbury,\r\nall in my room and alone. Saw Stockmar. Saw Clark, whom I named my\r\nphysician. Saw Mary. Wrote to Uncle Ernest. Saw Ernest Hohenlohe, who\r\nbrought me a kind and very feeling letter from the poor Queen. I feel\r\nvery much for her, and really feel that the poor good King was always\r\nso kind personally to me, that I should be ungrateful were I not\r\nto recollect it and feel grieved at his death. The poor Queen is\r\nwonderfully composed now, I hear.\r\n\r\nWrote my journal. Took my dinner upstairs alone. Went downstairs.\r\nSaw Stockmar. At about twenty minutes to 9 came Lord Melbourne and\r\nremained till near 10. I had a very important and a very _comfortable_\r\nconversation with him. Each time I see him I feel more confidence in\r\nhim; I find him very kind in his manner too. Saw Stockmar. Went down\r\nand said good-night to Mamma, etc. My _dear_ Lehzen will _always_\r\nremain with me as my friend, but will take no situation about me, and\r\nI think she is right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE HOUSE OF COMMONS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWILTON CRESCENT, _22nd June 1837._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell[54] presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and\r\nhas the honour to report that he presented to the House of Commons\r\nthis day your Majesty's gracious Message.\r\n\r\nHe then moved an Address of Condolence and Congratulation, which\r\nwas seconded by Sir Robert Peel. Sir Robert Peel very properly took\r\noccasion to speak in terms of high admiration of the deportment of\r\nyour Majesty before the Privy Council on Tuesday.

Il m'est doux de penser que l'heureuse direction que\r\nla Princesse votre excellente et bien aimée Mère a si sagement donnée\r\nà votre jeune âge, vous met à portée de supporter dignement le grand\r\nfardeau qui vous est échu.

Your\r\nletter of the 19th, written very shortly before the important event\r\ntook place, gave me _great satisfaction_; it showed me a temper of\r\nmind well calculated for the occasion. To see the difficulties of the\r\ntask without shrinking from them or feeling alarm, and to meet them\r\nwith courage, is the way to succeed. I have often seen that the\r\n_confidence_ of success has been the _cause of the success itself_,\r\nand you will do well to _preserve_ that sentiment.\r\n\r\nI have been most happy to learn that the swearing in of the Council\r\npassed so well. The Declaration in the newspapers I find simple and\r\nappropriate. The translation in the papers says, \"_J'ai été élevés en\r\nAngleterre._\" 1. I should advise to say as often as possible that you\r\nare _born_ in England. George III. _gloried_ in this, and as _none_\r\nof your cousins are born in England, it is your interest _de faire\r\nreporter cela fortement_. 2. You never can say too much in praise of\r\nyour country and its inhabitants. Two nations in Europe are really\r\nalmost ridiculous in their own exaggerated praises of themselves;\r\nthese are the English and the French. Your being very national is\r\nhighly important, and as you happen to be born in England and never to\r\nhave left it a moment,[56] it would be odd enough if people tried\r\nto make out the contrary. 3. The Established Church I also recommend\r\nstrongly; you cannot, without _pledging_ yourself to anything\r\n_particular_, _say too much on the subject_. 4. Before you decide\r\non anything important I should be glad if you would consult me; this\r\nwould also have the advantage of giving you time. In politics most\r\nmeasures will come in time within a certain number of days; to retrace\r\nor back out of a measure is on the contrary extremely _difficult_, and\r\nalmost always _injurious_ to the highest authority.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 56: The Duke and Duchess of Kent were settled at\r\n    Amorbach, in Leiningen, till a short time before the birth of\r\n    their child, when they came to Kensington.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE MINISTERS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\n_25th June 1837._\r\n\r\nMY BELOVED UNCLE,--Though I have an _immense_ deal of _business_\r\nto do, I shall write you a few lines to thank you for your kind and\r\nuseful letter of the 23rd, which I have just received. _Your_ advice\r\nis always of the _greatest importance_ to me.\r\n\r\nRespecting Claremont, Stockmar will be able to explain to you the\r\n_total_ impossibility of my being out of London, as I must see my\r\nMinisters _every_ day. I am _very_ well, sleep well, and drive every\r\nevening in the country; it is so hot that walking is out of the\r\nquestion. Before I go further let me pause to tell you how fortunate I\r\nam to have at the head of the Government a man like Lord Melbourne.\r\nI have seen him now every day, with the exception of Friday, and the\r\nmore I see him, the more confidence I have in him; he is not only a\r\nclever statesman and an honest man, but a good and a kind-hearted man,\r\nwhose aim is to do his duty for his country and not for a _party_. He\r\nis of the greatest use to me both politically and privately.\r\n\r\nI have seen almost all my other Ministers, and do regular, hard,\r\nbut to _me delightful_, work with them. It is to me the _greatest\r\npleasure_ to do my duty for my country and my people, and no fatigue,\r\nhowever great, will be burdensome to me if it is for the welfare of\r\nthe nation. Stockmar will tell you all these things. I have reason\r\nto be highly pleased with all my Ministers, and hope to God that\r\nthe Elections[57] may be favourable, as I well know that the present\r\nMinistry is the best and most moderate we can have.\r\n\r\nDo not, my dearly beloved Uncle, fear for my health; I shall take\r\n_good_ care of it. I beg your advice on the enclosed paper.\r\n\r\nEver your devoted and grateful Niece and affectionate _Child_,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 57: At that time rendered necessary by the demise of\r\n    the Crown.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DELIBERATION ADVISED]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _27th June 1837._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR CHILD,--... Now I must touch on another subject which is of\r\nvital importance for you and your comfort, viz. the habits of business\r\nwhich you will contract now. The best plan is to devote certain hours\r\nto it; if you do that, you will get through it with great ease. I\r\nthink you would do well to tell your Ministers that for the present\r\nyou would be ready to receive those who should wish to see you between\r\nthe hours of eleven and half-past one. This will not plague you much,\r\nand will be sufficient in most cases for the usual business that is to\r\nbe transacted.\r\n\r\nI shall add to this a piece of advice. Whenever a question is of some\r\nimportance, it should not be decided on the day when it is submitted\r\nto you. Whenever it is not an urgent one, I make it a rule not to let\r\nany question be forced upon my _immediate_ decision; it is really not\r\ndoing oneself justice _de décider des questions sur le pouce_. And\r\neven when in my mind I am disposed to accede, still I always keep the\r\npapers with me some little time before I return them. The best mode\r\nfor you will be, that each Minister should bring his box with him,\r\nand when he submits to you the papers, _explain them to you_. Then you\r\nwill keep the papers, either to think yourself upon it or to consult\r\nsomebody, and either return them the next time you see the Minister\r\nto whom they belong, or send them to him. Good habits formed _now_ may\r\nfor ever afterwards be kept up, and will become so natural to you that\r\nyou will not find them at all fatiguing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Melbourne._\r\n\r\nKENSINGTON PALACE, _29th June 1837._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Melbourne's communication, and thinks,\r\nas Prince Ernest of Hesse goes to the funeral, it would be proper the\r\nPrince of Leiningen should do just the same. The Queen requests that\r\nLord Melbourne will be so good as to take care that the Prince of\r\nLeiningen is informed as to the proper dress he ought to wear on the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nLord Albemarle mentioned yesterday to the Queen, that all the ladies'\r\nsaddle-horses, including the Queen-Dowager's own favourite horses,\r\nbelonged to the Queen; but it strikes her that it would be well if the\r\nQueen was to give the Queen-Dowager the choice of two or three of her\r\nown horses, and that she might keep them. The Queen would wish Lord\r\nMelbourne to give her his opinion on this subject....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: STOCKMAR]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: SUBJECTS FOR STUDY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _30th June 1837._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST CHILD,--... I am glad to see that you are so much pleased\r\nwith Lord Melbourne. I believe him to be as you think him. His\r\ncharacter is a guarantee which is valuable, and remember that\r\n_cleverness_ and _talent_, _without an honest heart and character_,\r\n_will never do for your Minister_. I shall name nobody, but what I\r\nsaid just now applies to some people you have recently seen.\r\n\r\nI am so happy that you enter into the important affairs which\r\nProvidence has entrusted to you with so much interest and spirit; if\r\nyou continue you will be _sure of success_, and your own conscience\r\nwill give you the most delightful and satisfactory feelings. To be\r\n_National_ is the _great thing_, and I was sure you would agree with\r\nwhat I said repeatedly to you on this _vital subject_, and you will be\r\ncertain in this way of the _love_ of the nation you govern.\r\n\r\nI recommend to your kind attention what Stockmar will think it his\r\nduty to tell you; he will never press anything, never plague you with\r\nanything, without the thorough conviction that it is indispensable\r\nfor your welfare. I can guarantee his independence of mind and\r\ndisinterestedness; nothing makes an impression upon him but what his\r\nexperience makes him feel to be of importance for you. I am delighted\r\nwith your plan. You will recollect that I pressed upon you repeatedly\r\nhow necessary it was for you to continue your studies on a more\r\n_extended_ scale, more appropriate to the station you were destined\r\nonce to fill. No one is better qualified to direct those studies for\r\nthe next few years than Stockmar, few people possess more general\r\ninformation, and very, very few have been like him educated, as it\r\nwere, by fate itself since 1816. There is no branch of information in\r\nwhich he may not prove useful--\r\n\r\n(1) History, considered in a practical and philosophical way; (2)\r\nInternational Law and everything connected with it; (3) Political\r\nEconomy, an important branch nowadays; (4) Classic studies; (5)\r\n_belles lettres_ in general; (6) Physical Science in all its branches,\r\netc., etc.--the list would be very long if I were to enumerate it all.\r\nThe _sooner_ you do this the better; in all countries and at all times\r\nmen like Stockmar have filled similar situations, even in the most\r\nbigoted and jealous countries, such as Spain, Austria, etc. You will\r\nhave him in this case _constantly near you without_ anybody having the\r\nright of finding fault with it, and to be useful to you he should be\r\nnear you. Stockmar would have the _immense_ advantage, for so young\r\na Queen, to be a _living_ dictionary of all matters scientific and\r\npolitic that happened these thirty years, which to you is of the\r\ngreatest importance, because you _must study_ the political history of\r\nat least the last thirty-seven years _more particularly_. I had begun\r\nsomething of the sort with you, even so far back as George II.; you\r\nwill do well to go through the reign of George III., and to follow the\r\nvarious circumstances which brought on finally the present state of\r\naffairs....\r\n\r\nMy letter grows too long, and you will not have time to read it; I\r\nwill therefore come to an end, remaining ever, my beloved Victoria,\r\nyour faithfully attached Uncle and Friend,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: SPANISH AFFAIRS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\n_3rd July 1837._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I had the happiness of receiving your kind letter\r\nof 30th June yesterday, and hasten to thank you for it. Your dear and\r\nkind letters, full of kind and excellent advice, will always be of the\r\ngreatest use to me, and will always be my delight. You may depend\r\nupon it that I shall profit by your advice, as I have already so often\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nI was sure you would be of my opinion relative to Lord Melbourne.\r\nIndeed, dearest Uncle, nothing is to be done without a good heart and\r\nan honest mind; I have, alas! seen so much of bad hearts and dishonest\r\nand _double_ minds, that I know how to value and appreciate _real\r\nworth_.\r\n\r\nAll is going on well at present, and the elections promise to be\r\nfavourable. God grant they may be so! I had a very long and highly\r\ninteresting conversation with Palmerston on Saturday, about Turkey,\r\nRussia, etc., etc. I trust something may be done for my sister Queens.\r\nThey have got a Constitution in Spain at length, and the Cortes have\r\ndone very well.

In\r\nPortugal, affairs look very black, I grieve to say. They have\r\nno money, and the _Chartists_ want to bring about another\r\ncounter-revolution, which would be fatal to the poor Queen's\r\ninterests, I fear.\r\n\r\nThat you approve my plan about Stockmar I am delighted to hear.\r\n\r\nI hope to go into Buckingham Palace very shortly after the funeral.\r\n\r\nNow, dearest Uncle, I must invite you _en forme_.

Then I should beg\r\nyou would stay a little longer than usual, a fortnight at _least_.

He said that he was quite sure that the Queen would find Lord\r\nMelbourne an honourable man, and one in whom Her Majesty might put\r\nconfidence; that he was a man apt to treat matters too lightly, or,\r\nas he expressed it, a _poco curante_, but in the main an honest and\r\nan honourable man. Upon my speaking to him of the kind and paternal\r\nconduct of King Leopold towards his Niece, he said that he was fully\r\npersuaded of this, and should at all and any time be ready to uphold\r\nit by his approbation, but that he had no immediate connection with\r\nthe Press, whose attacks indeed he held very cheap, though they were\r\nfrequently very offensive. He then asked me whether it was not true\r\nthat the Queen had thought of some reviews at which she would appear\r\non horseback. I said there had been some talk of it. He desired me to\r\nsay that he thought this would be very dangerous, that she had much\r\nbetter do this in an open carriage, as no one except such as himself\r\nknew how difficult it was to get steady riding horses, and besides\r\nthat, she could not be attended by any female, and that this would\r\nappear indelicate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: QUEEN ADELAIDE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Adelaide to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _7th July 1837._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST NIECE,--I must, before I leave this dear Castle, once more\r\nexpress to you the grateful sense I entertain for the kind treatment I\r\nhave experienced from you since it has pleased our heavenly Father to\r\nput you in possession of it.

Windsor requires thorough cleaning, and I\r\nmust say I could not think of going in sooner after the poor King's\r\ndeath. Windsor always appears very melancholy to me, and there are so\r\nmany sad associations with it. These will vanish, I daresay, if I see\r\nyou there soon after my arrival there.\r\n\r\nI have very pleasant large dinners every day. I invite my Premier\r\ngenerally once a week to dinner as I think it right to show publicly\r\nthat I esteem him and have confidence in him, as he has behaved so\r\nwell.

Having still a few moments before a special messenger sets off, I\r\ntake advantage of it to add a few words. By all I can hear, there are\r\nmany intrigues on foot in England at this moment. Princess Lieven[61]\r\nand another individual recently imported from her country seem to be\r\nvery active in what concerns them not; beware of them. A rule which I\r\ncannot sufficiently recommend is, _never to permit_ people to speak\r\non subjects concerning yourself or your affairs, without your having\r\nyourself desired them to do so. The moment a person behaves improperly\r\non this subject, change the conversation, and make the individual feel\r\nthat he has made a mistake.... People will certainly try to speak to\r\nyou on your _own personal_ affairs; decline it boldly, and they will\r\nleave you alone....\r\n\r\nNow I conclude with my warmest wishes for your happiness. Ever, my\r\ndear Victoria, your faithfully attached Uncle and Friend,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: The Princess Dorothea de Benckendorff married the Count\r\nde Lieven at fifteen; in 1812, he became Russian Minister (and later\r\nAmbassador) in London, whither she accompanied him. She was a woman\r\nof extraordinary cleverness, enjoying the confidence of George\r\nIV., Liverpool, Canning, Castlereagh, and Wellington. Inspiring the\r\nefforts, and even composing the despatches of her husband, she became\r\nherself the confidential correspondent of Nesselrode, Esterhazy, Posso\r\ndi Borgo, Guizot, and Lord Aberdeen. In 1834, the Lievens returned to\r\nSt Petersburg, where the Emperor Nicholas, though indifferent to the\r\nsociety of women of talent, showed her special marks of regard. Her\r\nhusband died at Rome, in January 1838, and she established herself\r\nin Paris, afterwards seeking a home in England during the troubles\r\nof 1848. Returning to Paris, her _salon_ became again the resort of\r\ndiplomatists, politicians, and men of the world. She died in January\r\n1857.\r\n\r\nMadame de Lieven about this time told Greville that she had had an\r\naudience of the Queen, \"who was very civil and gracious, but timid\r\nand embarrassed, and talked of nothing but commonplaces\"; and Greville\r\nadds that the Queen \"had probably been told that the Princess was an\r\n_intrigante_, and was afraid of committing herself.\"\r\n\r\nMadame de Lieven wrote to Lord Aberdeen on the 30th July 1837:--\r\n\r\nJ'ai vu la Reine deux fois, je l'ai vue seule, et je l'ai vue dans la\r\nsociété du soir, et avec son Premier Ministre. Elle a un aplomb, un\r\nair de commandement, de dignité, qui avec son visage enfantin, sa\r\npetite taille, et son joli sourire, forment certainement le spectacle\r\nle plus extraordinaire qu'il soit possible de se figurer. Elle est\r\nd'une extrême réserve dans son discours. On croit que la prudence est\r\nune de ses premières qualités. Lord Melbourne a auprès d'elle un\r\nair d'amour, de contentement, de vanité même, et tout cela mêlé avec\r\nbeaucoup de respect, des attitudes très à son aise, une habitude de\r\npremière place dans son salon, de la rêverie, de la gaieté, vous voyez\r\ntout cela. La Reine est pleine d'aimables sourires pour lui.\r\n\r\nLa société le soir n'était composée que du household de la Reine, de\r\ntout le household de la Duchesse de Kent (moins la famille Conroy, qui\r\nn'approche pas du Palais), et de quelques étrangers. La Duchesse de\r\nKent est parfaitement mécontente,--elle m'en a même parlé. Je doute\r\nque la mère et la fllle habitent longtemps sous le même toit. Quant\r\nà Lord Melbourne, il me semble que la Duchesse le déteste. Il est\r\névident qu'il est dans la possession entière et exclusive de la\r\nconfiance de la Reine, et que ses ressentiments, comme ses peines\r\npassées, sont confiés sans réserve à son Premier Ministre....]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PARLIAMENT PROROGUED]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\n_18th July 1837._\r\n\r\nMY BELOVED UNCLE,--...

I hear that the Levée went off very well, and I\r\nhave no doubt that the Drawing-Room did the same. Your _spirit_ in all\r\nthese new and trying proceedings makes me _happy beyond expression_.\r\nBelieve me, with _courage_ and _honesty_, you will get on beautifully\r\nand successfully. The firmness you displayed at the beginning of your\r\nreign will be for your quiet of the utmost importance. People must\r\ncome to the opinion _it is of no use intriguing, because when her mind\r\nis once made up, and she thinks a thing right_, no earthly power will\r\nmake her change. To these qualities must be added one which is of\r\ngreat importance, this is _discretion_; humble as it seems, it has\r\noften brought about successes in which talent failed and genius\r\ndid not succeed. Discretion in the great affairs of the world does\r\nwonders, and safety depends frequently and is chiefly derived from\r\nit....\r\n\r\nNow I must quickly conclude, with the prayer that you will _not\r\npermit_ anybody, be it even your Prime Minister, to speak to you on\r\nmatters that concern you _personally_, without _your_ having expressed\r\nthe wish of its being done. You have no idea of the importance of this\r\nfor your peace and comfort and safety.

His position is become extremely happy;\r\nafter having been, under the late King at least, in an awkward\r\nposition, he is now sure of enjoying your confidence and sincere\r\nsupport. If the elections turn out favourably to the Ministry, it\r\nwill, I hope, give them the means of trying to _conciliate_ the\r\ngreat mass of the _moderate_ Tories, who from their nature and in\r\nconsequence of their opinions are safe and desirable supporters of the\r\nCrown. The two extremes will give them trouble, and the ultra-Tories\r\nappear to me to be even the _more unreasonable_ of the two.\r\n\r\nI am most happy to see you on your guard against Princess Lieven and\r\nsuch-like people. Your life amongst intriguers and tormented with\r\nintrigues has given you an experience on this important subject which\r\nyou will do well not to lose sight of, as it will unfortunately often\r\n_reproduce itself_, though the names and manner of carrying on the\r\nthing may not be the same.\r\n\r\nI also think Windsor a little melancholy, but I believe that one likes\r\nit more and more, as the Park in particular is uncommonly beautiful.\r\nWe shall try our best to enliven it by our presence, and probably soon\r\nafter your arrival. I am most happy to see you so spirited and happy\r\nin your new position; it will go a great way to ensure your success,\r\nand your spirit and courage will never be _de trop_.\r\n\r\nNow I will conclude for the day, not to bore you, and beg you always\r\nto believe me, my dear and beloved Victoria, your devoted Uncle and\r\nFriend,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PRINCESS HOHENLOHE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Princess Hohenlohe to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLANGENBURG, _31st July 1837._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST VICTORIA,--On arriving here, I found your dear letter of\r\nthe 9th of this month; and some days ago I received the one of the\r\n16th.

For those who are\r\nnear you it is quite different than for me, who have not seen you yet\r\nin your new position, but must represent to myself all through the\r\nreport of others.

I should be _most_ happy to \"peep once\" into\r\nyour country, and wish that it _could_ be.\r\n\r\nWith respect to Politics, Lord Melbourne told me this morning that he\r\nthinks the Lords will be more moderate and reasonable next Session.\r\nThe Duke of Wellington made a speech shortly before the Dissolution of\r\nParliament, in which he said that _he wished as much as the Government\r\ndid to pass the questions now pending_.\r\n\r\nYou do not think Alexander[63] _near_ handsome enough in my opinion;\r\nyou know, ladies are much better judges.

He is such a good old soul, and greatly pleased that I go\r\non with him. I admire the music of the _Huguenots_ very much, but do\r\nnot sing it, as I prefer Italian to French for singing greatly. I\r\nhave been learning in the beginning of the season many of your old\r\nfavourites, which I hope to sing with you when we meet. I wish I could\r\nkeep Lablache to sing with us, but he will be gone by that time, I\r\ngreatly fear.\r\n\r\nNow farewell, my beloved Uncle.

But upon the whole we shall have as good a House as we\r\nhad, and, _I_ hope (as Lord Melbourne does also), a more moderate one\r\nthan the last one.

On\r\nthe other hand, the circumstances of the country do not present any\r\nextraordinary difficulty, and were any such to arise, the general\r\ncomposition of the new House of Commons affords a security that the\r\nmaintenance of the Constitution and the welfare of the country would\r\nbe permanent objects to the majority of its Members.[67]\r\n\r\nLord John Russell had some time ago the honour of stating to your\r\nMajesty that the return of Mr Fox Maule for Perthshire, and of Mr Hume\r\nfor Middlesex, were hardly to be expected. In this as in many other\r\ninstances the superior organisation of the Tory party have enabled\r\nthem to gain the appearance of a change of opinion, which has not in\r\nfact taken place.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell is sorry to add that bribery, intimidation, and\r\ndrunkenness have been very prevalent at the late elections, and that\r\nin many cases the disposition to riot has only been checked by the\r\nappearance of the Military, who have in all cases conducted themselves\r\nwith great temper and judgment.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 67: While the extreme Radicals were in several cases\r\n    defeated, the number of O'Connell's followers was decidedly\r\n    increased.

Lord Melbourne\r\nentirely partakes in the wish your Majesty has been graciously pleased\r\nto express that he had been there to witness the scene; but your\r\nMajesty will at once perceive that it was better that he was not, as\r\nin that case Lord Melbourne would have been accused of an attempt\r\nto take a political advantage of the general enthusiasm and to mix\r\nhimself and the Government with your Majesty's personal popularity.\r\nLord Melbourne fears that for some time your Majesty will find\r\nyourself somewhat incommoded by the desire, which naturally prevails\r\namongst all ranks and classes, to obtain an opportunity of seeing your\r\nMajesty....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _9th October 1837._\r\n\r\n... I have also told Stockmar to try to settle something for _regular_\r\nsafe communication; in quiet times like the present, one a week would\r\nbe sufficient. You know now that all letters are read, and that should\r\nnot be _always_ the case with ours. There is, however, one thing\r\nabout which I think it right to warn you. This way of reading people's\r\nletters is often taken advantage of by the writers of them, who\r\nare _not so ignorant of the thing as is imagined_ to write the very\r\nsubject which they wish to convey to the ears of persons without\r\ncompromising themselves. I will give you an example: we are still\r\nplagued by Prussia concerning those fortresses; now, to tell the\r\nPrussian Government many things, which we _should not like_ to tell\r\nthem _officially_, the Minister is going to write a despatch to our\r\nman at Berlin, sending it _by post_; the Prussians _are sure_ to read\r\nit, and to learn in this way what we wish them to hear. The diplomats\r\nin England may resort to this same mode of proceeding to injure\r\npeople, to calumniate, and to convey to your knowledge such things\r\nas they may hope to have the effect of injuring some people _they may\r\nfear_, in your eyes. I tell you the _trick_, that you should be able\r\nto guard against it; it is of importance, and I have no doubt will be\r\nresorted to by various political people.... Ever, my dearest Victoria,\r\nyour faithfully devoted Uncle and Friend,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: ENGLAND AND FRANCE]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LOUIS PHILIPPE'S POLICY]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: COUNT MOLÉ]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nTRIANON, _19th October 1837._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST VICTORIA,--... There is a great disposition here to be on\r\nthe best possible terms with England. As it has but too often happened\r\nthat the diplomatic agents of the two countries have drawn, or been\r\nbelieved to draw, different ways, I recommended strongly to Count\r\nMolé[71] to give strong and clear instructions to his people,\r\nparticularly at Madrid, Lisbon, and Athens.... He is going to read\r\nthem to Lord Granville, and also to communicate as much as possible\r\nall the despatches of the French diplomats to the English Government.\r\nThis will be a proof of confidence, and it will besides have the\r\nadvantage of giving often useful information, enabling thereby the\r\nEnglish Government to hear two opinions instead of one. It cannot be\r\ndenied that the idea that the Plenipotentiaries of the two countries\r\nwere following two different lines of policy has been hurtful to\r\nthe causes of the two Queens in the Peninsula. To put a stop to this\r\ndouble action is the only benefit which the Queens will at present\r\nderive from a better understanding between England and France; but as\r\nit is, it will be still of some importance to them, and take away from\r\nthe different political parties the possibility of using the pretended\r\nmisunderstanding against the Government of the Queens. I trust that\r\nyou will tell your Ministers to meet this friendly disposition with\r\nfrankness and kindness. The wish of the King here is, to have matters\r\nconcerted between the Plenipotentiaries of both countries. In this way\r\nit would become difficult for the parties in Spain or Portugal to\r\nsay that the two Plenipotentiaries support different candidates for\r\nMinisterial power, and the division in the parties connected with the\r\nQueens might be in this manner _prevented_ or _reconciled_. Many and\r\nmany are the ill-natured hints thrown out against the King's policy\r\nhere, and because he is clever, he is suspected of having _ambitious\r\nschemes without end_; it may not be without some importance to set\r\nthis, in your mind at least, to rights. Whatever may have been the\r\nKing's views immediately after the revolution of July[72] I will not\r\ndecide; perhaps he may a moment have wished to be able to do something\r\nfor France. Supposing this for the sake of argument to have been so,\r\ntwo months of his reign were sufficient to show him that the great\r\nquestion was not to conquer territories or foreign influence, but\r\nto save Monarchy. He saw clearly that though _he_ might begin a war,\r\nnecessarily it would soon degenerate into a war of propaganda, and\r\nthat he and his family would be the first victims of it. His struggle\r\nhas constantly been to strengthen his Government, to keep together or\r\ncreate anew the elements indispensable for a Monarchical Government,\r\nand this struggle is far from being at its end, and most probably\r\nthe remainder of his life will be devoted to this important task; and\r\nwhatever may be the more lively disposition of the Duke of Orleans,\r\ngreat part of his reign if he comes to the throne, and perhaps the\r\n_whole_ of it, will, _bon gré mal gré_, take the same turn. That it\r\nshould be so _is very natural_, because of _what use_ would be some\r\n_foreign provinces_ if they would only add to the difficulty of\r\ngoverning the old? Therefore, knowing as I do all the proceedings\r\nof the King and his Cabinet, even more fully than I do those of your\r\nGovernment; seeing constantly in the most unreserved manner the whole\r\nof the despatches; knowing as the nearest neighbour the system that\r\nthey constantly followed up towards us, I must say that no one is\r\nmore against acquiring influence in foreign States, or even getting\r\nburthened with family aggrandisement in them, than he. He rejected\r\nmost positively the marriage of Joinville with Donna Maria because he\r\nwill not have anything to do with Portugal. He rejects a _mille_ times\r\nthe idea of a future union of the Queen of Spain with Aumale, because\r\nhe will not have a son where it _is not_ his intention to support him.\r\n\r\nHis fear of being drawn into a real intervention has been the cause\r\nof his having been so anxious not to have a French Legion in Spain. He\r\nmay be right or wrong on this subject--I do not decide this, as I was\r\nof a different opinion last year; but his fear of being drawn too\r\nfar, like a man whose clothes get caught by a steam-engine, is natural\r\nenough. His dislike to the ultra-Liberals in the Peninsula is also\r\nvery natural, because they uphold principles of Government which\r\nrender Monarchy impossible, and the application of which to France\r\nwould be the ruin of the King. England, from the peculiarity of\r\nits position, can do many things which in France would upset\r\neverything.... I must close my letter, and shall answer yours\r\nto-morrow. God bless you! Ever, my dearest Victoria, your devoted\r\nUncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 71: French Premier and Foreign Secretary.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 72: 1830.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nPAVILION, BRIGHTON, _25th October 1837._\r\n\r\n... Now, dearest Uncle, I must speak to you _un peu de Politique_.\r\nI made Lord Melbourne read the _political_ part of your letter. He\r\nwished me to communicate to you part of the contents of a letter of\r\nLord Granville's which we received yesterday. Lord Granville complains\r\na good deal of Molé,[73] and says, that though he is apparently very\r\ncordial and friendly towards us, and talks of his desire that we\r\nshould be on a better footing as to our foreign Ministers than we have\r\nhitherto been, that whenever Lord Granville urges him to do anything\r\ndecisive (to use Lord G.'s own words) \"he _shrinks_ from the\r\ndiscussion,\" says he must have time to reflect before he can give any\r\nanswer, and evades giving any reply, whenever anything of _importance_\r\nis required. This, you see, dear Uncle, is not satisfactory. I merely\r\ntell you this, as I think you would like to know what Molé tells _our_\r\nAmbassador; this differs from what he told _you_. What you say\r\nabout Louis Philippe I am sure is very true; his situation is a very\r\npeculiar and a very difficult one....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 73: See _ante_, p. 93. (Ch. VI, Footnote 71)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE FRENCH IN AFRICA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nTRIANON, _27th October 1837._\r\n\r\n... Political matters I shall not touch upon to-day; there is nothing\r\nvery particular except the taking of Constantin.[74] The Duc de\r\nNemours has greatly distinguished himself. I am sorry to see that in\r\nEngland people are sometimes _sufficiently absurd_ to be jealous of\r\nthese French conquests. Nothing indeed can be more absurd, as nothing\r\nis of greater _importance to the peace_ of Europe than that a powerful\r\nand military nation like the French should have this outlet for their\r\nlove of military display. If one had named a council of wise men to\r\nfix upon a spot where this might be done with _the least mischief_ to\r\nthe rest of the world, one should have named the coast of Africa. By\r\ntheir being there they will render to civilisation a country which for\r\nabout 800 years has been growing worse and worse, and which was in the\r\ntimes of the Romans one of the richest provinces. It settles, besides,\r\nupon the French a constant _petite guerre_ with the natives, which is\r\nthe very thing that will do them good.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 74: The French losses amounted to 19 officers and 86\r\n    men killed, with 38 officers and 468 men wounded. The\r\n    French Government had failed in its efforts for an amicable\r\n    arrangement with Achmet Bey, and it appeared probable that the\r\n    Turkish fleet would also oppose them. The commander, however,\r\n    merely landed some men at Tripoli, and the French success was\r\n    complete.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _19th November 1837._\r\n\r\n... Now, dearest Uncle, before I say anything more, I will answer the\r\nvarious questions in your letter, which I have communicated to\r\nLord Melbourne and Lord Palmerston. (1) With respect to Ferdinand's\r\nquestion to you, it is impossible for _us_ to say _beforehand_ _what_\r\nwe _shall_ do in _such_ an _emergency_; it depends so entirely on the\r\npeculiar _circumstances_ of the _moment_ that we cannot say what we\r\nshould do. You know, dear Uncle, that the fleet has orders to protect\r\nthe King and Queen in case they should be in any personal danger. As\r\nto Lord Howard,[75] though what you say about him is true enough, it\r\nwould not do to recall him at present; it would give Bois le Comte[76]\r\nall the advantage he _wishes_ for, and which would be injurious to our\r\ninterests and influence.\r\n\r\n(2) With regard to Spain, a very decided mention is made of the\r\n_Queen_ herself in the speech which is to be delivered by me to-morrow\r\nin the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nWe have great reason to know that, of late, the Queen has positively\r\ndeclared her intention to remain at Madrid to the very last.\r\n\r\nVilliers'[77] conduct has been, I fear, much misrepresented, for his\r\n_own_ opinions are not at all those of the _ultra-Liberal_ kind; and\r\nhis _only_ aim has been, to be on good terms with the Spanish Ministry\r\nfor the time being.\r\n\r\n(3) Concerning France, I need not repeat to you, dear Uncle, how\r\n_very_ anxious we all are to be upon the _best_ and _most friendly_\r\nterms with her, and to co-operate with her.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 75: Lord Howard de Walden, British Minister at\r\n    Lisbon.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 76: French Minister at Madrid.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 77: British Minister at Madrid, afterwards fourth\r\n    Earl of Clarendon, and twice Foreign Secretary.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: CLOSE OF THE SESSION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _25th December 1837._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--... You will, I am sure, be happy to hear that\r\nthis Session is happily closed, and that the whole has gone off very\r\nsatisfactorily, much more so even than any of us could hope. I went\r\non Saturday to the House of Lords to give my Assent to the Civil List\r\nBill. I shall return to town on the 16th of January, when Parliament\r\nmeets again; it meets sooner than it was at first intended it should,\r\non account of the affairs of Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._[78]\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _26th December 1837._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST CHILD,--You were _somewhat irritable_ when you wrote to\r\nme!... Affairs stand now as follows: the studies at Bonn take the\r\nwhole of April, and may be concluded at the beginning of May. From May\r\ntill the end of August, if you approved of the visit, the time should\r\nbe _utilisé_. A _séjour_ at Coburg would _not_ be of much use; here\r\nwe are generally absent in the summer. To confide therefore the young\r\ngentleman to his Uncle Mensdorff[79] for three months, would give him\r\nso much time for some _manly accomplishments_, which do no harm to a\r\nyoung man. To make him _enter the Service_ would _not_ do at all. What\r\nyou say about his imbibing principles of a political nature, there\r\nis no great fear of that. First of all, Prague is not a town where\r\npolitics are at all agitated; these topics are very rarely touched\r\nupon; besides, Albert is clever, and it is not at the eleventh\r\nhour that anybody in three months will make him imbibe political\r\nprinciples. Perhaps you will turn in your mind what you think on the\r\nsubject, and communicate me the result of it....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 78: This letter refers to the course of study which\r\n    Prince Albert was about to pursue.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 79: Count Emmanuel de Mensdorff-Pouilly, who\r\n    married, in 1804, Sophia, Princess of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: CANADA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_27th December 1837._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and acquaints\r\nyour Majesty that he has this morning received a letter from\r\nthe Speaker[80] consenting to remain until Whitsuntide.

She omitted to ask Lord Melbourne when he\r\nthinks it would be convenient for Lord Palmerston to come down to\r\nWindsor for a few days, as it is the Queen's wish to ask him in the\r\ncourse of the Recess. The Queen is very thankful to Lord Melbourne for\r\nhis kind enquiries after her health; she is sorry to say she had one\r\nof her bad headaches yesterday, but feels very well this morning and\r\nthinks a drive will quite cure her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: ARMY ESTIMATES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Melbourne._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _29th December 1837._\r\n\r\nThe Queen received Lord Melbourne's two letters yesterday evening, and\r\nanother this morning, enclosing one from Lord Duncannon.[82] The Queen\r\nis very much gratified by the kind expressions in the letter she got\r\nlast night; she is grieved to see Lord Melbourne is so much oppressed\r\nwith business.\r\n\r\nThe Queen thinks Lord Melbourne has acted with the greatest judgment\r\nwith respect to Sir J. Conroy,[83] and highly approves the course he\r\nintends pursuing.\r\n\r\nThe Queen regrets that there should be so much difficulty with respect\r\nto the Report of the Army Estimates, but fervently trusts that no\r\nserious difficulties will arise from it; she will be very anxious to\r\ntalk about this and many other matters when she sees Lord Melbourne,\r\nwhich the Queen _hopes_ (as Lord Melbourne says nothing to the\r\ncontrary) she will do on the 3rd or 4th.\r\n\r\nThe Queen thinks that it will be quite right if Lord Melbourne writes\r\nto Lord John about the Staffordshire Yeomanry. The Queen will be\r\ndelighted to see Lady John Russell's little girl, and would be very\r\nhappy if Lady John was to bring the _Baby_ also. The Queen begs Lord\r\nMelbourne to invite them (Lord and Lady John) in her name on the 8th,\r\nand to stay till the 11th.\r\n\r\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are here, and the Queen is very\r\nsorry to say, that from what she _sees_ and _hears_, she has reason to\r\nfear all is _not_ as it _should_ be; _her_ mother is most _markedly_\r\ncivil and affectionate towards both the Duke and Duchess, and spoke\r\nPolitics with the former. The Queen will tell Lord Melbourne more\r\nabout this when she sees him.\r\n\r\nThe weather was beautiful yesterday, and the Queen had a _long_ drive\r\nand _walk_, which have done her great good; it is still finer to-day.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 82: Commissioner of Woods and Forests and Lord Privy\r\n    Seal.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 83: Sir J.

Lord Melbourne has not yet been able to leave London. In order to\r\nhave a chance of arranging these troublesome affairs it is necessary\r\ncontinually to see those who are principally engaged in them. From\r\na conversation which he has had this evening with Lord Howick, Lord\r\nMelbourne has better hopes of producing a general agreement upon\r\nCanadian affairs, but the question of the administration of the Army,\r\nwhich is of less immediate importance, is of more difficulty. Your\r\nMajesty knows the importance attached by the King of the Belgians to\r\nthis matter. The opinion of the Duke of Wellington is also strongly\r\nagainst the projected alteration. On the other hand, five Cabinet\r\nMinisters have pledged themselves to it by signing the report, and\r\nconsider themselves as having publicly undertaken to the House of\r\nCommons that some such measure shall be proposed. Lord Melbourne has\r\nasked for the opinions of Lord Hill[85] and Sir Hussey Vivian[86] in\r\nwriting. When Lord Melbourne receives them he must submit them to your\r\nMajesty with as short and as clear a statement as he can make of a\r\nquestion which is of a technical and official character, and with\r\nwhich Lord Melbourne does not feel himself to be very familiar. Lord\r\nMelbourne transmits a copy of the proposed Order in Council to carry\r\nthe recommendation of the report into effect, which will acquaint your\r\nMajesty precisely what the powers and duties are which it is intended\r\nto transfer from the Secretary of State[87] to the Secretary-at-War.\r\nIt is the more necessary to be cautious, because it can be done\r\nwithout taking the opinion or having recourse to the authority of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty will not suppose that Lord Melbourne by laying before you\r\nthe whole case has an idea of throwing the weight of such a decision\r\nentirely upon your Majesty. Lord Melbourne will deem it his duty to\r\noffer your Majesty a decided opinion upon the subject.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is much rejoiced to hear that your Majesty enjoys\r\nWindsor. The Duchess of Sutherland,[88] who appreciates both the grand\r\nand the beautiful, could not be otherwise than delighted with it....\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne has the pleasure of wishing your Majesty a happy and\r\nprosperous New Year.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 85: Commander-in-Chief.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 86: Master-General of the Ordnance.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 87: The Secretaries of State (then three, now five\r\n    in number) have co-extensive authority, that is to say, any\r\n    one of them can legally execute the duties of all, although\r\n    separate spheres of action are for convenience assigned to\r\n    them; at that time the administration of Colonial and Military\r\n    affairs were combined, the Secretary-at-War not being a\r\n    Secretary of State. After the Crimean War a fourth Secretary\r\n    was appointed, and after the Indian Mutiny a fifth was added,\r\n    entrusted severally with the supervision of Military affairs\r\n    and the administration of India.

On the accession of the\r\n    Queen, the Duchess of Sutherland became Mistress of the Robes,\r\n    a post which she held till 1841, and on three subsequent\r\n    occasions. The Duchess was a cultivated woman with many\r\n    tastes, and made Stafford House a great social centre. She was\r\n    deeply interested in philanthropic and social movements, such\r\n    as the Abolition of Slavery, and had a strong sympathy for\r\n    national movements, which she showed by entertaining Garibaldi\r\n    in 1864. She combined a considerable sense of humour with a\r\n    rare capacity for affection, and became one of the Queen's\r\n    closest friends; after the Prince Consort's death she was for\r\n    some weeks the Queen's constant companion.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\r\n\r\nTO CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Melbourne Ministry were able to maintain themselves in office\r\nduring the year (1838), but were too weak to carry important measures.\r\nThe prevailing distress led to much criticism of the Poor Law Act of\r\n1834, and the disturbances in Canada turned the tide of emigration\r\nto Australia. But public interest in politics was eclipsed by the\r\ngaieties of the Coronation, in which all ranks partook. The events\r\nof Imperial importance elsewhere centred in Jamaica and Canada, the\r\napprenticeship system in the former place leading to a renewal of the\r\nanti-slavery agitation at home, and the passing of a Colonial Bill for\r\nabsolute emancipation. The Canadian troubles brought about the passing\r\nof an Imperial Act for the suspension for two years of the Legislative\r\nAssembly of Lower Canada, and Lord Durham, an impulsive and\r\ngenerous-hearted man, was sent out as High Commissioner. Having\r\ndismissed the Executive Council of his predecessor, he nominated a\r\nfresh one, but an ordinance thereafter promulgated in reference to\r\nthe rebels was severely criticised. Lord Brougham, rejoicing at the\r\nopportunity of paying off old scores, castigated the Government,\r\nespecially Lord Glenelg, the Colonial Secretary, and carried a measure\r\ncensuring their Canadian policy. The Ministry disallowed the ordinance\r\nof Lord Durham, who, finding himself unsupported, resigned his\r\nCommission and returned home. On his arrival at Plymouth, he made a\r\nspeech, in which he described the rebellion as finally at an end;\r\nthe news, however, subsequently arrived that after his departure from\r\nCanada, disturbances had broken out afresh. Sir John Colborne was\r\nappointed to succeed Lord Durham with full powers.\r\n\r\nThe Civil War continued in Spain through the year, and intermittent\r\nrioting took place in Portugal, a country which was now verging on\r\nbankruptcy. The old Dutch and Belgian controversy as to the possession\r\nof Luxemburg was revived, the King of Holland, who had obstinately\r\nwithheld his concurrence for six years from the Articles on the faith\r\nof which King Leopold accepted the throne of Belgium, now showing\r\novert hostility in the disputed territory. As was natural, France was\r\nin sympathy with Belgium, and the two countries entered into a treaty\r\nof commerce and reciprocity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n1838\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_1st January 1838._\r\n\r\n...

Whatever may happen in the course of events,\r\nit will always be to Lord Melbourne a source of the most lively\r\nsatisfaction to have assisted your Majesty in the commencement of your\r\nreign, which was not without trouble and difficulty, and your Majesty\r\nmay depend that whether in or out of office Lord Melbourne's conduct\r\nwill always be directed by the strongest attachment to your Majesty's\r\nperson, and by the most ardent desire to promote your Majesty's\r\ninterests, which from his knowledge of your Majesty's character and\r\ndisposition Lord Melbourne feels certain will be always identified\r\nwith the interests of your People.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: CANADA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_14th January 1838._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has the\r\nhonour of acknowledging your Majesty's gracious communication, which\r\nhe received this evening. Lord Melbourne has this morning seen Lord\r\nDurham upon the subject of his assuming the Government of Canada,[1]\r\nand has had a long conversation with him. Lord Melbourne is to receive\r\nhis final answer before the Cabinet to-morrow, which meets at ten\r\no'clock. Lord Durham is anxious that your Majesty should express to\r\nhim your wish, or rather, as he phrased it, lay upon him your commands\r\nthat he should undertake this duty, and also that, as his absence will\r\nbe but temporary, that Lady Durham[2] should retain her situation in\r\nyour Majesty's household. Lord Melbourne thinks that your Majesty may\r\nproperly gratify him in both these points. Lord Durham made some other\r\nstipulations, which Lord Melbourne will explain to your Majesty, but,\r\nupon the whole, Lord Melbourne feels little doubt that he will accept.\r\n\r\nLord Glenelg[3] is on Monday to make a statement to the House of Lords\r\nupon the subject of Canada, on which a debate may not improbably arise\r\nby which Lord Melbourne may be detained. On Wednesday there is neither\r\nHouse of Lords nor Cabinet dinner. Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday will\r\ntherefore be festive days, on which Lord Melbourne will have great\r\npleasure in obeying your Majesty's commands and also on Monday, if he\r\nshould not be kept in the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne thinks it was prudent in your Majesty not to expose\r\nyourself to the cold of the Chapel. He is himself better, but has\r\nstill much cough, though he has kept himself very quiet and been very\r\ncareful of his diet since he has been in London.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: In the room of Lord Gosford.

I am very grateful for Lord Melbourne's\r\nkind recollection of me. I have a sincere regard for him, and I think\r\nthat our intercourse has satisfied him of one thing, that I have\r\nnothing so much at heart than your welfare, and what is for the good\r\nof your Empire. I wish very much that you would speak with him on\r\nthe subject of what ought to be done to keep for the Crown the little\r\ninfluence it still may possess. His views on this important subject\r\nare the more trustworthy as he always has belonged to the moderate\r\nLiberals, and therefore has had the means of judging the matter\r\nwith great impartiality. Monarchy to be carried on requires certain\r\nelements, and the occupation of the Sovereign must be constantly to\r\n_preserve these elements_, or should they have been too much weakened\r\nby untoward circumstances, to contrive by every means to _strengthen\r\nthem again_. You are too clever not to know, that it is _not_ the\r\nbeing _called_ Queen or King, which can be of the _least consequence_,\r\nwhen to the title there is not also annexed the power indispensable\r\nfor the exercise of those functions. All trades must be learned, and\r\nnowadays the trade of a _constitutional Sovereign, to do it well, is a\r\nvery difficult one_.\r\n\r\n... I must end, and remain ever, most affectionately, my dear Child,\r\nyour devoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Adelaide to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_24th January 1838._\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST NIECE,--Having just been informed of your gracious\r\nconsideration of, and your generosity towards, the dear King's\r\nchildren,[4] I must express to you how deeply I feel this kind proof\r\nof your attachment to the late King, whose memory you respect by the\r\ngenerous continuance of their former allowances from the Privy Purse.\r\nNothing could have given me more real satisfaction, and I trust and\r\nhope that they will prove their gratitude and entire devotion to you\r\nby their future conduct. Let me thank you, dearest Victoria, from the\r\nbottom of my heart, and be assured that the heavenly blessing of our\r\nbeloved King will be upon you for your generous kindness to those he\r\nloved so much in this world.\r\n\r\nI hope that you have not suffered at all from the severity of the\r\nweather, and are as well as all your subjects can wish you to be,\r\namongst whom there is none more anxiously praying for your welfare\r\nand happiness than, my dear Niece, your most devoted and affectionate\r\nAunt,\r\n\r\nADELAIDE.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: The eldest of the five illegitimate sons of\r\n    William IV. and Mrs. Jordan had been created Earl of Munster,\r\n    and his sisters and brothers had been given the precedence\r\n    of the daughters and younger sons of a Marquis.

I had a very brilliant Levée again yesterday, at\r\nwhich O'Connell and all his sons, son-in-law, nephew, etc., appeared.\r\nI received him, as you may imagine, with a very smiling face; he has\r\nbeen behaving very well this year.[5] It was quite a treat for me to\r\nsee him, as I had for long wished it.\r\n\r\nWe are going on most prosperously here, which will, I am sure, give\r\nyou as much pleasure as it does me. We have no fear for any of the\r\nquestions. Lord John Russell is much pleased with the temper of the\r\nHouse of Commons, which he says is remarkably good, and the Duke of\r\nWellington is behaving uncommonly well, going _with Ministers_, and\r\nbehaving like an honest man _should_ do....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: Ever since the Accession, O'Connell's speeches\r\n    had been full of expressions of loyalty, and he had been\r\n    acting in concert with the Whigs.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DEPARTMENTS OF STATE]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: BUREAUCRACY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSTANHOPE STREET, _25th February 1838._\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and with\r\nreference to your Majesty's question upon the subjects to which Lord\r\nWilliam Russell's recent despatch relates, he has the honour to state:\r\nthat in the Governments of the Continent, and more especially in those\r\nwhich have no representative Assemblies, the second class of persons\r\nin the public offices possess and exercise much more power and\r\ninfluence than the corresponding class of persons do in this\r\ncountry. In England the Ministers who are at the head of the several\r\ndepartments of the State, are liable any day and every day to defend\r\nthemselves in Parliament; in order to do this, they must be minutely\r\nacquainted with all the details of the business of their offices, and\r\nthe only way of being constantly armed with such information is to\r\nconduct and direct those details themselves.\r\n\r\nOn the Continent, where Ministers of State are not liable so to be\r\ncalled to account for their conduct, the Ministers are tempted\r\nto leave the details of their business much more to their\r\nUnder-Secretaries and to their chief clerks. Thus it happens that\r\nall the routine of business is generally managed by these subordinate\r\nagents; and to such an extent is this carried, that Viscount\r\nPalmerston believes that the Ministers for Foreign Affairs, in France,\r\nAustria, Prussia, and Russia, seldom take the trouble of writing\r\ntheir own despatches, except, perhaps, upon some very particular and\r\nimportant occasion.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty will easily see how greatly such a system must place in\r\nthe hands of the subordinate members of the public departments the\r\npower of directing the policy and the measures of the Government;\r\nbecause the value and tendency, and the consequences of a measure,\r\nfrequently depend as much upon the manner in which that measure\r\nis worked out, as upon the intention and spirit with which it was\r\nplanned.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance tends also to give great power to these\r\nsecond-class men, and that is their permanence in office.\r\n\r\nIn England when, in consequence of some great political change, the\r\nHeads of Departments go out, the greater part of the Under-Secretaries\r\ngo out also; thus the Under-Secretary (with two or three exceptions)\r\nhaving come in with his Chief, has probably no more experience than\r\nhis Chief, and can seldom set up his own knowledge to overrule the\r\nopinion, or to guide the judgment, of his superior.\r\n\r\nBut on the Continent, changes of Ministers are oftener changes of\r\nindividual men from personal causes, than changes of parties from\r\npolitical convulsions; and therefore when the Chief retires, the\r\nUnder-Secretary remains. There are consequently in all the public\r\noffices abroad a number of men who have spent the greater part of\r\ntheir lives in their respective departments, and who by their long\r\nexperience are full of knowledge of what has been done in former\r\ntimes, and of the most convenient and easy manner of doing what may be\r\nrequired in the time present. This affords to the Chiefs an additional\r\nmotive for leaning upon their subordinates, and gives to those\r\nsubordinates still more real influence.\r\n\r\nThis class of subordinate men has, from the fact of its being\r\npossessed of so much power, been invested by the jargon of the day\r\nwith the title of \"Bureaucratic\"--a name fabricated in imitation of\r\nthe words \"aristocratic\" and \"democratic,\" each being compounded of\r\nthe word \"cratic,\" which is a corruption from the Greek word \"kratos,\"\r\nwhich means power; and the prefix, denoting the particular class of\r\nsociety whose power is meant to be expressed. Thus \"_aristo_-cratic\"\r\nis the power of the upper, or, as in Greek it is called, the \"aristos\"\r\nclass of society; \"_demo_-cratic\" is the power of the people, which in\r\nGreek is called the \"demos\"; and \"_bureau_-cratic\" is the power of the\r\npublic offices or \"bureaus,\" for which latter the French name has been\r\ntaken instead of a Greek word.\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, to be the opinion of Lord William Russell, that this\r\nsecond class of public men in Prussia are animated by a desire to\r\nsee the general policy of their country rendered more national and\r\nindependent than it has hitherto been; that for this purpose they were\r\ndesirous of urging on the Government to take its stand against foreign\r\ninfluence upon some point or other, not much caring what that\r\npoint might be; that they thought it would be difficult to choose a\r\npolitical question, because on such a question the King of Prussia\r\nmight be against them, and that consequently they chose a religious\r\nquestion, on which they knew they should have the King with them;\r\nand that accordingly they led the Government on to a quarrel with the\r\nCourt of Rome, and with the Catholic or Austrian party in Germany,\r\nmore with a view to place Prussia in an independent national position\r\nthan from any particular importance which they attached to the\r\nquestion itself upon which the rupture was to be effected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_21st March 1838._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.

Lord Stanhope[6] made a long\r\ndeclamatory speech, very violent, but having in it nothing defined\r\nor specific, and was answered by Lord Brougham in a most able and\r\ntriumphant defence and maintenance of the late Act for Amending the\r\nLaws for the Relief of the Poor.[7]\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne was very sorry to be prevented from waiting upon your\r\nMajesty. He is very grateful for your Majesty's enquiries, and feels\r\nvery well this morning....\r\n\r\nLord Minto[8] told Lord Melbourne last night to acquaint your\r\nMajesty that Lord Amelius Beauclerck,[9] your Majesty's first Naval\r\nAide-de-Camp, intended to ask an Audience to-day of your Majesty,\r\nand that the object of it was to request that he and the other\r\nAides-de-Camp might wear sashes. This was always refused by the\r\nlate King as being absurd and ridiculous--as it is, particularly\r\nconsidering Lord Amelius's figure--and your Majesty had perhaps better\r\nsay that you can make no change.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne will be at St James's twenty minutes before ten.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: Philip Henry, fourth Earl.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: Before 1834 a great source of public abuse was\r\n    the out-door relief given to able-bodied paupers, either in\r\n    kind or money. The Act of that year was based on the\r\n    principle that no one must perish through the want of the bare\r\n    necessities of life. Poor Law Commissioners were established,\r\n    England was divided into Districts, and the Districts into\r\n    Unions. Out-door relief was to be given, on the order of\r\n    two justices, to poor persons wholly unable, from age or\r\n    infirmity, to work. But there was much opposition to the\r\n    new law; it was considered a grievance that old couples were\r\n    refused relief at home, and that the sexes must be separated\r\n    at the workhouse, to which the name of \"Bastille\" began to be\r\n    attached. In Devonshire it was even believed that the bread\r\n    distributed by the relieving officers was mixed with poisonous\r\n    ingredients.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: The First Lord of the Admiralty.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: A son of the eighth Duke of St Albans.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PRESSURE OF BUSINESS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _4th April 1838._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--_Vous ne m'en voudrez pas_, I sincerely hope, for\r\nnot having written to you sooner to thank you for your kind letter,\r\nwhich I received last week, but I really could not do so. As _honesty\r\nis the best policy_, I will tell you the simple fact. I have been out\r\nriding every day for about three hours, which quite renovates me,\r\nand when I come home I have consequently a good deal to do, what with\r\nseeing people, reading despatches, writing, etc. You will, I trust,\r\nnow quite forgive your poor niece, whom you so often call \"the little\r\nQueen,\" which is, I fear, true; but her _feelings_ of affection are\r\nnot so small as her _body_ is, I can assure you.\r\n\r\nThe Prince de Ligne[10] will be received with every possible\r\nattention, I can promise; it would have been so _without_ his being\r\nrecommended; his rank, and, above all, his being one of your subjects,\r\nwould of course entitle him to a good reception from me....\r\n\r\nThere is another _sujet_ which I wish to mention to you, _et que j'ai\r\nbien à c[oe]ur_, which is, if you would consult Stockmar with respect\r\nto the finishing of Albert's education; he knows best my feelings and\r\nwishes on that subject....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 10: He was appointed to attend the Coronation as\r\n    Minister Extraordinary from King Leopold.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_5th April 1838._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and is much\r\ndistressed that, being in the House of Lords, he was unable to answer\r\nyour Majesty's letter as soon as he received it. Lord Melbourne went\r\nto the Palace about half-past four, but learning from the porter at\r\nthe gate that your Majesty was not returned, went away thinking that\r\nthere was not left time to see your Majesty before the House of Lords.\r\nLord Melbourne is very much concerned that your Majesty should have\r\nhastened at all, and most earnestly requests your Majesty never will\r\ndo so upon his account. Lord Melbourne hears with great pleasure\r\nthat your Majesty has had a pleasant ride, and likes your horse.\r\nLord Melbourne is very well himself, and will wait upon your Majesty\r\nto-morrow morning about ten minutes before ten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: FAVOURITE HORSES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _10th April 1838._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I received your kind letter of the 5th on Sunday,\r\nand return you my best thanks for it. I shall, before I say another\r\nword, answer your question about the horses which I ride, which I do\r\nthe more willingly as I have got two _darlings_, if I may use that\r\nword. They are, both of them, _quite perfect_ in every sense of the\r\nword; _very handsome_, full of _spirit_, delightful easy-goers, very\r\nquiet, and _never_ shying at anything. Is not this perfection? The one\r\ncalled _Tartar_ (which belonged to Lord Conyngham), an Irish horse,\r\nis a very dark brown, a beautiful creature; the other, which Lord\r\nUxbridge[11] got for me, is called _Uxbridge_; he is smaller than\r\nTartar, and is a dark chestnut, with a beautiful little Arabian\r\nhead. I am afraid I shall have bored you with this long account of my\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\nI am going to Windsor to-morrow afternoon, and have got a great deal\r\nto do in consequence....\r\n\r\nPoor dear Louie[12] _lingers_ on, but, alas! I can only say _lingers_;\r\nshe does not gain strength. I cannot say how it grieves me, I am so\r\nsincerely attached to the good old soul, who has known me ever since\r\nmy birth. But I still entertain a hope that she may get over it.\r\n\r\nWe shall have a fortnight's respite from our Political Campaign.

Concerning the education of our friend Albert, it has been\r\nthe best plan you could have fixed upon, to name Stockmar your\r\ncommissary-general; it will give _unité d'action et de l'ensemble_,\r\nwhich otherwise we should not have had. I have communicated to him\r\nwhat your uncle and the young gentleman seem to wish, and what strikes\r\nme as the best for the moment. Stockmar will make a regular report to\r\nyou on this subject. They will return to Bonn at the beginning of May,\r\nand remain till the end of August.... I agree with this, as nothing\r\nenlarges the mind so much as travelling. But Stockmar will best treat\r\nthis affair verbally with you. The young gentlemen wished to pay me\r\nanother visit at the beginning of May, prior to their return to Bonn.\r\nNothing definite is, however, as yet settled about it. On one thing\r\nyou can rely, that it is my _great anxiety_ to see Albert a _very\r\ngood_ and _distinguished young man_, and _no pains will be thought too\r\nmuch_ on my part if this end can be attained....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n(_Undated._)\r\n\r\nYour Majesty will perceive by this box, which I received this morning\r\nbut had not time to open, that Marshal Soult, Duke of Dalmatia,[13]\r\nhas been appointed Ambassador to the Coronation....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 13: Soult entered the French army in 1785, and\r\n    became Marshal of France in 1804.

You will by this time have learnt the _sad_\r\nloss we have all sustained in the death of _dearest_, _faithful_,\r\n_excellent_ Louie, who breathed her last, without a struggle or a\r\nsuffering, on Sunday night at nine o'clock. I don't think I have\r\n_ever_ been so much overcome or distressed by anything, almost, as by\r\nthe death of this my earliest friend; it is the first link that has\r\nbeen broken of my first and infantine affections. I always loved\r\nLouie, and shall cherish her memory as that of the purest and best of\r\nmortals as long as I live! I took leave of her before I left London on\r\nWednesday, and _never_, _never_ shall I forget the blessing she gave\r\nme, and the grasp she gave my hand! I was quite upset by it! And I\r\nfeared and felt I should behold her on earth no more; it was, however,\r\na beautiful lesson of calmness and contentment and resignation to the\r\nwill of her God! Prepared as she was at every moment of her life to\r\nmeet her heavenly Father, she was full of hope of recovery, and quite\r\nunconscious of her approaching end. You will, I am sure, dearest\r\nUncle, feel the loss of this excellent creature; I cannot restrain my\r\ntears while writing this. One great consolation I have, which is, that\r\nI have been the means of making her last days as happy as she could\r\nwish to be, after having lost what she loved most!\r\n\r\n... Poor _Mason_, our faithful coachman for so many years, is also\r\ndead. These old servants cannot be replaced; and to see those whom one\r\nhas known from one's birth drop off, one by one, is melancholy! You\r\nwill think this letter a very sad one, but _I feel sad_....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Adelaide to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nMARLBOROUGH HOUSE, _17th April 1838._\r\n\r\n... I can well enter into all your feelings of regret at the death of\r\none so truly attached and so faithful as dear old Louie had been to\r\nyou from your infancy, and I quite understand your grief; yet I feel\r\nsure that you will also rejoice for her, that she has been relieved\r\nfrom her earthly sufferings. For _her_ the change of existence was a\r\nhappy one; good and pious as she was, we may trust that her state at\r\npresent is one of felicity and bliss through the redeeming grace of\r\nour Saviour....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE CORONATION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_17th April 1838._\r\n\r\n... The Parliamentary affairs will, please Heaven, continue to go on\r\nwell; I am more than ever bound to wish it, as I am not anxious to\r\nexchange my clever and well-informed friend Palmerston, with Lord\r\nAberdeen, for instance, of whose sweetness the Greek negotiation[14]\r\nhas given me very fair means of judging. Now I will conclude by\r\ntouching on one subject which concerns your great goodness to us.\r\nWhen we left England you expressed a wish to see us at the time of the\r\nCoronation, which was then believed to take place at the end of May.\r\nMore mature reflection has made me think that a King and Queen at your\r\ndear Coronation might perhaps be a _hors-d'[oe]uvre_, and I think, if\r\nit meets with your approbation, that it may be better to pay you our\r\nrespects at some other period, which you might like to fix upon. I do\r\nnot deny that having been deprived by circumstances from the happiness\r\nof wishing you joy at your birthday, since 1831, in person, I feel\r\nstrongly tempted to make a short apparition to see you, as seeing and\r\nspeaking is much pleasanter than ink and paper....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 14: Referring to the offer of the throne of Greece\r\n    to King Leopold in 1830.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _25th April 1838._\r\n\r\nMY BELOVED UNCLE,--... With respect to the happiness of seeing you and\r\nmy dearest Aunt, I shall now respectfully state my feelings. It would\r\nhave made me very happy to see you both at the Coronation, but I think\r\nupon the whole it is perhaps better you should not do so. Then, with\r\nrespect to your coming for my _old_ birthday, I must observe that I\r\ncould not enjoy you or my Aunt at all _à mon aise_. First of all, I\r\ncould not lodge you, and if one is not in the same house together,\r\nthere is _no real_ seeing one another; secondly, the town will be so\r\nfull of all sorts of foreigners that I should have _no peace_ to see\r\nyou and Aunt quietly. If therefore, dearest Uncle, it suits you and\r\nAunt Louise, would you come about the end of August, and stay with me\r\nas long as you can? I trust, dearest Uncle, _que vous me comprendrez\r\nbien_, and that you are assured of the great happiness it is for me to\r\nsee you at any time.\r\n\r\nSince I have written to you we have received from Lord Granville the\r\nnews of Marshal Soult's appointment as Ambassador for the Coronation,\r\nand of the Duc de Nemours' intention of coming here as a spectator.\r\nYou may be assured that I shall be delighted to see the Duke, as I\r\nalways am any of the dear French family. With regard to Soult, I\r\nam sure you are aware that whoever the King chose to send would be\r\nequally well received by me and the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE TRAIN-BEARERS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Melbourne._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _5th May 1838._\r\n\r\nThe Queen sends the papers relating to the Coronation as Lord\r\nMelbourne wished. The Queen also transmits the names of the young\r\nladies who she proposes should carry her train.

They are presented to your Majesty in this manner\r\nas a sort of privilege, instead of being presented at the Drawing-Room\r\nwith others, and your Majesty should conduct yourself towards them\r\nexactly as if they had been presented in the usual circle.

That\r\nthere is every disposition to make allowance for the difficulties\r\nof Portugal, but allowance must also be made for the feelings of\r\nthe people of England; that those feelings on the Slave Trade are as\r\nstrong as they are just. That England has made great sacrifices\r\nfor the suppression of that crime, that she has made sacrifices to\r\nPortugal, and that she has been extremely indignant at finding that\r\ntraffic so obstinately continued to be sheltered and protected under\r\nthe flag of Portugal. That Portugal must not expect that England will\r\nmuch longer refrain from taking effectual measures for preventing\r\nthese practices. That you have spoken thus openly because you wish\r\nthem to be aware of the truth, and that you entreat both the Queen and\r\nthe King to use their power and influence in procuring such a treaty\r\nto be concluded without delay, as will satisfy England and exonerate\r\nPortugal from the reproach under which she now labours.\r\n\r\nThis is the substance of what might be written.

Everybody was so\r\nkind and so friendly to me.\r\n\r\nWe have got a number of Austrians and Milanese here, among whom are\r\na Prince Odescalchi, and a Count Eugène Zichy, renowned for his\r\nmagnificent _turquoises_ and his famous valzing, a good-natured\r\n_élégant_; we have also Esterhazy's daughter Marie--now Countess\r\nChorinsky--a Count and Countess Grippa, and a Marquis and Marchioness\r\nof Trivalzi, etc.\r\n\r\nOld Talleyrand[16] is at last dead. I hear he showed wonderful\r\ncomposure and firmness to the last. He was one of those people who I\r\nthought never would die. Did you know what Pozzo said to somebody here\r\nabout him? He said he (Talleyrand) would not die yet, \"_parce que le\r\nDiable ne voulait pas l'avoir_.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16: Died 17th May, aged eighty-four.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: INDEPENDENCE OF BELGIUM]\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _2nd June 1838._\r\n\r\n... I have not all this time touched on our affairs, from motives of\r\n_great discretion_, but as the battle draws nigh,[17] I cannot very\r\nwell help writing a few words on the subject. I found an Article in\r\nthe French _Constitutionnel_ which paints our position in pretty true\r\ncolours. As it is not very long, I beg you to have the goodness to\r\nread it. You have given me so many proofs of affection, and your kind\r\nspeech at Windsor is so fresh in my memory, that it would be _very\r\nwrong_ in me to think that in so short a time, and without any cause,\r\nthose feelings which are so _precious_ to me could have changed. This\r\nmakes me appeal to those sentiments.\r\n\r\nThe independent existence of the Provinces which form this Kingdom has\r\nalways been an object of importance to England; the surest proof of\r\nit is, that for centuries England has made the greatest sacrifices of\r\nblood and treasure for that object. The last time I saw the late King\r\nat Windsor, in 1836, he said to me: \"If ever France or any other\r\nPower invades your country, it will be a question of immediate war for\r\nEngland; we cannot suffer that.\" I answered him I was happy to hear\r\nhim speak so, as I also did not want any foreign Power to invade\r\nus....\r\n\r\nAll I want from your kind Majesty is, that you will _occasionally_\r\nexpress to your Ministers, and particularly to good Lord Melbourne,\r\nthat, as far as it is _compatible_ with the interests _of your own_\r\ndominions, you do _not_ wish that your Government should take\r\nthe _lead_ in such measures as might in a short time bring on the\r\n_destruction_ of this country, as well as that of your uncle and his\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nEurope has enjoyed ever since 1833, in our part of it, a state of\r\n_profound peace_ and real happiness and prosperity. None can deny that\r\nthe measures which I adopted to organise this country have greatly\r\ncontributed to this happy state of affairs; this makes me think that\r\nthe changes which are to take place should be brought about in a _very\r\ngentle manner_....\r\n\r\nI am sorry to have you to listen to so much about politics, but it is\r\nnot my fault; I wished nothing so much as _to be left alone_. I shall\r\ndo all I can to bring about a good conclusion, but it must not be\r\nforgotten that these seven years _all the dangers, all the trouble_,\r\nfell constantly to _my share_....\r\n\r\nNow I will make haste to conclude, and remain ever, my dearest\r\nVictoria, your truly devoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 17: The execution of the treaty of 1831, called the\r\n    Twenty-four Articles, assigning part of Luxemburg to Holland,\r\n    had been reluctantly agreed to by Leopold, but the King of\r\n    Holland withheld his assent for seven years.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: ANGLO-BELGIAN RELATIONS]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PROGRESS OF BELGIUM]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _10th June 1838._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--It is indeed a long while since I have written to\r\nyou, and I fear you will think me very lazy; but I must in turn say,\r\ndearest Uncle, that your silence was longer than mine, and that it\r\ngrieved me, and _m'a beaucoup peinée_. I know, however, you have had,\r\nand still have, _much_ to do. Many thanks, my dear Uncle, for your\r\nvery kind letter of the 2nd inst....\r\n\r\nIt would indeed, dearest Uncle, be _very wrong_ of you, if you thought\r\nmy feelings of warm and devoted attachment to you, and of great\r\naffection for you, could be changed. _Nothing_ can ever change them!\r\nIndependent of my feelings of affection for you, my beloved Uncle, you\r\nmust be aware that the ancient and hereditary policy of this country\r\nwith respect to Belgium must make me most anxious that my Government\r\nnot _only_ should not be parties to any measure that would be\r\nprejudicial to Belgium, but that my Ministers should, as far as may\r\nnot conflict with the interests or engagements of this country, do\r\n_everything_ in their power to promote the prosperity and welfare of\r\nyour Kingdom.\r\n\r\nMy Ministers, I can assure you, share all my feelings on this subject,\r\nand are most anxious to see everything settled in a satisfactory\r\nmanner between Belgium and Holland.\r\n\r\nWe all feel that we cannot sufficiently or adequately express how much\r\nBelgium owes to your wise system of government, which has rendered\r\nthat country so flourishing in every way, and how much all Europe is\r\nindebted to you for the preservation of general peace; because it is\r\ncertain that when you ascended the throne of Belgium that country\r\nwas the one from which the occasion of a general war was much to be\r\nfeared; whereas now it is become a link to secure the continuance of\r\npeace; and by the happy circumstances of your double near relationship\r\nto me and to the King of the French, _Belgium_--which was in former\r\ntimes the cause of discord between England and France--becomes now a\r\nmutual tie to keep them together.\r\n\r\nThis, my beloved Uncle, we owe to you, and it must be a source of\r\npride and gratification to you.\r\n\r\nI perfectly understand and feel that your position with respect to all\r\nthese affairs is very difficult and trying, and the feelings of your\r\nsubjects are far from unnatural; yet I sincerely hope that you will\r\nuse the great influence you possess over the minds of the leading men\r\nin Belgium, to mitigate discontent and calm irritation, and procure\r\nacquiescence in whatever arrangements may ultimately be found\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\nYou are right in saying that I, though but a child of twelve years old\r\nwhen you went to Belgium, remember much of what took place, and I have\r\nsince then had the whole matter fully explained to me. The Treaty of\r\nNovember 1831 was perhaps not so advantageous to the Belgians as could\r\nhave been wished, yet it cannot have been thought very advantageous to\r\nthe Dutch, else they would have most probably urged their Government\r\nbefore this time to accept it; besides, when these conditions were\r\nframed, England was only one out of _five_ Powers whose concurrence\r\nwas required, and consequently they were made under very difficult\r\ncircumstances. This treaty having been ratified, it is become binding,\r\nand therefore it is almost impossible to consider it as otherwise,\r\nand to set aside those parts of it which have been ratified by all the\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nI feel I must in turn, dearest Uncle, entreat your indulgence for so\r\nlong a letter, and for such full explanations, but I felt it my duty\r\nto do so, as you had spoken to me on the subject.\r\n\r\nYou may be assured, my beloved Uncle, that both Lord Melbourne and\r\nLord Palmerston are most anxious at all times for the prosperity and\r\nwelfare of Belgium, and are consequently most desirous of seeing this\r\ndifficult question brought to a conclusion which may be satisfactory\r\nto you. Allow me once more therefore, dearest Uncle, to beseech you\r\nto use your powerful influence over your subjects, and to strive to\r\nmoderate their excited feelings on these matters. Your situation is a\r\nvery difficult one, and nobody feels more for you than I do.\r\n\r\nI trust, dearest Uncle, that you will, at all times, believe me your\r\ndevoted and most affectionate Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: FOREIGN POLICY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _June [18] 1838._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST AND MOST BELOVED VICTORIA,--You have written me a _very\r\ndear_ and long letter, which has given me _great pleasure and\r\nsatisfaction_. I was much moved with the expressions of truly felt\r\naffection, which it contains, and I shall _never_ again doubt your\r\naffection for me, but rely on your dear heart and the constancy of\r\nyour character.\r\n\r\nI will now tell you honestly that I had some misgivings; I did not\r\nexactly think that you had quite forgotten me, but I thought I had\r\nbeen put aside as one does with a piece of furniture which is no\r\nlonger wanted. I did not complain, because I fear if affection is once\r\non the decline, reproaches only diminish it the faster. I therefore\r\nsaid nothing, but in a life full of grief and disappointments like\r\nmine, the loss of your affection would have been one of the most\r\nsevere. It was in this point of view that the declaration made by\r\nLord Palmerston at the beginning of May to the Prussian Government\r\nchagrined me much.[19] It was premature, because the negotiation\r\nwas not yet renewed. It looked as if the English Government had\r\nbeen anxious to say to the Northern Powers, who always steadfastly\r\n_protected_ Holland, \"You imagine, perhaps, that we mean to have\r\n_égards_ for the uncle of the Queen; there you see we shall make even\r\nshorter work with him now than we did under our late master.\"\r\n\r\nThis impression had been _general_ on the Continent; they considered\r\nthe declaration to Prussia in this way: \"La Reine et ses Ministres\r\nsont donc entièrement indifférents sur le compte du Roi L.; _cela\r\nchange entièrement_ la position, et nous allons faire mains basses sur\r\nlui.\" From that moment their language became extremely imperious;\r\nthey spoke of nothing but acts of coercion, bombardment, etc., etc. I\r\nfirmly believe, because I have been these many years on terms of great\r\nand sincere friendship with Palmerston, that he did not himself quite\r\nforesee the importance which would be attached to his declaration. I\r\nmust say it hurt me more in my _English_ capacity than in my Belgian,\r\nas I came to this country _from England_, and was chosen _for that\r\nvery reason_. Besides, I am happy to say, I was never as yet in the\r\nposition to ask for any act of kindness from you, so that whatever\r\nlittle service I may have rendered you, remained on a basis of perfect\r\ndisinterestedness. That the first diplomatic step in our affairs\r\nshould seem by your Government to be directed against me, created\r\ntherefore all over the Continent a considerable sensation. I shall\r\nnever ask any favours of you, or anything that could in the least be\r\nconsidered as _incompatible_ with the interests of England; but you\r\nwill comprehend that there is a great difference in claiming favours\r\nand in being treated as an enemy....\r\n\r\nI will conclude my overgrown letter with the assurance that you\r\nnever were in greater favour, and that I love you dearly. Believe me,\r\ntherefore, ever, my best beloved Victoria, your devoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18: The day of the month is not given.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 19: Prussia was giving unmistakable evidence of a\r\n    disposition to support Holland against Belgium.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE CORONATION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Adelaide to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nMARLBORO' HOUSE, _28th June 1838._ (_At a quarter before 12 o'clock on\r\nthe Coronation Day._)\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST NIECE,--The guns are just announcing your approach to the\r\nAbbey, and as I am not near you, and cannot take part in the sacred\r\nceremony of your Coronation, I must address you in writing to assure\r\nyou that my thoughts and my whole heart are with you, and my prayers\r\nare offered up to Heaven for your happiness, and the prosperity and\r\nglory of your reign.

At half-past 9 I went into the\r\nnext room, dressed exactly in my House of Lords costume; and met Uncle\r\nErnest, Charles,[20] and Feodore (who had come a few minutes before\r\ninto my dressing-room), Lady Lansdowne, Lady Normanby, the Duchess of\r\nSutherland, and Lady Barham, all in their robes.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 20: Prince Charles of Leiningen, the Queen's\r\n    half-brother.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE ABBEY]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt 10 I got into the State Coach with the Duchess of Sutherland and\r\nLord Albemarle and we began our Progress. I subjoin a minute account\r\nof the whole Procession and of the whole Proceeding,--the route, etc.\r\nIt was a fine day, and the crowds of people exceeded what I have ever\r\nseen; many as there were the day I went to the City, it was nothing,\r\nnothing to the multitudes, the millions of my loyal subjects, who were\r\nassembled _in every spot_ to witness the Procession. Their good humour\r\nand excessive loyalty was beyond everything, and I really cannot say\r\n_how_ proud I feel to be the Queen of _such_ a Nation. I was alarmed\r\nat times for fear that the people would be crushed and squeezed on\r\naccount of the tremendous rush and pressure.\r\n\r\nI reached the Abbey amid deafening cheers at a little after half-past\r\neleven; I first went into a robing-room quite close to the entrance\r\nwhere I found my eight train-bearers: Lady Caroline Lennox, Lady\r\nAdelaide Paget, Lady Mary Talbot, Lady Fanny Cowper, Lady Wilhelmina\r\nStanhope, Lady Anne Fitzwilliam, Lady Mary Grimston, and Lady Louisa\r\nJenkinson--all dressed alike and beautifully in white satin and silver\r\ntissue with wreaths of silver corn-ears in front, and a small one of\r\npink roses round the plait behind, and pink roses in the trimming of\r\nthe dresses.\r\n\r\nAfter putting on my mantle, and the young ladies having properly\r\ngot hold of it and Lord Conyngham holding the end of it, I left the\r\nrobing-room and the Procession began as is described in the annexed\r\naccount, and all that followed and took place. The sight was splendid;\r\nthe bank of Peeresses quite beautiful all in their robes, and the\r\nPeers on the other side. My young train-bearers were always near me,\r\nand helped me whenever I wanted anything. The Bishop of Durham[21]\r\nstood on the side near me, but he was, as Lord Melbourne told me,\r\nremarkably _maladroit_, and never could tell me what was to take\r\nplace. At the beginning of the Anthem, where I've made a mark, I\r\nretired to St Edward's Chapel, a dark small place immediately behind\r\nthe Altar, with my ladies and train-bearers--took off my crimson robe\r\nand kirtle, and put on the supertunica of cloth of gold, also in the\r\nshape of a kirtle, which was put over a singular sort of little gown\r\nof linen trimmed with lace; I also took off my circlet of diamonds and\r\nthen proceeded bareheaded into the Abbey; I was then seated upon St\r\nEdward's chair, where the Dalmatic robe was clasped round me by the\r\nLord Great Chamberlain. Then followed all the various things; and last\r\n(of those things) the Crown being placed on my head--which was, I must\r\nown, a most beautiful impressive moment; _all_ the Peers and Peeresses\r\nput on their coronets at the same instant.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 21: Edward Maltby, 1770-1859.]\r\n\r\nMy excellent Lord Melbourne, who stood very close to me throughout\r\nthe whole ceremony, was _completely_ overcome at this moment, and\r\nvery much affected; he gave me _such_ a kind, and I may say _fatherly_\r\nlook. The shouts, which were very great, the drums, the trumpets, the\r\nfiring of the guns, all at the same instant, rendered the spectacle\r\nmost imposing.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: HOMAGE]\r\n\r\nThe Enthronisation and the Homage of, first, all the Bishops, and then\r\nmy Uncles, and lastly of all the Peers, in their respective order\r\nwas very fine. The Duke of Norfolk (holding for me the Sceptre with a\r\nCross) with Lord Melbourne stood close to me on my right, and the\r\nDuke of Richmond with the other Sceptre on my left, etc., etc. All my\r\ntrain-bearers, etc., standing behind the Throne. Poor old Lord Rolle,\r\nwho is 82, and dreadfully infirm, in attempting to ascend the steps\r\nfell and rolled quite down, but was not the least hurt; when he\r\nattempted to re-ascend them I got up and advanced to the end of the\r\nsteps, in order to prevent another fall. When Lord Melbourne's turn to\r\ndo Homage came, there was loud cheering; they also cheered Lord Grey\r\nand the Duke of Wellington; it's a pretty ceremony; they first all\r\ntouch the Crown, and then kiss my hand. When my good Lord Melbourne\r\nknelt down and kissed my hand, he pressed my hand and I grasped his\r\nwith all my heart, at which he looked up with his eyes filled with\r\ntears and seemed much touched, as he was, I observed, throughout the\r\nwhole ceremony. After the Homage was concluded I left the Throne, took\r\noff my Crown and received the Sacrament; I then put on my Crown again,\r\nand re-ascended the Throne, leaning on Lord Melbourne's arm. At the\r\ncommencement of the Anthem I descended from the Throne, and went into\r\nSt Edward's Chapel with my Ladies, Train-bearers, and Lord Willoughby,\r\nwhere I took off the Dalmatic robe, supertunica, etc., and put on the\r\nPurple Velvet Kirtle and Mantle, and proceeded again to the Throne,\r\nwhich I ascended leaning on Lord Melbourne's hand.\r\n\r\nThere was another most dear Being present at this ceremony, in the\r\nbox immediately above the royal box, and who witnessed all; it was my\r\ndearly beloved angelic Lehzen, whose eyes I caught when on the Throne,\r\nand we exchanged smiles. She and Späth, Lady John Russell, and Mr.\r\nMurray saw me leave the Palace, arrive at the Abbey, leave the Abbey\r\nand again return to the Palace!!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: POPULAR ENTHUSIASM]\r\n\r\nI then again descended from the Throne, and repaired with all the\r\nPeers bearing the Regalia, my Ladies and Train-bearers, to St Edward's\r\nChapel, as it is called; but which, as Lord Melbourne said, was\r\nmore _un_like a Chapel than anything he had ever seen; for what was\r\n_called_ an _Altar_ was covered with sandwiches, bottles of wine,\r\netc., etc. The Archbishop came in and _ought_ to have delivered\r\nthe Orb to me, but I had already got it, and he (as usual) was _so_\r\nconfused and puzzled and knew nothing, and--went away. Here we waited\r\nsome minutes. Lord Melbourne took a glass of wine, for he seemed\r\ncompletely tired. The Procession being formed, I replaced my Crown\r\n(which I had taken off for a few minutes), took the Orb in my left\r\nhand and the Sceptre in my right, and thus _loaded_, proceeded through\r\nthe Abbey--which resounded with cheers, to the first robing-room;\r\nwhere I found the Duchess of Gloucester, Mamma, and the Duchess of\r\nCambridge with their Ladies. And here we waited for at least an hour,\r\nwith _all_ my ladies and train-bearers; the Princesses went away about\r\nhalf an hour before I did. The Archbishop had (most awkwardly) put\r\nthe ring on the wrong finger, and the consequence was that I had the\r\ngreatest difficulty to take it off again, which I at last did with\r\ngreat pain. Lady Fanny, Lady Wilhelmina, and Lady Mary Grimston looked\r\nquite beautiful. At about half-past four I re-entered my carriage,\r\nthe Crown on my head, and the Sceptre and Orb in my hands, and we\r\nproceeded the same way as we came--the crowds if possible having\r\nincreased. The enthusiasm, affection, and loyalty were really\r\ntouching, and I shall ever remember this day as the _Proudest_ of my\r\nlife! I came home at a little after six, really _not_ feeling tired.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: INCIDENTS OF THE CORONATION]\r\n\r\nAt eight we dined. Besides we thirteen--my Uncles, sister, brother,\r\nSpäth, and the Duke's gentlemen--my excellent Lord Melbourne and Lord\r\nSurrey dined here. Lord Melbourne came up to me and said: \"I must\r\ncongratulate you on this most brilliant day,\" and that all had gone\r\noff so well. He said he was not tired, and was in high spirits. I\r\nsat between Uncle Ernest[22] and Lord Melbourne; and Lord Melbourne\r\nbetween me and Feodore, whom he had led in. My kind Lord Melbourne was\r\nmuch affected in speaking of the whole ceremony. He asked kindly if I\r\nwas tired; said the Sword he carried (the first, the Sword of State)\r\nwas excessively heavy. I said that the Crown hurt me a good deal. He\r\nwas so much amused at Uncle Ernest's being astonished at our still\r\nhaving the Litany. We agreed that the whole thing was a very fine\r\nsight. He thought the robes, and particularly the Dalmatic, \"looked\r\nremarkably well.\" \"And you did it all so well--excellent!\" said he,\r\nwith tears in his eyes. He said he thought I looked rather pale and\r\n\"moved by all the people\" when I arrived; \"and that's natural;\r\nand that's better.\" The Archbishop's and Dean's copes, which were\r\nremarkably handsome, were from James the Second's time; the very same\r\nthat were worn at his Coronation, Lord Melbourne told me. Spoke of the\r\nBishop of Durham's awkwardness, Lord Rolle's fall, etc. Of the Duc\r\nde Nemours being like his father in face; of the young ladies'\r\n(train-bearers') dresses; which he thought beautiful; and he said\r\nhe thought the Duchess of Richmond (who had ordered the make of the\r\ndresses, etc., and had been much condemned by some of the young ladies\r\nfor it) quite right. She said to him: \"One thing I was determined\r\nabout; that I would have no discussion with their Mammas about it.\"\r\nSpoke of Talleyrand and Soult having been very much struck by the\r\nceremony of the Coronation; of the English being far too generous\r\n_not_ to be kind to Soult. Lord Melbourne went home the night before,\r\nand slept very deeply till he was woke at six in the morning. I said I\r\ndid not sleep well. Spoke of the Illuminations and Uncle Ernest's wish\r\nto see them.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 22: The King of Hanover.]\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, before we sat down, we (that is Charles, Lord Melbourne,\r\nand I) spoke of the numbers of Peers at the Coronation, which, Lord\r\nMelbourne said, with the tears in his eyes, was unprecedented. I\r\nobserved that there were very few Viscounts; he said: \"There are very\r\nfew Viscounts,\" that they were an odd sort of title and not really\r\nEnglish; that they came from _Vice-Comités_; that Dukes and Barons\r\nwere the only _real_ English titles; that Marquises were likewise not\r\nEnglish; and that they made people Marquises when they did not wish to\r\nmake them Dukes. Spoke of Lord Audley who came as the First Baron, and\r\nwho Lord Melbourne said was a very odd young man, but of a very old\r\nfamily; his ancestor was a Sir Something Audley in the time of the\r\nBlack Prince, who, with Chandos, gained the Battle of Poictiers.\r\n\r\nI then sat on the sofa for a little while with Lady Barham and then\r\nwith Charles; Lord Melbourne sitting near me the whole evening. Mamma\r\nand Feodore remained to see the illuminations and only came in later,\r\nand Mamma went away before I did. Uncle Ernest drove out to see the\r\nIlluminations.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PAGES OF HONOUR]\r\n\r\nI said to Lord Melbourne when I first sat down that I felt a little\r\ntired on my feet; \"You must be very tired,\" he said. Spoke of the\r\nweight of the Robes, etc., etc., the Coronets; and he turned round to\r\nme with the tears in his eyes, and said _so_ kindly: \"And you did it\r\nbeautifully--every part of it, with so much taste; it's a thing that\r\nyou can't give a person advice upon; it must be left to a person.\"\r\nTo hear this, from this kind impartial friend, gave me great and real\r\npleasure. Mamma and Feodore came back just after he said this. Spoke\r\nof the Bishops' Copes, about which he was very funny; of the Pages who\r\nwere such a nice set of boys, and who were so handy, Lord Melbourne\r\nsaid, that they kept them the whole time. Little Lord Stafford and\r\nSlane (Lord Mountcharles) were pages to their fathers and looked\r\nlovely; Lord Paget (not a fine boy) was Lord Melbourne's page and\r\nremarkably handy, he said. Spoke again of the young ladies' dresses,\r\nabout which he was very amusing; he waited for his carriage with Lady\r\nMary Talbot and Lady Wilhelmina; he thinks Lady Fanny does not make as\r\nmuch show as other girls, which I would not allow. He set off for the\r\nAbbey from his house at half-past eight, and was there long before\r\nanybody else; he only got home at half-past six and had to go round\r\nby Kensington. He said there was a large breakfast in the Jerusalem\r\nChamber where they met _before_ all began; he said, laughing, that\r\nwhenever the Clergy, or a Dean and Chapter, had anything to do with\r\nanything, there's sure to be plen'y to eat.\r\n\r\nSpoke of my intending to go to bed, etc.; he said, \"You may depend\r\nupon it, you are more tired than you think you are.\" I said I had\r\nslept badly the night before; he said that was my mind, that nothing\r\nkept people more awake than any consciousness of a great event going\r\nto take place, and being agitated. He was not sure if he was not going\r\nto the Duke of Wellington's.\r\n\r\nStayed in the dining room till twenty minutes past eleven, but\r\nremained on Mamma's balcony looking at the fireworks in Green Park,\r\nwhich were quite beautiful.\r\n\r\nUncle Ernest, Charles, Feodore, and the Ladies and Gentlemen (like\r\nLehzen, etc.) saw me leave the Palace, arrive at the Abbey, leave the\r\nAbbey, and return to the Palace. Got a long letter from Aunt Louise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: EXTRA HOLIDAYS FOR SCHOOLS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Melbourne._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _29th June 1838._\r\n\r\nThe Queen is very anxious to hear if Lord Melbourne got home safe, and\r\nif he is not tired, and quite well this morning.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne will be glad to hear that the Queen had an excellent\r\nnight, is not the least tired, and is perfectly well this morning;\r\nindeed she feels much better than she has done for some days.\r\n\r\nThe Queen hears that it is usual to ask for an additional week's\r\nholiday for the boys at the various Public Schools, on the occasion\r\nof the Coronation.

The kind interest you take in\r\nme and my country (of which, and of the nation, I'm more proud than I\r\never was, since I've witnessed their excessive affection and\r\nloyalty to me) makes me certain that you will be glad to hear how\r\n_beautifully_ everything went off. It was a memorable and glorious day\r\nfor me. The millions assembled to witness the progress to and from the\r\nAbbey was _beyond_ belief, and _all_ in the highest good-humour. It\r\nis a fine ceremony, and a scene I shall _ever_ remember, and with\r\npleasure. I likewise venture to add that people thought I did my part\r\nvery well.\r\n\r\nThe amiable Duc de Nemours dined with me on Friday, comes to _my_ ball\r\nto-night, and dines again with me on Wednesday. Pray tell dearest Aunt\r\nLouise that I thank her much for her very kind letter, and will avail\r\nmyself of her kindness and _not_ write to her this mail.\r\n\r\nFeodore is writing in my room, well and happy. Uncle Ernest still very\r\nlame, and Charles well. There's an account of the family.

As your\r\nMajesty does not ride, the question is between driving down the line\r\nor not going down it at all,[23] and it appears to Lord Melbourne\r\nthat the first is the best, namely, to drive down; but if your Majesty\r\nfeels a strong repugnance, there is no more to be said.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne thinks it safer and more prudent that your Majesty\r\nshould not ride; but still it might have been done, and if Lord\r\nMelbourne had thought that your Majesty wished it much, he would not\r\nhave dissuaded it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: Referring to the Hyde Park review on the next day.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LOYAL DEMONSTRATIONS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nNEUILLY, _12th July 1838._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST VICTORIA,--I am very grateful for your kind letter; it\r\nis extremely _meritorious_, amidst such fatigues and festivities and\r\noccupations of every kind, to find a moment to write. I expressed\r\nalready the _great satisfaction_ with which I read and heard all\r\nthe accounts of the Coronation, and I believe that there _never_ was\r\nanything like it. The only one which in point of loyal demonstration\r\nmay approach it is that of George III., but I think it fell short of\r\nyours.\r\n\r\nI am happy to see that it has _increased_, if possible, your affection\r\nand attachment to your country, and this is in every respect a great\r\nblessing. You will remember that I have never varied on that subject,\r\nthe great thing is to be the _National_ Sovereign of your _own_\r\ncountry, and to love its very faults. This strengthens the _mutual\r\nattachment_, and that can _never be too strong_....\r\n\r\nBelieve me, ever, my dearest Victoria, your very devoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the family here offer their best _hommages_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nNEUILLY, _20th July 1838._\r\n\r\nI feel most grateful for your dear kind letter of the 10th inst.,\r\nwhich I received a few days ago. I hear that the review was something\r\n_most splendid_, and I feel always some regret at having been deprived\r\nof the happiness of seeing you _en fonction_, which you do in a degree\r\nof rare perfection.

The very\r\ndifficult and embarrassing situation in which Lord Durham and the\r\nCanadas and the Ministry are left by the vote of the House of Lords\r\nof last night, requires that a Cabinet should be held to-day, and Lord\r\nMelbourne has directed one to be summoned at two. Lord Melbourne will\r\nwait upon your Majesty either before that hour or after, about four\r\no'clock. The vote of last night and the Bill of Lord Brougham[24] is\r\na direct censure upon Lord Durham. Lord Durham's conduct has been most\r\nrash and indiscreet, and, as far as we can see, unaccountable. But to\r\ncensure him now would either be to cause his resignation, which would\r\nproduce great embarrassment, and might produce great evil, or to\r\nweaken his authority, which is evidently most undesirable....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 24: This Bill (which emphasised the illegality of\r\n    Lord Durham's ordinance) was read a second time by 54 to 36.\r\n    On the following day Lord Melbourne announced to the Peers\r\n    that Ministers had resolved to advise that the ordinance\r\n    should be disallowed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_10th August 1838._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs to\r\ninform you that the Cabinet have determined to advise your Majesty\r\nto disallow Lord Durham's ordinance, and to announce the same to the\r\nHouse of Lords.[25]\r\n\r\nThis is absolutely necessary, but very disagreeable, and will be very\r\nmuch so to Lord Durham.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 25: _See_ Introductory Note for the year, _ante_, p. 102.\r\n      (Introductory Note to Ch.

It\r\nwas most kind of you to have written so soon after our departure, and\r\nsuch an affectionate, good, kind letter. The tears came to my eyes\r\nas I read it, and I felt quite moved. Short as has been our stay,\r\nand great, as always, the pain of leaving you, it has been a _great\r\nhappiness_ for me to see you again, a happiness for which I shall\r\nalways thank God, you, and your dear Uncle. I need not add how _very\r\nprecious_ is your affection to me, and how _very grateful_ I am for\r\nevery new proof of it. You know my feelings on this point, and\r\nyou know they are better _felt_ than _expressed_. Your calling me\r\n_Louise_, and in such a kind way, gave me great pleasure. Almost all\r\nthose dear to me call me so, and I think it looks more affectionate;\r\nI would fain say now _sister-like_, although I am rather an old sister\r\nfor you now....\r\n\r\nLeopold is half crazy with the steam-engine, and particularly with\r\nthe _tools_ which you sent him. I enclose here the expression of his\r\ngratitude. I wrote exactly what he told me to write, and I did not add\r\na word. He has found again his kie (key), and he wears it suspended\r\nto his neck by a blue riband, with the Duchess's little seal. He felt\r\ndeeply the attention you had to have an _L_ engraved on each tool, and\r\nafter his letter was closed he charged me to thank you for it, and\r\nto tell you that it gave him great pleasure. An _iron spade_ was the\r\ngreatest object of his ambition, and he worked so hard yesterday with\r\nit, that I feared he would hurt himself with the exertion. He will go\r\nto-day to the races with us, in the Scotch dress which the Duchess had\r\nthe kindness to send him. It fits very well, and he is very proud of\r\nhaving a coat shaped _like that of a man_....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: IRELAND AND O'CONNELL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_25th October 1838._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty....\r\n\r\nMr Stanley of the Treasury[26] arrived in London yesterday, and\r\nacquaints me that Lord Normanby makes no secret of his willingness,\r\nand indeed his desire, to undertake the government of Canada. It\r\nwould have been better if Lord Normanby had acquainted Lord Melbourne\r\nquietly of this, and not made it at once public to all the world. It\r\nis not necessary to do anything at present. If Lord Durham remains,\r\nwhich Lord Melbourne does not, however, think likely, there will be\r\nno successor to be appointed, and if he returns, the authority of\r\nGovernor of Lower Canada will devolve upon Sir John Colborne,[27] in\r\nwhose hands it may be very safely left for the present.\r\n\r\nIf Ireland should be vacant, there is a strong feeling amongst many\r\nthat it would be nice to name the Duke of Sussex. It is said that it\r\nwould be popular in Ireland, that the name of one of the Royal Family\r\nwould do good there, and that it would afford to O'Connell a pretext\r\nand opportunity for giving up his new scheme of agitation. It is also\r\nadded that the Duke would suffer himself to be guided on all essential\r\nmatters by the advice of his Chief Secretary, and that he would\r\ncontent himself with discharging the ceremonial duties. Here are the\r\nreasons for it--your Majesty is so well acquainted with the reasons on\r\nthe other side, that it is unnecessary for me to detail them.\r\n\r\nI am afraid that times of some trouble are approaching, for which\r\nyour Majesty must hold yourself prepared; but your Majesty is too well\r\nacquainted with the nature of human affairs not to be well aware\r\nthat they cannot very well go on even as quietly as they have gone on\r\nduring the last sixteen months.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: \"Ben\" Stanley, afterwards Lord Stanley of Alderley,\r\nSecretary to the Treasury.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: Field-Marshal Sir John Colborne, afterwards Lord Seaton,\r\nhad been Military Secretary to Sir John Moore, had commanded a brigade\r\nwith much distinction in the Peninsula, and had contributed greatly to\r\nthe success of the British arms at Waterloo.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_4th November 1838._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is very well, but Sir James Clark,[28] a Scotchman and\r\na physician, and therefore neither by country nor by profession very\r\nreligious, detained him from Church in order to go through the report\r\nupon the state of Buckingham Palace. This is not a very good excuse,\r\nbut it is the true one. Lord Melbourne is very grateful to your\r\nMajesty for your enquiries, and having some letters to submit, will be\r\nhappy to attend upon your Majesty.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 28: Physician-in-Ordinary to the Queen.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DEATH OF LADY JOHN RUSSELL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _6th November 1838._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR UNCLE,--.... We have all been much distressed by the\r\nmelancholy and untimely death of poor Lady John Russell,[29] which\r\ntook place on the 1st. She was safely confined on the 20th of October\r\nwith a little girl, who bears my name, and seemed to be going on very\r\nwell; but on Wednesday she began to sink from weakness, not disease,\r\nand died at three o'clock on Thursday. It is a dreadful blow to _him_,\r\nfor he was _so_ attached to her, and I don't believe two people ever\r\nwere happier together. I send you his pretty letter to me, which I\r\nthink you may be interested to see; he is _dreadfully_ beat down by\r\nit, but struggles manfully against his grief, which makes one pity him\r\nmore. She has left four children by her first husband, _now orphans_,\r\nthe eldest a sweet girl twelve years old, and two little girls by Lord\r\nJohn; the eldest of these two is two and a half, and the youngest a\r\n_fortnight_. I had known her _very_ well and liked her, and I assure\r\nyou I was dreadfully shocked at it. You may also imagine what a loss\r\nshe is to poor Miss Lister, who has no mother, and whose only sister\r\nshe was. I fear, dear Uncle, I have made a sad and melancholy letter\r\nof this, but I have been so much engrossed by all this misery, and\r\nknowing you take an interest in poor Lord John, that I let my pen run\r\non almost involuntarily.\r\n\r\nWe have very good accounts of the Queen-Dowager from Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nPlease return me Lord John's letter when you have done with it.\r\n\r\nLord and Lady Howard[30] have been here, and I urged him to _bear_\r\nDietz as an inevitable evil, and I think he seems very anxious to do\r\nwhat is right. I have likewise written to Ferdinand, urging _him_ and\r\nDietz to be reasonable.\r\n\r\nWill you tell Aunt Louise that she will receive a box containing the\r\nLimerick lace dress (just like mine), which I lay at her feet. I\r\nfear, dear Uncle, you will think I'm making you my commissioner _de\r\ntoilette_, as in these two letters I have plagued you with commissions\r\non that subject....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 29: Daughter of Mr Thomas Lister.

I hail in you those simple and\r\nunaffected feelings which it contains. May you _always_ preserve that\r\ngreat warmth and truth of character which you now possess, and rest\r\nassured that it will be an ornament to you, and the means of finding\r\nthe same truth and warmth of feeling in others. Those who serve, from\r\nwhatever motive it may be, have always their eyes wide open on their\r\nsuperiors, and no qualities impose so much on them the necessity of\r\nrespect, which they _gladly avoid_, than a warm and noble character\r\nthat knows how to feel for others, and how to sympathise with their\r\nsorrows. I pity Lord John from all my heart, having always had for him\r\nsentiments of the sincerest regard. I fear that as a political man it\r\nmay prove also a severe blow. All depends on how he takes it, if he\r\nwill wish to forget his grief by occupying himself with political\r\nstrife or if his greater sensibility will make him wish to indulge it\r\nin solitude....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD JOHN RUSSELL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _12th November 1838._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I was certain you _would_ take interest in and feel\r\nfor poor Lord John; he is, I hear, still dreadfully shaken, and quite\r\nunequal to do any business at present. His chief consolation is in\r\nattending to the children.\r\n\r\nI felt much for you, and still more for poor dear Aunt Louise, when\r\nthe sad separation from poor Marie[31] took place; it is so melancholy\r\nto see a dear relation depart who is _so ill_.\r\n\r\nI have this morning heard from Ferdinand that the good Queen is\r\nat last confined, after keeping us for _two months_ and _more dans\r\nl'attente_ of the event. It took place on the 3rd, and Ferdinand\r\nwrites such a funny letter, saying, \"nous sommes tous bien heureux\r\nsurtout moi qui craignais que ce ne fût une petite fille ce qui m'eût\r\nété un peu désagréable, car en fait d'enfants j'aime mieux les petits\r\ngarçons, parce qu'ils sont plus gais et plus tapageurs.\"[32] Isn't\r\nthis very good?\r\n\r\nI believe the King of the French is to be godfather....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 31: See _post_, p. 144.

But Lord Melbourne will use\r\nevery effort in his power in order to keep the Administration together\r\nand to carry on the public service.

Solitude and retirement cherish and encourage grief.\r\nEmployment and exertion are the only means of dissipating it.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 33: Declining to join the Government.

Lord Durham, Lord\r\nMelbourne is convinced, exaggerates the peril in order to give greater\r\n_éclat_ to his own departure. The worst symptom which Lord Melbourne\r\nperceives is the general fear which seems to prevail there, and which\r\nmakes every danger ten times as great as it really is.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 34: The birth of an heir on 16th September 1837\r\n    conferred on Prince Ferdinand the right to the title of King.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 35: See _ante_, p. 131.

The\r\npresent moment being one of some importance--which may, if imprudently\r\nmanaged, cause great disturbances in the West of Europe, and exercise\r\na reaction on your own Government--I think it my duty to inform you\r\nof what is going on.\r\n\r\nI join a copy of a letter to Lord Palmerston. I should feel obliged to\r\nyou if you would read it _in the presence_ of good Lord Melbourne,\r\nin whose fairness and sense of justice I must say I feel great\r\nconfidence....\r\n\r\nI will not complain, only one subject I must touch upon as really very\r\nunfair. That your Ministers should take a line unfavourable to this\r\ncountry may be explained by their political position, but why should\r\nthey press so much on the French Government? I really see no cause for\r\nit.

Of course it is of vital importance for us to carry them all\r\nalong with us, and for that reason we press France.

You must not,\r\ndear Uncle, think that it is from want of interest that I, in general,\r\nabstain from touching upon these matters in my letters to you; but I\r\nam fearful, if I were to do so, to change our present delightful\r\nand familiar correspondence into a formal and stiff discussion upon\r\npolitical matters which would not be agreeable to either of us, and\r\nwhich I should deeply regret.

Lord Durham arrived yesterday\r\nevening, and Lord Melbourne has just seen Mr. Stanley, who has seen\r\nhim. He represents him as calm, but much hurt and vexed at the last\r\ndespatch which expresses your Majesty's disapprobation of his conduct\r\nin issuing the proclamation.[42] Lord Durham said that he should\r\nimmediately write an answer to it, in which he should state that he\r\nwould communicate to the Government all the information which he had\r\ncollected upon the state of the Canadas. That he should not ask an\r\naudience of your Majesty. This is his present decision. He may alter\r\nit; if he should, and through any channel request an audience, Lord\r\nMelbourne is now clearly of opinion that your Majesty should merely\r\nsay that an answer will be sent and the propriety of granting an\r\naudience may then be fully considered by your Majesty's confidential\r\nservants. Mr Stanley represents Lord Durham as not speaking with much\r\nviolence or asperity, but seeming to feel much the censure conveyed in\r\nthe last despatch.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty will receive from the Colonial Office a _précis_ of\r\nSir John Colborne's despatches. Nothing can be more honourable.

He will return to Windsor to-morrow....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 42: Lord Durham stated at Devonport: \"I shall, when\r\n    Parliament meets, be prepared to make a representation\r\n    of facts wholly unknown here, and disclosures which the\r\n    Parliament and people have no conception of.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_8th December 1838._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs to\r\nacquaint your Majesty that Lord Glenelg has this evening received\r\na letter from Lord Durham, tendering formally his resignation, and\r\nstating that his general report upon the affairs of Canada must be\r\ndelayed until the gentlemen connected with his Mission return from\r\nthat country, which they were to leave on or about the 20th of\r\nlast month, and therefore may be shortly expected here.

It\r\nis the want of a _Protestant church_ in this place which I mean.\r\nThere are so many English residents here, it is the seat of an English\r\nGovernment, and there is _not one_ church belonging to the Church of\r\nEngland.... The consequence of this want of church accommodation has\r\nbeen that the Dissenters have established themselves in considerable\r\nnumbers, and one cannot blame persons for attending their meetings\r\nwhen they have no church of their own.\r\n\r\nI address myself to you, as the head of the Church of England, and\r\nentreat you to consider well this important subject, and to talk it\r\nover with your Ministers and the Archbishop, in order to devise the\r\nbest means of remedying a want so discreditable to our country. Should\r\nthere be no funds at your disposal to effect this object, most happy\r\nshall I feel to contribute to any subscription which may be set on\r\nfoot, and I believe that a considerable sum may be raised amongst the\r\nProtestants of this island, where all parties are most anxious to\r\nsee a proper place of divine worship erected; without assistance from\r\nEngland, however, it cannot be effected. I therefore most humbly and\r\nconfidently submit this subject to you, dearest Victoria, who will\r\nbestow upon your Protestant subjects of this island an everlasting\r\nbenefit by granting them what they want most.[44]...\r\n\r\nI hope this will find you quite well and happy, and that I shall soon\r\nagain have the pleasure of hearing from you.

Lord Melbourne saw Mr. Stephenson this morning and learns from him\r\nthat the Duke of Sussex[45] is in the highest degree discontented at\r\nbeing informed decisively that there is no intention of sending him\r\nto Ireland. He is very loud against the Government, and is also very\r\nangry with Mr Stephenson, and the latter expects that he shall receive\r\nhis dismissal.... Mr Stephenson assures Lord Melbourne that he has\r\nmentioned this matter to no one but Lord Melbourne and Lady Mary,\r\nand it is of importance that it should be kept secret. Lord Melbourne\r\nthinks it his duty to apprise your Majesty of the feelings of the\r\nDuke, and of the possible origin of them.\r\n\r\nLord and Lady Holland return to London to-day and Lord Melbourne is\r\ngoing to dine with them.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 45: The Duke of Sussex was anxious to be appointed\r\n    Viceroy of Ireland.

Both his duty and his inclination would prompt him to do\r\nthis without a moment's delay, if he did not find it incumbent upon\r\nhim to represent to your Majesty the very important circumstances\r\nwhich require his presence for two or three days longer in London.\r\nThe session of Parliament approaches; the questions which are to be\r\nconsidered and prepared are of the most appalling magnitude, and of\r\nthe greatest difficulty. Many of your Majesty's servants, who fill\r\nthe most important offices, are compelled by domestic calamity to\r\nbe absent, and it is absolutely necessary that there should be some\r\ngeneral superintendence of the measures to be proposed, and some\r\nconsideration of the arrangements to be made.

Sir H.

I\r\nthink Brighton very agreeable at this time of the year, till the east\r\nwinds set in. It also gives the possibility of seeing people without\r\nhaving them on one's hands the whole day, as is the case in the\r\ncountry. The Pavilion, besides, is comfortable; that cannot be denied.\r\nBefore my marriage it was there that I met the Regent. Charlotte\r\nafterwards came with old Queen Charlotte. How distant all this\r\nalready, but still how present to one's memory.\r\n\r\nThe portrait of your Aunt and Leopold is nicely done. Don Leopoldo is\r\nlike, and has at times even a more intelligent look; he would amuse\r\nyou--he is very original and very sly. I often call him the little\r\ntyrant, because nobody knows so well _de faire aller le monde_.... My\r\nmost beloved Victoria, your devoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 46: Sir Hamilton Seymour, Minister at Brussels.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\r\n\r\nTO CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE chief political event of the year (1839) at home arose out of the\r\ntroubles in Jamaica. In addition to the apprenticeship question,\r\nthe state of the prisons, much overcrowded owing to the planters'\r\nseverity, had excited attention, and an Imperial Act was passed for\r\ntheir regulation. To this action the Colonial Assembly showed marked\r\nhostility, and, after the dissolution by Sir Lionel Smith, the\r\nGovernor, the new House was no more placable. Accordingly, the home\r\nGovernment brought in a Bill, in April, to suspend temporarily the\r\nJamaica Constitution, but on a division had a majority of five only\r\nin a house of five hundred and eighty-three. The Ministers therefore\r\nresigned, and Sir Robert Peel was sent for; a difficulty as to\r\nthe Ladies of the Household, commonly called the Bedchamber Plot,\r\ncompelled him to resign the task, and the Whigs, much injured in\r\nreputation, resumed office. Some changes took place, Macaulay joining\r\nthe Ministry, and Lord Normanby, who had succeeded Lord Glenelg at the\r\nColonial Office, exchanging places with Lord John Russell, the Home\r\nSecretary. The trial of strength over the Speakership ended in a\r\nvictory for the Ministerial candidate, Mr Shaw Lefevre, by a majority\r\nof eighteen in a house of six hundred and sixteen.\r\n\r\nPenny Postage was introduced by an Act of this session.\r\n\r\nThe Princes Ernest and Albert of Saxe-Coburg arrived on a visit to the\r\nQueen in October, and on the 14th the Queen's engagement to the latter\r\nwas announced by herself to Lord Melbourne. A few weeks later the\r\nQueen announced her betrothal at a meeting of the Privy Council.\r\n\r\nDuring the year risings in favour of the \"people's charter\" took place\r\nin various parts of the country, especially Birmingham and Newport,\r\nthe six points demanded being the ballot, universal suffrage,\r\nannual Parliaments, payment of members, the abolition of a property\r\nqualification for members, and equal electoral districts. At\r\nNewport one Frost, a linen-draper whom Lord John Russell had made a\r\nmagistrate, headed a riot. He was tried with his confederates by a\r\nspecial commission at Monmouth, and, with two others, sentenced to\r\ndeath; a sentence afterwards commuted.\r\n\r\nIn the East, war broke out between the Sultan Mahmoud and the Pasha of\r\nEgypt, Mehemet Ali, who had originally helped Turkey against Greece,\r\nbut had since revolted and driven the Turks from Syria. On that\r\noccasion (1833) Turkey had been saved by Russian intervention, a\r\ndefensive alliance, known as the treaty of Unkiar Skelessi, made\r\nbetween Russia and Turkey, and Mehemet granted Syria as well as Egypt.\r\nOn the revival of hostilities, Ibrahim, son of Mehemet, defeated the\r\nTurkish army on June 24; a week later the Sultan Mahmoud died, and\r\nthe Turkish admiral treacherously delivered over the Turkish fleet\r\nto Mehemet at Alexandria. Once more the four Powers (Great Britain,\r\nAustria, Prussia, and Russia) interfered to save the Sultan. The\r\nCzar accepted the principle of a joint mediation, the advance of the\r\nEgyptians was stopped, and the Sultan was informed that no terms of\r\npeace would be accepted which had not received the approval of the\r\nPowers. The terms were settled at a congress held in London. Mehemet\r\nrefused to accept the terms, and was encouraged by France to persevere\r\nin his refusal.\r\n\r\nThe dispute between Belgium and Holland as to the Luxemburg territory\r\nwas settled by a treaty in the course of the year. Lord Durham\r\npresented his report on Canada, a document drafted by Charles Buller\r\nbut inspired by Lord Durham himself; though legislation did not take\r\nplace this year, this document laid the foundation of the federal\r\nunion of the Canadas, and of the Constitution of other autonomous\r\ncolonies, but for the present the ex-Commissioner met with much\r\ncriticism of his actions.\r\n\r\nOur troops were engaged during the year against Dost Mahommed, the\r\nAmeer of Afghanistan, a usurper who many years earlier had driven\r\nShah Sooja into exile. Lord Auckland, the Viceroy of India, had sent\r\nCaptain (afterwards Sir Alexander) Burnes on a Mission to Cabul,\r\nand the Ameer had received him hospitably at first, but subsequently\r\ndismissed him from his Court. Lord Auckland thereupon resolved to\r\nrestore Shah Sooja, and in the autumn of 1838 issued a manifesto\r\ndethroning Dost Mahommed. Operations were accordingly directed against\r\nhim under Sir John (afterwards Lord) Keane, who, on August 6, 1839,\r\nentered Cabul and placed Shah Sooja on the throne. However open to\r\ncriticism, the news of this result was enthusiastically received in\r\nEngland, and Lord Auckland was promoted to an Earldom.\r\n\r\nIn China a dispute of long standing became acute. With the renewal of\r\nthe East India Company's charter, in 1834, the Chinese ports had been\r\nthrown open, and the opium trade became a source of great profit\r\nto private traders. In spite of the prohibition which the Chinese\r\nGovernment laid on importation of opium, the traffic was actively\r\ncarried on, and, as a result of the strained relations which ensued,\r\nCaptain Elliot, the British Chief Superintendent, requested that\r\nwarships should proceed to China for the protection of British life\r\nand property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n1839\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nPAVILION [BRIGHTON], _1st January 1839._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR UNCLE,--...

The Normanbys\r\nspent two nights here.[3] Lord Melbourne is the only person staying in\r\nthe house besides several of my Court and my suite, and, I am sorry to\r\nsay, is not very well; he has also had, I fear, too much business to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nLady Breadalbane[4] is my new Lady of the Bedchamber, and a very nice\r\nperson.

Your Majesty will have seen in the\r\nnewspapers that Lord Norbury was shot at in his own grounds and\r\ndangerously wounded.[5] Lord Melbourne learns to-day by a letter\r\nfrom Lord Morpeth that Lord Norbury is since dead. This is a shocking\r\nevent, and will, of course, create a strong sensation, much stronger\r\nthan the death in the same manner of several persons of inferior\r\ndegree. It is almost the first time that an attempt of this kind has\r\nbeen directed against an individual of that rank or station....\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne has seen Sir Henry Halford,[6] who says that his pulse\r\nis low and his system languid. He has prescribed some draughts, which\r\nLord Melbourne trusts will be of service, but he feels much depressed\r\nto-day. He dined yesterday at Lady Holland's, where he met Mr\r\nEllice,[7] civil and friendly enough in appearance, but Lord Melbourne\r\nfears hostile at heart, and a determined partisan of Lord Durham. Lord\r\nDurham has not yet made to Lord Glenelg the promised communication of\r\nhis report and plan, but it is said that he will do so soon....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: At Kilbeggan Abbey, County Meath.

It is a heavy dispensation, and one that it is\r\ndifficult to comprehend, but we must submit.\r\n\r\nI thought it best to write to my poor dear Aunt, for whom this will\r\nbe a sad blow; but I abstained from doing so to the dear Queen of the\r\nFrench just as yet. I have no letters, and only learnt the melancholy\r\nevent by the papers. Poor wretched Alexander! What a loss, what a\r\nchange for him, poor fellow!\r\n\r\n_You_ will, I am sure, regret that sweet amiable creature, as poor\r\nMarie was, very much, having known her so well, and her attachment to\r\nyou was great.\r\n\r\nI will not prolong this letter, but merely repeat _how_ much I feel\r\nfor you all, and beg you to believe me, your most affectionate Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: Princess Marie of Orleans, born 1813, sister to\r\n    the Queen of the Belgians, had married Prince Alexander of\r\n    Würtemberg, in 1837.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: HOLLAND AND BELGIUM]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _18th January 1839._\r\n\r\n... Your Aunt as well as myself are very anxious to be of use to poor\r\nAlexander.

He, besides, is\r\nsurrounded by people who are kind to him. Of George IV., then Regent,\r\nit was observed that for years he had not been in such good\r\nspirits than by the loss of his daughter.

Your Majesty will have seen by Sir Edward\r\nDisbrowe's[9] despatches that the concentration of Dutch troops\r\nmentioned in these reports was purely defensive, and was the\r\nconsequence of the military demonstrations previously made by the\r\nBelgians; and it appears, moreover, that the Dutch force is inferior\r\nin number to the Belgian force opposite to it; and that affords an\r\nadditional security against the chance of an invasion of Belgium by\r\nthe Dutch. It is, however, undeniable that when two armies are drawn\r\nup in face of each other, separated by a small distance, and animated\r\nby mutual hatred, the chances of collision become great and imminent.\r\nBut it is to be hoped in the present case that the communication made\r\nby the Conference to the two parties on Thursday last may avert danger\r\nof hostilities between the Dutch and Belgians.[10]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: Minister at the Hague.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 10: _See_ next letter.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: BELGIUM AND ENGLAND]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _7th February 1839._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR UNCLE,--I am much grieved to learn that poor Philippe[11] has\r\ngiven you such anxiety.

I hope to\r\nGod that I shall get news of Philippe's complete recovery to-morrow.\r\n\r\nI regret to hear that your Government gives you so much trouble,\r\nbut trust that you will exert all your influence, as you have so\r\nfrequently done, to persuade your Ministers to be reasonable, and not\r\nto resist the favourable offers made to the Government. _Everybody_\r\nhere is exceedingly anxious for the conclusion of these long pending\r\naffairs, and hope that the answer from Belgium will soon arrive.[12]\r\nYou will forgive me, dear Uncle, if I express to you my earnest hope\r\nthat these expectations may not be disappointed, for I feel that\r\nsince the Dutch have so instantly accepted the proposition of the\r\nConference, Belgium would suffer in the eyes of this country were she\r\nto delay, and, what I am still more fearful of, my beloved Uncle, you\r\nmight be blamed, and suffer for what your Government may do. You will,\r\nI know, forgive this freedom, which is prompted by my great anxiety\r\nfor your _welfare_ and _happiness_ (which I know you are well aware\r\nof), and for the preservation of the inestimable blessings of peace.\r\nNo one feels more for you than I do at this difficult moment, nor than\r\nI have done throughout these trying and embarrassing affairs. That all\r\nmay be peaceably and amicably settled is my earnest prayer.\r\n\r\nEverything went off well yesterday,[13] and we are again launched into\r\na political campaign, which it is impossible not to contemplate with a\r\ncertain degree of anxiety.\r\n\r\nAdieu! my dear Uncle.

Lord John Russell brought on\r\nthe question of the Civil Government of the Army, in a temperate and\r\njudicious manner, but Lord Howick made a most violent speech, strongly\r\ncondemning the whole of the present system and arraigning the conduct\r\nof the Treasury and other Departments, saying that he should not throw\r\nup his office because no measure was brought forward, but that, when\r\nquestioned upon the subject by Mr Hume in the House of Commons, as it\r\nwas certain that he would be, he should say that Government would do\r\nnothing upon the subject, until he (Mr Hume) compelled them, and that\r\nhe should express his entire disapprobation of the present system,\r\nand his reasons in detail for that disapprobation. Your Majesty will\r\nperceive that nothing could be more violent than this course. It was\r\nborne with great patience by the rest of the Cabinet, although Mr.\r\nRice,[14] against whom the greater part of Lord Howick's speech was\r\ndirected, felt himself most deeply hurt, and so expressed himself in\r\nprivate afterwards to Lord Melbourne. Upon the whole, Lord Melbourne\r\ncannot but consider that affairs are in a most precarious state, and\r\nthat whilst there is so much discontent fermenting within the Cabinet\r\nitself, there must be great doubt of Lord Melbourne's being much\r\nlonger able to hold the Administration together.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 14: The Chancellor of the Exchequer.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_10th February 1839._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and is very\r\nsorry that his communication has occasioned your Majesty so much alarm\r\nand uneasiness.

If that should be so, and if your Majesty should invite the\r\nDuke of Lucca to dine at the Palace before his departure, perhaps the\r\ninvitation might be made by note, instead of by card, as it was when\r\nthe Duke last dined at the Palace.

Nevertheless, I thought it\r\nbut right by them to send you these letters, and I have written to\r\nthem giving them little hope.\r\n\r\nThe French Ministry are gone, and I am sure the poor King will be much\r\nvexed by it. They talk of Broglie as Minister for Foreign Affairs,[19]\r\nbut I am afraid Thiers is inevitable. We are rather in fear of Thiers\r\nhere, but it is a pity that Louis Philippe should show so much dislike\r\nto a man he must take, for it will have the effect of a defeat.\r\n\r\nI have no time to add more, but to beg you to believe me, always, your\r\nmost affectionate Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18: Daughter of Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg, and\r\n    married in April 1840 to the Duc de Nemours.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 19: After a provisional Cabinet, in which the Duc de\r\n    Montebello was Foreign Minister, the King appointed a Ministry\r\n    with Soult as Premier and Foreign Minister.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DIFFICULTIES OF THE MINISTRY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_22nd March 1839._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs to\r\nacquaint your Majesty that the Cabinet have decided--\r\n\r\n1.

I regret to learn you are still not easy about\r\nyour own affairs, but trust all will now be speedily adjusted. You\r\nalways allow me, dear Uncle, to speak frankly to you; you will,\r\ntherefore, I hope, not be displeased if I venture to make a few\r\nobservations on one or two parts of your letter.\r\n\r\nYou say that the anger of the Belgians is principally directed against\r\nEngland.[24] Now, I must say you are very unjust towards us, and (if\r\nI could) I might be even a little angry with you, dear Uncle. We only\r\n_pressed_ Belgium for her _own_ good, and _not_ for ours. It may seem\r\nhard at first, but the time will come when you will see that we were\r\nright in urging you not to delay any longer the signature of the\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\nI think that you will see in this frank expression of my sentiments no\r\nwish to annoy or hurt you, but only an anxious desire to prove to you\r\nthat England is Belgium's sincere friend, and that my Government\r\nare ever desirous of doing what is in their power for the welfare,\r\nsecurity, and prosperity of yourself and your kingdom.\r\n\r\nI regret much the state of affairs in France,[25] which cannot but\r\nmake us all somewhat anxious; you will, I hope tell me what news you\r\nhear from Paris.\r\n\r\nPray, dearest Uncle, receive my best, my very warmest, wishes for many\r\nhappy returns of dear Leopold's birthday, and also, though somewhat\r\nlate, for Philippe's birthday.\r\n\r\nGive my love to my dear Aunt, and believe me, always, your most\r\ndevoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 24: He had written on 5th April:--\"The feeling is\r\n    strongest against England, in which the people expected to\r\n    see a support, and only found a strong determination to decide\r\n    _everything against them_ and at _their expense_.

We were\r\nparticularly fortunate that day, as the brightest sunshine heightened\r\nits picturesque effects beyond description. We found old Rome very\r\nfull, and to see it and its ecclesiastic governors to advantage, the\r\nHoly Week is certainly the properest time. From morning to noon the\r\nPrince was at seeing sights, and he made so good a use of his time,\r\nthat I don't think that something really remarkable was left unseen.\r\nUpon this very principle, we paid our respects to the Holy Father,[26]\r\nof which interview the Prince made so admirable a sketch, so very\r\nworthy of H.B.,[27] that I am very much tempted to send it for the\r\ninspection of your Majesty. We assisted at the Church ceremonies of\r\nthe Holy Week from the beginning to the end.

But the fact is,\r\nthat certainly your Government have taken the lead in maintaining a\r\ncondition which time had rendered difficult to comply with. Physicians\r\nwill tell you that often an operation, which might have been performed\r\nat one time, could not, without great danger for the patient, be\r\nundertaken some years later. We have not been listened to, and\r\narrangements _are forced_ on us, in themselves full of seeds of\r\ndanger, when by consulting the _real interests_ of Holland and\r\nBelgium, both countries might have been placed on a footing of\r\n_sincere peace_ and good neighbourhood. This country feels now humbled\r\nand _désenchanté_ with its _soi-disant_ political independence as it\r\npleased the Conference to settle it. They will take a dislike to a\r\npolitical state which _wounds their vanity_, and will, in consequence\r\nof this, _not wish it to continue_. Two things will happen, therefore,\r\non the very first opportunity, either that this country will\r\nbe involved in war to better a position which it thinks _too\r\nhumiliating_, or that it will voluntarily throw up a nominal\r\nindependence in which it is now hemmed in between France and Holland,\r\nwhich begins on the North Sea, and ends, of all the things in this\r\nworld, on _the Moselle_!\r\n\r\nI think old Pirson, who said in the Chamber that if the treaty was\r\ncarried into execution I was likely to be the first and last King\r\nof the country, was not wrong. Whenever this will happen, it will be\r\n_very awkward_ for England, and _deservedly so_. To see, after eight\r\nyears of hard work, blooming and thriving political plantations cut\r\nand maimed, and that by those who have a real interest to protect\r\nthem, is very melancholy. I do not say these things with the most\r\ndistant idea of bringing about any change, but only because in the\r\nhigh and very responsible position in which Providence has placed\r\nyou, it is good to tell you the truth, as you ought to have weight\r\nand influence on the affairs of Europe; and England, not being in\r\nthe possibility of making territorial acquisition, has a real and\r\npermanent interest in the proper maintenance of a balance of political\r\npower in Europe.

Though you seem not to dislike my political\r\nsparks, I think it is better not to increase them, as they might\r\nfinally take fire, particularly as I see with regret that upon this\r\none subject we cannot agree. I shall therefore limit myself to my\r\nexpressions of very sincere wishes for the welfare and prosperity of\r\nBelgium.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Duke,[29] after a long delay, is at length to arrive on\r\nFriday night; I shall put myself out of my way in order to be very\r\ncivil to such a great personage.

Lord Melbourne\r\nis certain that your Majesty will not deem him too presuming if\r\nhe expresses his fear that this decision will be both painful and\r\nembarrassing to your Majesty, but your Majesty will meet this crisis\r\nwith that firmness which belongs to your character, and with that\r\nrectitude and sincerity which will carry your Majesty through all\r\ndifficulties. It will also be greatly painful to Lord Melbourne to\r\nquit the service of a Mistress who has treated him with such unvarying\r\nkindness and unlimited confidence; but in whatever station he may be\r\nplaced, he will always feel the deepest anxiety for your Majesty's\r\ninterests and happiness, and will do the utmost in his power to\r\npromote and secure them.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 30: The numbers are apparently incorrectly stated.\r\n    The division was 294 to 289.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: RESIGNATION IMMINENT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_7th May 1839._\r\n\r\nThe present circumstances have been for some time so probable, or\r\nrather so certain, that Lord Melbourne has naturally been led to weigh\r\nand consider maturely the advice which, if called upon, he should\r\ntender to your Majesty when they did arrive. That advice is, at once\r\nto send for the Duke of Wellington. Your Majesty appears to Lord\r\nMelbourne to have no other alternative. The Radicals have neither\r\nability, honesty, nor numbers. They have no leaders of any character.\r\nLord Durham was raised, one hardly knows how, into something of a\r\nfactitious importance by his own extreme opinions, by the panegyrics\r\nof those who thought he would serve them as an instrument, and by the\r\nmanagement of the Press, but any little public reputation which he\r\nmight once have acquired has been entirely dissipated and destroyed by\r\nthe continued folly of his conduct in his Canadian Government. There\r\nis no party in the State to which your Majesty can now resort, except\r\nthat great party which calls itself Conservative, and of that party,\r\nhis rank, station, reputation, and experience point out the Duke of\r\nWellington as the person to whom your Majesty should apply.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne therefore advises that your Majesty should send for the\r\nDuke of Wellington, and should acquaint him, provided your Majesty so\r\nfeels, that you were entirely satisfied with your late Government, and\r\nthat you part from them with reluctance; but that as he and the party\r\nof which he is the head have been the means of removing them from\r\noffice, you naturally look to him to advise you as to the means of\r\nsupplying their places and carrying on the business of the country.\r\n\r\nIf the Duke should be unwilling to form the Government himself, and\r\nshould desire to devolve the task upon Sir Robert Peel, Lord Melbourne\r\nwould advise your Majesty to accede to that suggestion; but Lord\r\nMelbourne would counsel your Majesty to be very unwilling to suffer\r\nthe Government to be formed by Sir Robert Peel, without the active\r\nassistance in office of the Duke of Wellington.\r\n\r\nWith respect both to measures and appointments, your Majesty should\r\nplace the fullest confidence in those to whom you entrust the\r\nmanagement of affairs, exercising at the same time, and fully\r\nexpressing, your own judgment upon both.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty will do well to be from the beginning very vigilant that\r\nall measures and all appointments are stated to your Majesty in the\r\nfirst instance, and your Majesty's pleasure taken thereon previously\r\nto any instruments being drawn out for carrying them into effect, and\r\nsubmitted to your Majesty's signature. It is the more necessary to be\r\nwatchful and active in this respect, as the extreme confidence which\r\nyour Majesty has reposed in me may have led to some omission at times\r\nof these most necessary preliminaries.\r\n\r\nThe patronage of the Lord Chamberlain's Department is of the greatest\r\nimportance, and may be made to conduce at once to the beneficial\r\ninfluence of the Crown, and to the elevation and encouragement of the\r\nprofessions of the Church and of Medicine. This patronage, by being\r\nleft to the uncontrolled exercise of successive Lord Chamberlains, has\r\nbeen administered not only wastefully but perniciously. The physicians\r\nto the late King were many of them men of little eminence; the\r\nchaplains are still a sorry set. Your Majesty should insist with the\r\nnew Ministers that this patronage should be disposed of, not by the\r\nLord Chamberlain, but, as it has hitherto been during your Majesty's\r\nreign, by your Majesty upon consultation with your Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DISTRESS OF THE QUEEN]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Melbourne._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _9th May 1839._\r\n\r\nThe Queen thinks Lord Melbourne may possibly wish to know how she\r\nis this morning; the Queen is somewhat calmer; she was in a wretched\r\nstate till nine o'clock last night, when she tried to occupy herself\r\nand try to think less gloomily of this dreadful change, and she\r\nsucceeded in calming herself till she went to bed at twelve, and she\r\nslept well; but on waking this morning, all--all that had happened\r\nin one short eventful day came most forcibly to her mind, and brought\r\nback her grief; the Queen, however, feels better now; but she couldn't\r\ntouch a morsel of food last night, nor can she this morning. The Queen\r\ntrusts Lord Melbourne slept well, and is well this morning; and that\r\nhe will come precisely at eleven o'clock. The Queen has received no\r\nanswer from the Duke, which is very odd, for she knows he got her\r\nletter. The Queen hopes Lord Melbourne received her letter last night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_8th May 1839._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and is\r\nmuch grieved that he did not answer your Majesty's letter yesterday\r\nevening, as your Majesty desired, but he did not get it till late, and\r\nhe felt much tired and harassed by all that had passed during the day.\r\nThe situation is very painful, but it is necessary for your Majesty to\r\nbe prudent and firm. It is of all things necessary not to be suspected\r\nof any unfair dealing. Whilst Lord Melbourne holds his office,\r\neverything of course may be written to him as usual; but still the\r\nresolutions for the formation of the new Government will now commence,\r\nand it will never do, whilst they are going on, either for appearance\r\nor in reality, that Lord Melbourne should dine with your Majesty, as\r\nhe did before this disturbance. It would create feeling, possibly lead\r\nto remonstrance, and throw a doubt upon the fairness and integrity\r\nof your Majesty's conduct. All this is very painful both to do and to\r\nsay, but it is unavoidable; it must be said, and it must be done. Lord\r\nMelbourne will wait upon your Majesty at eleven.[31]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 31: Lord Melbourne had made the not unnatural\r\n    mistake of recommending to the Queen, as members of her first\r\n    Household, ladies who were nearly related to himself and his\r\n    Whig colleagues. No doubt these were the ladies whom he knew\r\n    best, and in whom he had entire confidence; but he ought to\r\n    have had sufficient prescience to see that the Queen would\r\n    probably form strong attachments to the ladies who first\r\n    served her: and that if the appointments had not in the first\r\n    instance a political complexion, yet that the Whig tendencies\r\n    which these Ladies represented were likely to affect the\r\n    Queen, in the direction of allying her closely with a\r\n    particular party in the State.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: SIR ROBERT PEEL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Melbourne._\r\n\r\n_8th May 1839._\r\n\r\nThe Queen told Lord Melbourne she would give him an account of what\r\npassed, which she is _very_ anxious to do. She saw the Duke for about\r\ntwenty minutes; the Queen said she supposed he knew why she sent for\r\nhim, upon which the Duke said, No, he had no idea. The Queen then said\r\nthat she had had the greatest confidence in her late Ministry, and\r\nhad parted with them with the greatest reluctance; upon which the Duke\r\nobserved that he could assure me no one felt more pain in hearing the\r\nannouncement of their resignation than he did, and that he was deeply\r\ngrieved at it. The Queen then continued, that as his party had been\r\ninstrumental in removing them, that she must look to him to form a\r\nnew Government. The Duke answered that he had no power whatever in\r\nthe House of Commons, \"that if he was to say black was white,[32] they\r\nwould say it was not,\" and that he advised me to send for Sir Robert\r\nPeel, in whom I could place confidence, and who was a gentleman and a\r\nman of honour and integrity. The Queen then said she hoped he would at\r\nall events have a place in the new Cabinet. The Duke at first rather\r\nrefused, and said he was so deaf, and so old and unfit for any\r\ndiscussion, that if he were to consult his own feelings he would\r\nrather not do it, and remain quite aloof; but that as he was very\r\nanxious to do anything that would tend to the Queen's comfort, and\r\nwould do everything and at all times that could be of use to the\r\nQueen, and therefore if she and her Prime Minister urged his accepting\r\noffice, he would. The Queen said she had more confidence in him\r\nthan in any of the others of his party. The Queen then mentioned the\r\nsubject of the Household, and of those who were not in Parliament. The\r\nDuke did not give any decisive answer about it, but advised the Queen\r\nnot to begin with conditions of this sort, and wait till the matter\r\nwas proposed. The Queen then said that she felt certain he would\r\nunderstand the great friendship she had for Lord Melbourne, who had\r\nbeen to her quite a parent, and the Duke said _no one felt and knew\r\nthat better than he did, and that no one could still be of greater\r\nuse to the Queen than Lord Melbourne_. The Duke spoke of his personal\r\nfriendship for Lord Melbourne, and that he hoped I knew that he had\r\noften done all he could to help your (Lord Melbourne's) Government.\r\nThe Queen then mentioned her intention to prove her great _fairness_\r\nto her new Government in telling them, that they might know there was\r\nno unfair dealing, that I meant to see you often as a friend, as I\r\nowed _so_ much to you. The Duke said he quite understood it, and knew\r\nI would not exercise this to weaken the Government, and that he would\r\ntake my part about it, and felt for me. He was very kind, and said he\r\ncalled it \"a misfortune\" that you had all left me.\r\n\r\nThe Queen wrote to Peel, who came after two, embarrassed and put out.\r\nThe Queen repeated what she had said to the Duke about her former\r\nGovernment, and asked Sir Robert to form a new Ministry. He does not\r\nseem sanguine; says entering the Government in a minority is very\r\ndifficult; he felt unequal to the task, and far from exulting in what\r\nhad happened, as he knew what pain it must give me; he quite approved\r\nthat the Duke should take office, and saw the importance of it; meant\r\nto offer him the post of Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and if he\r\nrefused, Lord Aberdeen; Lord Lyndhurst, Chancellor; hoped to secure\r\nStanley and Graham; Goulburn to be the candidate for the Speaker's\r\nChair; he expects a severe conflict then, and if he should be beat\r\nmust either resign or dissolve Parliament. Before this the Queen said\r\nshe was against a dissolution, in which he quite agreed, but of course\r\nwished no conditions should be made; he felt the task arduous, and\r\nthat he would require me to demonstrate (_a certain_ degree, if _any_\r\nI can only feel) confidence in the Government, and that my Household\r\nwould be one of the marks of that. The Queen mentioned the same thing\r\nabout her Household, to which he at present would give no answer, and\r\nsaid nothing should be done without my knowledge or approbation. He\r\nrepeated his surprise at the course you had all taken in resigning,\r\nwhich he did not expect. The Queen talked of her great friendship for,\r\nand gratitude to Lord Melbourne, and repeated what she had said to the\r\nDuke, in which Peel agreed; but he is such a cold, odd man she can't\r\nmake out what he means. He said he couldn't expect me to have the\r\nconfidence in him I had in you (and which he never can have) as he has\r\nnot deserved it. My impression is, he is not _happy_ and sanguine. He\r\ncomes to me to-morrow at one to report progress in his formation of\r\nthe new Government. The Queen don't like his manner after--oh! how\r\ndifferent, how dreadfully different, to that frank, open, natural and\r\nmost kind, warm manner of Lord Melbourne.[33] The Duke I like by far\r\nbetter to Peel. The Queen trusts Lord Melbourne will excuse this long\r\nletter, but she was so very anxious he should know all. The Queen was\r\nvery much collected, and betrayed no agitation during these two\r\ntrying Audiences. But afterwards again _all_ gave way. She feels Lord\r\nMelbourne will understand it, amongst enemies to those she most relied\r\non and esteemed, and people who seem to have no heart; but what is\r\nworst of all is the being deprived of seeing Lord Melbourne as she\r\nused to do.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 32: _Sic_: an obvious mistake for \"black was\r\n    black.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 33: Lady de Grey had written to Peel on 7th\r\n    May:--\"The Queen has always expressed herself much impressed\r\n    with Lord Melbourne's open manner, and his truth. The latter\r\n    quality you possess, the former not.\r\n\r\n    \"Now, dear Peel, the first impression on so young a girl's\r\n    mind is of immense consequence, accustomed as she has been\r\n    to the open and affectionate manner of Lord Melbourne, who,\r\n    _entre nous_, treats her as a father, and, with all his\r\n    faults, feels for her as such.\"--_Sir Robert Peel_, Parker,\r\n    vol. ii. p. 389.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD MELBOURNE'S ADVICE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_9th May 1839._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. He has read\r\nwith the greatest attention the very clear and distinct account which\r\nyour Majesty has written of that which passed at the Audiences which\r\nyour Majesty has given to the Duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel.\r\nNothing could have been more proper and judicious than your Majesty's\r\nconduct, and they appear to have acted upon their part with propriety\r\nand sincerity. Lord Melbourne has no doubt that both with respect\r\nto him (Lord Melbourne) and to themselves and their own feelings and\r\nposition, they expressed what they really think. The Duke was right in\r\nsaying that in general, in affairs of this nature, it is best not to\r\nbegin with conditions; but this matter of the Household is so personal\r\nto yourself, that it was best to give an intimation of your feelings\r\nupon it in the first instance. Lord Melbourne has little doubt that if\r\nthey could have acted from themselves, they would have acceded to your\r\nMajesty's wish at once; but your Majesty must recollect that they have\r\nothers to satisfy, and must not attribute entirely to them anything\r\nthat is harsh and unreasonable. Lord Melbourne advises your Majesty\r\nto urge this question of the Household strongly as a matter due to\r\nyourself and your own wishes; but if Sir Robert is unable to concede\r\nit, it will not do to refuse and to put off the negotiation upon it.\r\nLord Melbourne would strongly advise your Majesty to do everything to\r\nfacilitate the formation of the Government. Everything is to be\r\ndone and to be endured rather than run the risk of getting into the\r\nsituation in which they are in France, of no party being able to form\r\na Government and conduct the affairs of the country.[34]\r\n\r\nThe Dissolution of Parliament is a matter of still more importance,\r\nand if this should be again pressed upon your Majesty, Lord Melbourne\r\nwould advise your Majesty to reserve your opinion, not to give a\r\npromise that you will dissolve, nor to say positively that you\r\nwill not. You may say that you do not think it right to fetter the\r\nPrerogative of the Crown by previous engagements, that a dissolution\r\nof Parliament is to be decided according to the circumstances at the\r\ntime, that you mean to give full confidence to the Government that\r\nshall be formed, and to do everything in your power to support them,\r\nand that you will consider whether Parliament shall be dissolved, when\r\nyou are advised to dissolve it, and have before you the reasons for\r\nsuch a measure.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne earnestly entreats your Majesty not to suffer yourself\r\nto be affected by any faultiness of manner which you may observe.\r\nDepend upon it, there is no personal hostility to Lord Melbourne nor\r\nany bitter feelings against him. Sir Robert is the most cautious and\r\nreserved of mankind. Nobody seems to Lord Melbourne to know him, but\r\nhe is not therefore deceitful or dishonest. Many a very false man has\r\na very open sincere manner, and _vice versâ_....\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne earnestly hopes that your Majesty is better this\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 34: Alluding to the successive failures of Soult,\r\n    Thiers, and Broglie.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Melbourne._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _9th May 1839._\r\n\r\nThe Queen cannot sufficiently thank Lord Melbourne for his most kind\r\nletter, and for his excellent advice, which is at once the greatest\r\ncomfort and of the greatest use to her; the Queen will follow it in\r\nevery respect, and nothing of importance shall be done without due\r\nreflection; and she trusts Lord Melbourne will help her and be to her\r\nwhat she told him he was, and begged him still ever to be--a father to\r\none who never wanted support more than she does now.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne shall hear again after she sees Peel this morning....\r\n\r\nThe Queen has just now heard Lord Liverpool is not in town.\r\n\r\nThe Queen hopes Lord Melbourne is able to read her letters; if ever\r\nthere is anything he cannot read, he must send them back, and mark\r\nwhat he can't read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD PALMERSTON'S GRATITUDE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSTANHOPE STREET, _9th May 1839._\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs\r\nto return your Majesty his grateful thanks for your Majesty's gracious\r\ncommunication of this morning. It affords Viscount Palmerston the most\r\nheart-felt satisfaction to know that his humble but zealous endeavours\r\nto promote the interests of his country and to uphold the honour of\r\nyour Majesty's Crown, have had the good fortune to meet with your\r\nMajesty's approbation; and he begs most respectfully to assure\r\nyour Majesty that the deep impression produced by the condescending\r\nkindness which he has upon all occasions experienced from your Majesty\r\ncan never be effaced from his mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE HOUSEHOLD]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_9th May 1839._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs to\r\nsuggest that if Sir Robert Peel presses for the dismissal of those of\r\nyour Household who are not in Parliament, you may observe that in so\r\ndoing he is pressing your Majesty more hardly than any Minister ever\r\npressed a Sovereign before.\r\n\r\nWhen the Government was changed in 1830, the principal posts of the\r\nHousehold were placed at the disposal of Lord Grey, but the Grooms and\r\nEquerries were not removed.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Robert Peel himself became Minister in 1834, no part of the\r\nHousehold were removed except those who were in Parliament.\r\n\r\nWhen I became Prime Minister again in 1835, none of the Grooms or\r\nEquerries were removed because none of them were in Parliament.\r\n\r\nThey press upon your Majesty, whose personal feelings ought from your\r\ncircumstances to be more consulted, a measure which no Minister before\r\never pressed upon a Sovereign.\r\n\r\nIf this is put to him by your Majesty, Lord Melbourne does not see how\r\nhe can resist it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Melbourne._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _9th May 1839._\r\n\r\nThe Queen writes one line to prepare Lord Melbourne for what _may_\r\nhappen in a very few hours. Sir Robert Peel has behaved very ill,\r\nand has insisted on my giving up my Ladies, to which I replied that I\r\nnever would consent, and I never saw a man so frightened. He said\r\nhe must go to the Duke of Wellington and consult with him, when both\r\nwould return, and he said this must suspend all further proceedings,\r\nand he asked whether I should be ready to receive a decision, which I\r\nsaid I should; he was quite perturbed--but this is _infamous_. I said,\r\nbesides many other things, that if he or the Duke of Wellington had\r\nbeen at the head of the Government when I came to the Throne, perhaps\r\nthere might have been a few more Tory Ladies, but that then if you had\r\ncome into Office you would never have _dreamt_ of changing them. I was\r\ncalm but very decided, and I think you would have been pleased to see\r\nmy composure and great firmness; the Queen of England will not submit\r\nto such trickery. Keep yourself in readiness, for you may soon be\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PROPOSED NEW CABINET]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extract from the Queen's Journal._\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 9th May 1839._\r\n\r\n_At half-past two_ I saw the Duke of Wellington. I remained firm, and\r\nhe told Sir Robert that I remained firm. I then saw Sir Robert Peel,\r\nwho stopped a few minutes with me; he must consult those (of whom I\r\nannex the List) whom he had named:\r\n\r\n  THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON  _Secretary for Foreign Affairs_\r\n  SIR JAMES GRAHAM        _Secretary for the Home Department_\r\n  LORD STANLEY            _Secretary for the Colonies_\r\n  LORD LYNDHURST          _Lord Chancellor_\r\n  LORD ELLENBOROUGH       _President of the Board of Control_\r\n  SIR H. HARDINGE         _Secretary at War_\r\n\r\nand he said he would return in two or three hours with the result,\r\nwhich I said I should await.[35]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 35: It was a curious circumstance, much commented\r\n    on at the time, that in the _Globe_ of 9th May, a Ministerial\r\n    evening paper, which would probably have gone to press at two\r\n    o'clock in the afternoon, the following paragraph appeared:\r\n    \"The determination which it is well known Her Majesty has\r\n    taken, not to allow the change in the Government to interfere\r\n    with the ladies of her Court, has given great offence to the\r\n    Tories.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Melbourne._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _9th May 1839._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Melbourne's letter. Lord Melbourne will\r\nsince have heard what has taken place. Lord Melbourne must not think\r\nthe Queen rash in her conduct; she saw both the Duke and Sir Robert\r\nagain, and declared to them she could not change her opinion. The\r\nLadies are not (as the Duke imagined was stated in the Civil List\r\nBill) in the _place_ of the Lords; and the Queen felt this was an\r\nattempt to see whether she could be led and managed like a child;\r\nif it should lead to Sir Robert Peel's refusing to undertake the\r\nformation of the Government, which would be absurd, the Queen will\r\nfeel satisfied that she has only been defending her own rights, on\r\na point which so nearly concerned her person, and which, if they had\r\nsucceeded in, would have led to every sort of unfair attempt at power;\r\nthe Queen maintains _all_ her ladies,--and thinks her Prime Minister\r\nwill cut a sorry figure indeed if he resigns on this. Sir Robert is\r\ngone to consult with his friends, and will return in two or three\r\nhours with his decision. The Queen also maintained the Mistress of the\r\nRobes, for as he said _only_ those who are _in Parliament_ shall be\r\nremoved, I should like to know if they mean to give the _Ladies_ seats\r\nin Parliament?\r\n\r\nWe shall see what will be done. The Queen would not have _stood so\r\nfirmly_ on the Grooms and Equerries, but her _Ladies_ are _entirely_\r\nher own affair, and _not_ the Ministers'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE CRISIS]\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_9th May 1839._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. Lord\r\nMelbourne had certainly never expected that this demand would be\r\nurged, and therefore had never advised your Majesty as to what was to\r\nbe done in such a case. Lord Melbourne strongly advises your Majesty\r\nto hear what the Duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel urge, but to\r\ntake time before you come to a peremptory and final decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_9th May 1839._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. This is a\r\nmatter of so much importance, and may have such grave results,\r\nthat any advice which Lord Melbourne could give would be of little\r\nimportance unless it coincided with the opinions of others, and\r\nparticularly of all those who were and intend still [to] continue to\r\nbe his colleagues.\r\n\r\nIt will depend upon their determination whether your Majesty is to be\r\nsupported or not. The best course will perhaps be that you should\r\nhear Sir Robert Peel's determination, say nothing, but send for Lord\r\nMelbourne, and lay the matter before him. Lord Melbourne will then\r\nsummon a Cabinet to consider of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE LADIES OF THE BEDCHAMBER]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extract from the Queen's Journal._\r\n\r\n_9th May 1839._\r\n\r\nAt half-past six came Lord Melbourne and stayed with me till ten\r\nminutes past seven.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE LADIES]\r\n\r\nI then began by giving him a detailed account of the whole proceeding,\r\nwhich I shall state here as briefly as possible. I first again related\r\nwhat took place in the two first interviews, and when I said that\r\nthe Duke said he had assisted my Government often very much, Lord\r\nMelbourne said: \"Well, that is true enough, but the Duke did all he\r\ncould about this vote.\" \"Well, then,\" I said, \"when Sir Robert Peel\r\ncame this morning, he began first about the Ministry. I consented,\r\nthough I said I might have my personal feelings about Lord Lyndhurst\r\nand Lord Aberdeen, but that I would suppress every personal feeling\r\nand be quite fair. I then repeated that I wished to retain about me\r\nthose who were not in Parliament, and Sir Robert _pretended_ that\r\nI had the preceding day expressed a wish to keep about me those who\r\n_were_ in Parliament. I mentioned my wish to have Lord Liverpool, to\r\nwhich Sir Robert readily acceded, saying he would offer him the place\r\nof Lord Steward, or of Lord in Waiting. He then suggested my\r\nhaving Lord Ashley,[36] which I said I should like, as Treasurer or\r\nComptroller. Soon after this Sir Robert said: 'Now, about the Ladies,'\r\nupon which I said I could _not_ give up _any_ of my Ladies, and\r\nnever had imagined such a thing. He asked if I meant to retain _all_.\r\n'_All_,' I said. 'The Mistress of the Robes and the Ladies of the\r\nBedchamber?' I replied, '_All_,'--for he said they were the wives\r\nof the opponents of the Government, mentioning Lady Normanby[37] in\r\nparticular as one of the late Ministers' wives. I said that would not\r\ninterfere; that I never talked politics with them, and that they\r\nwere related, many of them, to Tories, and I enumerated those of my\r\nBedchamber women and Maids of Honour; upon which he said he did not\r\nmean _all_ the Bedchamber women and _all_ the Maids of Honour, he\r\nmeant the Mistress of the Robes and the Ladies of the Bedchamber; to\r\nwhich I replied _they_ were of more consequence than the others, and\r\nthat I could _not_ consent, and that it had never been done before. He\r\nsaid I was a Queen Regnant, and that made the difference. 'Not here,'\r\nI said--and I maintained my right. Sir Robert then urged it upon\r\n_public grounds only_, but I said here I could not consent. He then\r\nbegged to be allowed to consult with the Duke upon such an important\r\nmatter. I expressed a wish also to see the Duke, if Sir Robert\r\napproved, which he said he did, and that he would return with the\r\nDuke, if I would then be prepared for the decision, which I said I\r\nwould. Well,\" I continued, \"the Duke and Sir Robert returned soon, and\r\nI first saw the Duke, who talked first of his being ready to take the\r\npost of Secretary for Foreign Affairs, which I had pressed Peel\r\nto urge on him (the Duke having first wished to be in the Cabinet,\r\nwithout accepting office), and the Duke said, 'I am able to do\r\nanything,' for I asked him if it would not be too much for him. Then\r\nI told him that I had been very well satisfied with Sir Robert\r\nyesterday, and asked the Duke if Sir Robert had told him what had\r\npassed about the Ladies. He said he had, and then I repeated all my\r\narguments, and the Duke his; but the Duke and Sir Robert differed\r\nconsiderably on two points. The Duke said the _opinions_ of the Ladies\r\nwere nothing, but it was the _principle_, whether the Minister could\r\nremove the Ladies or not, and that he (the Duke) had understood it was\r\nstated in the Civil List Bill, 'that the _Ladies were instead of the\r\nLords_,' which is quite false, and I told the Duke that there were not\r\n_twelve Lords_, as the expense _with the Ladies_ would have been too\r\ngreat.\" Lord Melbourne said: \"There you had the better of him,\r\nand what did he say?\" \"Not much,\" I replied. I repeated many of my\r\narguments, all which pleased Lord Melbourne, and which he agreed to,\r\namongst others, that I said to the Duke, Was Sir Robert so weak that\r\n_even_ the Ladies must be of his opinion? The Duke denied that. The\r\nDuke then took my decision to Sir Robert, who was waiting in the next\r\nroom; after a few minutes Sir Robert returned. After stopping a\r\nfew minutes, as I have already stated, Sir Robert went to see his\r\ncolleagues, and returned at five: said he had consulted with those who\r\nwere to have been his colleagues, and that they agreed that, with\r\nthe probability of being beat the first night about the Speaker, and\r\nbeginning with a Minority in the House of Commons, that unless\r\nthere was _some_ (_all_ the Officers of State and Lords I gave up)\r\ndemonstration of my confidence, and if I retained all my Ladies\r\nthis would not be, \"they agreed unanimously they could not go on.\" I\r\nreplied I would reflect, that I felt certain I should not change my\r\nmind, but that I should do nothing in a hurry, and would write him my\r\ndecision either that evening or the next morning. He said, meanwhile,\r\nhe would suspend all further proceedings.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 36: Afterwards Earl of Shaftesbury, the well-known\r\n    Philanthropist.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 37: J. W. Croker wrote to the King of Hanover:--\r\n\r\n    \"_11th May 1839._\r\n\r\n    \"... This is the sum of the whole affair. Sir R. Peel could\r\n    not admit that broad principle that all were to remain.\r\n    Lady Normanby (whom the Queen particularly wishes for), for\r\n    instance, the wife of the very Minister whose measures have\r\n    been the cause of the change, two sisters of Lord Morpeth, the\r\n    sisters-in-law of Lord John Russell, the daughter of the Privy\r\n    Seal and the Chancellor of the Exchequer....\r\n\r\n    \"Her Majesty's ball last night was, I am told, rather dull,\r\n    though she herself seemed in high spirits, as if she were\r\n    pleased at retaining her Ministers. She has a great concert on\r\n    the 13th, but to both, as I hear, the invitations have been on\r\n    a very exclusive principle, no Tories being invited who could\r\n    on any pretence be left out. These are small matters, but\r\n    everything tends to create a public impression that Her\r\n    Majesty takes a personal and strong interest in the Whigs--a\r\n    new ingredient of difficulty.\"--_Croker Papers_, II. 347.]\r\n\r\nI also told Lord Melbourne that I feared I had embarrassed the\r\nGovernment; that I acted quite alone. Lord Melbourne saw, and said\r\nI could not do otherwise. \"I must summon the Cabinet,\" said Lord\r\nMelbourne, at half-past nine. \"It may have very serious consequences.\r\nIf we can't go on with this House of Commons, we may have to dissolve\r\nParliament, and we don't know if we may get as good a House of\r\nCommons.\" I begged him to come, and he said: \"I'll come if it is in\r\nany time--if it's twelve; but if it's one or two, I'll write.\"\r\n\r\nAfter dinner (as usual with the Household) I went to my room, and\r\nsat up till a quarter past two. At a quarter to two I received the\r\nfollowing letter from Lord Melbourne, written at one o'clock:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN'S ULTIMATUM]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_10th May 1839_ (1 A.M.).\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.

The Cabinet of Lord Melbourne discussed\r\n    the proposals of that of Sir Robert Peel, and they dictated to\r\n    the Queen the reply in which she refused to consent to the\r\n    advice tendered to her by the man who was _at that moment_ her\r\n    Minister.\"--_Greville's Journal, 12th May 1839._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Sir Robert Peel._\r\n\r\n_10th May 1839._\r\n\r\nThe Queen having considered the proposal made to her yesterday by Sir\r\nRobert Peel, to remove the Ladies of her Bedchamber, cannot consent to\r\nadopt a course which she conceives to be contrary to usage, and which\r\nis repugnant to her feelings.[39]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 39: Sixty years later the Queen, during a\r\n    conversation at Osborne with Sir Arthur Bigge, her Private\r\n    Secretary, after eulogising Sir Robert Peel, said: \"I was very\r\n    young then, and perhaps I should act differently if it was all\r\n    to be done again.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Melbourne._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _10th May 1839._\r\n\r\nThe Queen wrote the letter before she went to bed, and sent it at\r\nnine this morning; she has received no answer, and concludes she will\r\nreceive none, as Sir Robert told the Queen if the Ladies were not\r\nremoved, his party would fall directly, and could not go on, and that\r\nhe only awaited the Queen's decision. The Queen therefore wishes to\r\nsee Lord Melbourne about half-past twelve or one, if that would do.\r\n\r\nThe Queen fears Lord Melbourne has much trouble in consequence of all\r\nthis; but the Queen was fully prepared, and fully intended to give\r\nthese people a fair trial, though she always told Lord Melbourne she\r\nknew they couldn't stand; and she must rejoice at having got out of\r\nthe hands of people who would have sacrificed every personal feeling\r\nand instinct of the Queen's to their bad party purposes.\r\n\r\nHow is Lord Melbourne this morning?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: AN ANXIOUS WEEK]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Melbourne._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _10th May 1839._\r\n\r\nHalf-past one will do as well as one; any hour will do that Lord\r\nMelbourne likes, for the Queen will not go out.\r\n\r\nThere is no answer from Peel.\r\n\r\nThe Queen is wonderfully well, considering all the fatigue of\r\nyesterday, and not getting to bed till near half-past two, which is\r\nsomewhat of a fatigue for to-night when the Queen must be very late.\r\nReally all these Fêtes in the midst of such very serious and anxious\r\nbusiness are quite overwhelming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Melbourne._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _10th May 1839._\r\n\r\nThe Queen forgot to ask Lord Melbourne if he thought there would be\r\nany harm in her writing to the Duke of Cambridge that she really was\r\nfearful of fatiguing herself, if she went out to a party at Gloucester\r\nHouse on Tuesday, an Ancient Concert on Wednesday, and a ball at\r\nNorthumberland House on Thursday, considering how much she had to do\r\nthese last four days. If she went to the Ancient Concert on Wednesday,\r\nhaving besides a concert of her own here on Monday, it would be four\r\nnights of fatigue, really exhausted as the Queen is.\r\n\r\nBut if Lord Melbourne thinks that as there are only to be English\r\nsingers at the Ancient Concert, she ought to go, she could go there\r\nfor one act; but she would much rather, if possible, get out of it,\r\nfor it is a fatiguing time....\r\n\r\nAs the negotiations with the Tories are quite at an end, and Lord\r\nMelbourne _has been here_, the Queen hopes Lord Melbourne will not\r\nobject to dining with her on _Sunday_?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: RESIGNATION OF PEEL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir Robert Peel to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_10th May 1839._\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has had\r\nthe honour of receiving your Majesty's note of this morning.\r\n\r\nIn respectfully submitting to your Majesty's pleasure, and humbly\r\nreturning into your Majesty's hands the important trust which your\r\nMajesty had been graciously pleased to commit to him, Sir Robert Peel\r\ntrusts that your Majesty will permit him to state to your Majesty his\r\nimpression with respect to the circumstances which have led to the\r\ntermination of his attempt to form an Administration for the conduct\r\nof your Majesty's Service.\r\n\r\nIn the interview with which your Majesty honoured Sir Robert Peel\r\nyesterday morning, after he had submitted to your Majesty the names of\r\nthose whom he proposed to recommend to your Majesty for the principal\r\nexecutive appointments, he mentioned to your Majesty his earnest wish\r\nto be enabled, with your Majesty's sanction, so to constitute your\r\nMajesty's Household that your Majesty's confidential servants might\r\nhave the advantage of a public demonstration of your Majesty's full\r\nsupport and confidence, and that at the same time, as far as possible\r\nconsistently with that demonstration, each individual appointment in\r\nthe Household should be entirely acceptable to your Majesty's personal\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\nOn your Majesty's expressing a desire that the Earl of Liverpool[40]\r\nshould hold an office in the Household, Sir Robert Peel requested your\r\nMajesty's permission at once to offer to Lord Liverpool the office of\r\nLord Steward, or any other which he might prefer.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel then observed that he should have every wish to apply\r\na similar principle to the chief appointments which are filled by\r\nthe Ladies of your Majesty's Household, upon which your Majesty\r\nwas pleased to remark that you must reserve the whole of those\r\nappointments, and that it was your Majesty's pleasure that the whole\r\nshould continue as at present, without any change.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington, in the interview to which your Majesty\r\nsubsequently admitted him, understood also that this was your\r\nMajesty's determination, and concurred with Sir Robert Peel in opinion\r\nthat, considering the great difficulties of the present crisis, and\r\nthe expediency of making every effort in the first instance to\r\nconduct the public business of the country with the aid of the present\r\nParliament, it was essential to the success of the Commission with\r\nwhich your Majesty had honoured Sir Robert Peel, that he should have\r\nthat public proof of your Majesty's entire support and confidence\r\nwhich would be afforded by the permission to make some changes in\r\nthat part of your Majesty's Household which your Majesty resolved on\r\nmaintaining entirely without change.\r\n\r\nHaving had the opportunity through your Majesty's gracious\r\nconsideration, of reflecting upon this point, he humbly submits to\r\nyour Majesty that he is reluctantly compelled, by a sense of public\r\nduty and of the interests of your Majesty's service, to adhere to his\r\nopinion which he ventured to express to your Majesty.\r\n\r\nHe trusts he may be permitted at the same time to express to your\r\nMajesty his grateful acknowledgments for the distinction which your\r\nMajesty conferred upon him by requiring his advice and assistance in\r\nthe attempt to form an Administration, and his earnest prayers that\r\nwhatever arrangements your Majesty may be enabled to make for that\r\npurpose may be most conducive to your Majesty's personal comfort and\r\nhappiness, and to the promotion of the public welfare.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 40: Charles Cecil Cope Jenkinson, third Earl,\r\n    1784-1851, became Lord Steward in 1841.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN'S JOURNAL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extract from the Queen's Journal._\r\n\r\n_Friday, 10th May 1839._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne came to me at two and stayed with me till ten minutes\r\nto three.

How much has taken place since Monday the 7th\r\nto yesterday the 13th. You will have easily imagined how dreadful\r\nthe resignation of my Government--and particularly of that truly\r\ninestimable and excellent man, Lord Melbourne--was for me, and you\r\nwill have felt for me! What I suffered I cannot describe! To have to\r\ntake people whom I should have no confidence in, ... was most painful\r\nand disagreeable; but I felt I must do it, and made up my mind to\r\nit--nobly advised and supported by Lord Melbourne, whose character\r\nseems to me still more perfect and noble since I have gone through all\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nI sent for the Duke of Wellington, who referred me to Peel, whom I\r\naccordingly saw.\r\n\r\nEverything fair and just I assented to, even to having Lord Lyndhurst\r\nas Chancellor, and Sir H. Hardinge and Lord Ellenborough in the\r\nCabinet; I insisted upon the Duke in the Foreign Office, instead\r\nof Lord Aberdeen.... All this I granted, as also to give up all the\r\nOfficers of State and all those of my Household who are in Parliament.\r\n\r\nWhen to my utter astonishment he asked me to change my Ladies--my\r\nprincipal Ladies!--this I of course refused; and he upon _this\r\nresigned_, saying, as he felt he should be beat the very first night\r\nupon the Speaker, and having to begin with a minority, that unless he\r\nhad this demonstration of my confidence he could not go on!\r\n\r\nYou will easily imagine that I firmly resisted this attack upon my\r\npower, from these people who pride themselves upon upholding the\r\nprerogative! I acted quite alone, but I have been, and shall be,\r\nsupported by my country, who are very enthusiastic about it, and\r\nloudly cheered me on going to church on Sunday. My Government have\r\nnobly stood by me, and have resumed their posts, strengthened by the\r\nfeelings of the country....\r\n\r\nPray tell my dearest Aunt that I really cannot write to her to-day,\r\nfor you have no conception of what I have to do, for there are balls,\r\nconcerts, and dinners all going on besides.

The march of the whole affair is\r\nvery clear and fair, and does you _great credit_.... Peel in making\r\nhis demand misjudged you; he remembered George IV., and even the late\r\nKing, and dreamt of Court influence of people near the Sovereign. You\r\nhave the great merit, for which you cannot be too much praised, of\r\nbeing _extremely honest_ and honourable in your dealings. If you had\r\nkept Peel, you would have acted honestly by him, without any Lady's\r\nhaving a chance of doing him a bad turn. When he asked the measure\r\nas an expression of your great confidence in him, it was not fair,\r\nbecause _you_ had not wished to take him; he was forced upon you, and\r\ntherefore, even if you had granted his request, nobody would have seen\r\nin it a proof of your confidence in him, but rather a sacrifice to a\r\nfar-stretched pretence.\r\n\r\nBesides, that he was to have encountered difficulties as a Minister\r\nwas partly the consequence of the policy of his party, and you were\r\nnot bound to give him any assistance beyond what he had a right to ask\r\nas a Minister. I was sure that Lord Melbourne would give you both the\r\nfairest and the most honourable advice in this painful crisis. He was\r\nkind enough last year to speak to me on the subject, and I could but\r\napprove what he said on the subject. Altogether, keeping now your\r\nold Ministers, you will have reason to congratulate yourself on the\r\nresult; it is likely to strengthen them, by showing the Radicals what\r\nmay be the consequences.\r\n\r\nRumour spoke of their wishing to add some Radicals to the Cabinet;\r\nI don't see that they could improve the Ministry by it, which is\r\nperfectly well composed as it is at present, and new elements often\r\nhave a dissolving effect.

It is always well to have some\r\nbreathing-time.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 44: The Jamaica Bill for the temporary suspension of\r\n    the Constitution.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWILTON CRESCENT, _11th June 1839._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has\r\nthe honour to state that the division of last night was extremely\r\nencouraging to the future prospects of the Government.\r\n\r\nCombined with the division on the Speakership,[45] it shows that the\r\nLiberal party have still a clear though small majority in the House\r\nof Commons, and that it may probably not be necessary to resort to a\r\ndissolution. Indeed, such a measure in present circumstances would be\r\nof very doubtful issue.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell stated last night that he would not divide on the\r\nCanada resolutions, but move for leave to bring in a Bill.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 45: Mr Shaw Lefevre was elected by 317 against 299\r\n    for Mr Goulburn.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_6th July 1839._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has\r\nthe honour to report that Mr. Rice yesterday brought forward his\r\nfinancial statement with great ability.\r\n\r\nHe moved a resolution in favour of a penny postage, which Sir Robert\r\nPeel declared it to be his intention to oppose on the report.

The Queen had imagined that the\r\nHouse of Lords was still sitting, and therefore desired them to take\r\nthe box there, but never had intended it should follow him to dinner;\r\nshe begs Lord Melbourne to excuse this mistake which must have\r\nappeared so strange.\r\n\r\nDid the dinner go off well at Lady Elizabeth H.

First of all, I wish to know if _Albert_ is aware of the\r\nwish of his _Father_ and _you_ relative to _me?_ Secondly, if he knows\r\nthat there is _no engagement_ between us? I am anxious that you should\r\nacquaint Uncle Ernest, that if I should like Albert, that I can make\r\n_no final promise this year_, for, at the _very earliest_, any such\r\nevent could not take place till _two or three years hence_. For,\r\nindependent of my youth, and my _great_ repugnance to change my\r\npresent position, there is _no anxiety_ evinced in _this country_ for\r\nsuch an event, and it would be more prudent, in my opinion, to wait\r\ntill some such demonstration is shown,--else if it were hurried it\r\nmight produce discontent.\r\n\r\nThough all the reports of Albert are most favourable, and though\r\nI have little doubt I shall like him, still one can never answer\r\nbeforehand for _feelings_, and I may not have the _feeling_ for him\r\nwhich is requisite to ensure happiness. I _may_ like him as a friend,\r\nand as a _cousin_, and as a _brother_, but not _more_; and should this\r\nbe the case (which is not likely), I am _very_ anxious that it should\r\nbe understood that I am _not_ guilty of any breach of promise, for\r\n_I never gave any_. I am sure you will understand my anxiety, for I\r\nshould otherwise, were this not completely understood, be in a very\r\npainful position. As it is, I am rather nervous about the visit, for\r\nthe subject I allude to is not an agreeable one to me. I have little\r\nelse to say, dear Uncle, as I have now spoken openly to you, which I\r\nwas very, _very anxious_ to do.\r\n\r\nYou will be at Paris, I suppose, when you get this letter, and I\r\ntherefore beg you to lay me at the feet of the whole family, and to\r\nbelieve me ever your very devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Melbourne._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _20th July 1839._\r\n\r\nThe Queen anxiously hopes Lord Melbourne has slept well, and has not\r\nsuffered from last night. It was very wrong of him not to wish the\r\nQueen good-night, as she expected he would in so small a party, for\r\nshe _saw_ that he did _not_ go away immediately after supper. When\r\ndid he get home? It was great pleasure to the Queen that he came last\r\nnight. We kept up the dancing till past three, and the Queen was much\r\namused, and slept soundly from four till half-past ten, which she is\r\nashamed of. She is quite well, but has got a good deal of cold in her\r\nhead; she hopes to see Lord Melbourne at two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE DUCHESS OF BRAGANZA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Melbourne._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _25th July 1839._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has seen the Duchess of Braganza,[47] who, though a good\r\ndeal changed, is still handsome, and very amiable; she seemed so glad,\r\ntoo, to see the Queen again. The child[48] is grown a dear fine girl.\r\nLord Palmerston thought it right that I should ask her to dinner also\r\non Saturday and take her to the Opera; and on Sunday, as she came on\r\npurpose to see the Queen, and goes on Monday.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday (besides Lord Melbourne) the Queen proposes asking\r\nPalmerston, Normanby, Uxbridge, and Surrey, and no one else except the\r\nDuchess's suite. The Queen hopes Lord Melbourne will approve of this.\r\nHe will not forget to let the Queen know how the debate is going on,\r\nat about nine or ten, as she will be curious to know. She trusts he\r\nwill not suffer from the fatigue of to-night.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 47: The step-mother of Donna Maria.

Everything is pretty quiet, and the _grâce accordée à Barbès_[49]\r\nhas put down the rage against the King personally, at least for some\r\nlittle time. The affairs of the Orient interest a good deal. I think\r\nthat it is better the Porte should be on a favourable footing with\r\nMehemet Ali than if that gentleman had pushed on in arms, as it will\r\nput the _casus foederis_ out of the question, and the Turks will not\r\ncall in the assistance of the Russians. Whoever pushed the late Sultan\r\ninto this war has done an act of great folly, as it could only bring\r\nthe Porte into jeopardy.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 49: Armand Barbès, the leader of a fatal riot\r\n    in Paris, was sentenced to death, a sentence afterwards\r\n    remitted.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_3rd August 1839._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne will wait upon your Majesty at a quarter before five,\r\nif possible, but there is much to discuss at the Cabinet. The Caspian\r\nPasha has taken the Turkish fleet to Alexandria,[50] and Mehemet Ali\r\nsays that he will not give it up to the Sultan until he dismisses the\r\nGrand Vizier, and acknowledges the hereditary right of the Pasha to\r\nthe countries which he at present governs. This is to make the Sultan\r\nhis subject and his vassal.\r\n\r\nThe accounts from Birmingham are by no means good.[51] There has\r\nbeen no disturbance of the peace, but the general disposition is both\r\nviolent and determined.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 50: The Viceroy of Egypt had revolted against the\r\n    Porte, and on 8th June the Sultan purported to deprive him and\r\n    Ibrahim, his son, of their dignities.

But the Admiral\r\n    treacherously sailed to Alexandria, and the Ottoman troops,\r\n    under Hafiz, who had succeeded Mehemet Ali in the Government\r\n    of Egypt, were utterly routed.

It was\r\nintensely hot at the Opera; the Queen-Dowager visited the Queen in her\r\nbox, as did also the young Grand Duke of Weimar, who is just returned\r\nfrom Scotland, and whom the Queen has asked to come after dinner\r\nto-morrow. The Queen has not asked the Duke of Sussex to come after\r\ndinner to-morrow, as she thought he would be bored by such a sort of\r\nparty; does not Lord Melbourne think so? and she means to ask him to\r\ndinner soon.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has not asked Lord Melbourne about any days this week\r\nbesides to-morrow (when she trusts he may be able to come, but she\r\ndoes not know what there is in the House) and Wednesday; but perhaps\r\nLord Melbourne will consent to leave Thursday and Friday open in\r\n_case_ he should be able to come one or both of those days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Melbourne._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _4th August 1839._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has just received Lord Melbourne's letter; and wishes to\r\nknow if Lord Melbourne means by \"to-day\" that he is also coming to\r\nsee her _this afternoon_, (which she does not expect) as well as _this\r\nevening_? for she did _not_ ask him in her note of this morning _if_\r\nhe would come to-night (for she felt _sure_ of that), but if he could\r\ncome _to-morrow_, about which he has not answered her, as to whether\r\nhe expects there will be anything of great length in the House of\r\nLords. Lord Melbourne will forgive the Queen's troubling him again,\r\nbut she felt a little puzzled by his letter; she sent him a card for\r\nWednesday without previously asking him, as she thought that would\r\nsuit him, and hopes it does?\r\n\r\nThe Queen will follow Lord Melbourne's advice respecting the Duke of\r\nSussex.\r\n\r\nWe have just returned from hearing not only a very long, and very bad,\r\nbut also, a very ludicrous, sermon.\r\n\r\nThe heat is somewhat less, but the Queen is undecided as to driving\r\nout or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: KING LOUIS PHILIPPE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _9th August 1839._\r\n\r\n... I am sorry that you are less pleased with the old Duke, but party\r\nspirit is in England an incurable disease. These last two years he had\r\nrendered essential service to the present Administration; perhaps he\r\nhas been soured by last summer's events. It was my intention to have\r\nanswered your questions sooner, but from Paris I had not the means.\r\nNow the time draws so near when I hope to have the happiness of seeing\r\nyou, that I think it will be better to treat the matter verbally, the\r\nmore so as my most beloved Majesty is easily displeased with what may\r\nbe written with the best intention, instead that in conversation the\r\nimmediate reply renders any misunderstanding, however small, very\r\ndifficult; and as I do not wish to have any great or small with you,\r\nand see no occasion for it, I will give my answer _de vive voix_.\r\n\r\nNow comes a subject which will _astonish_ you. I am charged _de\r\nsonder_ your will and pleasure on the following subject. The King my\r\nfather-in-law goes to Eu, where he hopes to remain till the 5th or 6th\r\nof September. Having at his disposition some very fine steamers, his\r\ngreat wish would be to go over to Brighton, just for one afternoon and\r\nnight, to offer you his respects in person. He would in such a\r\ncase bring with him the Queen, my Aunt, Clémentine,[52] Aumale and\r\nMontpensier. The first step in this business is to know what\r\nyour pleasure is, and to learn that very frankly, as he perfectly\r\nunderstands that, however short such a visit, it must be submitted to\r\nthe advice even of some of your Ministers. What renders the thing very\r\ndifficult, in my opinion, is that in a country like France, and with\r\nso many Ministerial difficulties, the King to the _last hour_ will\r\nhardly know if he can undertake the thing. As, however, the first\r\nobject is to know your will, he begged me to ascertain that, and to\r\ntell you that if you had the _smallest objection_ you would not be\r\ncarried away by the apprehension of hurting him by telling me honestly\r\nthat you did _not_ see how the affair could be arranged, but to speak\r\nout, that he knew enough how often objections may arise, and that even\r\nwith himself he could only be sure of the thing at the last moment.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 52: Who afterwards married Queen Victoria's cousin,\r\n    Prince Augustus (Gusti) of Coburg.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE NEW SULTAN]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nFOREIGN OFFICE, _19th August 1839._\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and in\r\nsubmitting the accompanying private letter from the Earl Granville[53]\r\nbegs to state that neither Viscount Melbourne nor Viscount Palmerston\r\nare of opinion that it would be expedient that your Majesty should\r\nsend an Ambassador Extraordinary to compliment the young Sultan[54]\r\non his accession. The circumstances connected with his accession are\r\nindeed fitter matter for condolence than for congratulation, and he\r\nwould probably be better pleased by the restoration of his fleet than\r\nby the arrival of Ambassadors Extraordinary. Moreover, it has not been\r\ncustomary for the Sovereign of England to send such missions upon the\r\naccession of Sultans.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 53: The first Earl Granville (1773-1846), formerly\r\n    Ambassador Extraordinary to the Russian Court, at this time\r\n    Ambassador at Paris.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 54: Abdul Medjid, a lad of sixteen, succeeded the\r\n    Sultan Mahmoud.

France,\r\n    however, wished to support Mehemet, and direct the Alliance\r\n    against Russia. But Nicholas I. of Russia was prepared to\r\n    support England as far as regarded the affairs of Turkey and\r\n    Egypt, and to close the Dardanelles and Bosphorus to warships\r\n    of all nations, it being stipulated that Russian ships of war\r\n    only were to pass the Bosphorus, as acting under the mandate\r\n    of Europe in defence of the Turks. _See_ further, Introductory\r\n    Notes for 1839 and 1840.

The King's intention would be to leave Eu in the evening, let us\r\nsay at eight or nine o'clock, and to land, perhaps at ten or eleven,\r\nat Brighton on the _following morning_. He would have the honour of\r\ndining with you, and would re-embark in the _evening of the same day_,\r\nso as to be back on the _following morning_ at Eu. He will therefore,\r\nas you see, _not_ sleep in England.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot give any _pied-à-terre_ in the Palace for these few\r\nhours, they will remain in an hotel. But I must say that as the King\r\nand Queen put themselves to _some inconvenience in coming_ to see\r\nyou, it would be _rather desirable_ to offer them rooms in the Palace,\r\nwhich I think might be easily managed. As far as we are concerned, it\r\n_does not matter_ if we are housed in an hotel or where we bivouac. I\r\nwill charge Van de Weyer to take rooms for us somewhere....\r\n\r\nDo not imagine that I have done the least to bring this about for my\r\nown satisfaction, which is _very limited_ in this business, but the\r\nKing wished _much to see you once_, and so did the Queen, who abhors\r\nsailing more than anybody, and this is perhaps the _only_ opportunity\r\nwhich may ever offer of doing it, even with some political benefit, as\r\nit certainly is desirable that it should appear that the two maritime\r\nPowers are on good terms....

As I must forward\r\nthis letter by Calais, and know not who may read it in these times of\r\ncuriosity, I am forced to be guarded; but the news are as follows,\r\nof the 23rd--curious coincidence, as your letter was also of that\r\ndate--that, the moment _approaching, many and serious_ difficulties\r\narise, and that the expedition was considered imprudent by some\r\npeople, that, besides, the presence would perhaps be required,\r\nbefore the _possible_ departure, at the _usual home_ of the person\r\ninterested, that therefore for the present it would perhaps be best to\r\ngive it up. I must say that I am _most happy_ that matters have come\r\nto this pass, because it would have been next to impossible to arrange\r\naffairs properly in proper time.

My\r\nfriendship for the dear King and Queen makes me, as you may easily\r\nunderstand, wish most exceedingly to see them and to make the\r\nacquaintance of the Queen and all the family. And I feel the immense\r\nkindness of them all in wishing to see me, and in coming over for only\r\na few hours. Politically it would be _wished_ by _us all_, and the\r\n_only_ difficulty I see is the following, which is, that _I do not\r\nfeel quite_ equal to going to Brighton and receiving them all, so soon\r\nafter the Prorogation.[55] I do not _feel_ well; I feel _thoroughly_\r\nexhausted from all that I have gone through this Session, and am quite\r\nknocked up by the two little trips I made to Windsor. This makes me\r\nfear, uncertain as it all is, with such a pressure of business, so\r\nmany affairs, and with so much going on, that I should be unequal to\r\nthe journey and the whole thing. This, and this _alone_, could make me\r\nexpress a wish that this most kind visit should take place _next_\r\nyear instead of this year. I feel such regret really in saying this--I\r\nshould so wish to see them, and yet I feel I am not _quite_ up to\r\nit. You will understand me, dear Uncle, I am certain, as I know the\r\nanxiety you always express for my health. For _once_ I _long_ to leave\r\nLondon, and shall do so on Friday. If you could be at Windsor by the\r\n4th, I should be delighted.\r\n\r\nThe dear Ferdinands, whom I _all dearly_ love, will await you here.\r\nI have had so much to do and so many people to see, that I feel quite\r\nconfused, and have written shockingly, which you must forgive.

I _do\r\nlove you tenderly_, and with all the power of affection which is often\r\nfound in characters who do not make much outward show of it. I love\r\nyou _for yourself_, and I love in you the dear child whose welfare I\r\ncarefully watched. My great wish is always that you should _know_\r\nthat I am _desirous_ of _being useful_ to you, without _hoping for\r\nany other return_ than some little affection from your warm and kind\r\nheart. I am even so far pleased that my eternal political affairs are\r\nsettled, as it takes away the _last possibility_ of imagining that I\r\nmay want something or other. I have all the honours that can be given,\r\nand I am, politically speaking, very solidly established, more so than\r\nmost Sovereigns in Europe. The only political longing I still have\r\nis for the Orient, where I perhaps shall once end my life, unlike\r\nthe sun, rising in the West and setting in the East. I never press\r\nmy services on you, nor my councils, though I may say with some truth\r\nthat from the extraordinary fate which the higher Powers had ordained\r\nfor me, my experience, both political and of private life, is great.

In the first place\r\nI don't think one can _reckon_ on the Cousins arriving here on the\r\n30th. Well, all I want is that _you_ should detain them one or two\r\ndays longer, in order that they may arrive here on _Thursday, the\r\n3rd_, if possible _early_. My reason for this is as follows: a number\r\nof the Ministers are coming down here on Monday to stay till Thursday,\r\non affairs of great importance, and as you know that people are always\r\non the alert to make remarks, I think if _all_ the Ministers were to\r\nbe down here when they arrive, people would say--it was to _settle\r\nmatters_. At all events it is better to avoid this. I think indeed a\r\nday or two at Brussels will do these young gentlemen good, and\r\nthey can be properly fitted out there for their visit. Ever yours\r\ndevotedly,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _1st October 1839._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR UNCLE,--I received your kind letter on Sunday, for which many\r\nthanks. The _retard_ of these young people puts me rather out, but of\r\ncourse cannot be helped. I had a letter from Albert yesterday saying\r\nthey could not set off, he thought, before the 6th. I think they don't\r\nexhibit much _empressement_ to come here, which rather shocks me.\r\n\r\nI got a very nice letter from dear Alexander yesterday from\r\nReinhardtsbrun;[57] he says Albert is very much improved, but not\r\ntaller than Augustus. His description of him is as follows:--\"Albert,\r\nI found, had become stronger and more handsome; still he has not grown\r\nmuch taller; he is of about the same size as Augustus; he is a most\r\npleasant, intelligent young man. I find, too, that he has become more\r\nlively than he was, and that sits well on him, too.\" (_Translation._)\r\nI think you may like to hear this, as I know Alexander is a very\r\ncorrect observer of persons, and his opinion may be relied upon. He\r\nadds that Albert plagues Leopold beyond measure.\r\n\r\nI shall take care and send a gentleman and carriages to meet my\r\ncousins, either at Woolwich or the Tower, at whichever place you\r\ninform me they land at. The sooner they come the better. I have got\r\nthe house _full_ of Ministers. On Monday the Queen Dowager is coming\r\nto sleep here for two nights; it is the _first time_, and will be a\r\nsevere trial.

I received another\r\nletter from Alex. M. yesterday, _since Ernest's arrival_, and he says\r\nthat they have determined on setting off, so as to embark at Antwerp\r\non the 9th and be here after all on the 10th!

I shall therefore (unless I hear from you to the contrary)\r\nsend one of my equerries and two carriages to the Tower on _Thursday_.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to hear of the serious disturbances at Ghent; I trust it\r\nis all got under now. If you should hear anything more of Roi\r\nGuillaume's[58] marriage, pray let me hear it, as it is such an odd\r\nstory. Old Alava, who was here for two nights last week, told me he\r\nknew _Pauline d'Oultremont_ many years ago, when she was young and\r\nvery gay and pretty, but that he wonders much at this marriage, as the\r\nKing hates Catholics. Alava is _rayonnant de bonheur_.\r\n\r\nI told Lord Melbourne of your alarms respecting the financial crisis,\r\nwhich _we_ did not bring on--those wild American speculations are the\r\ncause of it--and he desires me to assure you that we will pursue as\r\nmoderate and cautious a course as possible.\r\n\r\nThe Queen Dowager came here yesterday and stays till to-morrow; she is\r\nvery cheerful and in good spirits....\r\n\r\nI must conclude in haste.

The dear cousins arrived at half-past seven on\r\nThursday, after a very bad and almost dangerous passage, but looking\r\nboth very well, and much improved. Having no clothes, they could not\r\nappear at dinner, but nevertheless _débutéd_ after dinner in their\r\n_négligé_. Ernest is grown quite handsome; Albert's _beauty_ is\r\n_most striking_, and he so amiable and unaffected--in short, very\r\n_fascinating_; he is excessively admired here. The Granvilles and Lord\r\nClanricarde[59] happened just to be here, but are gone again to-day.\r\nWe rode out yesterday and danced after dinner. The young men are very\r\namiable, delightful companions, and I am very happy to have them here;\r\nthey are playing some Symphonies of Haydn _under_ me at this very\r\nmoment; they are passionately fond of music.\r\n\r\nIn the way of news I have got nothing to tell you to-day. Everything\r\nis quiet here, and we have no particular news from abroad.

My mind is quite made up--and I told Albert this morning\r\nof it; the warm affection he showed me on learning this gave me\r\n_great_ pleasure. He seems _perfection_, and I think that I have the\r\nprospect of very great happiness before me. I _love_ him _more_ than I\r\ncan say, and I shall do everything in my power to render the sacrifice\r\nhe has made (for a _sacrifice_ in my opinion it is) as small as I\r\ncan. He seems to have a very great tact--a very necessary thing in his\r\nposition. These last few days have passed like a dream to me, and I\r\nam so much bewildered by it all that I know hardly how to write; but I\r\n_do_ feel _very_, _very_ happy.\r\n\r\nIt is absolutely necessary that this determination of mine should be\r\nknown to _no one_ but yourself, and Uncle Ernest--till the meeting of\r\nParliament--as it would be considered otherwise neglectful on my part\r\nnot to have assembled Parliament at once to have informed them of\r\nit.... Lord Melbourne, whom I of course have consulted about the whole\r\naffair, quite approves my choice, and expresses great satisfaction\r\nat the event, which he thinks in every way highly desirable. Lord\r\nMelbourne has acted in this business, as he has always done towards\r\nme, with the greatest kindness and affection.\r\n\r\nWe also think it better, and Albert quite approves of it, that\r\nwe should be married very soon after Parliament meets, about the\r\nbeginning of February; and indeed, loving Albert as I do, I cannot\r\nwish it should be delayed. My feelings are a _little_ changed, I must\r\nsay, since last Spring, when I said I couldn't _think_ of marrying for\r\n_three or four years_; but seeing Albert has changed all this.\r\n\r\nPray, dearest Uncle, forward these two letters to Uncle Ernest\r\n(to whom I beg you will enjoin _strict_ secrecy, and explain these\r\ndetails, which I have not time to do) and to faithful Stockmar.\r\n\r\nI think you might tell Louise of it, but none of her family. I should\r\nwish to keep the dear young gentlemen here till the end of next month.\r\nErnest's sincere pleasure gave me great delight. He does so adore\r\ndearest Albert.

I had, when I saw your decision, almost the\r\nfeeling of old Zacharias[61]--\"Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart\r\nin peace\"! Your choice had been for these last years my conviction of\r\nwhat might and would be _best_ for your happiness; and just because I\r\nwas convinced of it, and knowing how _strangely_ fate often _deranges_\r\nwhat one tries to bring about as being the best plan one could fix\r\nupon, _the maximum of a good arrangement_, I feared that it would\r\n_not_ happen. In your position, which may and will, perhaps, become\r\nin future even more difficult in a political point of view, _you could\r\nnot exist_ without having a _happy_ and an _agreeable intérieur_.\r\n\r\nAnd I am much deceived--which I think I am not--or you will find\r\nin Albert just the very qualities and dispositions which are\r\nindispensable for your happiness, and _which will suit your own\r\ncharacter, temper, and mode of life_. You say most amiably that you\r\nconsider it a sacrifice on the part of Albert. This is true in many\r\npoints, because his position will be a difficult one; but much, I may\r\nsay _all_, will depend on your affection for him. If _you love him,\r\nand are kind to him_, he will easily bear the burthen of the position;\r\nand there is a steadiness and at the same time cheerfulness in his\r\ncharacter which will facilitate this. I think your plans excellent.\r\nIf Parliament had been called at an unusual time it would make them\r\nuncomfortable, and if, therefore, they receive the communication at\r\nthe opening of the Session, it will be best. The marriage, as you say,\r\nmight then follow as closely as possible.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne has shown himself the _amiable_ and _excellent_ man I\r\nalways took him for. Another man in his position, instead of _your_\r\nhappiness, might have merely looked to his own personal views and\r\nimaginary interests. Not so our good friend; he saw what was best _for\r\nyou_, and I feel it deeply to his praise.\r\n\r\nYour keeping the cousins next month with you strikes me as a very good\r\nplan. It will even show that you had sufficient opportunity of judging\r\nof Albert's character....\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd, Prince Metternich came to see me. He was very kind, and\r\ntalked most confidentially about political affairs, particularly the\r\nOriental concerns.[62] M. de Brunnow had been with him. The short of\r\nhis views is this: he wishes that the Powers could be _unanimous_,\r\nas he sees in this the best chance of avoiding measures of violence\r\nagainst the Pasha of Egypt, which he considers _dangerous_, either as\r\n_not_ sufficiently effective, or of a nature to bring on complications\r\nmost earnestly to be avoided, such as making use of Russian troops.\r\nAustria naturally would like to bring about the best possible\r\narrangement for the Porte, but it will adhere to any arrangement or\r\nproposition which can be agreed upon by England and France. He is,\r\nhowever, positive that Candia must be given back to the Porte, its\r\nposition being too threatening, and therefore constantly alarming the\r\nPorte. He made me write the import of our conversation to King Louis\r\nPhilippe, which I did send after him to Frankfort, where he was to\r\nforward it to Paris. Perhaps you will have the goodness to communicate\r\nthis political scrap to good Lord Melbourne with my best regards. He\r\nspoke in praise of Lord Beauvale.[63] The Prince is better, but grown\r\nvery old and looking tired. It gave me great pleasure to see him\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nI drink the waters now four days, and can therefore not yet judge of\r\ntheir good or bad effects. My palpitations are rather increased here;\r\nif my stupid heart will get diseased I shall soon be departing for\r\nsome other world. I would it could be soon then.\r\n\r\nTill further orders I shall say nothing to your Mother, Charles, or\r\nFeodore.\r\n\r\nNow I will conclude with my best blessings, and remain, my dearest and\r\nmost beloved Victoria, your devoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 61: An obvious slip for Simeon.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 62: _See_ Introductory Notes for 1839 and 1840.\r\n      (to Ch.

I was sure\r\nyou would be satisfied and pleased with our proceedings.\r\n\r\nBefore I proceed further, I wish just to mention one or two\r\nalterations in the plan of announcing the event.\r\n\r\nAs Parliament has _nothing_ whatever to say respecting the marriage,\r\ncan neither approve nor disapprove it (I mean in a manner which might\r\n_affect_ it), it is now proposed that, as soon as the cousins are gone\r\n(which they now intend to do on the 12th or 14th of November, as time\r\npresses), I should assemble all the Privy Councillors and announce to\r\nthem my intention....\r\n\r\nOh! dear Uncle, I _do_ feel so happy! I do so adore Albert! he is\r\nquite an angel, and so very, very kind to me, and seems so fond of me,\r\nwhich touches me much. I trust and hope I shall be able to make him\r\nas happy as he _ought_ to be! I cannot bear to part from him, for we\r\nspend such happy, delightful hours together.\r\n\r\nPoor Ernest has been suffering since Wednesday last with the jaundice,\r\nwhich is very distressing and troublesome, though not alarming.... I\r\nlove him dearly too, and look upon him quite as a brother.\r\n\r\nWhat you say about Lord Melbourne has given me great pleasure; it is\r\nvery just and very true. There are not many _such_ honest kind friends\r\nto be found in this world. He desires me to say that he is deeply\r\nsensible of your good opinion, and that he can have no other object\r\nthan that which he considers best to secure my happiness, which is\r\nclosely connected with the well-being of the country.\r\n\r\nI am glad you saw Prince Metternich, and that you were satisfied with\r\nthe interview.\r\n\r\nI hope and trust you may derive much benefit from your stay at\r\nWiesbaden. Pray name me to good Stockmar, and believe me, always, your\r\nmost devoted Niece and Child,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: CONGRATULATIONS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Queen of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _9th November 1839._\r\n\r\nMY MOST BELOVED VICTORIA,--Your Uncle has already told you, I trust,\r\nwith what feelings of deep affection and gratitude I received the so\r\n_interesting_ and _important_ communication which you permitted him\r\nto make to me; but I was longing for an opportunity to speak to you\r\nmyself of the great subject which fills now our hearts, and to tell\r\nyou how very grateful I have been, I am, and will ever be, for the\r\nconfidence and trust which you so kindly placed in me. All I can\r\nsay is that you did full justice to my feelings, for _nothing_ could\r\ninterest _more_ my heart than _your_ marriage, my most dearly loved\r\nVictoria, and I could not have heard even of that of Clémentine with\r\n_more_ anxious affection and sisterly love. I cannot really tell you\r\n_with words_ how deeply and strongly I was moved and affected by the\r\ngreat news itself, and by your dear, unaffected, confiding, happy\r\nletter. When I received it I could do nothing but cry, and say\r\ninternally, \"May God bless her now and ever!\" Ah! may God bless you,\r\nmy most beloved Victoria! may He shower on you His best blessings,\r\nfulfil _all_ your heart's wishes and hopes, and let you enjoy for\r\n_many, many years_ the happiness which the dearest ties of affection\r\n_alone_ can give, and which is the only _real_ one, the only worthy of\r\nthe name in this uncertain and transitory world!\r\n\r\nI have seen much of dear Albert two years ago, I have watched him, as\r\nyou may well think, with particular care, attention, and interest, and\r\nalthough he was very young then, I am well convinced that he is not\r\nonly fit for the situation which he is now called to fulfil, but, what\r\nis still more important in my eyes, that he has _all those qualities_\r\nof the heart and the mind which can give and ensure happiness. I think\r\neven that his disposition is particularly well calculated to suit\r\nyours, and I am fully confident that you will be both happy together.\r\nWhat you tell me of your fear of not being worthy of him, and able to\r\nmake him sufficiently happy, is for me but a proof more of it. Deep\r\naffection makes us always diffident and _very humble_. Those that we\r\nlove stand so high in our own esteem, and are in our opinion so much\r\nabove us and all others that we naturally feel unworthy of them and\r\nunequal to the task of making them happy: but there is, I think, a\r\nmingled charm in this feeling, for although we regret not to be\r\nwhat we should wish to be for them, feeling and acknowledging the\r\nsuperiority of those we love and must always love and respect, is a\r\ngreat satisfaction, and an increasing and everlasting one. You will\r\nfeel it, I am sure, as well as I do....\r\n\r\nYou will excuse my blots and hurried scribbling when I will tell you\r\nthat in order to profit of the private messenger which goes to-morrow\r\nmorning I write to you at ten in the evening, a thing quite unusual\r\nfor me, and even rather forbidden: but after having been deprived of\r\nexpending my heart for so many days, I could not _not_ avail myself of\r\nthe present opportunity. When I write to you by the ordinary messenger\r\nI will continue to be _silent_; but I trust you will permit me to\r\nsay some time a word, when a safe opportunity presents itself, for my\r\nheart is with you more than I can tell. I would that I could see you,\r\nwhen it could be, for an hour. I remain, my most beloved Victoria,\r\never and ever your most affectionate\r\n\r\nLOUISE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE ANNOUNCEMENT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Duke of Sussex._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _11th November 1839._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR UNCLE,--The affection which you have shown me makes me feel\r\ncertain that you will take interest in an event which so nearly\r\nconcerns the future happiness of my life; I cannot, therefore, delay\r\nany longer to inform you of my intended marriage with my Cousin\r\nAlbert, the merits of whose character are so well known by all who\r\nare acquainted with him, that I need say no more than that I feel as\r\nassured of my own happiness as I can be of anything in this world.\r\n\r\nAs it is not to be publicly known, I beg you not to mention it except\r\nto our own Family.\r\n\r\nI hope you are well and enjoying yourself.

I had written less of late, because I thought you\r\noccupied more agreeably than to read my letters. I have on purpose\r\nkept back a courier, to be able to send you the latest news from here\r\nof M. Albert. The young people arrived here only on the 20th, in the\r\nmorning, having very kindly stopped at Bonn. I find them looking well,\r\nparticularly Albert; it proves that happiness is an excellent remedy,\r\nand keeps people in better health than any other. He is much attached\r\nto you, and moved when he speaks of you. He is, besides, in great\r\nspirits and gaiety, and full of fun; he is a very amiable companion.\r\n\r\nConcerning the peerage, that is a matter to be considered at any\r\ntime; the only reason why I do wish it is, that Albert's foreignership\r\nshould disappear as much as possible. I have, in different\r\ncircumstances to be sure, suffered greatly from my having declined\r\nconditionally the peerage when it was offered me in 1816.[69] Your\r\nUncle[70] writes to you in German: as far as I understood him, he\r\nspeaks of the necessity of a marriage treaty; that is a matter of\r\ncourse. There is, however, something additional to be regulated\r\nconcerning the possible succession in the Coburg-Gotha dominions,\r\nthere being betwixt it and Albert but good Ernest. Some regulation\r\nbecomes therefore necessary, at least reasonable. The Duke wishes also\r\nto know if the treaty is to be made in England or in Germany.\r\nShould the last of the two be fixed upon, he thinks that one of your\r\nMinisters abroad would be the proper person for it. Ever, my dear\r\nVictoria, your devoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 69: The Dukedom of Kendal was offered to, and, after\r\n    consideration, declined by, Prince Leopold.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 70: The Duke of Saxe-Coburg (Ernest I.).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _26th November 1839._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR UNCLE,--I thank you for your kind letter which I received\r\nthe day before yesterday; but I fear you must have been very dull at\r\nWiesbaden....\r\n\r\nEverything went off uncommonly well on the 23rd, but it was rather\r\nformidable;[71] eighty-two Privy Councillors present; everybody very\r\nmuch pleased--and I was loudly greeted on leaving the Palace _after_\r\nthe Council.\r\n\r\nThe _whole Cabinet_ agree with me in being _strongly_ of opinion that\r\nAlbert should _not_ be a Peer; indeed, I see everything against it and\r\n_nothing_ for it; the English are very jealous at the idea of Albert's\r\nhaving any political power, or meddling with affairs here--which I\r\nknow from himself he will _not_ do.\r\n\r\nAs Wiesbaden is half-way (or thereabouts) to Coburg, I take the\r\nliberty of enclosing a large letter to Albert, which I beg you to send\r\non to him.\r\n\r\nWe are quite flooded here, and the road to Datchet is quite\r\nimpassable.

We had a good talk this morning about\r\nyour arrangements for our marriage, and also about your official\r\nattendants, and he[74] has told me that young Mr. Anson (his Private\r\nSecretary), who is with him, greatly wishes to be with you. I am very\r\nmuch in favour of it, because he is an excellent young man, and very\r\nmodest, very honest, very steady, very well-informed, and will be of\r\n_much use_ to you. He is not a member of the House of Commons, which\r\nis also convenient; so long as Lord Melbourne is in office he remains\r\nhis Secretary--but William Cowper[75] was also for some time Secretary\r\nto his Uncle, and at the same time my Groom-in-Waiting.

You may entirely rely upon me that\r\nthe people who will be about you will be absolutely pleasant people,\r\nof high standing and good character. _These gentlemen will not be in\r\ncontinual attendance on you; only on great occasions, and to accompany\r\nyou when you go anywhere, and to dinners, etc. Seymour is your\r\nconfidential attendant, and also Schenk and Anson,[76] whom Lehzen\r\nhas written to you about._\r\n\r\n_Old Sir George Anson has been told of your gracious wish to have him\r\nas Groom of the Bedchamber and is delighted._\r\n\r\n_I_ can only have _Lords_, and they will not be _Peers_, but _Lords_,\r\nthe eldest sons of Dukes or Marquesses, or Earls (Counts), and who as\r\nfar as possible are not in Parliament, for then they need not change,\r\n_but your people are appointed by you and not by me (nominally), and\r\ntherefore, unless they were to vote against my Government (which would\r\nbe awkward), they need not change. You may rely upon my care that you\r\nshall have proper people, and not idle and not too young, and Lord\r\nMelbourne has already mentioned several to me who would be very\r\nsuitable...._\r\n\r\nI have received to-day an ungracious letter from Uncle Leopold. He\r\nappears to me to be nettled because I no longer ask for his advice,\r\nbut dear Uncle is given to believe that he must rule the roast\r\neverywhere. However, that is not a necessity. As he has written to\r\nMelbourne, Melbourne will reply to him on every point, and will also\r\ntell him that Stockmar ought to come here as soon as possible to\r\narrange everything about the treaty. That will be a very good thing,\r\nbecause Stockmar understands all English things so well.\r\n\r\nThe _Second_, as you always called Palmerston, is to be married within\r\nthe next few days to Lady Cowper, the sister of my Premier (_Primus_);\r\nI have known this for a long time, but Melbourne asked me not to tell\r\nit to any one. They are, both of them, above fifty, and I think that\r\nthey are quite right so to act, because Palmerston, since the death\r\nof his sisters, is quite alone in the world, and _Lady C._ is a very\r\nclever woman, and _much_ attached to him; still, I feel sure it will\r\nmake you smile.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 76: Mr George Anson had been Private Secretary to\r\n    Lord Melbourne; it was on Lord Melbourne's recommendation that\r\n    the Queen appointed him Private Secretary to Prince Albert.\r\n    The Prince was inclined to resent the selection, and to think\r\n    that in the case of so confidential an official he should have\r\n    been allowed to make his own nomination. But they became firm\r\n    friends, and the Prince found Mr Anson's capacity, common\r\n    sense, and entire disinterestedness of the greatest value to\r\n    him. Later he became keeper of the Prince's Privy Purse, and\r\n    died in 1849.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_Continued on the 9th_).--To-day I have had a _Conseil_, and then I\r\nknighted the Mayor of Newport[77] (who distinguished himself so much\r\nin that _riot of the Chartists_[78]); he is a very timid, modest man,\r\nand was very happy when I told him orally how exceedingly satisfied I\r\nam with his conduct.... The officers have been rewarded too.... I am\r\nplaguing you already with tiresome politics, but you will in that find\r\na proof of my [confidence] love,[79] because I must share with you\r\neverything that rejoices me, everything that vexes or grieves me, and\r\nI am certain you will take your part in it....\r\n\r\nTo-day I saw Lord William Russell--you know him, don't you?

Melbourne has asked me to enquire of you whether\r\nyou know Lord Grosvenor? He is the eldest son of the Marquis\r\nof Westminster, and does not belong to any party; he is not in\r\nParliament. He is very pleasant, speaks German very well, and has been\r\na good deal on the Continent.

I was quite miserable at not hearing from Albert\r\nfor _ten_ days; such a long silence is quite insupportable for any\r\none in my position towards Albert, and I was overjoyed on receiving\r\nyesterday the _most_ dear, _most_ affectionate, delightful long letter\r\nfrom him. He writes so beautifully, and so simply and unaffectedly.\r\nI hope, dear Uncle, you received my last letter (quite a packet) for\r\nAlbert, on the 5th or 6th? I send you another now. I fear I am very\r\nindiscreet about these letters, but I have so much to tell him, and\r\nit will only last two months, so that I trust you will forgive it, and\r\nforward them.\r\n\r\nI mentioned the topics you spoke of to me in your letter to our good\r\nfriend Lord Melbourne, and as he is writing, I leave it to him to\r\nexplain to you, as he writes so much better than I do. He will explain\r\nto you _why_ the word Protestant was left out in the Declaration,\r\nwhich I think was quite right; for do what one will, nothing will\r\nplease these Tories.... I shall be delighted to see Stockmar here, for\r\nso many reasons, and the quicker he comes the better....\r\n\r\nI have a favour to ask you, dear Uncle, which I hope you will grant,\r\nunless it should be _indiscreet_ in me. It is, if you have still got\r\nAunt Charlotte's bust at Claremont, if you would give it to me to put\r\nin the Gallery here, where you would see it _oftener_ than you do at\r\nClaremont, and I am so anxious there should be one of her _here_.\r\n\r\nWe have _vile_ weather, cold and foggy; such fogs we have here! I move\r\nto London for good on the 9th or 10th of January.

I like Lady A---- very much too, only she is a little _strict and\r\nparticular_, and too severe towards others, which is not right; for\r\nI think one ought always to be indulgent towards other people, _as I\r\nalways think, if we had not been well brought up and well taken care\r\nof, we might also have gone astray_. That is always my feeling. Yet\r\nit is always right to show that one does not like to see what is\r\nobviously wrong; but it is very dangerous to be _too_ severe, and I am\r\ncertain that as a rule such people always greatly regret that in their\r\nyouth they have not been as careful as they ought to have been. I have\r\nexplained this so badly, and written it so badly, that I fear you will\r\nhardly be able to make it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _15th December 1839._\r\n\r\n... Again no letter from you!... Lord Melbourne left here this\r\nmorning, but comes back to-morrow evening, after the wedding of his\r\nsister. I hope he will remain here, because I am fond of him, and\r\nbecause he has a share in all my happiness, and is the only man with\r\nwhom I can speak without _gêne_ on everything, which I cannot do with\r\nmy Court.\r\n\r\n\"Islay\"[80] is still plagued by him every evening--a thing which he\r\nmuch enjoys--and constantly begs for the spectacles. I forgot to tell\r\nyou that Karl has given me a pretty little Rowley, who likewise lives\r\nin the house. The multitude of dogs is really terrible!\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of Declaration must have been very fine and touching, and\r\nI am most happy that the good people of Coburg are so pleased with our\r\nmarriage....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 80: A pet dog of the Queen's.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dec. 17th._--I have spoken to Lord M. about your wish, and he\r\nsays--what is my own opinion too--_that your people ought to be as\r\nmuch as possible out of Parliament when they have hardly any politics,\r\nwhich is the best thing--as your Household must not form a contrast\r\nto mine--and therefore you could not have violent Tories amongst your\r\npeople; but you may be quite certain that both I and Lord Melbourne\r\nwill take the greatest care to select respectable and distinguished\r\npeople, and people of good character. Perhaps Lord Grosvenor may be\r\nyour Groom of the Stole, though he is no Peer; but his rank and family\r\nare so high, that he would do very well; and, besides, not belonging\r\nto any party, and being out of Parliament, is such a great advantage._\r\n\r\nThe design of our Arms without _supporters_ is unfortunately not\r\nfinished, but I send you a little drawing which I have made of it\r\nmyself. The report of Sir William Woods I beg you will send back, but\r\nthe Arms you can keep.\r\n\r\nI add a little pin as a small Christmas present. I hope you will\r\nsometimes wear it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE PROTESTANT QUESTION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _14th December 1839._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST VICTORIA,--I lived in the hope of receiving some letters\r\nfor you from Albert, but nothing is arrived to-day. Your dear long\r\nletter gave me great pleasure. Before I answer some parts of it, I\r\nwill say a few words on Lord Melbourne's letter. Perhaps you will be\r\nso good to tell him that it gratified me much. It is the letter of an\r\nhonest and an amiable statesman, practical and straightforward. In\r\nthe omission of the word \"Protestant\" he was probably right, and it is\r\nequally probable that they would have abused him--maybe even more if\r\nhe had put it in. There is only this to say, however: the Ernestine\r\nbranch of the Saxon family has been, there is no doubt, the real cause\r\nof the establishment of Protestantism in Germany, and consequently in\r\ngreat parts of Northern Europe. This same line became a martyr to that\r\ncause, and was deprived of almost all its possessions in consequence\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nRecently there have been two cases of Catholic marriages, but the main\r\nbranch has remained, and is, in fact, very sincerely Protestant. Both\r\nErnest and Albert are much attached to it, and when deviations took\r\nplace they were connected more with new branches transplanted out of\r\nthe parent soil than with what more properly must be considered as the\r\nreigning family.\r\n\r\nThe Peerage question may remain as it is, but it will not be denied\r\nthat the great object must be to make Albert as English as possible,\r\nand that nothing will render this more difficult than a foreign\r\nname....\r\n\r\nI shall be most happy to see poor Charlotte's bust in the Gallery at\r\nWindsor, and it is kind of you to have had the thought. She was a high\r\nand noble-minded creature, and her affection and kindness for me\r\nvery great. She had placed the most unbounded confidence in me; our\r\nprinciple had been never to let a single day pass over any little\r\nsubject of irritation. The only subjects of that sort we had were\r\nabout the family, particularly the Regent, and then the old Queen\r\nCharlotte. Now I must conclude with my best love. Ever, my dearest\r\nVictoria, your devoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: A MISSING LETTER]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _17th December 1839._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR UNCLE,--Many thanks for your two most kind letters.

You are very kind to\r\nthink about my stupid health; I don't think I _ever_, at least not\r\nfor _very_ long, have _walked_ so regularly as I have done this last\r\nmonth--out in fog, and mist, and wind, and cold. But I cannot be\r\notherwise than agitated; getting _no_ letter makes me ill, and\r\n_getting_ them excites me....\r\n\r\nI have much to write, and therefore cannot make this a long letter,\r\nbut _one_ thing more I must mention. The very day of the Declaration\r\nin Council, on the 23rd ult., I sent off a letter to Albert, by Van\r\nde Weyer, saying it was to be forwarded _sans délai_ to Coburg; now,\r\nAlbert _never_ has received that letter, which was a long one, and\r\nthanks me for two, of the 26th and 29th. This vexes me much, and\r\nI can't help thinking the letter is lying either at Wiesbaden or\r\nBrussels. Would you graciously enquire, for I should not like it to be\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nForgive my writing such a letter so full of _myself_. Ever, dearest\r\nUncle, your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE PRINCE'S SECRETARY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE.\r\n\r\n_The 22nd._--I have but little time to write. The Duchess of\r\nSutherland is here, who admires you much, and is very sympathetic....\r\n\r\n_The 23rd._--Your letter of the 15th just received. I will now answer\r\nat once. _It is, as you rightly suppose, my greatest, my most anxious\r\nwish to do everything most agreeable to you, but I must differ with\r\nyou respecting Mr Anson.... What I said about Anson giving you advice,\r\nmeans, that if you like to ask him, he can and will be of the greatest\r\nuse to you, as he is a very well-informed person. He will leave Lord\r\nMelbourne as soon as he is appointed about you. With regard to your\r\nlast objection, that it would make you a party man if you took the\r\nSecretary of the Prime Minister as your Treasurer, I do not agree in\r\nit; for, though I am very anxious you should not appear to belong to a\r\nParty, still it is necessary that your Household should not form a too\r\nstrong contrast to mine, else they will say, \"Oh, we know the Prince\r\nsays he belongs to no party, but we are sure he is a Tory!\" Therefore\r\nit is also necessary that it should appear that you went with me in\r\nhaving some of your people who are staunch Whigs; but Anson is not\r\nin Parliament, and never was, and therefore he is not a violent\r\npolitician. Do not think because I urge this, Lord M. prefers it; on\r\nthe contrary, he never urged it, and I only do it as I know it is for\r\nyour own good._ You will pardon this long story. _It will also not do\r\nto wait till you come to appoint all your people. I am distressed\r\nto tell you what I fear you do not like_, but it is necessary, my\r\ndearest, most excellent Albert. Once more I tell you that you can\r\nperfectly rely on me in these matters....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE TORIES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _26th December 1839._\r\n\r\n... The Historical Sketch has interested us greatly; Lord Melbourne\r\nread it through immediately. I greatly thank you also for the\r\ngenealogical tree you sent me.\r\n\r\nNow, my dearest, to be about what is _not so pleasant or amusing.\r\nI mean, now for business. I always think it safer to write that in\r\nEnglish, as I can explain myself better, and I hope you can read my\r\nEnglish, as I try to be very legible. I am much grieved that you feel\r\ndisappointed about my wish respecting your gentlemen, but very glad\r\nthat you consent to it, and that you feel confidence in my choice.\r\nRespecting the Treasurer, my dearest Albert, I have already written\r\nat great length in my last letter, so I will not say much more about\r\nit to-day, but I will just observe that, tho' I fully understand\r\n(indeed no one could feel more for you in the very trying position you\r\nwill be placed in than I do) your feelings, it is absolutely necessary\r\nthat an Englishman should be at the head of your affairs; therefore\r\n(tho' I will not force Mr. Anson on you) I ask you if it is not better\r\nto take a man in whom I have confidence, and whom I know well enough\r\nto trust perfectly, than a man who is quite a stranger, and whom I\r\nknow nothing of?_\r\n\r\nI am very glad that your father knows Lord Grosvenor. As to the\r\nTories, I am still in a rage;[81] they abuse and grumble incessantly\r\nin the most incredible manner.\r\n\r\nI will tell good Lord Melbourne that you are very grateful. That you\r\nwill write to him is very nice of you, and makes me glad. I shall\r\nalways feel very happy if you, my dearest Albert, will be very\r\nfriendly to this good and just man; and I am convinced that, when you\r\nwill know him more intimately, you will be as fond of him as I am.\r\nNo one is more abused by bad people than Lord M.--_and nobody is so\r\nforgiving_....\r\n\r\nI have just learned that my two uncles, the Dukes of Sussex and\r\nCambridge (_to whom Lord M. had written_) _very willingly consent to\r\nlet you take precedence of them; it was, of course, necessary to ask\r\nthem about it...._\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 81: _Lit._ raging (_wuthend_). The phrase was a\r\n    favourite one of King Leopold's, from whom the Queen had\r\n    adopted it.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _27th December 1839._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR UNCLE,--Just two words (though you don't deserve _half a one_,\r\nas your silence is unpardonable) to say I have just heard from Albert,\r\nwho, I am glad to say, consents to _my_ choosing his people; so _one\r\nessential_ point is gained, and we have only the Treasurer to carry\r\nnow. I am sure, as you are so anxious Albert should be thoroughly\r\nEnglish, you will see how necessary it is that an Englishman should be\r\nat the head of his financial affairs.\r\n\r\nI see that you wrote to Lord Melbourne that you were glad to hear I\r\ntook more walking exercise, but I must tell you that ever since I\r\nhave done so I sleep badly, and feel unwell! If the weather would only\r\nallow me to ride I should be quite well. Ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE PRINCE AND LORD MELBOURNE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _30th December 1839._\r\n\r\n... I here enclose Lord Melbourne's letter. I have read it, and _I\r\nthink that nothing could be better; it is just what I told you, and it\r\nis the honest and impartial advice of a very clever, very honest,\r\nand very impartial man, whose_ greatest wish is to secure your and\r\nmy happiness. Follow this advice and you may be sure of success. Lord\r\nMelbourne told me that he had it written on purpose in a clear hand,\r\nby one of his secretaries, as he thought and feared you would not be\r\nable to read his own hand, which I daresay would have been the case,\r\nas he writes a very peculiar hand; he has therefore only signed it.\r\n\r\nI saw to-day the Duke of Cambridge, who has shown me your letter, with\r\nwhich he is quite delighted--and, indeed, it is a very nice one. The\r\nDuke told Lord Melbourne he had always greatly desired our marriage,\r\nand never thought of George; but that _I_ do not believe.\r\n\r\nI must conclude, my dearest, beloved Albert. Be careful as to your\r\nvaluable health, and be assured that no one loves you as much as your\r\nfaithful VICTORIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\r\n\r\nTO CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe marriage of the Queen and Prince Albert took place amid great\r\nsplendour and general rejoicings on the 10th of February; the general\r\nsatisfaction being unaffected by the tactless conduct of Ministers\r\nwho, by not acting in conjunction with the Opposition, had been\r\ndefeated on the question of the amount of the Prince's annuity, the\r\nHouse of Commons reducing it from £50,000 to £30,000.\r\n\r\nAt home, the Privilege Question aroused great interest, a point which\r\nfor months convulsed the Courts and Parliament being whether a report,\r\nordered by the House to be printed, of a Committee appointed by the\r\nHouse, was protected by privilege against being the subject of an\r\naction for libel. The Courts having decided that it was not, an\r\nAct was passed to alter the rule for the future, but meanwhile the\r\nsheriffs had been imprisoned by the House for executing the judgment\r\nin the usual course.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry tottered on, getting a majority of nine only on their\r\nChina policy, and twenty-one on a direct vote of confidence. The\r\nBill for the union of the two Canadas was, however, passed without\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nAn attempt by a barman named Oxford to assassinate the Queen on\r\nConstitution Hill fortunately failed, and Oxford was committed, after\r\ntrial, to a lunatic asylum. In July, the prospect of an heir being\r\nborn to the throne led to the passing of a Regency Bill, naming Prince\r\nAlbert Regent, should the Queen die leaving issue; the Duke of Sussex\r\nalone entered a formal protest against it.\r\n\r\nAfghanistan continued unsettled, and Lord Auckland's policy seemed\r\nhardly justified by the unpopularity at Cabul of Shah Sooja; Dost\r\nMahommed still made efforts to regain his position, but he ultimately\r\nsurrendered to Sir William Macnaghten, the British Envoy at Cabul.\r\nThe disputes with China continued, and hostilities broke out; British\r\nships proceeded to China, and Chusan was captured.\r\n\r\nIn France an attempt against the Government was made by Louis\r\nNapoleon, who landed at Boulogne in a British steamer, was captured,\r\nand sentenced to life imprisonment. More serious difficulties between\r\nthis country and France arose out of Eastern affairs. The Four Powers,\r\nEngland, Russia, Austria, and Prussia, had addressed an ultimatum to\r\nMehemet, requiring him to evacuate North Syria, France declining to\r\ntake part in the conference on the subject. An Anglo-Austrian army\r\nundertook to eject him, St Jean d'Acre was stormed, and France thrust\r\ninto a position of unwilling isolation. Thiers, who had been made\r\nMinister, expected that Mehemet would be able to retain his conquests,\r\nand for a time it looked as though France would interfere to protect\r\nhim. Ultimately, in spite of some ostentatious preparations in France,\r\npeaceful counsels prevailed, and Thiers found it advisable to retire\r\nin favour of Guizot.\r\n\r\nIn Holland, William I. (then sixty-seven) abdicated in favour of his\r\nson, the Prince of Orange (William II.). The need of a younger\r\nand firmer ruler was the reason officially stated in the Royal\r\nProclamation. The real reasons were probably the King's attachment\r\nto the Roman Catholic Countess d'Oultremont, whom he now privately\r\nmarried, and the humiliation he felt at the unfavourable termination\r\nof the Belgian dispute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n1840\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _11th January 1840._\r\n\r\nSTOCKMAR is here; I saw him yesterday and to-day, and have begged him\r\nto explain to you _all the Court affairs, and the affairs concerning\r\nthe Treaty_, in my name. He will explain to you the Treasury affair,\r\nand will do it much better than I should. I am very happy to see him\r\nagain, and to have him here; he can give such good advice to both of\r\nus, and he understands England so fully.... Stocky (as I always\r\nused to call him) is so sensible about everything, and is _so much_\r\nattached to you.\r\n\r\nI shall have no great dinners, because the large rooms in the upper\r\nstory here are not yet ready. My good old Primus[1] usually dines\r\nwith me three or four times a week, almost always on Sundays, _when I\r\ncannot invite other people to dinner, as it is not reckoned right here\r\nfor me to give dinners on Sunday, or to invite many people_. Your song\r\n(the bust has been mentioned before) is very fine; there is something\r\ntouching in it which I like so much....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: _I.e._ Premier.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: OPENING OF PARLIAMENT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _12th January 1840._\r\n\r\nThis letter will be handed you by Torrington personally. I recommend\r\nyou not to leave late, so as to make the journey without hurry. I did\r\nnot go to church to-day; the weather is very cold, and I have to be\r\ncareful not to catch cold before the 16th, because I open Parliament\r\nin person. _This is always a nervous proceeding, and the announcement\r\nof my marriage at the beginning of my speech is really a very nervous\r\nand awful affair for me. I have never failed yet, and this is the\r\nsixth time that I have done it, and yet I am just as frightened as if\r\nI had never done it before. They say that feeling of nervousness\r\nis never got over, and that Wm. Pitt himself never got up to make\r\na speech without thinking he should fail. But then I only read my\r\nspeech._\r\n\r\nI had to-day a visit from George[2] whom I received _alone_, and he\r\nwas very courteous. His Papa I have also seen.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: Prince George of Cambridge.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _17th January 1840._\r\n\r\n... Yesterday just as I came home from the House of Lords,[3] I\r\nreceived your dear letter of the 10th. I cannot understand at all why\r\nyou have received no letters from me, seeing that I always wrote twice\r\na week, regularly....\r\n\r\nI observe with horror that I have not formally invited your father;\r\nthough that is a matter of course. My last letter will have set that\r\nright. I ought not to have written to you on picture notepaper, seeing\r\nthat we are in deep mourning for my poor Aunt, the Landgravine,[4] but\r\nit was quite impossible for me to write to you on mourning paper....\r\n\r\n_But this will not interfere with our marriage in the least; the\r\nmourning will be taken off for that day, and for two or three days\r\nafter, and then put on again._\r\n\r\nEverything went off exceedingly well yesterday. There was an immense\r\nmultitude of people, and perhaps never, certainly not for a long\r\ntime, have I been received so well; and what is remarkable, I _was\r\nnot nervous_, and read the speech really well. The Tories began\r\nimmediately afterwards to conduct themselves very _badly_ and to\r\nplague us. But everyone praised you very much. Melbourne made a very\r\nfine speech about you and your ancestors. To-day I receive the\r\nAddress of the House of Lords, and, perhaps, also that of the House of\r\nCommons.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: The Queen had opened Parliament in person, and\r\n    announced her intended marriage.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: The Princess Elizabeth (born 1770), third\r\n    daughter of George III. and widow of the Landgrave Frederick\r\n    Joseph Louis of Hesse-Homburg. _See_ p. 195.

Here hardly\r\nanything to relate to-day, because we are living in great retirement,\r\nuntil informed that my poor Aunt has been buried. With the exception\r\nof Melbourne and my own people, no one has dined for the last week.\r\n\r\nWe are all of us very much preoccupied with politics. The Tories\r\nreally are very astonishing; _as they cannot and dare not attack us in\r\nParliament, they do everything that they can to be personally rude to\r\nme.... The Whigs are the only safe and loyal people, and the Radicals\r\nwill also rally round their Queen to protect her from the Tories;\r\nbut it is a curious sight to see those, who as Tories, used to pique\r\nthemselves upon their excessive loyalty, doing everything to degrade\r\ntheir young Sovereign in the eyes of the people. Of course there are\r\nexceptions._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _31st January 1840._\r\n\r\n... You have written to me in one of your letters about our stay at\r\nWindsor, but, dear Albert, you have not at all understood the matter.\r\n_You forget, my dearest Love, that I am the Sovereign, and that\r\nbusiness can stop and wait for nothing. Parliament is sitting, and\r\nsomething occurs almost every day, for which I may be required, and it\r\nis quite impossible for me to be absent from London; therefore two\r\nor three days is already a long time to be absent. I am never easy a\r\nmoment, if I am not on the spot, and see and hear what is going on,\r\nand everybody, including all my Aunts (who are very knowing in all\r\nthese things), says I must come out after the second day, for, as I\r\nmust be surrounded by my Court, I cannot keep alone. This is also my\r\nown wish in every way._\r\n\r\nNow as to the Arms: _as an English Prince you have no right, and Uncle\r\nLeopold had no right to quarter the English Arms, but the Sovereign\r\nhas the power to allow it by Royal Command: this was done for Uncle\r\nLeopold by the Prince Regent, and I will do it again for you. But it\r\ncan only be done by Royal Command._\r\n\r\nI will, therefore, without delay, have a seal engraved for you.\r\n\r\nYou will certainly feel very happy too, at the news of the coming\r\nunion of my much-beloved Vecto[5] with Nemours. It gives me quite\r\ninfinite pleasure, because then I can see the dear child more\r\nfrequently.\r\n\r\nI read in the newspaper that you, dear Albert, have received many\r\nOrders; also that the Queen of Spain will send you the Golden\r\nFleece....\r\n\r\nFarewell, dearest Albert, and think often of thy faithful\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: The Princess Victoire of Saxe-Coburg, cousin of\r\n    Queen Victoria.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE PRINCE'S GRANT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nBRUSSELS, _31st January 1840._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST VICTORIA,--I am most grateful for your long letter of the\r\n27th and 28th inst. I send a messenger to be able to answer quite\r\nconfidentially. I must confess that I never saw anything _so\r\ndisgraceful_ than the discussion and vote in the Commons.[6] The whole\r\nmode and way in which those who opposed the grant treated the\r\nquestion was so extremely _vulgar_ and _disrespectful_, that I cannot\r\ncomprehend the Tories. The men who uphold the dignity of the Crown to\r\ntreat their Sovereign in such a manner, on such an occasion! Even in\r\nprivate life the most sour and saturnine people relax and grow gay\r\nand mildly disposed on occasions like this. Clearly, as you are Queen\r\nRegnant, Albert's position is to all intents and purposes that of a\r\nmale Queen Consort, and the same privileges and charges ought to be\r\nattached to it which were attached to Queen Adelaide's position. The\r\ngiving up the income which the Queen-Dowager came into, and which I\r\nhope and trust Albert would never have, or have had, any chance of\r\nhaving had himself, was in reality giving up a thing which _custom_\r\nhad sanctioned. That Prince George of Denmark[7] was considered to\r\nbe in the same position as a Queen Consort there can be, I think,\r\nno doubt about, and when one considers the immense difference in the\r\nvalue of money then and now, it renders matters still more striking.\r\nI must say such conduct in Parliament I did _not expect_, and the\r\nless when I consider that your Civil List was rather curtailed than\r\notherwise, perhaps not quite fairly. I rejoice to think that I induced\r\nLord Melbourne to propose to you not to accede to the giving up of\r\nthe Duchy of Lancaster. Parliament did not deserve it, and by good\r\nmanagement I think something may be made of it.\r\n\r\nAnother thing which made me think that Parliament would have acted\r\nwith more decency, is that I return to the country now near £40,000\r\na year, _not because_ I thought my income _too large_, as worthy Sir\r\nRobert Peel said, but from motives of political delicacy, which at\r\nleast might be acknowledged on such occasions. I was placed by my\r\nmarriage treaty in the position of a Princess of Wales, which in\r\nreality it was, though not yet by law, there existing a possibility of\r\na Prince of Wales as long as George IV. lived. I can only conclude by\r\ncrying _shame, shame_!...\r\n\r\nI hope and trust you will not be too much worried with all these\r\nunpleasant things, and that Albert will prove a comforter and support\r\nto you. And so good-bye for to-day. Ever, my dearest Victoria, your\r\ndevoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: The Ministers proposed an income of £50,000 a\r\n    year for the Prince--the Conservatives and Radicals united on\r\n    an amendment reducing it to £30,000, which was carried by a\r\n    majority of 104.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: The Consort of Queen Anne.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE PRINCE AT BRUSSELS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nBRUSSELS, _1st February 1840._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST VICTORIA,--I hope you will be pleased with me, as I send a\r\nmessenger on purpose to inform you of Albert's arrival. He will write\r\nhimself this night, though rather inclined to surrender himself to\r\nMorpheus.\r\n\r\nHe looks well and handsome, but a little interesting, being very much\r\nirritated by what happened in the House of Commons. He does not\r\ncare about the money, but he is much shocked and exasperated by the\r\ndisrespect of the thing, as he well may.\r\n\r\nI do not yet know the exact day of their departure, but I suppose it\r\nwill be on the 5th, to be able to cross on the 6th. I have already\r\nhad some conversation with him, and mean to talk _à fond_ to him\r\nto-morrow. My wish is to see you both happy and thoroughly united\r\nand of one mind, and I trust that both of you will ever find in me a\r\nfaithful, honest, and attached friend.\r\n\r\nAs it is eleven o'clock at night, I offer you my respects, and remain,\r\never, my dearest Victoria, your devoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\nYour poor Aunt fainted this morning; she is much given to this, but it\r\nwas rather too long to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: AMIABILITY OF THE PRINCE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nBRUSSELS, _4th February 1840._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST VICTORIA,--I have now treated all the questions you wished\r\nme to touch upon with Albert, and I was much pleased with his amiable\r\ndisposition. At a certain distance explanations by letter are next to\r\nimpossible, and each party in the end thinks the other unreasonable.\r\nWhen he arrived he was rather exasperated about various things, and\r\npretty full of grievances. But our conversations have dissipated these\r\nclouds, and now there will only remain the new parliamentary\r\nevents and consequences, which change a good deal of what one could\r\nreasonably have foreseen or arranged. You will best treat these\r\nquestions now verbally. Albert is quick, not obstinate, in\r\nconversation, and open to conviction if good arguments are brought\r\nforward. When he thinks himself right he only wishes to have it\r\n_proved_ that he _misunderstands_ the case, to give it up without\r\nill-humour. He is not inclined to be sulky, but I think that he may be\r\nrendered a little melancholy if he thinks himself unfairly or unjustly\r\ntreated, but being together and remaining together, there _never_\r\ncan arise, I hope, any occasion for any disagreement even on trifling\r\nsubjects.... Ever, my dearest Victoria, your devoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nBRUSSELS, _8th February 1840._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST VICTORIA,--This letter will arrive when I trust you will\r\nbe most happily occupied; I don't mean therefore to trespass on your\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMay Heaven render you as happy as I always wished you to be, and as I\r\nalways tried hard to see you. There is every prospect of it, and I\r\nam sure you will be mistress in that respect of your own _avenir_.\r\n_Perfect confidence_ will best ensure and consolidate this happiness.\r\nOur rule in poor Charlotte's time was never to permit _one single day_\r\nto pass over _ein Missverständniss_, however trifling it might be.[8]\r\nI must do Charlotte the justice to say that she kept this compact most\r\nreligiously, and at times even more so than myself, as in my younger\r\ndays I was sometimes inclined to be sulky and silently displeased.\r\nWith this rule no misunderstandings can take root and be increased or\r\ncomplicated by new ones being added to the old. Albert is gentle and\r\nopen to reason; all will therefore always be easily explained, and he\r\nis determined never to be occupied but by what is important or useful\r\nto you....\r\n\r\nNow I conclude, with my renewed warmest and sincerest good wishes for\r\nyou, ever, my dearest Victoria, your devoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: _(From an unpublished Contemporary Memoir by\r\n    Admiral Sir William Hotham, G.C.B.)_\r\n\r\n    \"Her Royal Highness was now and then apt to give way to a high\r\n    flow of animal spirits, natural at her time of life, and from\r\n    carelessness more than unkindness to ridicule others. In one\r\n    of these sallies of inconsiderate mirth, she perceived the\r\n    Prince, sombre and cold, taking no apparent notice of what was\r\n    going on, or if he did, evidently displeased. She at length\r\n    spoke to him about it, and he at once manifested reluctance\r\n    to join in the conversation, saying that though he had been a\r\n    tolerably apt scholar in many things, he had yet to learn in\r\n    England what pleasure was derived from the exercise of that\r\n    faculty he understood to be called \"quizzing\"; that he could\r\n    by no means reconcile it to himself according to any rule\r\n    either of good breeding or benevolence. The tears instantly\r\n    started in her eye, and feeling at once the severity and\r\n    justice of the reproof, assured him most affectionately\r\n    that, as it was the first time she had ever merited His Royal\r\n    Highness's reproof on this subject, she assured him most\r\n    solemnly it should be the last.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE WEDDING-DAY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Prince Albert._[9]\r\n\r\n_10th February 1840._\r\n\r\nDEAREST,--...

Really, I do not think it _possible_ for any\r\none in the world to be _happier_, or AS happy as I am. He is an Angel,\r\nand his kindness and affection for me is really touching. To look in\r\nthose dear eyes, and that dear sunny face, is enough to make me adore\r\nhim. What I can do to make him happy will be my greatest delight.\r\nIndependent of my great personal happiness, the reception we both\r\nmet with yesterday was the most gratifying and enthusiastic I ever\r\nexperienced; there was no end of the crowds in London, and all along\r\nthe road. I was a good deal tired last night, but am quite well again\r\nto-day, and happy....\r\n\r\nMy love to dear Louise.

News from you are always\r\nmost precious to me, and now almost more than ever. This is such\r\nan important moment in your life, it will so much decide how the\r\nremainder is to be, that I am deeply interested in all I can hear on\r\nthe subject. Hitherto, with the exception of your own dear and\r\nRoyal self, I have not been spoiled, _et j'ai puisé beaucoup de mes\r\nnouvelles_ in the _Times_ and such like sources.\r\n\r\nGod be praised that the dear _ménage_ is so happy! I can only say may\r\nit be so for ever and ever. I always thought that with your warm and\r\nfeeling heart and susceptibility for strong and lasting affection, you\r\nwould prefer this _genre_ of happiness, if you once possessed it, to\r\nevery other. It must be confessed that it is less frequent than could\r\nbe wished for the good of mankind, but when it does exist, there is\r\nsomething delightful to a generous heart like yours in this sacred\r\ntie, in this attachment for better for worse, and I think the English\r\nChurch service expresses it in a simple and touching manner.\r\n\r\nI was happy to see that the Addresses of both Houses of Parliament\r\nwere voted in a decent and becoming way. How mean people are! If\r\nthey had not seen the public at large take a great interest in your\r\nmarriage and show you great affection, perhaps some would again have\r\ntried to bring on unpleasant subjects....\r\n\r\nMy letter is grown long; I will therefore conclude it with the\r\nexpression of my great affection for your dear self.

Mr\r\nWarburton moved an adjournment, which caused many members to leave the\r\nHouse. The motion being opposed, there were on a division 240 against\r\nadjournment, and only 125 in favour of it.\r\n\r\nMr Warburton then by some blunder moved that the House adjourn, which\r\nputs an end to the debate. This was eagerly caught at by the opposite\r\nparty, and agreed to. So that the question is lost by this ridiculous\r\ntermination, and it is to be feared that it will produce much\r\ndiscontent in the manufacturing class.[10]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 10: The opposition to the Corn Laws was now\r\n    increasing in the North.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_5th April 1840._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.

It would have been much better that what horses the\r\nPrince had should have been kept quite separate, and that the horses\r\nof your Majesty's which he should have to use should have been\r\nsettled, and some plan arranged by which they could have been obtained\r\nwhen wanted. Horses to be used by one set of people and kept and fed\r\nby another will never do. Servants and subordinate agents in England\r\nare quite unmanageable in these respects. If they get [matters] into\r\ntheir hands neither the Deity nor the Devil, nor both together, can\r\nmake them agree. Lord Melbourne writes this in ignorance of the actual\r\nfacts of the case, and therefore it may be inapplicable.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 11: Master of the Horse.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_8th April 1840._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has\r\nthe honour to state that Sir James Graham yesterday brought forward\r\nhis motion on China in a speech of nearly three hours.[12] He was\r\nanswered by Mr Macaulay in a manner most satisfactory to his audience,\r\nand with great eloquence.

He has just\r\nreceived this from Lord John Russell--a most shocking event,[15] which\r\nyour Majesty has probably by this time heard of. The persons who did\r\nit came for the purpose of robbing the house; they entered by the back\r\nof the house and went out at the front door.[16] The servants in the\r\nhouse, only a man and a maid, never heard anything, and the maid, when\r\nshe came down to her master's door in the morning, found the horrid\r\ndeed perpetrated....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 15: The murder of Lord William Russell by his valet,\r\n    Courvoisier, in Norfolk Street, Park Lane.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16: This was the original theory.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MURDER OF LORD WILLIAM RUSSELL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_6th May 1840._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. Since he\r\nwrote to your Majesty, he has seen Mr Fox Maule,[17] who had been\r\nat the house in Norfolk Street. He says that it is a most mysterious\r\naffair. Lord William Russell was found in his bed, quite dead, cold\r\nand stiff, showing that the act had been perpetrated some time. The\r\nbed was of course deluged with blood, but there were no marks of blood\r\nin any other part of the room; so that he had been killed in his bed\r\nand by one blow, upon the throat, which had nearly divided his head\r\nfrom his body. The back door of the house was broken open, but there\r\nwere no traces of persons having approached the door from without.\r\nHis writing-desk was also broken open and the money taken out, but\r\notherwise little or nothing had been taken away. The police upon duty\r\nin the streets had neither heard nor seen anything during the night.\r\nIn these circumstances strong suspicion lights upon the persons in\r\nthe house, two maids and a man, the latter a foreigner[18] and who had\r\nonly been with Lord William about five weeks. These persons are now\r\nseparately confined, and the Commissioners of Police are actively\r\nemployed in enquiring into the affair. An inquest will of course be\r\nheld upon the body without delay.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne has just received your Majesty's letter, and will\r\nimmediately convey to Lord John your Majesty's kind expressions of\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 17: Under-Secretary for Home Affairs; afterwards, as\r\n    Lord Panmure, Secretary for War.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18: Courvoisier.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MRS NORTON]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PRINCESS CHARLOTTE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _22nd May 1840._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST VICTORIA,--I received yesterday a most kind and dear letter\r\nfrom your august hands. Charles,[19] who wanted to cross yesterday,\r\nwill have had very bad weather. He _is_ prepared not to make too long\r\na stay in England. He dined here on the 19th. Louise was prepared\r\nto come to dinner, but was not quite equal to it; she therefore came\r\nafter it. He came also to see me on the 20th, before his departure for\r\nOstende. It is very gracious of you to have given him subsidies, but\r\nin fact poor Feo stands more in need of it. She really is too poor;\r\nwhen one thinks that they have but £600 a year, and that large\r\ncastles, etc., are to be kept up with it, one cannot conceive how they\r\nmanage it. It was a very generous feeling which prompted you to see\r\nMrs Norton, and I have been too much her friend to find fault with it.\r\nTrue it is that Norton was freely accepted by her, but she was very\r\npoor, and could therefore hardly venture to refuse him. Many people\r\nwill flirt with a clever, handsome, but poor girl, though not marry\r\nher--besides, the idea of having old Shery[20] for a grandfather had\r\nnothing very captivating. A very unpleasant husband Norton certainly\r\nwas, and one who had little tact. I can well believe that she was much\r\nfrightened, having so many eyes on her, some of which, perhaps, not\r\nwith the most amiable expression.\r\n\r\nI was delighted to learn that you meant to visit poor Claremont, and\r\nto pass there part of your precious birthday. Claremont is the place\r\nwhere in younger days you were least plagued, and generally I saw you\r\nthere in good spirits. You will also _nolens volens_ be compelled to\r\nthink of me, and maybe of poor Charlotte.\r\n\r\nThis gives me an opening for saying a few words on this subject. I\r\nfound several times that some people had given you the impression that\r\npoor Charlotte had been hasty and violent even to imperiousness and\r\n_rudeness_. I can you assure that it was _not so_; she was quick, and\r\neven violent, but I never have seen anybody so open to conviction, and\r\nso fair and candid when wrong. The proverb says, and not without some\r\ntruth, that ladies come always back to the first words, to avoid any\r\nsymptom of having been convinced. Generous minds, however, do not do\r\nthis; they fight courageously their battles, but when they clearly see\r\nthat they are wrong, and that the reasons and arguments submitted to\r\nthem are _true_, they frankly admit the truth. Charlotte had eminently\r\nthis disposition; besides, she was so anxious to please me, that often\r\nshe would say: \"Let it be as it may; provided you wish it, I will\r\ndo it.\" I always answered: \"I never want anything for myself; when I\r\npress something on you, it is from a conviction that it is for your\r\ninterest and for your good.\" I know that you have been told that she\r\nordered everything in the house and liked to show that she was the\r\nmistress. It was not so. On the contrary, her pride was to make\r\nme appear to my best advantage, and even to display respect and\r\nobedience, when I least wanted it from her. She would almost\r\nexaggerate the feeling, to show very clearly that she considered me as\r\nher lord and master.\r\n\r\nAnd on the day of the marriage, as most people suspected her of a very\r\ndifferent disposition, everybody was struck with the manner in which\r\nshe pronounced the promise of obedience. I must say that I was much\r\nmore the master of the house than is generally the case in private\r\nlife. Besides, there was something generous and royal in her mind\r\nwhich alone would have prevented her doing anything vulgar or\r\nill-bred. What rendered her sometimes a little violent was a slight\r\ndisposition to jealousy. Poor Lady Maryborough,[21] at all times some\r\ntwelve or fifteen years older than myself, but whom I had much known\r\nin 1814, was once much the cause of a fit of that description. I told\r\nher it was quite childish, but she said, \"it is not, because she is a\r\nvery coquettish, dissipated woman.\" The most difficult task I had was\r\nto change her manners; she had something brusque and too rash in her\r\nmovements, which made the Regent quite unhappy, and which sometimes\r\nwas occasioned by a struggle between shyness and the necessity of\r\nexerting herself. I had--I may say so without seeming to boast--the\r\nmanners of the best society of Europe, having early moved in it, and\r\nbeen rather what is called in French _de la fleur des pois_. A good\r\njudge I therefore was, but Charlotte found it rather hard to be so\r\nscrutinised, and grumbled occasionally how I could so often find fault\r\nwith her.\r\n\r\nNothing perhaps speaks such volumes as the _positive fact_ of her\r\nmanners getting _quite changed_ within a year's time, and that to\r\nthe openly pronounced satisfaction of the very fastidious and not\r\nover-partial Regent. To explain how it came that manners were a little\r\nodd in England, it is necessary to remember that England had been for\r\nmore than ten years completely cut off from the rest of the world....\r\n\r\nWe have bitter cold weather which has given colds to both the\r\nchildren. Uncle Ferdinand [22] is now only arriving _si dice_ on\r\nSunday next. He has been robbed of 15,000 francs in his own room _au\r\nPalais-Royal_, which is very unpleasant for all parties.\r\n\r\nMy letter is so long that I must haste to conclude it, remaining ever,\r\nmy beloved Victoria, your devoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\nMy love to Alberto.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 19: Prince Charles of Leiningen.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 20: The three sisters, Mrs Norton, Lady Dufferin,\r\n    and Lady Seymour (afterwards Duchess of Somerset), the latter\r\n    of whom was \"Queen of Beauty\" at the Eglinton Tournament, were\r\n    grand-daughters of R.

She said it\r\nproceeded entirely from indolence; she knew it was wrong, but when she\r\nwas with the Prince she preferred talking upon other subjects. I told\r\nHer Majesty that she should try and alter this, and that there was\r\nno objection to her conversing with the Prince upon any subject she\r\npleased. My impression is that the chief obstacle in Her Majesty's\r\nmind is the fear of difference of opinion, and she thinks that\r\ndomestic harmony is more likely to follow from avoiding subjects\r\nlikely to create difference. My own experience leads me to think that\r\nsubjects between man and wife, even where difference is sure to ensue,\r\nare much better discussed than avoided, for the latter course is sure\r\nto beget distrust. I do not think that the Baroness[23] is the cause\r\nof this want of openness, though her name to me is never mentioned by\r\nthe Queen.\"\r\n\r\n_Baron Stockmar._--\"I wish to have a talk with you. The Prince leans\r\nmore on you than any one else, and gives you his entire confidence;\r\nyou are honest, moral, and religious, and will not belie that trust.\r\nThe Queen has not started upon a right principle. She should by\r\ndegrees impart everything to him, but there is danger in his wishing\r\nit all at once. A case may be laid before him; he may give some\r\ncrude and unformed opinion; the opinion may be taken and the result\r\ndisastrous, and a forcible argument is thus raised against advice\r\nbeing asked for the future.\r\n\r\n\"The Queen is influenced more than she is aware of by the Baroness. In\r\nconsequence of that influence, she is not so ingenuous as she was two\r\nyears ago. I do not think that the withholding of her confidence does\r\nproceed wholly from indolence, though it may partly arise, as the\r\nPrince suggests, from the entire confidence which she reposes in her\r\npresent Ministers, making her inattentive to the plans and measures\r\nproposed, and thinking it unnecessary entirely to comprehend them; she\r\nis of necessity unable to impart their views and projects to him who\r\nought to be her friend and counsellor.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 23: Baroness Lehzen.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: OXFORD'S ATTEMPT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCARLTON TERRACE, _10th June 1840._\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and\r\nthough your Majesty must be overwhelmed with congratulations at\r\nyour Majesty's escape from the aim of the assassin,[24] yet Viscount\r\nPalmerston trusts that he may be allowed to express the horror with\r\nwhich he heard of the diabolical attempt, and the deep thankfulness\r\nwhich he feels at your Majesty's providential preservation.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston humbly trusts that the failure of this atrocious\r\nattempt may be considered as an indication that your Majesty is\r\nreserved for a long and prosperous reign, and is destined to assure,\r\nfor many years to come, the welfare and happiness of this nation.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 24: Edward Oxford, a pot-boy, aged eighteen, fired\r\n    twice at the Queen on Constitution Hill.

In your good little heart I hope that it made you\r\nfeel grateful to God for a protection which was very signal. It does\r\ngood and is a consolation to think that matters are not _quite_ left\r\nto take care of _themselves_, but that an all-powerful Hand guides\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nLouise I told the affair mildly, as it might have made too great an\r\nimpression on her otherwise. She always feels so much for you and\r\nloves you so much, that she was rejoiced beyond measure that you\r\nescaped so well and took the thing with so much _courage_. That you\r\nhave shown _great fortitude_ is not to be doubted, and will make a\r\nvery great and good impression. I see that the general feeling is\r\nexcellent, but what a melancholy thing to see a young man, without\r\nprovocation, capable of such a diabolical act! That attempts of that\r\nsort took place against George III., and even George IV., one can\r\ncomprehend; but you have not only been extremely liberal, but in no\r\ninstance have you hitherto come into contact with any popular feeling\r\nor prejudice; besides, one should think that your being a lady would\r\nalone prevent such unmanly conduct. It shows what an effect bad\r\nexample and the bad press have. I am sure that this act is _une\r\nsingerie_ of what passes in France, that it is a fancy of some of\r\nthose societies _de Mort aux Rois et Souverains_, without knowing\r\nwherefore, merely as a sort of fashion....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: EGYPT AND THE POWERS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nST CLOUD, _26th July 1840._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST VICTORIA,--Your dear letter of the 19th greatly delighted\r\nme....\r\n\r\nLet me now add a few words on politics. The _secret_ way in which the\r\narrangement about the arbitration of the Turco-Egyptian affairs has\r\nbeen signed, the keeping out of France in an affair so _near_ it\r\nand touching its interests in various ways, has had here a very\r\n_disastrous_ effect.[26] I cannot disguise from you that the\r\nconsequences may be very serious, and the more so as the Thiers\r\nMinistry is supported by the movement party, and as _reckless of\r\nconsequences_ as your own Minister for Foreign Affairs, even much more\r\nso, as Thiers himself would not be sorry to see everything existing\r\nupset. He is strongly impregnated with all the notions of fame and\r\nglory which belonged to part of the Republican and the Imperial times;\r\nhe would not even be much alarmed at the idea of a Convention ruling\r\nagain France, as he thinks that _he_ would be the _man to rule_ the\r\nAssembly, and has told me last year that he thinks it for France\r\nperhaps the _most powerful_ form of Government.[27]\r\n\r\nThe mode in this affair ought to have been, as soon as the Four Powers\r\nhad agreed on a proposition, to communicate it officially to France,\r\nto join it. France had but two ways, either to join or to refuse\r\nits adhesion. If it had chosen the last, it would have been a free\r\ndecision on her part, and a secession which had nothing offensive in\r\nthe eyes of the nation.\r\n\r\nBut there is a material difference between leaving a company from\r\nmotives of one's own, or being _kicked out_ of it. I must beg you to\r\nspeak seriously to Lord Melbourne, who is the head of your Government,\r\non these important affairs; they may upset everything in Europe if the\r\nmistake is not corrected and moderated.\r\n\r\nI shall write again to you next Friday from hence, and on Saturday,\r\n1st August, we set off. Ever, my dearest Victoria, your devoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 26: On the 15th of July a convention was signed in\r\n    London by representatives of England, Russia, Austria, and\r\n    Prussia, offering an ultimatum to the Viceroy of Egypt. The\r\n    exclusion of France was hotly resented in Paris. Guizot,\r\n    then Ambassador in London, had been kept in ignorance of the\r\n    project, but the Foreign Secretary, Lord Palmerston, denied\r\n    that there had been any discourtesy intended, or want of\r\n    consideration shown.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 27: Louis Adolphe Thiers (1797-1877), who through\r\n    the Press had contributed to the downfall of the Bourbons, had\r\n    held various Cabinet offices under Louis Philippe, and, from\r\n    March to October 1840, was for the second time Premier.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PRINCE LOUIS NAPOLEON]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_7th August 1840._ (10 P.M.)\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. The House of\r\nLords lasted until eight, and Lord Melbourne might by an exertion have\r\ngot to the Palace to dinner, but as he had the Speech, by no means an\r\neasy one, to prepare for the consideration of the Cabinet to-morrow,\r\nhe thought it better to take this evening for that purpose, and he\r\nhopes therefore that your Majesty will excuse his not coming, which is\r\nto him a great sacrifice to have made.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty will have probably seen by this time the report from\r\nyour Majesty's Consul at Boulogne of the mad attempt of Louis\r\nBonaparte.[28] It is rather unfortunate that it should have taken\r\nplace at this moment, as the violent and excited temper of the French\r\nnation will certainly lead them to attribute it to England. It will\r\nalso be highly embarrassing to the King of the French to have in\r\nhis possession a member of the family of Bonaparte and so many\r\nBonapartists who have certainly deserved death but whom it may not be\r\nprudent or politic to execute.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 28: The Prince, afterwards the Emperor Napoleon\r\n    III., descended on Boulogne with fifty-three persons, and\r\n    a tame eagle which had been intended, with stage effect, to\r\n    alight on the Colonne de Napoléon. He was captured, tried\r\n    for high treason, and sentenced to perpetual imprisonment. He\r\n    effected his escape, which was undoubtedly connived at by the\r\n    authorities, in 1846.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE CONVENTION OF 1828]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWIESBADEN, _22nd September 1840._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST VICTORIA,--I was most happy in receiving this morning per\r\nmessenger your dear little letter of the 15th, though it is grown a\r\nlittle elderly. The life one leads here is not favourable to writing,\r\nwhich, besides, is prohibited, and easily gives me palpitation enough\r\nto sing \"_di tanti palpiti!_\" I get up at half after six and begin to\r\ndrink this hot water; what with drinking and walking one comes to ten\r\no'clock or half after ten for breakfast. Then I read papers and such\r\nlike things. At one o'clock I have been generally bored with some\r\nvisit or other till two o'clock. I try to finish some writing, and\r\nthen I walk and ride out till dinner-time, generally at seven. In the\r\nevening I have written sometimes, but it certainly does one harm. You\r\nsee that there remains but little time for writing.\r\n\r\nI am most happy to find that you are well; the papers, which don't\r\nknow what to invent to lower the Funds, said that you had been unwell\r\non the 10th, which, God be praised! is not at all true.\r\n\r\nI pity poor Princess Augusta[29] from all my heart. I am sure that if\r\nshe had in proper time taken care of herself she might have lived to\r\na great age. I have not time to-day to write at any length on the\r\npolitics of the day, but I am _far from thinking_ that the French\r\n_acted wisely_ in the Oriental affair. I must say that I think\r\nthe King _meant well_, but I should not have _abstained_ from the\r\nConference as he did, though, in France, interference with Mehemet Ali\r\nwas certainly not popular. In England much of the _fond_ is logical,\r\nbut the form towards France was, and is still, harsh and insulting. I\r\ndon't think France, which these ten years behaved well, and the poor\r\nKing, who was nearly murdered I don't remember how often, deserved\r\nto be treated so unkindly, and all that seemingly to please the great\r\nAutocrat. We must not forget what were the fruits of the _first_\r\nConvention of July 1828--I think the 16th or 26th of that month; I\r\nought to remember it, as I took its name in vain often enough in the\r\nGreek affair.\r\n\r\nThis first Convention brought about the battle of Navarino and the\r\nsecond campaign of the Russians, which ended with, in fact, the demise\r\nof the poor old Porte, the _Treaty of Adrianople_.[30] Your Majesty\r\nwas then afflicted with the age of ten, in itself a good age, and may\r\nnot remember much about it except that in 1829 the affair about my\r\ngoing to Greece began, and that your affectionate heart took some\r\ninterest in that. Lord Melbourne, however, you _must encourage to\r\nspeak about this matter_. Canning's intention was this: he said we\r\nmust remain with Russia, and by this means _prevent_ mischief. The\r\nDuke of Wellington, who came to me shooting at Claremont in 1828,\r\nreally did cry, though he is not of a crying disposition, and said\r\n\"_by this Convention the Russians will have the power of doing all\r\nthey never would have dared to do single-handed_, and shielded by\r\nthis infernal Convention, it will not be in our power _to stop them_.\"\r\nRussia is again in this very snug and comfortable position, that\r\n_the special protection of the Porte_ is confided to its tender\r\nmercies--_la chèvre gardant le chou_, the wolf the sheep, as I suppose\r\nI must not compare the Turcs to lambs. The Power which ruined the\r\nOttoman Empire, which since a hundred and forty years nearly _pared_\r\nit all round nearly in every direction, is to be the protector and\r\nguardian of that same empire; and we are told that it is the most\r\nscandalous calumny to suspect the Russians to have any other than the\r\nmost humane and disinterested views! \"_ainsi soit-il_,\" as the French\r\nsay at the end of their sermons. This part of the Convention of the\r\n15th of July 1840 strikes impartial people as strange, the more so\r\nas nothing lowers the Porte so much in the eyes of the few patriotic\r\nTurks who remain than the protection of the arch-enemy of the concern,\r\nRussia. I beg you to read this part of my letter to my good and dear\r\nfriend, Lord Melbourne, to whom I beg to be kindly remembered.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 29: Princess Augusta, second daughter of George III.\r\n    _See_ p. 230.

But\r\nfor God's sake do not bring on a crisis;[32] the Queen really could\r\nnot go through that _now_, and it might make her _seriously ill_ if\r\nshe were to be kept in a state of agitation and excitement if a crisis\r\nwere to come on; she has had already so much lately in the distressing\r\nillness of her poor Aunt to harass her. I beseech you, think of _all_\r\nthis, and the consequences it might cause, not only to me, but to all\r\nEurope, as it would show our weakness in a way that would be seriously\r\ninjurious to this country.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 31: The letter, to which this is a reply, seems not\r\n    to have been preserved.

I regret her _very, very_\r\nsincerely, though for herself we are all most thankful for the release\r\nof such unexampled sufferings, borne with such unexampled patience.\r\nAlmost the last thing she said when she was still conscious, the day\r\nbefore she died, was to Mr More (the apothecary), who wrote me every\r\nmorning a Report: \"Have you written to my darling?\" Is this not\r\ntouching? The Queen-Dowager had her hand in hers when she died, and\r\nclosed her eyes when all was over; all the Family were present.\r\n\r\nI have seen your letters to Palmerston, and his answer to you, and I\r\nalso send you a paper from Lord Melbourne. I assure you that I _do_\r\ngive these affairs my _most serious_ attention: it would be indeed\r\n_most_ desirable if France could _come back to us_, and I think what\r\nMetternich suggests very sagacious and well-judged.[33] You must allow\r\nme to state that _France_ has _put herself_ into this unfortunate\r\nstate. _I_ know (as I saw _all_ the _papers_) how she was engaged\r\nto join us--and I know how strangely she refused; I know also, that\r\nFrance _agrees_ in the _principle_, but only doubts the _efficacy_ of\r\nthe measures. Where then is \"_La France outragée_\"? wherefore arm when\r\nthere is _no_ enemy? wherefore raise the war-cry? But this has been\r\n_done_, and has taken _more_ effect than I think the French Government\r\n_now_ like; and _now_ she has to undo all this and to calm the general\r\nagitation and excitement, which is not so easy. Still, though France\r\nis in the wrong, and _quite_ in the wrong, still _I_ am most anxious,\r\nas I am sure my Government also are, that France should be pacified\r\nand should again take her place amongst the five Powers. I am sure she\r\nmight easily do this....\r\n\r\nAlbert, who sends his love, is much occupied with the Eastern affairs,\r\nand is quite of my opinion....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 33: Metternich's suggestion was that if other\r\n    means of coercion failed, the allies should renew their\r\n    deliberations in conjunction with France.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _30th September 1840._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. He is quite\r\nwell, and will be ready at half-past one.\r\n\r\nThe Prince's[34] observations are just, but still the making an\r\nadvance to France now, coupled with our constant inability to carry\r\ninto effect the terms of our Convention, will be an humiliating step.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne sends a letter which he has received this morning from\r\nLord Normanby, whom he had desired to see Lord Palmerston and Lord\r\nJohn Russell, and try what he could do.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne also sends a letter which he has received from Lord\r\nLansdowne.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne would beg your Majesty to return them both.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 34: Prince Metternich.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nDOWNING STREET, _1st October 1840._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. We have had\r\nthe Cabinet and it has passed over quietly. We have agreed to make\r\na proposition to France founded upon the communication of Prince\r\nMetternich to the King of the Belgians.[35] Palmerston will propose\r\nto-morrow to Neumann,[36] the Prussian Minister, and Brunnow,[37] that\r\nhe should write to Granville, authorising him to acquaint Thiers that\r\nif France will concur in respecting the principle of the treaty, we,\r\nwithout expecting her to adopt coercive measures, will concert with\r\nher the further course to be adopted for the purpose of carrying the\r\nprinciple into effect. This is so far so good. Lord Melbourne trusts\r\nthat it will get over the present entanglement, but of course we must\r\nexpect that in a matter so complicated and which we have not the power\r\nof immediately terminating, further difficulties will arise.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 35: _See_ p. 231. (Ch. IX, Footnote 33)]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 36: Austrian Minister.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 37: Russian Minister.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MEHEMET ALI]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nDOWNING STREET, _2nd October 1840._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. We have just\r\nhad another Cabinet,[38] which was rendered necessary by Brunnow\r\nand the Prussian Minister refusing to concur in what we determined\r\nyesterday without reference to their Courts and authority from\r\nthem. This makes it impossible for us to take the step in the way\r\nwe proposed, but we have now settled that Palmerston should direct\r\nGranville to submit the proposition to Thiers, and ask him how he\r\nwould be disposed to receive it if it were formally made to him. This,\r\nso far as we are concerned, will have all the effect which could have\r\nbeen attained in the other way.\r\n\r\nVery important despatches of the 14th inst. have come from\r\nConstantinople. The Ministers of the Porte held the last proposition\r\nof Mehemet Ali as a positive refusal of the terms of the Convention,\r\nand proceeded by the advice of Lord Ponsonby[39] at once to divest\r\nMehemet Ali of the Pashalik of Egypt; to direct a blockade of the\r\ncoasts both of Syria and Egypt, and to recall the four Consuls from\r\nAlexandria. These are serious measures, and there are despatches from\r\nLord Beauvale[40] stating that Prince Metternich is much alarmed at\r\nthem, and thinks that measures should be immediately taken to diminish\r\nand guard against the effect which they may have in France. Lord\r\nMelbourne humbly begs your Majesty's pardon for this hurried scrawl\r\nupon matters of such importance, but Lord Melbourne will have\r\nthe opportunity of speaking to your Majesty more fully upon them\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 38: The peace party in the Cabinet were defeated and\r\n    Palmerston triumphant.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 39: British Ambassador at Constantinople.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 40: Frederick James Lamb, younger brother of Lord\r\n    Melbourne, and his successor in the title (1782-1853). He\r\n    was at this time Ambassador at Vienna, having previously been\r\n    Ambassador at Lisbon.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PALMERSTON AND FRANCE]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: VIEWS OF LOUIS PHILIPPE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWIESBADEN, _2nd October 1840._\r\n\r\n... There is an idea that Mehemet Ali suffers from what one calls _un\r\ncharbon_, a sort of dangerous ulcer which, with old people, is never\r\nwithout some danger. If this is true, it only shows how little one can\r\nsay that the Pashalik of Aleppo is to decide who is to be the master\r\nof the Ottoman Empire in Europe and Asia, the Sultan or Mehemet? It is\r\nhighly probable that if the old gentleman dies, his concern will go to\r\npieces; a division will be attempted by the children, but that in the\r\nEast hardly ever succeeds. There everything is personal, except the\r\nsort of Caliphate which the Sultan possesses, and when the man is\r\ngone, his empire _also goes_. Runjeet Singh[41] is a proof of this;\r\nhis formidable power will certainly go to the dogs, though the Sikhs\r\nhave a social link which does not exist in the Egyptian concern. If we\r\nnow were to set everything in Europe on a blaze, have a war which may\r\nchange totally all that now exists, and in the midst of it we should\r\nhear that Mehemet is no more, and his whole _boutique_ broken up,\r\nwould it not be _really laughable_, if it was not _melancholy_? And\r\nstill the war _once raging_, it would no longer put a stop to it, but\r\ngo on for _other reasons_.\r\n\r\nI cannot understand what has rendered Palmerston so _extremely hostile\r\nto the King_ and Government of France. A _little civility_ would have\r\ngone a great way with the French; if in your Speech on the 11th of\r\nAugust some regret had been expressed, it would have greatly modified\r\nthe feelings of the French. But Palmerston _likes to put his foot on\r\ntheir necks_! _Now, no statesman must triumph over an enemy that is\r\nnot quite dead_, because people forget a real loss, a real misfortune,\r\nbut they won't forget _an insult_. Napoleon made great mistakes that\r\nway; he hated Prussia, insulted it on all occasions, but still _left\r\nit alive_. The consequence was that in 1813 they rose to a man in\r\nPrussia, even children and women took arms, not only because they had\r\nbeen injured, but because they had been treated with _contempt_ and\r\n_insulted_. I will here copy what the King wrote to me lately from\r\nParis:\r\n\r\n\"Vous ne vous faites pas d'idée à quel point l'approbation publique\r\nsoutient les armements, c'est universel. Je regrette que cela aille\r\nbien au-delà, car la fureur contre l'Angleterre s'accroît et un\r\ndes points que je regrette le plus, c'est que tout notre peuple est\r\npersuadé que l'Angleterre veut réduire la France _au rang de Puissance\r\nsecondaire_, et vous savez ce que c'est que l'orgueil national et la\r\nvanité de tous les peuples. Je crois donc bien urgent que la crise\r\nactuelle se termine bientôt pacifiquement. Plus je crois que l'union\r\nde l'Angleterre et de la France est la base du repos du monde, plue je\r\nregrette de voir susciter tant d'irritation entre nos deux Nations.\r\nLa question est de savoir ce que veut véritablement le Gouvernement\r\nAnglais. J'avoue que je ne suis pas sans crainte et sans inquiétude à\r\ncet égard quand je récapitule dans ma tête tout ce que Lord Ponsonby\r\na fait pour l'allumer et tout ce qu'il fait encore. Je n'aurais aucune\r\ninquiétude si je croyais que le Gouvernement suivrait la voix de\r\nsa Nation, et les véritables intérêts de son pays qui repoussent\r\nl'alliance Russe et indiquent celle de la France, ce qui est\r\ntout-à-fait conforme à mes v[oe]ux personnels. Mais ma vieille\r\nexpérience me rappelle ce que font les passions personnelles, qui\r\nprédominent bien plus de nos jours que les véritables intérêts, et ce\r\nque peut le Gouvernement Anglais pour entraîner son pays, et je\r\ncrains beaucoup l'art de la Russie ou plutôt de l'Empereur Nicolas\r\nde captiver, par les plus immenses flatteries, les Ministres Anglais,\r\npreuve Lord Durham. Or si ces deux Gouvernements veulent ou osent\r\nentreprendre _l'abaissement_ de la France, la guerre s'allumera, et\r\npour _mon compte alors je m'y_ jetterai _à outrance_, mais si comme\r\nje l'espère encore, malgré mes soupçons, ils ne veulent pas la guerre,\r\nalors l'affaire de l'Orient, s'arrangera à l'amiable, et le cri de\r\ntoutes les Nations fera de nouveau justice de ces humeurs belliqueuses\r\net consolidera la paix générale, comme cela est arrivé dans les\r\npremières années de mon règne.\"\r\n\r\nI think it right to give you this extract, as it is written from\r\nthe very bottom of the King's heart, and shows the way in which he\r\nconsiders the present position of affairs. Perhaps you will be so\r\nkind to read it or to let it be read by Lord Melbourne. It is\r\nthis _abaissement de la France_ which now sticks in their throats.\r\nChartres[42] has quite the same feeling, and then the refrain is,\r\n_plutôt périr que de souffrir cette ignominie!_\r\n\r\nReally my paper is abominable, but it is a great shame that in the\r\nresidence of such a rich Prince nothing can be had.

Lord John\r\nRussell has directed a Cabinet to be summoned for to-morrow at three\r\no'clock, at which he intends to propose that \"Instructions should be\r\nsent to Lord Granville to ascertain from the French Government what\r\nterms France would consider satisfactory for the immediate arrangement\r\nof the affairs of the East.\"\r\n\r\nThat if such terms shall appear satisfactory, Mr Henry Bulwer[44] or\r\nsome person of similar rank should be sent to Constantinople to urge\r\ntheir acceptance on the Sultan, and that our Allies should be invited\r\nto co-operate in that negotiation.\r\n\r\nThat the French Government should be informed that the only mode in\r\nwhich the pacification can be carried into effect is by Mehemet Ali's\r\naccepting the terms of the treaty and then receiving from the Sultan\r\nthe terms which shall have been previously agreed upon by his Allies.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne feels certain that Lord Palmerston will not accede\r\nto these proposals, and indeed Lord Melbourne himself much doubts\r\nwhether, after all that has passed, it would be right to submit the\r\nwhole matter, as it were, to the decision and arbitration of France.\r\nLord John Russell seems very much determined to press this question\r\nto a decision to-morrow, and Lord Melbourne much fears that such a\r\ndecision may lead to serious consequences.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is much grieved to have to send your Majesty\r\nintelligence which he knows will greatly disquiet your Majesty, but\r\nthere is no remedy for it.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne's lumbago is somewhat better to-day but not much. His\r\nbeing compelled to attend at the House of Lords yesterday prevented\r\nhim from recovering. He has remained in bed to-day, and hopes to be\r\nbetter to-morrow.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 44: Henry Bulwer (1801-1872), afterwards Lord\r\n    Dalling, then First Secretary of the Embassy in Paris, became\r\n    Minister to Spain, 1843-1848; to the United States, 1849-1852;\r\n    to Tuscany, 1852-1855; and Ambassador to Turkey, 1858-1865.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PACIFIC INSTRUCTIONS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _9th October 1840._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. He has just\r\nreceived your Majesty's box. He will do all he can to put everything\r\ntogether, and it does not appear to him that there is any necessity\r\non any side for a decisive step at present. A letter is arrived to-day\r\nfrom Bulwer, which states that the instructions given to Guizot are,\r\nthrough the interposition of the King, of a very pacific character. It\r\nwould surely be well to see what they are, and whether they will not\r\nafford the means of arranging the whole affair.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne thought with your Majesty that the letter to Lord\r\nGranville upon Prince Metternich's proposition was a great deal too\r\nshort and dry and slight, but the importance of this step is now a\r\ngood deal superseded by what has taken place, and the position\r\nof affairs has already become different from that in which it was\r\nresolved upon.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne very much thanks the Prince for his letter, which may\r\ndo much service and have an effect upon the antagonists.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne has just seen Dr Holland.[45] Lord Melbourne is very\r\nmuch crippled and disabled. Lord Melbourne does not think that the\r\nshooting has had anything to do with it. His stomach has lately been\r\nout of order, which is always the cause of these sort of attacks. Lord\r\nMelbourne will come down on Sunday if he possibly can, and unless he\r\nshould be still disabled from moving.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 45: Dr (afterwards Sir) Henry Holland,\r\n    Physician-in-Ordinary to the Queen, 1850-1873, father of Lord\r\n    Knutsford.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _10th October 1840._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. ... All\r\nthe question at the Cabinet to-day as to whether we should write\r\na communication to France was fortunately put an end to by Guizot\r\ndesiring to see Palmerston in the morning and making a communication\r\nto him. This communication is very much in substance what Mr. Bulwer's\r\nnote had led us to expect. It is a strong condemnation of the act\r\nof the Porte depriving Mehemet Ali of the Government of Egypt,\r\nan expression of satisfaction at having already learned from Lord\r\nPalmerston and Count Apponyi[46] that Austria and England are not\r\nprepared to consider this act as irrevocable, and a threat on the\r\npart of France that he considers the power of Mehemet Ali in Egypt a\r\nconstituent part of the balance of Europe, and that he cannot permit\r\nhim to be deprived of that province without interfering. It was\r\ndetermined that this intimation should be met in an amicable spirit,\r\nand that Lord Palmerston should see the Ministers of the other Powers\r\nand agree with them to acquaint the French that they with England\r\nwould use their good offices to induce the Porte not to insist upon\r\nthe deprivation of Mehemet Ali as far as Egypt is concerned. Lord\r\nMelbourne hopes that this transaction may lead to a general settlement\r\nof the whole question.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne feels himself much fatigued to-night. Though better, he\r\nis yet far from well, and he knows by experience that this malady when\r\nonce it lays hold of him does not easily let go. It was so when he was\r\nyounger. He fears, therefore, that it will not be prudent for him to\r\nleave town so early as Monday, but will do so as soon as he can with\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 46: Born 1782; at this time the Austrian Ambassador\r\n    in France.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MEHEMET ALI]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nPANSHANGER, _11th October 1840._\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston submits to your Majesty some interesting letters,\r\nwhich he received some days ago from Paris, showing that there never\r\nhas been any real foundation for the alarm of war with France which\r\nwas felt by some persons in this country.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston also submits a despatch from Mons. Thiers to Mons.\r\nGuizot which was communicated to him yesterday by Mons. Guizot,\r\nand which seems to open a prospect of an amicable and satisfactory\r\nunderstanding between France and the Four Powers.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston also submits a note from Mr Bulwer intimating that\r\nthe French Government would be contented with an arrangement which\r\nshould leave Mehemet Ali in possession of Egypt alone, without any\r\npart of Syria, and Viscount Palmerston submits that such is the\r\narrangement which it would on all accounts be desirable to accomplish.\r\nThere seems reason to think that the bombardment of Beyrout[47] and\r\nthe deposal of Mehemet Ali by the Sultan have greatly contributed to\r\nrender the French more reasonable on this question, by exciting in\r\ntheir minds an apprehension that unless some arrangement be speedily\r\neffected, the operations now going on in the Levant will end in the\r\nentire overthrow of Mehemet Ali.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 47: On 10th October Ibrahim was defeated by\r\n    the Allies, and next day Beyrout was occupied by British,\r\n    Austrian, and Turkish troops.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: GUIZOT AND THIERS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _11th October 1840._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. He has not\r\nwritten before to-day, because he had nothing new to lay before your\r\nMajesty. Lord Melbourne anxiously hopes she feels some confidence\r\nthat the present state of the Eastern affairs is such as may lead to\r\na speedy, amicable termination--at the same time, with a nation so\r\nirritable as the French, and with the Constitution which they have and\r\nwhich they are unused to exercise, it is impossible to feel secure\r\nfor a moment. Guizot, when he gave the despatch of Thiers to Lord\r\nPalmerston, said that he had nothing to do with the reasonings of that\r\ndespatch, and would not enter into any argument upon them.\r\n\r\nHe delivered them only in his official capacity as the Ambassador of\r\nthe King of France. All he would say was that they were the result of\r\na great effort of that party in France which was for peace. This was a\r\nsufficient intimation that he himself did not approve of them, but it\r\nwas not possible to collect from what he said upon what grounds his\r\ndissent was founded. Lord Melbourne has since heard that he says, that\r\nhe considers that France has taken too low a tone and has made too\r\nmuch concession, and that he could not have been a party to this step\r\nif he had been one of the King's Ministers. The step is also probably\r\ncontrary to the declared opinion of M. Thiers; whether it be contrary\r\nto his real opinion is another question. But if it was written\r\nprincipally by the influence of the King, it is a measure at once bold\r\nand friendly upon his part, and the success of which will much depend\r\nupon its being met in an amicable spirit here.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne returns the letter of the King of the Belgians. Lord\r\nMelbourne kept it because he wished to show it to Lord John Russell,\r\nand some others, as containing an authentic statement of the feelings\r\nof the King of the French, which it is well that they should know....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _12th October 1840._\r\n\r\nThe Queen in returning these letters must express to Lord Palmerston\r\nher very great satisfaction at the favourable turn affairs have taken,\r\nand the Queen earnestly trusts that this demonstration of returning\r\namity on the part of France will be met in a very friendly spirit\r\nby Lord Palmerston and the rest of her Government. The Queen feels\r\ncertain that this change on the part of France is also greatly owing\r\nto the peaceable disposition of the King of the French, and she thinks\r\nthat in consideration of the difficulties the King has had to contend\r\nwith, and which he seems finally to have overcome, we should make\r\nsome return; and indeed, as Lord Palmerston states, the arrangement\r\nproposed is the best which can be desired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: FEELING IN FRANCE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _12th October 1840._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. He is much\r\nbetter to-day, free from pain and difficulty of moving, but he thinks\r\nthat it would not be prudent, and that he should run the risk of\r\nbringing back the complaint, if he should leave town to-morrow.\r\n\r\nHe thinks it might also be imprudent in another point of view, as\r\naffairs are still in a very unsettled state, and the rest of the\r\nCabinet watch with great impatience, and, to say the truth, not\r\nwithout suspicion, the manner in which Palmerston will carry into\r\neffect the decision of Saturday. They are particularly anxious\r\nfor speed, and I have written both last night and this morning to\r\nPalmerston, to urge him not to delay. He will go down to Windsor\r\nto-morrow, and your Majesty will then have an opportunity of speaking\r\nto him, upon which Lord Melbourne will write again to your Majesty.\r\n\r\nGuizot has been with Lord Melbourne this morning for the purpose of\r\nrepeating what he had before said to Palmerston, that the Note which\r\nhe delivered on Saturday was the result of a great effort made by the\r\nparty who are for peace, that it had been conquered against a strong\r\nopposition, that if it were not taken advantage of here now, it would\r\nnot be renewed, that the conduct of affairs in France would probably\r\nfall into the hands of the violent party, and that it would be no\r\nlonger possible to control the excited feelings of the people of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThe worst is that Palmerston, and John Russell, with now the\r\ngreater part of the Cabinet, proceed upon principles, opinions, and\r\nexpectations which are entirely different from one another, and which\r\ntherefore necessarily lead to a different course of action. We are\r\nanxious to finish the business speedily, because we fear that there is\r\ndanger of the Government of France being forced into violent measures\r\nby popular outcry. Palmerston, on the contrary, thinks that there is\r\nno danger of war, that the French do not mean war, and that there is\r\nno feeling in France but what has been produced by the Ministry and\r\ntheir instruments the Press.\r\n\r\nWe are anxious that the opportunity should be seized now whilst we\r\nhave the appearance of success in Syria, not being at all confident of\r\nthe ultimate result. Palmerston, on the contrary, is so confident of\r\ncomplete success, that he wishes to delay concluding the affair until\r\nhe can have the benefit of the full advantages, which he anticipates,\r\nin the negotiation.\r\n\r\nWe should be too glad to see the matter settled, leaving Mehemet Ali\r\nin possession of Egypt.\r\n\r\nPalmerston has both the wish and the hope of getting him out of Egypt,\r\nas well as Syria.\r\n\r\nThese great differences of view, object, and expectation render it\r\ndifficult for those who hold them to pursue the same line of conduct.\r\n\r\nThere is also, as your Majesty knows, much suspicion, distrust and\r\nirritation, and all these circumstances throw great obstacles in the\r\nway of the progress of affairs, but Lord Melbourne hopes that they\r\nwill all be overcome, and that we shall arrive at a safe conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: RELATIONS WITH FRANCE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _13th October 1840._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. It is\r\nabsolutely necessary that we should have a Cabinet on Thursday. There\r\nis so much natural impatience, and so deep an interest taken in what\r\nis now going on, that it cannot be avoided....\r\n\r\nYour Majesty will naturally seize this opportunity of stating strongly\r\nto Palmerston your wishes that this opportunity should be taken\r\nadvantage of, with a view to the speedy accommodation of the whole\r\ndifference. Your Majesty will see the necessity of at the same\r\ntime not appearing to take too much the part of France, which might\r\nirritate and indispose.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty will find John Russell perfectly right and reasonable.\r\nHe was before somewhat embarrassed by the position in which he was\r\nplaced. Having agreed to the Convention, it was difficult for him to\r\ntake steps which might appear to be in departure from its policy, and\r\nto be occasioned by the gravity of its consequences. But this step\r\nupon the part of France will enable all the friends of peace to act\r\ncordially together. John Russell thinks that you have not been put\r\nfully in possession of his sentiments. Lord Melbourne thinks this is\r\nnot the case; but it would be well if your Majesty would try to efface\r\nthis impression from his mind as much as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\n_13th October 1840._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,-- ... I have three kind letters of yours unanswered\r\nbefore me, of the 1st, 2nd, and 6th, for which many thanks. My time is\r\nvery short indeed to-day, but Albert has, I know, written to you about\r\nthe favourable turn which the Oriental affairs have taken, and of the\r\nproposition of France, which is very amicably received here; Austria\r\nand Prussia are quite ready to agree, but Brunnow has been making\r\nalready difficulties (this is in confidence to you). I hope and\r\ntrust that this will at length settle the affair, and that peace, the\r\nblessings of which are innumerable, will be preserved. I feel we\r\nowe _much_ of the change of the conduct of France to the peaceable\r\ndisposition of the dear King, for which I feel grateful.[48] Pray,\r\ndear Uncle, when an opportunity offers, do offer the King my best,\r\nsincerest wishes for his health and happiness in _every_ way, on the\r\noccasion of his birthday; may he live many years, for the benefit of\r\nall Europe!...\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 48: The King of the French was alarmed at the\r\n    warlike language of his Ministers. He checked the preparations\r\n    for war which Thiers was making; he went further, and on\r\n    the 24th of October he dismissed the Thiers Ministry, and\r\n    entrusted the management of affairs to Soult and Guizot,\r\n    who were pacifically inclined and anxious to preserve the\r\n    Anglo-French _entente_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN'S INFLUENCE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _16th October 1840._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I received your kind but anxious letter of the\r\n10th, the day before yesterday, and hasten to reply to it by the\r\ncourier who goes to-day. Indeed, dearest Uncle, I have worked hard\r\nthis last week to bring about something conciliatory, and I hope and\r\ntrust I have succeeded. Lord Melbourne, who left Claremont on the\r\nsame day as we did, was confined to the house till yesterday, when he\r\narrived here, by a lumbago and bilious attack; but I had a constant\r\ncorrespondence with him on this unfortunate and alarming question, and\r\nhe is, I can assure you, fully aware of the danger, and as anxious as\r\nwe are to set matters right; and so is Lord John, and Palmerston, I\r\nhope, is getting more reasonable. They have settled in consequence of\r\nThiers' two despatches that Palmerston should write to Lord Ponsonby\r\nto urge the Porte _not_ to dispossess Mehemet Ali finally of Egypt,\r\nand I believe the other foreign Ministers at Constantinople will\r\nreceive similar instructions; this despatch Palmerston will send to\r\nGranville (to-night, I believe) to be communicated to Thiers, and _I_\r\nhave made Palmerston _promise_ to put into the despatch to Granville\r\n\"that it would be a source of great satisfaction to England, if this\r\nwould be the cause of bringing back France to that alliance (with\r\nthe other Four Powers) from which we had seen her depart with so much\r\nregret.\" I hope this will have a good effect. Now, in _my_ humble\r\nopinion (but this I say of myself and without anybody's knowledge),\r\nif France, upon this, were to make some sort of advance, and were to\r\n_cease arming_, I think all would do; for you see, if France goes on\r\narming, we shall hardly be justified in not doing the same, and that\r\nwould be very bad. Couldn't you suggest this to the King and Thiers,\r\nas of yourself? My anxiety is great for the return of amity and\r\nconcord, I can assure you. I think our child ought to have besides its\r\nother names those of _Turco Egypto_, as we think of nothing else!\r\nI had a long talk with Palmerston on Wednesday, and also with J.\r\nRussell.\r\n\r\nI hope I have done good. The Dutch don't like the abdication. I'm so\r\nsorry for poor little Paris![49]\r\n\r\nPray excuse this dreadful scrawl, but I am so hurried. Ever your\r\ndevoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 49: The Comte de Paris, born 24th August 1838,\r\n    eldest son of Ferdinand, Duke of Orleans, who was Louis\r\n    Philippe's eldest son.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: ATTEMPT ON LOUIS PHILIPPE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _17th October 1840._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST VICTORIA,--You will, I am sure, have been very much shocked\r\non hearing that on the 15th there was a new attempt made to kill the\r\npoor good King at Paris.[50] The place was cleverly chosen, as the\r\nKing generally puts his head out of the carriage window to bow to\r\nthe guard. I join the letter which he had the goodness to forward us\r\nthrough an _estafette_.[51] May this melancholy _attentat_ impress\r\non your Ministers the necessity of aiding the King in his arduous\r\ntask.... You will have the goodness to show this letter to Albert.\r\n\r\nLouise was much alarmed when it arrived at such an unusual hour; it\r\nwas ten o'clock. At first we thought it might be something about poor\r\nlittle Paris, who is not yet so well as one could wish.\r\n\r\nWe have gloomy miserable weather, and I feel much disgusted with this\r\npart of the world.

You know well that no personal\r\ninterest guides me in my exertions; I am in fact bored with being\r\nhere, and shall ever regret to have remained in these regions, when I\r\nmight so easily have gone myself to the Orient, the great object of my\r\npredilection.\r\n\r\nI never shall advise anything which would be against the interests and\r\nhonour of yourself, your Government, or your country, in which I have\r\nso great a stake myself. The great thing now is _not to refuse to\r\nnegotiate_ with France, even if it should end in nothing. Still for\r\nthe King Louis Philippe there is an _immense strength_ and facility in\r\nthat word \"_nous négocions_\"; with this he may get over the opening of\r\nthe session, and this once done, one may hope to come to a conclusion.\r\nSince I wrote to Lord Melbourne to-day, I have received a letter\r\nfrom the King, of the 19th, _i.e._ yesterday, in which he tells me,\r\n\"_Pourvu qu'il y ait, pour commencer, des négociations, cela me donne\r\nune grande force._\"\r\n\r\nI have written yesterday to him most fully a letter he may show Thiers\r\nalso concerning the armaments. I think that my arguments will make\r\nsome impression on Thiers. The King writes me word that by dint of\r\ngreat exertion he had brought Thiers to be more moderate. If it was\r\npossible to bring France and Mehemet Ali to agree to the greatest part\r\nof the Treaty, it will be worth while for everybody to consent. The\r\nway to bring France to join in some arrangement, and to take the\r\nengagement to compel Mehemet to accept it, would be the best practical\r\nway to come to a conclusion. It is probable, though I know nothing\r\nabout it in any positive way, that the efforts of getting possession\r\nof Syria will fail, if the country itself does not take up arms on a\r\nlarge scale, which seems not to be believed.\r\n\r\nTo conclude then my somewhat hurried argumentation, the greatest\r\nthing is to negotiate. The negotiation cannot now have the effect of\r\nweakening the execution as that goes on, and it may have the advantage\r\nof covering the non-success if that should take place, which is at\r\nall events possible if not probable. May I beg you to read these few\r\nconfused words to Lord Melbourne as a supplement of my letter to him.\r\nDarmes says that if Chartres had been with the King, he would not\r\nhave fired, but that his reason for wishing to kill the King was his\r\nconviction that one could not hope for war till he was dead.\r\n\r\nIt is really melancholy to see the poor King taking this _acharnement_\r\nvery much to heart, and upon my word, the other Powers of Europe owe\r\nit to themselves and to him to do everything to ease and strengthen\r\nhis awful task.\r\n\r\nWhat do you say to poor Christina's departure?[52] I am sorry for it,\r\nand for the poor children. She is believed to be very rich.\r\n\r\nNow I must conclude, but not without thanking you once more for your\r\n_great and most laudable exertions_, and wishing you every happiness,\r\nwhich you so _much deserve_. Ever, my most beloved Victoria, your\r\ndevoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 52: Queen Christina abdicated the Regency of Spain,\r\n    and went to Paris.

He took charge of all\r\nmy love and _hommages_ for you, dear Albert, and all the Royal Family.\r\nBefore dinner the children were presented to him (that is Leopold\r\nand Philippe), but I am sorry to say that poor Lippchen was so much\r\nfrightened with his appearance, loud voice, and black gloves, that he\r\nburst out crying, and that we were obliged to send him away. The\r\nDuke took his shyness very kindly; but I am still ashamed with his\r\nbehaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: NEWS FROM SYRIA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCARLTON TERRACE, _8th November 1840._\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and in\r\naddition to the good news from Syria, which confirms the defeat and\r\ndispersion of the forces, both of Ibrahim and of Solyman Pasha, with\r\nthe loss of 8,000 prisoners, 24 pieces of cannon, the whole of\r\ntheir camp, baggage, and stores, followed by the flight of those two\r\nGenerals with a small escort, he has the satisfaction of informing\r\nyour Majesty that the new French Ministers had a majority of 68, upon\r\nthe vote for the election of the President of the Chamber.[54]\r\n\r\nThis majority, so far exceeding any previous calculation, seems to\r\nplace the stability of the Government beyond a doubt, though it must,\r\nof course, be expected that upon other questions their majority will\r\nnot be so overwhelming.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 54: M. Sauzet was elected in preference to M.\r\n    Odillon Barrot. Thiers resigned the Premiership on 14th\r\n    October; in the new Ministry Soult was President of the\r\n    Council, Guizot Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Duchatel\r\n    Minister of the Interior.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DISAFFECTION IN FRANCE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _11th November 1840._\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and with\r\nreference to your Majesty's memorandum of the 9th inst., he entreats\r\nyour Majesty not to believe that there exists at present in France\r\nthat danger of internal revolution and of external war which the\r\nFrench Government, to serve its own diplomatic purposes, endeavours to\r\nrepresent.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt a large Party among the leading politicians in\r\nFrance, who have long contemplated the establishment of a virtually,\r\nif not actually, independent State in Egypt and Syria, under the\r\ndirect protection and influence of France, and that Party feel great\r\ndisappointment and resentment at finding their schemes in this respect\r\nbaffled. But that Party will not revenge themselves on the Four Powers\r\nby making a revolution in France, and they are enlightened enough to\r\nsee that France cannot revenge herself by making war against the Four\r\nPowers, who are much stronger than she is.\r\n\r\n... But your Majesty may be assured that there is in France an immense\r\nmass of persons, possessed of property, and engaged in pursuits of\r\nindustry, who are decidedly adverse to unnecessary war, and determined\r\nto oppose revolution. And although those persons have not hitherto\r\ncome prominently forward, yet their voice would have made itself\r\nheard, when the question of peace or unprovoked war came practically\r\nto be discussed.\r\n\r\nWith regard to internal revolution, there is undoubtedly in France a\r\nlarge floating mass of Republicans and Anarchists, ready at any moment\r\nto make a disturbance if there was no strong power to resist them; but\r\nthe persons who would lose by convulsion are infinitely more numerous,\r\nand the National Guard of Paris, consisting of nearly 60,000 men,\r\nare chiefly persons of this description, and are understood to be\r\ndecidedly for internal order, and for external peace.\r\n\r\nIt is very natural that the French Government, after having failed to\r\nextort concessions upon the Turkish Question, by menaces of foreign\r\nwar, should now endeavour to obtain those concessions, by appealing\r\nto fears of another kind, and should say that such concessions are\r\nnecessary in order to prevent revolution in France; but Viscount\r\nPalmerston would submit to your Majesty his deep conviction that\r\nthis appeal is not better founded than the other, and that a firm and\r\nresolute perseverance on the part of the Four Powers, in the measures\r\nwhich they have taken in hand, will effect a settlement of the affairs\r\nof Turkey, which will afford great additional security for the future\r\npeace of Europe, without producing in the meantime either war _with_\r\nFrance, or revolution _in_ France.\r\n\r\nFrance and the rest of Europe are entirely different now from what\r\nthey were in 1792. The French nation is as much interested now to\r\navoid further revolution, as it was interested then in ridding itself,\r\nby any means, of the enormous and intolerable abuses which then\r\nexisted. France then imagined she had much to gain by foreign war;\r\nFrance now knows she has everything to lose by foreign war.\r\n\r\nEurope then (at least the Continental States) had also a strong desire\r\nto get rid of innumerable abuses which pressed heavily upon the people\r\nof all countries. Those abuses have now in general been removed; the\r\npeople in many parts of Germany have been admitted, more or less, to\r\na share in the management of their own affairs. A German feeling and\r\na spirit of nationality has sprung up among all the German people, and\r\nthe Germans, instead of receiving the French as Liberators, as many\r\nof them did in 1792-1793, would now rise as one man to repel a hateful\r\ninvasion. Upon all these grounds Viscount Palmerston deems it his duty\r\nto your Majesty to express his strong conviction that the appeals made\r\nto your Majesty's good feelings by the King of the French, upon the\r\nscore of the danger of revolution in France, unless concessions are\r\nmade to the French Government, have no foundation in truth, and are\r\nonly exertions of skilful diplomacy.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston has to apologise to your Majesty for having\r\ninadvertently written a part of this memorandum upon a half-sheet of\r\npaper. And he would be glad if, without inconvenience to your Majesty,\r\nhe could be enabled to read to the Cabinet to-morrow the accompanying\r\ndespatches from Lord Granville.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE STATE OF FRANCE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._[55]\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _11th November 1840._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has to acknowledge the receipt of Lord Palmerston's letter\r\nof this morning, which she has read with great attention. The Queen\r\nwill just make a few observations upon various points in it, to which\r\nshe would wish to draw Lord Palmerston's attention. The Queen does so\r\nwith strict impartiality, having had ample opportunities of hearing\r\nboth sides of this intricate and highly-important question.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it strikes the Queen that, even if M. Thiers _did_ raise\r\nthe cry, which was so loud, for war in France (but which the Queen\r\ncannot believe he _did_ to the extent Lord Palmerston does), that such\r\nan excitement _once_ raised in a country like France, where the people\r\nare more excitable than almost any other nation, it cannot be so\r\neasily controuled and stopped again, and the Queen thinks this will be\r\nseen in time.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the Queen cannot either quite agree in Lord Palmerston's\r\nobservation, that the French Government state the danger of internal\r\nrevolution, if not supported, merely to extract further concessions\r\nfor Mehemet Ali. The Queen does not pretend to say that this danger is\r\nnot exaggerated, but depend upon it, a _certain_ degree of danger\r\ndoes exist, and that the situation of the King of the French and\r\nthe present French Government is not an easy one. The majority,\r\ntoo, cannot be depended upon, as many would vote against Odillon\r\nBarrot,[56] who would _not_ vote on other occasions with the\r\nSoult-Guizot Ministry.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the danger of war is also doubtless greatly exaggerated,\r\nas also the numbers of the French troops. But Lord Palmerston must\r\nrecollect how very warlike the French are, and that if once roused,\r\nthey will not listen to the calm reasoning of those who wish for\r\npeace, or think of the great risk they run of _losing_ by war, but\r\nonly of the glory and of revenging insult, as they call it.\r\n\r\nFourthly, the Queen sees the difficulty there exists at the present\r\nmoment of making any specific offer to France, but she must at\r\nthe same time repeat how _highly_ and _exceedingly_ important she\r\nconsiders it that some sort of conciliatory agreement should be come\r\nto with France, for she cannot believe that the appeals made to her\r\nby the King of the French are only exertions of skilful diplomacy. The\r\nQueen's earnest and only wish is peace, and a maintenance of friendly\r\nrelations with her allies, consistent with the honour and dignity\r\nof her country. She does not think, however, that the last would be\r\ncompromised by attempts to soften the irritation still existing in\r\nFrance, or by attempts to bring France back to her former position in\r\nthe Oriental Question.\r\n\r\nShe earnestly hopes that Lord Palmerston will consider this, will\r\nreflect upon the importance of not driving France to extremities, and\r\nof conciliatory measures, without showing fear (for our successes on\r\nthe coast of Syria show our power), or without yielding to threats.\r\nFrance has been humbled, and France is in the wrong, but, therefore,\r\nit is easier than if we had failed, to do something to bring matters\r\nright again. The Queen has thus frankly stated her own opinion, which\r\nshe thought it right Lord Palmerston should know, and she is sure he\r\nwill see it is only dictated by an earnest desire to see _all_ as much\r\nunited as possible on this important subject.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 55: A copy of this letter was sent at the same time\r\n    to Lord Melbourne.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 56: The unsuccessful candidate for the Presidency of\r\n    the Chamber.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Baron Stockmar to Viscount Melbourne._\r\n\r\n_21st November 1840._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LORD,--I have just received Her Majesty's order to express\r\nto you her great desire to have from this day the Prince's name\r\nintroduced into the Church Prayer.

As to politics, I do not wish to say much to-day. Palmerston,\r\n_rex_ and autocrat, is, for a Minister finding himself in such\r\nfortunate circumstances, far _too irritable and violent_. One does not\r\nunderstand the use of showing so much hatred and anger. What he says\r\nabout the _appeal to the personal feeling of the Queen, on the part\r\nof the King of the French_, is childlike and malicious, for it has\r\n_never_ existed.\r\n\r\nThe King was for many years the great friend of the Duke of Kent,\r\nafter whose death he remained a friend of Victoria. His relations with\r\nthe latter have, up to 1837, passed through very varied phases; she\r\nwas for a long time an object of hatred in the family, who had not\r\ntreated the Duke of Kent over-amicably, and a proof of this is the\r\nfact that the Regent, from the year 1819, forbade the Duke his house\r\nand presence--which was probably another nail in the Duke's coffin.\r\nMany of these things are quite unknown to Victoria, or forgotten\r\nby her. Still it is only fair not to forget the people who were her\r\nfriends before 1837; after that date there was a violent outbreak of\r\naffection among people who in the year 1836 would still not go near\r\nVictoria. October 1836, when he sat next her at dinner, was the\r\nfirst time that Palmerston himself had ever seen Victoria except at a\r\ndistance. As you have the best means of knowing, the King has not even\r\ndreamt of applying to Victoria.\r\n\r\nAs to danger, it was very great in September, on the occasion of the\r\n_ouvrier_ riot--for a Paris mob fires at once, a thing which--Heaven\r\nbe thanked!--English mobs rarely do. Towards the end of October, when\r\nThiers withdrew, there was a possibility of a revolution, and it was\r\nonly the fear of people of wealth that kept them together, and drew\r\nthem towards Guizot.\r\n\r\nA revolution, at once democratic and bellicose, could not but become\r\nmost dangerous. That was on the cards, and only a fairly fortunate\r\ncombination of circumstances saved matters. The King and my poor\r\nmother-in-law were terribly _low_, _on both occasions_, and I confess\r\nthat I looked everyday with the greatest anxiety for the news. If the\r\npoor King had been murdered, or even if he were now to be murdered,\r\nwhat danger, what confusion would follow! All these things were met by\r\nPalmerston with the excessively _nonchalante_ declaration, _it was not\r\nso, and it is not so_! Those are absolutely baseless assertions, and\r\ntotally valueless. At least I could estimate the danger as well as he\r\nand Bulwer--and, indeed, it was an anxious crisis. I should think the\r\nRevolution of 1790 _et ce qui s'en est suivi_ had done a brisk enough\r\nbusiness in Europe, and to risk a new one of the same kind would\r\nreally be somewhat scandalous.\r\n\r\nWhat, however, may be the future fruit of the seed of Palmerston's\r\nsowing, we do not in the least know as yet; it may, however, prove\r\nsufficiently full of misfortune for the future of innocent people.\r\nThe Eastern affairs will be put on an intelligible footing only when,\r\nafter these differences with Mehemet Ali, something is done for\r\nthe poor Porte, which is now so much out of repair. Otherwise there\r\nremains a little place which is called Sebastopol, and from which, as\r\nthe wind is almost constantly favourable, one can get very quickly\r\nto Constantinople--and Constantinople is always the one place which\r\nexercises the greatest influence, and all the more because the ducats\r\ncome from that quarter, with results which the marked economy of\r\nEngland is hardly likely to effect....\r\n\r\nVictoria has borne herself bravely and properly in the matter, and\r\n_deserves to be greatly praised_....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: BIRTH OF THE PRINCESS ROYAL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Queen of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _30th November 1840._\r\n\r\nMY MOST BELOVED VICTORIA,--I have been longing to write to you ever\r\nsince we got the _joyful_ tidings,[57] but I would not do so before\r\nthe nine days were at an end.

I am _very_ prudent and careful, you may _rely_ upon\r\nit. Your little grand-niece is most flourishing; she gains daily in\r\nhealth, strength and, I may add, beauty; I think she will be very like\r\nher dearest father; she grows amazingly; I shall be proud to present\r\nher to you.\r\n\r\nThe _dénouement_ of the Oriental affair is most fortunate, is it\r\nnot?[58]\r\n\r\nI see Stockmar often, who is very kind about me and the Princess\r\nRoyal....\r\n\r\nAlbert sends his affectionate love, and pray believe me always, your\r\ndevoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 58: On the 3rd of November St Jean d'Acre was\r\n    captured by the allied fleet, Admiral Sir Robert Stopford\r\n    commanding the British contingent; the battle is said to have\r\n    been the first to test the advantages of steam.

I can well understand that you feel quite astonished at finding\r\nyourself within a year of your marriage a very respectable mother of\r\na nice little girl, but let us thank Heaven that it is so. Any illness\r\nto which, unfortunately, we poor human creatures are very subject,\r\nwould almost have kept you longer in bed, and make you longer weak and\r\nuncomfortable, than an event which in your position as Sovereign is of\r\na very great importance.\r\n\r\nBecause there is no doubt that a Sovereign without heirs direct, or\r\nbrothers and sisters, which by their attachment may stand in lieu of\r\nthem, is much to be pitied, viz., Queen Anne's later years. Moreover,\r\nchildren of our own, besides the affection which one feels for them,\r\nhave also for their parents sentiments which one rarely obtains from\r\nstrangers. I flatter myself therefore that you will be a delighted and\r\ndelightful _Maman au milieu d'une belle et nombreuse famille_....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\r\n\r\nTO CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the year the Ministry were confronted with\r\nmonetary difficulties and bad trade; their special weakness in\r\nfinance, contrasted with Sir Robert Peel's great ability, in addition\r\nto their many reverses, indicated that a change was at hand; and\r\nconfidential communications were, with Lord Melbourne's full approval,\r\nopened up by the Prince with Sir Robert Peel, to avert the recurrence\r\nof a Bedchamber dispute. The Ministry were defeated on their Budget,\r\nbut did not resign. A vote of want of confidence was then carried\r\nagainst them by a majority of one, and Parliament was dissolved; the\r\nMinisters appealing to the country on the cry of a fixed duty on corn.\r\nThe Conservative and Protectionist victory was a decisive one,\r\nthe most significant successes being in the city of London,\r\nNorthumberland, and the West Riding. Somewhat improving their position\r\nin Scotland and Ireland, and just holding their own in the English\r\nboroughs, the Whigs were absolutely overwhelmed in the counties, and\r\nin the result three hundred and sixty-eight Conservatives and only two\r\nhundred and ninety-two Liberals were returned. The modern practice of\r\nresigning before meeting Parliament had not then been introduced, and\r\nthe Ministry was defeated in both Houses on Amendments to the Address,\r\nthe Duke of Wellington taking the opportunity of eulogising Lord\r\nMelbourne's great services to the Queen. A powerful Protectionist\r\nMinistry was formed by Sir Robert Peel, including the Duke of\r\nWellington, Lord Aberdeen, Sir James Graham, and Lord Lyndhurst.\r\n\r\nGreat national rejoicings took place when, on the 9th of November, a\r\nmale heir to the throne, now His Majesty King Edward VII., was born.\r\n\r\nIn France the bitter feeling against England, arising out of the\r\nSyrian expedition, still continued, but Thiers' supersession by the\r\nmore pacific Guizot, and the satisfaction with which both the latter\r\nand his Sovereign regarded the displacement of Palmerston by Aberdeen,\r\nbegan to lead to a better _entente_. The scheme of fortifying Paris\r\ncontinued, however, to be debated, while the Orleanist family were\r\nstill the subjects of futile _attentats_.\r\n\r\nSpain was disturbed, the question of the guardianship of the young\r\nQueen giving rise to dissension: insurrections in the interests of the\r\nQueen-mother took place at Pampeluna and Vittoria, and her pension was\r\nsuspended by Espartero, the Regent.\r\n\r\nIn the east, Mehemet Ali surrendered the whole of the Turkish fleet,\r\nand he was subsequently guaranteed the hereditary Pashalik of Egypt\r\nby the four European Powers who had intervened in the affairs of the\r\nLevant.\r\n\r\nIn Afghanistan, an insurrection broke out, and Sir Alexander Burnes\r\nwas murdered; our envoy at Cabul, Sir William Macnaghten, in an\r\nunfortunate moment entered into negotiations with Akbar Khan, a son\r\nof Dost Mahommed, who treacherously assassinated him. Somewhat\r\nhumiliating terms were arranged, and the English force of 4,000\r\nsoldiers, with 12,000 camp-followers, proceeded to withdraw from\r\nCabul, harassed by the enemy; after endless casualties, General\r\nElphinstone, who was in command, with the women and children, became\r\ncaptives, and one man alone, of the 16,000--Dr Brydon--reached\r\nJellalabad to tell the tale.\r\n\r\nIn China, operations were continued, Sir Henry Pottinger superseding\r\nCaptain Elliot, and Canton soon lying at the mercy of the British\r\narms; the new Superintendent co-operated with Sir Hugh Gough and\r\nAdmiral Sir William Parker, in the capture of Amoy, Chusan, Chintu,\r\nand Ningpo.\r\n\r\nIn America, the union of the two Canadas was carried into effect, but\r\na sharp dispute with the United States arose out of the Upper Canada\r\ndisturbances of 1837. Some Canadian loyalists had then resented the\r\ninterference of a few individual Americans in favour of the rebels,\r\nand an American named Durfee had been killed. One M'Leod, a British\r\nsubject, was now arrested in the State of New York, on a charge of\r\nhaving been concerned in the affray. He was acquitted, reprisals were\r\nmade by Canadians, and international feeling was for a time highly\r\nacute.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch interest naturally attaches to Lord Melbourne's continued\r\ncorrespondence with the Queen, after the change of Government. Baron\r\nStockmar's remonstrance on the subject shows that he misunderstood the\r\ncharacter of the correspondence, and over-estimated its momentousness.\r\n\r\nThese letters dealt chiefly with social and personal matters, and\r\nalthough full of interest from the light which they throw on Lord\r\nMelbourne's relations with the Queen, they show him to have behaved\r\nwith scrupulous honour and delicacy, and to have tried to augment,\r\nrather than undermine, Peel's growing influence with the Queen\r\nand Prince. There are comparatively few of Peel's letters in the\r\ncollection. He wrote rarely at first, and only on strictly official\r\nmatters. But before long his great natural reserve was broken through,\r\nand his intercourse with the Prince, to whom his character was\r\nparticularly sympathetic, became very close and intimate.\r\n\r\nOf all the English Ministers with whom the Prince was brought in\r\ncontact, it is known that he preferred the stately and upright\r\nCommoner, who certainly, of all English Ministers, estimated and\r\nappreciated the Prince's character most truly and clearly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n1841\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\n_5th January 1841._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I have to thank you for two very kind letters, of\r\nthe 26th December and 1st January, and for all your very kind and good\r\nwishes. I am sorry to hear you have all been plagued with colds; we\r\nhave as yet escaped them, and I trust will continue to do so. I think,\r\ndearest Uncle, you cannot _really_ wish me to be the \"Mamma d'une\r\n_nombreuse_ famille,\" for I think you will see with me the great\r\ninconvenience a _large_ family would be to us all, and particularly to\r\nthe country, independent of the hardship and inconvenience to myself;\r\nmen never think, at least seldom think, what a hard task it is for us\r\nwomen to go through this _very often_. God's will be done, and if He\r\ndecrees that we are to have a great number of children, why we must\r\ntry to bring them up as useful and exemplary members of society. Our\r\nyoung lady flourishes exceedingly, and I hope the Van de Weyers (who\r\nhave been here for three days), who have seen her twice, will give you\r\na favourable description of her. I think you would be amused to see\r\nAlbert dancing her in his arms; he makes a capital nurse (which I do\r\nnot, and she is much too heavy for me to carry), and she already seems\r\nso happy to go to him.\r\n\r\nThe christening will be at Buckingham Palace on the 10th of February,\r\nour dear marriage-day.\r\n\r\nAffairs are certainly still precarious, but I feel confident all will\r\ncome right....\r\n\r\nEver your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _8th January 1841._\r\n\r\n... I trust also that affairs will come right; what is to be feared\r\nis the _chapter of accidents_.

He would like to bring literary and scientific\r\npeople about the Court, vary the society, and infuse a more useful\r\ntendency into it. The Queen however has no fancy to encourage such\r\npeople. This arises from a feeling on her part that her education has\r\nnot fitted her to take part in such conversation; she would not like\r\nconversation to be going on in which she could not take her fair\r\nshare, and she is far too open and candid in her nature to pretend to\r\none atom more knowledge than she really possesses on such subjects;\r\nand yet, as the world goes, she would, as any girl, have been\r\nconsidered accomplished, for she speaks German well and writes it;\r\nunderstands Italian, speaks French fluently, and writes it with great\r\nelegance. In addition to this old Davys instilled some Latin into her\r\nduring his tutorship. The rest of her education she owes to her own\r\nnatural shrewdness and quickness, and this perhaps has not been the\r\nproper education for one who was to wear the Crown of England.\r\n\r\n\"The Queen is very proud of the Prince's utter indifference to the\r\nattractions of all ladies. I told Her Majesty that these were early\r\ndays to boast, which made her rather indignant.

Some mention of the good conduct and gallantry of the Navy\r\nthere must be--to omit it would be injurious and disheartening--but as\r\nto any expressions complimentary to France or expressive of regret\r\nat our separation from it, it will be hardly possible to introduce\r\nanything of that nature.[1] It is quite unusual in our Speeches from\r\nthe Throne to express either approbation or disapprobation of the\r\nconduct of foreign nations and foreign Governments. It is surprising\r\nhow very seldom it has been done, and the wisdom and prudence of\r\nabstaining from it is very manifest. It would be giving an opinion\r\nupon that which does not belong to us. Anything which would have the\r\neffect of producing satisfaction in France must be of an apologetic\r\ncharacter, which there is no ground for, and for which neither the\r\nGovernment nor the country is prepared.\r\n\r\nThe best course will be a total reserve upon this head, certainly\r\nabstaining from anything that can be in the slightest degree\r\noffensive.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: France was not mentioned, though the Convention\r\n    with the other Powers, and the naval operations in conjunction\r\n    with Austria, were referred to.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_22nd January 1841._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne will be most happy to wait upon your Majesty on\r\nSaturday and Sunday.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is very sorry that your Majesty is compelled to come to\r\nLondon contrary to your inclinations; but Lord Melbourne much rejoices\r\nthat your Majesty expresses that reluctance, as there is no surer\r\nsign of complete happiness and contentment in the married life than a\r\ndesire to remain quietly in the country, and there is nothing on the\r\nearth Lord Melbourne desires more anxiously than the assurance of your\r\nMajesty's happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN'S INFANCY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nBRUSSELS, _22nd January 1841._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST VICTORIA,--I thank you very sincerely for your kind letter\r\nof the 19th, which I hasten to answer. I should not have bored you by\r\nmy presence, but the act of the christening is, in my eyes, a sort of\r\nclosing of the first cyclus of your dear life. I was shooting at the\r\nlate Lord Craven's in Berkshire, when I received the messenger who\r\nbrought me the horrifying news of your poor father's deadly illness. I\r\nhastened in bitter cold weather to Sidmouth, about two days before his\r\ndeath. His affairs were so much deranged that your Mother would have\r\nhad no means even of leaving Sidmouth if I had not taken all this\r\nunder my care and management. That dreary journey, undertaken, I\r\nthink, on the 26th of January, in bitter cold and damp weather, I\r\nshall not easily forget. I looked very sharp after the poor little\r\nbaby, then about eight months old. Arrived in London we were very\r\nunkindly treated by George IV., _whose great wish was to get you and\r\nyour Mamma out of the country_, and I must say without my assistance\r\nyou could _not_ have remained.... I state these facts, because it is\r\nuseful to remember through what _difficulties_ and _hardships_ one\r\nhad to struggle. You will also remember that though there existed\r\nthe _possibility_ of your eventually succeeding to the Crown, that\r\npossibility was very doubtful, the then Duchess of Clarence having\r\nbeen confined after your Mother, and there being every reason to think\r\nthat, though poor little Princess Elizabeth did not live more than\r\nsome months, other children might appear.[2]\r\n\r\nIt was a long time from 1820 to 1837! We got over it, however, and, as\r\nfar as you are concerned, God be praised! safely and happily. You are\r\nmarried, with every prospect of many happy years to come, and your\r\nhappiness is _crowned_, and _consolidated_, as it were, by the birth\r\nof the dear little lady. Having from motives of discretion, perhaps\r\n_carried even too far_, not assisted at your coming to the throne,\r\nnor at your Coronation, nor afterwards at your marriage, I wished to\r\nassist at the christening of the little Princess, an event which is of\r\ngreat importance....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: Two children were born to the Duke and Duchess of\r\n    Clarence--Charlotte Augusta Louisa, born and died 29th March\r\n    1819, and Elizabeth Georgina Adelaide, born 10th December\r\n    1820, and died 4th March 1821.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCARLTON TERRACE, _1st February 1841._\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and in\r\nsubmitting this letter from Earl Granville, which coupled with the\r\ndespatches from Sir Robert Stopford virtually show that the Turkish\r\nQuestion is brought to a close, begs most humbly to congratulate your\r\nMajesty upon this rapid and peaceful settlement of a matter which at\r\ndifferent periods has assumed appearances so threatening to the peace\r\nof Europe.[3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: See _ante_, pp. 252, 254.\r\n      (Ch.

It is in some degree a party measure, and levelled against\r\nthese new Oxford doctrines. The proposal is to republish the works of\r\nthe older divines up to the time of the death of Queen Elizabeth. Up\r\nto that period the doctrines of the Church of England were decidedly\r\nCalvinistic. During the reign of James II.,[4] and particularly after\r\nthe Synod of Dort (1618-1619), the English clergy very generally\r\nadopted _Arminian_ opinions.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to republish the works of the divines who wrote during\r\nthe first period, and to stop short when they come to the second.\r\nThere is meaning in this. But, after all, the object is not a bad one,\r\nand it may not be worth while to consider it so closely.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: Lord Melbourne must have meant James I.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_5th February 1841 (6 o'clock)._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and is very\r\nsorry to have to acquaint your Majesty that the Duke of Wellington was\r\ntaken ill in the House of Lords this evening with a seizure, probably\r\nparalytic, and of the same nature with those which he has had before.\r\nLord Brougham, who was standing opposite to the Duke and addressing\r\nthe House, observed the Duke's face to be drawn and distorted, and\r\nsoon afterwards the Duke rose from his seat and walked staggeringly\r\ntowards the door.

Adverting to the present\r\nstate of our affairs with the United States,[5] he said that much\r\nas he disliked war, yet if the honour or interests of the country\r\nrequired it, he should sink all internal differences, and give his\r\nbest support to the Government of his country.\r\n\r\nThis declaration was received with loud cheers. It must be considered\r\nas very creditable to Sir Robert Peel.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: _See_ Introductory Note, _ante_, p. 254.\r\n      (Intro Note to Ch.

Captain Elliot seems to have wholly disregarded the\r\ninstructions which had been sent to him, and even when, by the entire\r\nsuccess of the operations of the Fleet, he was in a condition to\r\ndictate his own terms, he seems to have agreed to very inadequate\r\nconditions.[7] The amount of compensation for the opium surrendered\r\nfalls short of the value of that opium, and nothing has been obtained\r\nfor the expenses of the expedition, nor for the debts of the bankrupt\r\nHong[8] merchants. The securities which the plenipotentiaries were\r\nexpressly ordered to obtain for British residents in China have been\r\nabandoned; and the Island of Chusan which they were specifically\r\ninformed was to be retained till the whole of the pecuniary\r\ncompensation should have been paid, has been hastily and discreditably\r\nevacuated. Even the cession of Hong Kong has been coupled with a\r\ncondition about the payment of duties, which would render that island\r\nnot a possession of the British Crown, but, like Macao, a settlement\r\nheld by sufferance in the territory of the Crown of China.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston deems it his duty in laying these papers before\r\nyour Majesty, to state some few of the objections which he feels to\r\nthe arrangement, but the Cabinet will have to consider, as soon as\r\nthey meet after the Recess, what advice they may wish humbly to tender\r\nto your Majesty upon these important matters. There is no doubt,\r\nhowever, that much has been accomplished, but it is very mortifying\r\nto find that other things which the plenipotentiaries were ordered\r\nto obtain, and which the force placed at their command was amply\r\nsufficient to enable them to accomplish, have not been attained.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston has sent a small map of the Canton River, which\r\nyour Majesty may like to keep for future reference.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: Captain Elliot, after capturing the Chinese\r\n    position at the mouth of Canton River, concluded a preliminary\r\n    treaty with the Chinese Government, which did not satisfy the\r\n    Chinese, and which was strongly disapproved of by the English\r\n    Ministry, as containing no mention of the opium traffic,\r\n    which had been the cause of all the difficulties; Elliot was\r\n    accordingly recalled, and succeeded by Sir Henry Pottinger.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: They were the cession of Hong-Kong, and payment\r\n    of an indemnity of 6,000,000 dollars to Great Britain,\r\n    with provision for commercial facilities and collection of\r\n    customs.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: The native Canton merchants,--Hong here probably\r\n    meaning a \"row of houses,\" a \"street.\" Hong Kong (Hiang Kiang)\r\n    means the \"fragrant lagoon.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\n_13th April 1841._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I thank you much for your kind letter of the 9th,\r\nreceived yesterday. I have just heard from Stockmar (who, I hope,\r\nreported favourably of us all) that your Ministry is at _last_\r\nsettled, of which I wish you joy. I think, dear Uncle, that you would\r\nfind the East not only as \"absurd\" as the West, but very barbarous,\r\ncruel, and dangerous into the bargain.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese business vexes us much, and Palmerston is deeply mortified\r\nat it. _All_ we wanted might have been got, if it had not been for\r\nthe unaccountably strange conduct of Charles Elliot (_not Admiral_\r\nElliot,[9] for _he_ was obliged to come away from ill-health), who\r\ncompletely disobeyed his instructions and _tried_ to get the _lowest_\r\nterms he could.... The attack and storming of the Chorempee Forts on\r\nthe 7th of January was very gallantly done by the Marines, and immense\r\ndestruction of the Chinese took place.[10] The accounts of the cruelty\r\nof the Chinese to one another are horrible. Albert is so much amused\r\nat my having got the Island of Hong Kong, and we think Victoria ought\r\nto be called Princess of Hong Kong in addition to Princess Royal.\r\n\r\nShe drives out every day in a close carriage with the window open,\r\nsince she has been here, which does her worlds of good, and she is to\r\nhave a _walk_ to-day.\r\n\r\nStockmar writes me word that Charlotte[11] is quite beautiful. _I_ am\r\nvery jealous.\r\n\r\nI think Vecto quite right not to travel without Nemours; for it would\r\nlook just as if she was unhappy, and ran to her parents for help. I\r\nam sure _if_ Albert ever should be away (which, however, _will_ and\r\n_shall never_ happen, for I would go with him even if he was to go\r\nto the _North Pole_), I should never think of travelling; but I can't\r\nmake mamma understand this. Now farewell.

Mr\r\nLabouchere[12] has desired that the five-pound piece which is about\r\nto be issued from the Mint should be submitted for your Majesty's\r\ninspection and approbation.\r\n\r\nWe have had under our consideration at the Cabinet the unfortunate\r\nsubject of the conduct of Lord Cardigan.[13] The public feeling upon\r\nit is very strong, and it is almost certain that a Motion will be made\r\nin the House of Commons for an Address praying your Majesty to remove\r\nhim from the command of his regiment. Such a Motion, if made, there is\r\nvery little chance of resisting with success, and nothing is more to\r\nbe apprehended and deprecated than such an interference of the House\r\nof Commons with the interior discipline and government of the Army.\r\nIt was also felt that the general order issued by the Horse Guards\r\nwas not sufficient to meet the case, and in these circumstances it was\r\nthought proper that Lord Melbourne should see Lord Hill, and should\r\nexpress to him the opinion of the Cabinet, that it was necessary that\r\nhe should advise your Majesty to take such measures as should have the\r\neffect of removing Lord Cardigan from the command of the 11th Hussars.\r\nThe repeated acts of imprudence of which Lord Cardigan has been\r\nguilty, and the repeated censures which he has drawn down upon\r\nhimself, form a ground amply sufficient for such a proceeding, and\r\nindeed seem imperiously to demand it.[14]\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne has seen Lord Hill and made to him this communication,\r\nand has left it for his consideration. Lord Hill is deeply chagrined\r\nand annoyed, but will consider the matter and confer again with Lord\r\nMelbourne upon it to-morrow.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 12: President of the Board of Trade, afterwards\r\n    created Lord Taunton.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 13: \"Within the space of a single twelvemonth, one\r\n    of his [Lord Cardigan's] captains was cashiered for writing\r\n    him a challenge; he sent a coarse and insulting verbal message\r\n    to another, and then punished him with prolonged arrest,\r\n    because he respectfully refused to shake hands with the\r\n    officer who had been employed to convey the affront; he fought\r\n    a duel with a lieutenant who had left the corps, and shot him\r\n    through the body; and he flogged a soldier on Sunday, between\r\n    the Services, on the very spot where, half an hour before, the\r\n    man's comrades had been mustered for public worship.\"--SIR G.\r\n    TREVELYAN, _Life and Letters of Lord Macaulay_, chap. viii.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 14: In February he had been acquitted on technical\r\n    grounds by the House of Lords of shooting a Captain Harvey\r\n    Garnett Phipps Tuckett.

He is most\r\nanxious upon all subjects to be put in possession of Your Majesty's\r\nfull and entire opinions. It is true that this question may materially\r\naffect the discipline of the Army, by subjecting the interior\r\nmanagement of regiments to be brought continually under the inspection\r\nand control of the House of Commons upon complaints of officers\r\nagainst their superiors, or even of private men against the officers.\r\n\r\nThe danger of the whole of Lord Cardigan's proceedings has been lest\r\na precedent of this nature should arise out of them. The question is\r\nwhether it is not more prudent to prevent a question being brought\r\nforward in the House of Commons, than to wait for it with the\r\ncertainty of being obliged to yield to it or of being overpowered by\r\nit. But of course this cannot be done unless it is consistent with\r\njustice and with the usage and prestige of the Service.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne has desired the Cabinet Ministers to assemble here\r\nto-day at four o'clock, in order to consider the subject. Lord\r\nMelbourne has seen Lord Hill again this morning, and Lord Hill has\r\nseen and consulted the Duke of Wellington, who has stated his opinion\r\nvery fully.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of the Duke is that the Punishment on Sunday was a great\r\nimpropriety and indiscretion upon the part of Lord Cardigan, but not a\r\nMilitary offence, nor a breach of the Mutiny Act or of the Articles of\r\nWar; that it called for the censure of the Commander-in-Chief, which\r\ncensure was pronounced by the General Order upon which the Duke was\r\nconsulted before it was issued, and that according to the usage of the\r\nService no further step can be taken by the Military Authorities. This\r\nopinion Lord Melbourne will submit to-day to the Cabinet Ministers.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne perceives that he has unintentionally written upon\r\ntwo sheets of paper, which he hopes will cause your Majesty no\r\ninconvenience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE NOTTINGHAM ELECTION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _28th April 1841._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. He has\r\nhimself seen the result of the election at Nottingham[15] without the\r\nleast surprise, from his knowledge of the place and his observation of\r\nthe circumstances of the contest. What John Russell reported to your\r\nMajesty was the opinion of those who act for us in that place, but as\r\nsoon as Lord Melbourne saw that there was a disposition upon the part\r\nof the violent party, Radicals, Chartists, and what not, to support\r\nthe Tory candidate, he knew that the contest was formidable and\r\ndubious. The Tory party is very strong, naturally, at Nottingham,\r\nand if it received any accession of strength, was almost certain to\r\nprevail. This combination, or rather this accession of one party to\r\nthe Tories, which has taken place at Nottingham, is very likely, and\r\nin Lord Melbourne's opinion almost certain, to take place in many\r\nother parts of the country in the case of a general election, and\r\nforms very serious matter for consideration as to the prudence of\r\ntaking such a step as a dissolution of the Parliament.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne will wait upon your Majesty after the Levée. It\r\nsignifies not how late, as there is no House of Lords.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 15: Where Mr Walter, a Tory, was elected with a\r\n    majority of 238.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE BUDGET]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWILTON CRESCENT, _1st May 1841._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has\r\nthe honour to report that Mr Baring yesterday brought forward the\r\nBudget in a remarkably clear and forcible speech.\r\n\r\nThe changes in the duties on Sugar and Timber,[16] and the\r\nannouncement made by Lord John Russell of a proposal for a fixed duty\r\non Corn, seemed to surprise and irritate the Opposition.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel refused to give any opinion on these propositions, and\r\nsatisfied himself with attacking the Government on the state of the\r\nfinances.\r\n\r\nThe supporters of the Government were greatly pleased with Mr Baring's\r\nplan, and loud in their cheers.\r\n\r\nIt is the general opinion that Lord Stanley will not proceed with his\r\nBill,[17] and there seems little doubt of this fact.\r\n\r\nBut the two parties are now evenly balanced, and the absence or\r\ndefection of some two or three of the Ministerial party may at any\r\ntime leave the Government in a minority.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16: The proposals were to increase the duty on\r\n    colonial timber from 10_s._ to 20_s._ a load, reducing it on\r\n    foreign timber from 55_s._ to 50_s._, to leave the duty on\r\n    colonial sugar unloaded at 24_s._ a cwt., reducing that on\r\n    foreign sugar from 63_s._ to 36_s._ a cwt.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 17: On Irish Registration.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_3rd May 1841._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. We decided at\r\nthe Cabinet on Friday that we could not sanction the agreement which\r\nCaptain Elliot has probably by this time concluded with the Government\r\nof China, but that it would be necessary to demand a larger amount of\r\nindemnity for the past injury, and also a more complete security for\r\nour trade in future. For this purpose it was determined to send out\r\ninstructions, in case the armament should not have left the Chinese\r\ncoasts and have been dispersed, to reoccupy the Island of Chusan,[18]\r\na measure which appears to have had a great effect upon the minds\r\nof the Chinese Government. It was also determined to recall Captain\r\nElliot, and to send out as soon as possible another officer with\r\nfull instructions from hence as to the views and intentions of your\r\nMajesty's Government. Sir Henry Pottinger,[19] an officer in the East\r\nIndia Company's Service, much distinguished in the recent operations\r\nin Afghanistan, is designated with your Majesty's approbation for this\r\nservice, which he has signified his willingness to undertake. It was\r\nalso thought that it would be proper to entrust Lord Auckland[20]\r\nwith general discretionary powers as to the further conduct of the\r\nexpedition. These determinations Lord Melbourne hopes that your\r\nMajesty will approve.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell informed Lord Melbourne yesterday that he knew that\r\nit was not the intention of the Opposition to press Lord Stanley's\r\nBill; but it is not to be expected in the present position of affairs\r\nthat they will not determine upon taking some decisive and united\r\nmeasure in advance.\r\n\r\nIn the present state of public measures and of public feeling, when\r\ndebate may arise at any moment, it would not be fitting for Lord\r\nMelbourne to absent himself on any sitting day from the House of\r\nLords. But unless there should be anything so urgent as to prevent\r\nhim, he will come down after the House on Tuesday evening and stay\r\nuntil Thursday morning.\r\n\r\nFanny is highly delighted and immeasurably grateful for your Majesty's\r\noffer of the Lodge in Richmond Park, and most desirous to avail\r\nherself of your Majesty's kindness, and so is Jocelyn. Lord Melbourne\r\nhas little doubt that they will thankfully accept it.[21]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18: The Island of Chusan, off the coast of China,\r\n    had been occupied in July 1840 as a base of operations, but\r\n    evacuated by Elliot in 1841.

The christening[22] was very splendid, the weather\r\nbeautiful, and everything extremely well managed.... The arrival\r\nat Notre-Dame, and the _coup d'[oe]il_ of the old church, all hung\r\ninteriorly with crimson velvet draperies and trophies of flags, was\r\nvery splendid. There was in the church three rows _de tribunes_ all\r\nfull of well-dressed people. _Les grands corps de l'État étaient\r\nrangés de chaque côté et dans le ch[oe]ur; l'Autel était placé au\r\ncentre de l'église. Les cardinaux et tout le clergé étaient alentour._\r\nWhen my father arrived, the Archbishop of Paris received him at the\r\ndoor of the church, and we all walked in state. My father _ouvrait la\r\nmarche_ with the Queen. _Prie-dieu_ and chairs were disposed for us\r\n_en demi-cercle_ before the altar, or rather before the baptismal\r\nfont, which was placed in front of it, in the very middle of the\r\nChurch. My father and mother stood in the centre of the row near each\r\nother. Your uncle, Chartres, and all the Princes followed on the\r\nside of my father, and the princesses on the side of my mother.

It would be a\r\ndifficulty of their own seeking, and their want of candour and justice\r\nto their opponents would be the cause of their own embarrassments.\r\n\r\nThe moment is a very important one, and the consequences of the vote\r\nof Friday, or probably Monday, cannot fail to be serious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: A MINISTERIAL CRISIS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by Mr Anson._\r\n\r\n_\"The Ministry in jeopardy.\" (Heading in the Prince Albert's hand.)_\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _4th May 1841._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne came down from town after the House of Lords. I went\r\nwith him to his room for an hour after the Queen had retired. He said\r\nthe main struggle would take place on the Sugar Duties on Friday. His\r\nimpression was that the Government would be beat, and he must then\r\ndecide whether to go out or dissolve. He leaned to the former. I said,\r\n\"I trusted he would not dissolve unless he thought there was some\r\nprospect of increasing his strength, and begged him to remember what\r\nwas done would not be considered the act of the Government but that of\r\nhimself and the Queen, and that he individually would be held as the\r\nresponsible person.\"\r\n\r\nHe said he had not written to the Queen to prepare H.M. for coming\r\nevents and the course that it would be incumbent upon her to take, for\r\nhe felt it extremely difficult and delicate, especially as to the use\r\nshe should make of the Prince, and of her mode of communication when\r\nshe required it with Lord Melbourne. He thought she ought never to ask\r\nhis advice direct, but if she required his opinion there would be no\r\nobjection to her obtaining it through the Prince.\r\n\r\nHe said H.M. had relied so implicitly upon him upon all affairs, that\r\nhe felt that she required in this emergency advice upon almost every\r\nsubject. That he would tell H.M. that she must carefully abstain from\r\nplaying the same part she did, again, on Sir R. Peel's attempt to form\r\na Ministry, for that nothing but the forbearance of the Tories had\r\nenabled himself and his colleagues to support H.M. at that time. He\r\nfeared Peel's doggedness and pertinacity might make him insist, as a\r\npoint of honour, on having all discretion granted to him in regard\r\nto the removal of Ladies. I told him of the Prince's suggestion that\r\nbefore the Queen saw Sir R. Peel some negotiation might be entered\r\ninto with Sir Robert, so that the subject might be avoided by mutual\r\nconsent, the terms of which might be that Sir Robert should give up\r\nhis demand to extort the principle. The Queen, on the other hand,\r\nshould require the resignation of those Ladies objected to by Sir\r\nRobert. Lord Melbourne said, however, that the Prince must not have\r\npersonal communication with Sir Robert on this subject, but he thought\r\nthat I might through the medium of a common friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD MELBOURNE'S ADVICE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by Mr Anson._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _5th May 1841._\r\n\r\nSaw Lord Melbourne after his interview this morning with the Queen. He\r\nsays Her Majesty was perfectly calm and reasonable, and seemed quite\r\nprepared for the resignation of the Government. He said she was\r\nprepared to give way upon the Ladies if required, but much wished\r\nthat that point might be previously settled by negotiation with Sir R.\r\nPeel, to avoid any discussion or difference. Lord Melbourne thinks I\r\nmight do this. He would also like Peel to be cautioned not to press\r\nHer Majesty to decide hastily, but to give Her Majesty time, and that\r\nhe should feel that if he acted fairly he would be met in the same\r\nspirit by the Queen.\r\n\r\nWith regard to future communication with Lord Melbourne, the Queen\r\nsaid she did not mean that a change should exclude her from Lord\r\nMelbourne's society, and when Lord Melbourne said that in society Her\r\nMajesty could not procure Lord Melbourne's opinion upon any subject,\r\nand suggested that that should be obtained through the Prince, Her\r\nMajesty said that that could pass in writing under cover to me, but\r\nthat she must communicate direct.\r\n\r\nThe Queen, he says, leans to sending for the Duke of Wellington. Lord\r\nMelbourne advised that Her Majesty should make up her mind at once to\r\nsend for Sir Robert. He told me that it would not be without precedent\r\nto send for both at once; this it appears to me would obviate every\r\nobjection. The Queen, he thinks, has a perfect right to exercise her\r\njudgment upon the selection of all persons recommended to Her Majesty\r\nfor Household appointments, both as to liking, but chiefly as to their\r\ncharacter and as to the character of the husband or wife of the person\r\nselected. He would advise the Queen to adopt the course which King\r\nWilliam did with Lord Melbourne in 1835, viz. desiring Lord Melbourne,\r\nbefore His Majesty approved of any appointments, to send a list of\r\nthose proposed even to the members of every Board, and the King having\r\nthem all before him expressed his objections to certain persons, which\r\nLord Melbourne yielded to.\r\n\r\nTold Lord Melbourne that the Prince wished him to impress upon the\r\nQueen's mind not to act upon the approaching crisis without the\r\nPrince, because she would not be able to go through difficulties by\r\nherself, and the Prince would not be able to help her when he was\r\nignorant of the considerations which had influenced her actions. He\r\nwould wish Lord Melbourne when with the Queen to call in the Prince,\r\nin order that they might both be set right upon Lord Melbourne's\r\nopinions, that he might express in the presence of each other his\r\nviews, in order that he should not convey different impressions by\r\nspeaking to them separately, so that _they_ might act in concert.\r\n\r\nThe Prince says the Queen always sees what is right at a glance, but\r\nif her feelings run contrary she avoids the Prince's arguments, which\r\nshe feels sure agree with her own, and seeks arguments to support her\r\nwishes against her convictions from other people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DISSOLUTION OR RESIGNATION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _7th May 1841._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and laments\r\nmuch the prospect that lies before us, more especially as it is so\r\nrepugnant to your Majesty's feelings. Your Majesty has often observed\r\nthat these events must come in the course of affairs at some moment or\r\nanother, but Lord Melbourne knows not whether it is much consolation\r\nto reflect that what is very disagreeable is also natural and\r\nunavoidable. Lord Melbourne feels certain that your Majesty will\r\nconsider the situation calmly and impartially, will do that which\r\nshall appear the best for your own interests and those of the country,\r\nwhich are identical.\r\n\r\nEverything shall be done that can be; the questions which may arise\r\nshall be considered well, and upon as full information as can be\r\nobtained. But Lord Melbourne has little to add to what he wrote to\r\nyour Majesty yesterday. So many interests are affected by this Sugar\r\nquestion, the West Indian, the East Indian, the opponents of Slavery\r\nand others, that no small number of our supporters will be induced\r\neither to stay away or to vote against us, and this must place us in\r\na minority upon the main points of our Budget. In this we can hardly\r\nacquiesce, nor can we adopt a different policy and propose other\r\ntaxes, when in our opinion the necessary revenue can be raised without\r\nimposing them. This state of things imposes upon us the alternative\r\nof dissolution or of resignation, and to try the former without\r\nsucceeding in it would be to place both your Majesty and ourselves in\r\na worse situation than that in which we are at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _8th May 1841._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. We have been\r\nconsidering this question of dissolution at the Cabinet, and we have\r\nhad before us a general statement of the public returns for England\r\nand Wales. It is not very favourable, but Lord Melbourne fears that it\r\nis more favourable than the reality would prove. The Chancellor,[23]\r\nPalmerston, and Hobhouse are strongly for dissolution, but the opinion\r\nof the majority is the other way, and in that opinion Lord Melbourne\r\nis strongly inclined to agree.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne will have the honour of waiting upon your Majesty\r\nto-morrow at three.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 23: The Earl of Cottenham.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: SIR ROBERT PEEL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by Mr Anson._\r\n\r\nNOTES UPON AN INTERVIEW WITH SIR ROBERT PEEL (NO. 1).[24]\r\n\r\n_9th May 1841._\r\n\r\nTold Sir Robert that I had wished to have sought him through the\r\nmedium of a common friend, which would have given him a greater\r\nconfidence than I had now a right to expect at his hands, but I\r\nfelt upon so delicate a mission it was safer, and would be more in\r\naccordance with his wishes, to come direct.\r\n\r\nThat the Prince had sent me to him, with the object of removing\r\ndifficulties upon his coming into office.\r\n\r\nThat Her Majesty was anxious that the question of the removal of the\r\nLadies of the Bedchamber should not be revived, and would wish that\r\nin any personal communication with Sir Robert this question might be\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nThat it might be arranged that if Sir Robert would not insist upon\r\ncarrying out his principle, Her Majesty might procure the resignation\r\nof any Ladies whom Sir Robert might object to; that I thought there\r\nmight be a disposition to yield to the removal of the Mistress of the\r\nRobes, Lady Normanby, and the Duchess of Bedford, as being connected\r\nwith leading political persons in Government.\r\n\r\nEndeavoured to impress upon Sir Robert that if he acts fairly and\r\nkindly towards the Queen, he will be met in the same spirit.\r\n\r\nSir Robert said he had considered the probable object of my interview,\r\nand thought, from my former position with Lord Melbourne, that Lord\r\nMelbourne would be aware of my coming. He must be assured of this\r\nbefore he could speak confidentially to me.\r\n\r\nUpon this I admitted that Lord Melbourne had knowledge of my\r\nintention, but that I was not authorised to say that he had.\r\n\r\nSir Robert said, \"I shall put aside all form, and treat you frankly\r\nand confidentially. You may depend upon every word you say being held\r\nas sacred. No part, without further permission, shall be mentioned\r\neven to the Duke, much less to any of my other colleagues.\r\n\r\n\"_I would waive every pretension to office, I declare to God! sooner\r\nthan that my acceptance of it should be attended with any personal\r\nhumiliation to the Queen._\"\r\n\r\nHe thought that giving in the names of those Ladies whom he considered\r\nobnoxious was an offensive course towards the Queen.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of office, which he did not covet, he could not concede\r\nany constitutional principle, but it was not necessary that that\r\nprinciple should be mooted.\r\n\r\n\"It would be repulsive to my feelings that Her Majesty should part\r\nwith any of her Ladies, as the _result of a forced stipulation on my\r\npart_; in a party sense it would doubtless be advantageous to me to\r\nsay that I had demanded from the Queen, and the Queen had conceded to\r\nme the appointments of these three Ladies.\"\r\n\r\nThe mode he would like, and which he considered as least objectionable\r\nfor Her Majesty, was for Her Majesty to say to him, \"There is no\r\noccasion to revive this constitutional question, as those ladies\r\nimmediately connected with prominent members of the Administration\r\nhave sent in their resignation.\"\r\n\r\nThe vacancies existing before Sir Robert Peel sees Her Majesty, there\r\nis no necessity for discussion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, by this means, there was less appearance of insult to\r\nthe Queen, and on the other, there was no appearance of concession of\r\nprinciple upon his.\r\n\r\nSir Robert was ready to make any personal sacrifice for Her Majesty's\r\ncomfort, except that of his honour. \"Can the Queen for an instant\r\nsuppose that I would permit my party to urge me on to insist upon\r\nanything incompatible with Her Majesty's dignity, which it would be my\r\ngreat aim and honour to defend?\"\r\n\r\n[This was his indignant reply to my remark upon the rumours that his\r\nparty would press him to coerce and subdue Her Majesty.]\r\n\r\nSir Robert thinks it better for the Queen to avoid anything in the\r\nshape of a stipulation. He would like what he would have done upon\r\na former occasion (and upon which, on the honour of a gentleman, his\r\nviews had undergone no change) to be taken as a test of what he would\r\nbe ready to concede to.\r\n\r\nNothing but misconception, he said, could in his opinion have led\r\nto failure before. \"_Had the Queen told me_\" (after the question\r\nwas mooted, which it never need have been) \"_that those three\r\nladies immediately connected with the Government had tendered their\r\nresignation, I should have been perfectly satisfied_, and should have\r\nconsulted the Queen's feelings in replacing them.\"\r\n\r\nSir Robert said this conversation shall remain sacred, and to all\r\neffect, as if it had never happened, until he saw me again to-morrow\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing said, he added, which in any way pledges or\r\ncompromises the Queen, the Prince, or Lord Melbourne.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 24: See Parker's _Sir Robert Peel_, vol. ii. p. 455,\r\n    _et seq._, where Peel's memorandum of the interview is set\r\n    out.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: SIR ROBERT PEEL]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: HOUSEHOLD APPOINTMENTS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by Mr Anson._\r\n\r\nINTERVIEW WITH SIR ROBERT PEEL (No. 2).\r\n\r\n_10th May 1841._\r\n\r\nPeel said: \"It is essential to my position with the Queen that Her\r\nMajesty should understand that I have the feelings of a gentleman, and\r\nwhere my duty does not interfere, I cannot act against her wishes.\r\nHer Majesty doubtless knows how pressed I am as the head of a powerful\r\nparty, but the impression I wish to create in Her Majesty's mind is,\r\nthat I am bound to defend her against their encroachments.\"\r\n\r\nIn regard to Household appointments the holders of which are not in\r\nParliament, he had not considered the question, but in the meantime he\r\nwould in no way commit himself to anyone, or to any understanding\r\nupon the subject, without previous communication. He had no personal\r\nobjects to serve, and the Queen's wishes would always be consulted.\r\n\r\nHe again repeated, that if the Queen's personal feelings would suffer\r\nless by forming an Administration to his exclusion, he should not be\r\noffended. Private life satisfied him, and he had no ambition beyond\r\nit.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne might rest assured that _he_ fully appreciated his aim,\r\nthat his only object was to do that which was most for Her Majesty's\r\nadvantage, and no human being should know that he was privy to\r\nthis overture. Lord Melbourne might depend upon his honour. If Lord\r\nMelbourne was pressed to a dissolution he should still feel the same\r\nimpression of Lord Melbourne's conduct, that it was honourable and\r\nstraightforward.\r\n\r\nHe wished the Prince to send him a list of those Ladies whom it would\r\nbe agreeable to Her Majesty to have in her Household. Sir Robert must\r\npropose it to the Ladies, but will be entirely guided by Her Majesty's\r\nwishes. There should be no appearance that Her Majesty has any\r\nunderstanding, as he was bound to his party to make it appear that the\r\nappointments emanated from himself.[25]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 25: There was a further interview on the following\r\n    day at which various detailed points were arranged.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Queen._\r\n\r\n_11th May 1841._\r\n\r\nThe Queen considers it her right (and is aware that her predecessors\r\nwere peculiarly tenacious of this right) to appoint her Household.\r\nShe, however, gives up the great officers of State and those of\r\nher Lords-in-Waiting, Equerries, and Grooms-in-Waiting, who are _in\r\nParliament_, to the appointment of the Prime Minister, subject to her\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has _always_ appointed her _Ladies of the Bedchamber\r\nherself_, but has generally mentioned their names to the Prime\r\nMinister before appointing them, in order to leave him room for\r\nobjection in case he should deem their appointment injurious to his\r\nGovernment, when the Queen would probably not appoint the Lady.\r\n\r\nThe Maids of Honour and Women of the Bedchamber are of course not\r\nincluded amongst those who are mentioned to the Prime Minister before\r\ntheir appointment, but are at once appointed by the Queen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PRESSURE OF BUSINESS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extract from the Queen's Journal._\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 12th May 1841._\r\n\r\n\"At seven minutes to five Lord Melbourne came to me and stayed till\r\nhalf-past five. He gave me the copies of Anson's conversations with\r\nPeel. Lord Melbourne then gave me a letter from the Chancellor to\r\nread, strongly advocating a dissolution, and wishing that there should\r\nbe a division also on Lord John Russell's amendment.[26]\r\n\r\n\"Lord Melbourne left the letter with me. The first part of the letter,\r\nrelative to Lord John's amendment, we think good, but the other\r\npart we can't quite agree in. 'There is to be a Cabinet to-morrow\r\nto consider what is to be done,' said Lord Melbourne, 'for the\r\nChancellor's opinion must be considered. There is a preferment amongst\r\nour people for dissolution,' Lord M. added. The feeling in the country\r\ngood. I asked Lord M., 'Must they resign directly, the next day, after\r\nthe division (if they intended resigning)?' 'Why,' he said, 'it was\r\nawkward _not_ to do so if Parliament was sitting; if the division were\r\nonly to take place on Friday, then they needn't announce it till Monday,'\r\nwhich we hope will be the case, as we agreed it wouldn't do for me to\r\nhave a ball the day Lord M. had resigned, and before I had sent for\r\nanybody else, and therefore I hoped that it could be managed that the\r\ndivision did not take place till Friday. Lord M. said that in case they\r\nresigned, he wished Vernon Smith[27] to be made a Privy Councillor; the\r\nonly addition to the Peers he mentioned the other day he wished to make\r\nis Surrey;[28] we agreed that too many Peers was always a bad thing.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 26: To Lord Sandon's resolution on the Sugar Duties.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 27: Robert Vernon Smith (1800-1873), Under-Secretary\r\n    for War and the Colonies, afterwards Lord Lyveden.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 28: The Earl of Surrey (1791-1856) was now M.P. for\r\n    West Sussex, and Treasurer of the Household, and was afterwards\r\n    thirteenth Duke of Norfolk.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\n_11th May 1841._\r\n\r\n...

If we were to\r\ndissolve,' he continued, 'and were to have the parties equal as they\r\nare now, it would be very bad; if we _were_ to have a _majority_, it\r\nwould be a great thing; _but_ if we were to have a minority it would\r\nbe still worse.... We know that Charles I. and Charles II., and even\r\nCromwell, appealed to the country, and had a Parliament returned\r\ninto their very teeth' (so strong an Opposition), 'and that produced\r\ndeposition, and convulsion, and bloodshed and death; but since then\r\nthe Crown has always had a majority returned in favour of it. Even\r\nQueen Anne,' he continued, 'who removed Marlborough in the midst of\r\nhis most glorious victories and dissolved Parliament, had an immense\r\nmajority, though her measures were miserable; William IV.,' he said,\r\n'even though he had a majority against him which prevented him from\r\nkeeping his Ministers, had a much stronger feeling for him in that\r\nParliament, than he ever had before.

But this expectation has been entirely\r\ndisappointed; debate has unmasked the hollow pretence of humanity,\r\nand the meetings at Exeter Hall and in the country have completely\r\ncounteracted the impressions which Dr Lushington's speech[30] had\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nLancashire, Cheshire, and the West Riding of Yorkshire have been\r\nroused to strong excitement by the prospect of a reduction of the\r\nduty on corn. Several of the large towns have expressed their opinions\r\nwithout distinction of party.\r\n\r\nThese symptoms are said to have created some dissensions among the\r\nopponents of your Majesty's present Government.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel, Lord Stanley, and nearly all the eminent leaders\r\nof the party, profess their adherence to the principles of Mr\r\nHuskisson.[31] On the other hand, the Duke of Buckingham,[32] with\r\nmany Lords and Commoners, is opposed to any relaxation of the\r\npresent Corn Laws. This difference must ultimately produce serious\r\nconsequences, and it is possible they may break out before the present\r\ndebate is ended.\r\n\r\nOne consequence of the propositions of the Ministry is the\r\nweakening of the power of the Chartists, who have relied on the\r\nmisrepresentation that neither Whigs nor Tories would ever do anything\r\nfor the improvement of the condition of the working classes.\r\n\r\nAll these circumstances have a bearing on the question of a\r\ndissolution of Parliament, and are to be weighed against the risks and\r\ninconveniences of so bold a measure.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 29: On Lord Sandon's resolution.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 30: Against the Budget, on the ground that it tended\r\n    to encourage slavery.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 31: Which were opposed to Protection and the\r\n    Navigation Laws.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 32: Richard Plantagenet (1797-1861), second Duke of\r\n    the 1822 creation, M.P. for Bucks 1818-1839, and author of\r\n    the \"Chandos clause,\" became Lord Privy Seal this year, but\r\n    resigned shortly after.

There were no\r\n_new_ news. He gave me a letter from the Duke of Roxburgh,[33] saying\r\nhe could not support Government on the Corn Laws, and writing an\r\nunnecessarily cold letter. Lord Melbourne fears this would lose\r\nRoxburgh in case of an election. A great many of the friends of the\r\nGovernment, however, are against any alteration in the Corn Laws.\r\nTalked of the excellent accounts from the country with which the\r\npapers are full, and I said I couldn't help thinking the Government\r\nwould gain by a dissolution, and the feeling in the country so strong,\r\nand daily increasing. They would lose the counties, Lord Melbourne\r\nthinks, and the question is whether their successes in the\r\nmanufacturing towns would be sufficient to counterbalance that. The\r\ndebate may last longer, Lord Melbourne says, as J. Russell says he\r\nwill continue it as long as their friends wish it. Many of their\r\nfriends would be very angry if we did not dissolve, Lord Melbourne\r\nsays. 'I say always,' said Lord Melbourne, 'that your Majesty will\r\nbe in such a much worse position' (if a majority should be returned\r\nagainst us), 'but they say not, for that the others would dissolve.'\r\nI said that if that was so we _must dissolve_, for then that it would\r\ncome to just the same thing, and that that changed my opinion very\r\nmuch. 'You would like us then to make the attempt?' Lord Melbourne\r\nasked. I said 'Almost.' I asked if he really thought they would\r\ndissolve. 'I've great reason to believe they would,' he replied.\r\n'Hardinge[34] told Vivian[35] \"we shall prevent _your_ dissolving, but\r\n_we shall_ dissolve.\"' ... I asked did Lord Melbourne think they (the\r\nConservatives) would remain in long, and Melbourne said: 'One can't\r\ntell beforehand what may happen, but you would find their divisions\r\nand dissensions amongst themselves sufficient to prevent their staying\r\nin long.' ...\r\n\r\n\"Saw Lord John Russell, who didn't feel certain if the debate would\r\nend to-night. Talked of the very good feeling in the country. He said\r\nhe understood Sir Edward Knatchbull[36] was exceedingly displeased at\r\nwhat Peel had said concerning Free Trade, and said in that case Peel\r\nwould be as bad as the present Government. He thinks the Tories, if in\r\npower, might try and collect the Sugar duties without Law, which would\r\ndo them a great deal of harm and be exceedingly unpopular. He does\r\n_not_ think the Tories intend _certainly_ to dissolve. He thinks they\r\nwould not dissolve now, and that they would hereafter get so entangled\r\nby their own dissensions, as to render it unfavourable to them.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 33: James, sixth Duke.

Since last Monday, the 10th, we\r\nhave lived in the daily expectation of a final event taking place, and\r\nthe debate _still_ continues, and it is not certain whether it will\r\neven finish to-night, this being the eighth night, it having begun on\r\nFriday the 7th, two Saturdays and two Sundays having intervened! Our\r\nplans are so unsettled that I can tell you nothing, only that you\r\nmay depend upon it nothing will be done without having been duly,\r\nproperly, and maturely weighed. Lord Melbourne's conduct is as usual\r\nperfect; fair, calm, and totally disinterested, and I am certain that\r\nin whatever position he is _you_ will treat him _just_ as you have\r\nalways done.\r\n\r\nMy dearest Angel is indeed a great comfort to me. He takes the\r\ngreatest interest in what goes on, feeling with and for me, and yet\r\nabstaining as he ought from biassing me either way, though we talk\r\nmuch on the subject, and his judgment is, as you say, good and\r\nmild....\r\n\r\n_P.S._--Pray let me hear soon _when_ you come. You, I know, like me\r\nto tell you what I hear, and for me to be frank with you. I therefore\r\ntell you that it is believed by some people here, and even by some\r\nin the Government, that _you_ wish my Government to be _out_. Now,\r\nI never for an instant can believe such an assertion, as I know your\r\nliberal feelings, and your interest in my welfare and in that of\r\nthe country too well to think you could wish for such a thing, and I\r\nimmediately said I was sure this was not so; but I think you would\r\ndo well to say to Seymour something which might imply interest in my\r\npresent Government.\r\n\r\nI know you will understand my anxiety on your account, lest such a\r\nmischievous report should be believed. It comes, you see, from the\r\nidea that your feelings are very French.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE CORN LAWS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extract from the Queen's Journal._\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 18th May 1841._\r\n\r\n\"Saw Lord Melbourne.[37] He said Lord John Russell had been to\r\nsee him, and, 'He now wishes us not to resign, but to give notice\r\nimmediately of a Motion on the Corn Laws. This, he thinks, will make\r\nthe others propose a vote of confidence, or make them oppose the Sugar\r\nDuties, which, he thinks, will be better for us to resign upon,\r\nand when it would be clear to our people that we couldn't dissolve.\r\nEverybody says it would be a very bad thing for us to resign now, upon\r\nsuch a question as this, and we must consider the party a little.' I\r\nsaid, of course, this would be agreeable to me as it gave us another\r\nchance. I said it would be awkward if they resigned Thursday, on\r\naccount of the Birthday. Lord Melbourne said I could wait a day and\r\nonly send for Peel on Saturday, that that wouldn't signify to Peel,\r\nas he could come down to Claremont.... I asked, in case they meant to\r\nbring on this Corn Law question, when would they do so. 'Perhaps about\r\nthe 30th,' Lord Melbourne said. It would be a more dangerous question,\r\nbut it would make them (the Tories) show their colours, which is a\r\ngreat advantage. He said they prevented Sir Edward Knatchbull from\r\nspeaking last night.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 37: After eight days' discussions of Lord Sandon's\r\n    Motion, the Ministers were defeated by 317 to 281.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: RESIGNATION POSTPONED]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 19th May._\r\n\r\n\"At twenty minutes to one came Lord Melbourne.... I returned him Lord\r\nJohn Russell's letter, and talked of it, and of John Russell's saying\r\nthe division and Peel's speech made it absolutely necessary to decide\r\n_to-day_ whether to _resign_ or _dissolve_. I asked what Peel had\r\nsaid in his speech about the Corn Laws. 'I'll tell you, Ma'am, what he\r\nsaid,' Lord Melbourne replied, 'that he was for a sliding duty and\r\nnot for a fixed duty; but he did not pledge himself as to what rate of\r\nduty it should be. I must say,' Lord Melbourne continued, 'I am\r\nstill against dissolution. I don't think our chances of success are\r\nsufficient.' I replied that I couldn't quite believe that, but that I\r\nmight be wrong. Lord John is for dissolving. '_You_ wish it?' I said I\r\nalways did. Talked of the feeling in the City and in the country being\r\nso good. Lord Melbourne don't think so much of the feeling in the\r\ncountry. Talked of the majority of thirty-six having not been more\r\nthan they expected.... Lord Melbourne said people thought the debate\r\nwas lengthened to please me. I said not at all, but that it was more\r\nconvenient for me. Anyhow I need do nothing till Saturday. The House\r\nof Commons was adjourned to the next day, and the House of Lords to\r\nMonday. 'Mr Baring says,' he said, 'if there was only a majority\r\none way or another, it would be better than this state of complete\r\nequality.'\r\n\r\n\"At twenty minutes past four Lord Melbourne returned. 'Well, Ma'am,'\r\nhe said, 'we've considered this question, and both the sides of\r\nit well, and at last we voted upon it; and there were--the Lord\r\nChancellor for dissolution, Lord Minto[38] for it, Lord Normanby\r\nagainst it, but greatly modified; Lord John for, Lord Palmerston for,\r\nLord Clarendon for, Lord Morpeth for, Lord Lansdowne for, Labouchere\r\nfor, Hobhouse for, Duncannon[39] for, Baring for, Macaulay for; and\r\nunder those circumstances of course I felt I could not but go with\r\nthem.[40] Lord Melbourne was much affected in saying all this. 'So we\r\nshall go on, bring on the Sugar Duties, and then, if things are in a\r\npretty good state, dissolve. I hope you approve?' I said I did highly\r\n... and that I felt so happy to keep him longer. 'You are aware we may\r\nhave a majority against us?' he said; he means in our election. The\r\nSugar Duties would probably take a fortnight or three weeks to pass,\r\nand they would dissolve in June and meet again in October. He thought\r\nthey must.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 38: Lord Minto was First Lord of the Admiralty.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 39: Then First Commissioner of Land Revenue.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 40: See Sir John Hobhouse's account of this Cabinet\r\n    meeting, _Edinburgh Review_, vol. 133, p. 336.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN AND THE CHURCH]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_21st May 1841._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne thinks that what your Majesty proposes to say will do\r\nvery well, but it is thought best to say \"Church as Reformed\" at the\r\nReformation.\r\n\r\nIf your Majesty could say this, it would be well:\r\n\r\n\"I am very grateful for your congratulations on the return of this\r\nday.

I cannot _sufficiently_ express to\r\nyou my _gratitude_ for the frankness with which you have written\r\nto me--and let me entreat you, whenever you have anything _sur\r\nle c[oe]ur_, to _do the same_. I shall begin with your postscript\r\nconcerning the idea that I wished your present Ministers to retire,\r\nbecause they had become disagreeable to France. The people who\r\n_avancent quelque chose de la sorte_ probably have some ill-natured\r\nmotive which it is not always easy to guess; perhaps in the present\r\ninstance does it mean, let us say, _that?_ whatever opinion he may\r\nthen express we can easily counteract it, representing it as the\r\nresult of _strong partiality to France_. Let us therefore examine\r\nwhat France has to gain in a change of Administration. Certainly your\r\npresent Ministers are _not_ much loved _now_ in France, not so much in\r\nconsequence of the political events of last year themselves, than for\r\nthe _manner_ in which they came to pass. Nevertheless, when I was at\r\nParis, King and Council were decided to sign the treaty with the four\r\nother Powers, which would put an end to the _isolement_, though many\r\npeople are stoutly _for the isolement_. There end the relations which\r\nwill exist for some time between the two countries--they will be on\r\n_decent_ terms; that is all I wish for the present, and it is matter\r\nof moonshine who your Ministers are. No doubt, formerly there existed\r\nsuch a predilection in favour of Lord Grey's[42] Administration and\r\nthose who continued it, that the coming in of the Tories would have\r\nbeen considered as a great public calamity; but even now, though\r\nthis affection is gone, the Tories will also be looked on with some\r\nsuspicion. Lord Melbourne's Administration has had the great merit of\r\nbeing liberal, and at the same time prudent, conservative in the good\r\nsense of the word, preserving what was good. Monarchy, by an adherence\r\nto this system, was very safe, and the popular liberal cry needless.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 42: 1830-1834.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: KING LEOPOLD'S ADVICE]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_Continued at_) LAEKEN, _21st May._\r\n\r\nI regret that the Corn question was brought forward somewhat\r\nabruptly;[43] it is a dangerous one, as it roused the most numerous\r\nand poorest classes of society, and may easily degenerate into\r\nbloodshed. The dissolution under such circumstances would become still\r\nmore a source of agitation, as it generally always is in England. Lord\r\nMelbourne, I am sure, will think so too.\r\n\r\nI am delighted by what you say of Albert; it is just the proper line\r\nfor him to take, without biassing you either way, to show you honestly\r\nthe consequences which in his opinion the one or the other may have.\r\nAs he has really a very clear and logical judgment, his opinion will\r\nbe valuable for you. I feel very much for you, and these Ministerial\r\ncomplications are of a most painful and perplexing nature, though\r\nless in England than on the Continent, as the thing is at least better\r\nunderstood. To amuse you a little, and to prove to you how impartial\r\nI must be to be in this way accused by both parties, I must tell you\r\nthat it is said in France that, conjointly with Lord Melbourne,\r\nwe _artfully_ ruined the Thiers Administration,[44] to the great\r\ndetriment of the honour and welfare of France. But what is still\r\nstranger is, that the younger branches of the family, seeing that my\r\narrival at Paris was delayed from time to time, became convinced that\r\n_I would not come at all_, and that my intention was to _cut them\r\ncompletely_, not to _compromettre_ myself with England! Truly people\r\nare strange, and the unnecessary suspicions and stories which they\r\nlove to have, and to tell, a great bore....\r\n\r\nPray have the goodness of giving my _kindest_ regards to Lord\r\nMelbourne. I will love him very _tenderly_ in and out of office, as\r\nI am really attached to him. Now last, though first, I offer my\r\nsincerest wishes on the happy return of your birthday; may every\r\nblessing be always bestowed on your beloved head. You possess _much_,\r\nlet your warm and honest heart _appreciate_ that. Let me also express\r\nthe hope that you always will maintain your _dear character true_\r\nand _good_ as it is, and let us also humbly express the hope that\r\nour warmth of feeling, a valuable gift, will not be permitted to\r\ngrow occasionally a little violent, and particularly not against your\r\nuncle. You may pull Albertus by the ear, when so inclined, but be\r\nnever irritated against your uncle. But I have _not to complain_ when\r\nother people do not instigate such things; you have always been kind\r\nand affectionate, and when you look at my deeds for you, and on\r\nbehalf of you, these twenty-two years, I think you will not have many\r\nhardships to recollect. I am happy to hear of my god-daughter's teeth,\r\nand that she is so well. May God keep the whole dear little family\r\nwell and happy for ever.

Peel._\r\n(No. 4.)\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 23rd May 1841._\r\n\r\nCalled upon Sir Robert Peel this morning. I said I could not feel\r\nsatisfied without seeing him after the very unexpected course which\r\npolitical affairs had taken. I wished to know that he felt assured,\r\nthough I trusted there could be no doubt upon his mind, that there\r\nhad been perfect honesty of purpose on my part towards him, and more\r\nespecially upon the part of those with whose knowledge I had been\r\nacting. I assured Sir Robert that H.M. had acted in _the most perfect\r\nfairness towards him_, and I was most anxious that there should be no\r\nerroneous impression upon his mind as to the conduct of either H.M. or\r\nthe Prince.\r\n\r\nI said (quoting the Prince's expression), \"that the Queen has a\r\nnatural modesty upon her constitutional views, and when she receives\r\nan advice from men like the Lord Chancellor, Lord John Russell, Mr\r\nBaring, Mr Labouchere, and Lord Clarendon, and knows that they have\r\nbeen weighing the question through so many days, she concludes that\r\nher judgment cannot be better than theirs, and that she would do wrong\r\nto reject their advice.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince, I said, however strongly impressed for or against a\r\nquestion, thinks it wrong and impolitic, considering his age and\r\ninexperience and his novelty to the country, to press upon the Queen\r\nviews of his own in opposition to those of experienced statesmen. Sir\r\nRobert said he could relieve my mind entirely; that he was convinced\r\nthat all that had taken place had been with the most perfect honesty;\r\nthat he had no feeling whatever of annoyance, or of having been\r\nill-used; that, on the contrary, he had the feeling, and should always\r\nretain it, of the deepest gratitude to the Queen for the condescension\r\nwhich Her Majesty had been pleased to show him, and that it had only\r\nincreased his devotion to Her Majesty's person. He said that much of\r\nthe reserve which he had shown in treating with me was not on _his\r\nown_ account, but that he felt from his own experience that events\r\nwere by no means certain, and he most cautiously abstained from\r\npermitting her Majesty in any way to commit herself, or to bind\r\nherself by any engagement which unforeseen circumstances might render\r\ninconvenient. Sir Robert said it was very natural to try and remove\r\nobstacles which had before created so much confusion, and he was\r\nconvinced that they would have been practically removed by what had\r\npassed. He said that neither Lord Stanley nor Sir James Graham knew\r\na word of what had passed. That Mr Greville had asked his friend Mr\r\nArbuthnot whether some understanding had not been entered into between\r\nLord Melbourne and him. That Mr Arbuthnot had replied that he was\r\ncertain that nothing of the sort could have passed,[45] as, if it had,\r\nSir Robert Peel would have informed him (Mr Arbuthnot) of the fact.\r\nAgain, Lady de Grey, the night of the ball at the Palace, came up to\r\nhim and said the Duke of Bedford had been speaking to her about the\r\nresignation of the Duchess of Bedford, and asking her whether she\r\nthought it necessary. She volunteered to find out from Sir Robert\r\nwhether he thought it requisite. She asked the question, which Sir\r\nRobert tried to evade, but not being able, he said it struck him that\r\nif it was a question of doubt the best means of solving it, was for\r\nthe Duke of Bedford to ask Lord Melbourne for his opinion.\r\n\r\nI added that if the dissolution was a failure, which it was generally\r\napprehended would be the case, I felt convinced that Sir Robert would\r\nbe dealt with in the most perfect fairness by Her Majesty.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 45: \"After I had been told by the Duke of Bedford\r\n    that Peel was going to insist on certain terms, which was\r\n    repeated to me by Clarendon, I went to Arbuthnot, told him\r\n    Melbourne's impression, and asked him what it all meant. He\r\n    said it was all false, that he was certain Peel had no such\r\n    intentions, but, on the contrary, as he had before assured me,\r\n    was disposed to do everything that would be conciliatory\r\n    and agreeable to the Queen.\"--_Greville's Journal_, 19th May\r\n    1841.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: VOTE OF WANT OF CONFIDENCE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _24th May 1841._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has to\r\nacquaint your Majesty that in the House of Commons this evening\r\nSir Robert Peel gave notice that on Thursday next he would move a\r\nresolution to the following effect: \"That Her Majesty's Ministers not\r\npossessing power sufficient to carry into effect the measures\r\nwhich they considered necessary, their retention of office was\r\nunconstitutional and contrary to usage.\"[46] These are not the exact\r\nwords, but they convey the substance. This is a direct vote of want of\r\nconfidence, and Lord Melbourne would be inclined to doubt whether it\r\nwill be carried, and if it is, it certainly will not be by so large\r\na majority as the former vote. When the Chancellor of the Exchequer\r\nmoved the resolution upon the Sugar Duties, Sir Robert Peel seconded\r\nthe motion, thereby intending to intimate that he did not mean to\r\ninterfere with the Supplies. This course was determined upon at a\r\nmeeting held at Sir R. Peel's this morning.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 46: The closing words of the resolution were as\r\n    follows: \"...

I regret much, I must\r\nconfess, that the idea of a dissolution has gained ground, and I will\r\ntry to show in a very few words why I am against it.\r\n\r\nIn politics, a great rule ought to be to rule with the things which\r\none _knows already_, and not to jump into something entirely new of\r\nwhich no one can do more _than guess the consequences._ The present\r\nParliament has been elected at a moment most favourable to the\r\npresent Administration after a most popular accession to the throne,\r\neverything new and fresh, and with the natural fondness of the great\r\nmass of people, a change is always popular; it was known that you were\r\nkindly disposed towards your Ministers, everything was therefore\r\n_à souhait_ for the election of a new Parliament. In this respect\r\nMinisters have nothing like the favourable circumstances which smiled\r\nupon them at the last general election. Feeling this, they raise a\r\ncry, which may become popular and embarrass their antagonists about\r\n_cheap_ bread! I do not think this is quite befitting their\r\ndignity; such things do for revolutionaries like Thiers, or my\r\nlate Ministers.... If the thing rouses the people it may do serious\r\nmischief; if not, it will look awkward for the Ministers themselves.\r\nIf you do not grant a dissolution to your present Ministers you would\r\nhave, at the coming in of a new Administration, the right to tell them\r\nthat they must go on with the present Parliament; and I have no doubt\r\nthat they could do so. The statistics of the present House of Commons\r\nare well known to all the men who sit in it, and to keep it a few\r\nyears longer would be a real advantage.\r\n\r\nYou know that I have been rather maltreated by the Tories, formerly to\r\nplease George IV., and since I left the country, because I served, in\r\ntheir opinion, on the revolutionary side of the question. I must\r\nsay, however, that for your service as well as for the quiet of the\r\ncountry, it would be good to give them a trial. If they could not\r\nremain in office it will make them quieter for some time. If by\r\na dissolution the Conservative interest in the House is too much\r\nweakened the permanent interests of the country can but suffer from\r\nthat. If, on the contrary, the Conservatives come in stronger, your\r\nposition will not be very agreeable, and it may induce them to be\r\nperhaps less moderate than they ought to be. I should be very happy if\r\nyou would discuss these, my _hasty_ views, with Lord Melbourne. I\r\ndo not give them for more than what they are, mere _practical_\r\nconsiderations; but, as far as I can judge of the question, if I was\r\nmyself concerned I should have no dissolution; if even there was but\r\nthe very _banale_ consideration, _qu'on sait ce qu'on a, mais qu'on ne\r\nsait nullement ce qu'on aura_. The moment is not without importance,\r\nand well worthy your earnest consideration, and I feel convinced that\r\nLord Melbourne will agree with me, that, notwithstanding the great\r\npolitical good sense of the people in England, the machine is so\r\ncomplicated that it should be handled with great care and tenderness.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I must add that perhaps a permanent duty on corn may be a\r\ndesirable thing, but that it ought to be sufficiently high to serve as\r\na real protection. It may besides produce this effect, that as it\r\nwill be necessary, at least at first, to buy a good deal of the to be\r\nimported corn with _money_, the currency will be seriously affected\r\nby it. The countries which would have a chance of selling would be\r\nchiefly Poland in all its parts, Prussia, Austria, and Russia, the\r\nSouth of Russia on the Black Sea, and maybe Sicily. Germany does not\r\ngrow a sufficient quantity of wheat to profit by such an arrangement;\r\nit will besides not buy more from England for the present than it does\r\nnow, owing to the Zollverein,[49] which must first be altered. But I\r\nwill not bore you too long, and conclude with my best love to little\r\nVictoria, of whom her Grandmama speaks with raptures. Ever, my dearest\r\nVictoria, your devoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 48: The Duchess of Kent had left England for a tour\r\n    on the Continent.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 49: After the fall of Napoleon, the hopes of many\r\n    Germans for a united national Germany were frustrated by\r\n    the Congress of Vienna, which perpetuated the practical\r\n    independence of a number of German States, as well as the\r\n    predominance within the Germanic confederation of Austria,\r\n    a Power largely non-German. One of the chief factors in the\r\n    subsequent unification of Germany was the Zollverein, or\r\n    Customs Union, by which North Germany was gradually bound\r\n    together by commercial interest, and thus opposed to Austria.\r\n    The success of this method of imperial integration has not\r\n    been without influence on the policies of other lands.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE OPPOSITION ELATED]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_WILTON CRESCENT, 5th June 1841._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has\r\nthe honour to state that the House divided about three this morning.\r\n\r\n  For Sir Robert Peel       312\r\n  Against                   311\r\n                            ---\r\n  Majority                    1\r\n\r\nThe Opposition were greatly elated by this triumph.

It will suit him much better to wait upon\r\nyour Majesty at dinner to-morrow than to-day, as his hand shows some\r\ndisposition to gather, and it may be well to take care of it.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is very glad to learn that everything went off well at\r\nOxford. Lord Melbourne expected that the Duke of Sutherland[55] would\r\nnot entirely escape a little public animadversion. Nothing can be\r\nmore violent or outrageous than the conduct of the students of\r\nboth Universities upon such occasions; the worst and lowest mobs\r\nof Westminster and London are very superior to them in decency and\r\nforbearance.\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop[56] is a very agreeable man; but he is not without\r\ncunning, and Lord Melbourne can easily understand his eagerness that\r\nthe Queen should not prorogue Parliament in person. He knows that it\r\nwill greatly assist the Tories. It is not true that it is universal\r\nfor the Sovereign to go down upon such occasions. George III. went\r\nhimself in 1784; he did not go in 1807, because he had been prevented\r\nfrom doing so by his infirmities for three years before.

But we shall try and do our best to make it as little dull\r\nas we can, and you will kindly take the will for the deed.\r\n\r\nWe came back from Nuneham yesterday afternoon. Albert came back\r\nat half-past five on Tuesday from Oxford, where he had been\r\nenthusiastically received, but the students ... had the bad taste to\r\nshow their party feeling in groans and hisses when the name of a\r\nWhig was mentioned, which they ought not to have done in my husband's\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nI must now conclude, begging you ever to believe me, your devoted\r\nNiece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\nMy Coiffeur will be quite at Louise's disposal, and he can _coiffer_\r\nin any way she likes, if her dresser tells him how she wishes it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD BROUGHAM]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LETTER FROM LORD BROUGHAM]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord Brougham to Queen Victoria._[58]\r\n\r\nGRAFTON STREET, _19th June 1841._\r\n\r\nMOST GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN,--I crave leave humbly to approach your\r\nMajesty and to state in writing what I should have submitted to your\r\nRoyal consideration at an Audience, because I conceive that this\r\ncourse will be attended with less inconvenience to your Majesty.\r\n\r\nIn the counsel which I ventured with great humility, but with an\r\nentire conviction of its soundness, to tender, I cannot be biassed by\r\nany personal interest, for I am not a candidate for office; nor by any\r\nParliamentary interest, for I have no concern with elections; nor by\r\nany factious interest, for I am unconnected with party. My only\r\nmotive is to discharge the duty which I owe to both the Crown and the\r\ncountry. Nor am I under the influence of any prejudice against your\r\nMajesty's servants or their measures; for I charge your Majesty's\r\nservants with nothing beyond an error, a great error, in judgment, and\r\nI entirely approve of the measures which they have lately propounded\r\n(with a single exception partially applicable to one of them), while I\r\nlament and disapprove of the time and manner of propounding them, both\r\non account of the Government and of the measures themselves.\r\n\r\nI feel myself, Madam, under the necessity of stating that the\r\ndissolution of the Parliament appears to me wholly without\r\njustification, either from principle or from policy. They who advise\r\nit must needs proceed upon the supposition that a majority will be\r\nreturned favourable to the continuance of the present Administration\r\nand favourable to their lately announced policy. On no other ground is\r\nit possible that any such advice should be tendered to your Majesty.\r\nFor no one could ever think of such a proceeding as advising the\r\nCrown to dissolve the Parliament in order to increase the force of the\r\nOpposition to its own future Ministers, thus perverting to the mere\r\npurposes of party the exercise of by far the most eminent of the Royal\r\nprerogatives; and I pass over as wholly unworthy of notice the only\r\nother supposition which can with any decency be made, when there is\r\nno conflict between the two Houses, namely, that of a dissolution\r\nin entire ignorance of the national opinion and for the purpose of\r\nascertaining to which side it inclines. Your Majesty's advisers must,\r\ntherefore, have believed, and they must still believe, that a majority\r\nwill be returned favourable both to themselves and their late policy.\r\nI, on the other hand, have the most entire conviction that there will\r\nbe a considerable majority against them, and against their policy a\r\nmajority larger still, many of their supporters having already joined\r\nto swell that majority. Whoever examines the details of the case\r\nmust be satisfied that the very best result which the Government can\r\npossibly hope for is a narrow majority against them--an event which\r\nmust occasion a second dissolution by whatever Ministry may succeed\r\nto the confidence of your Majesty. But those best acquainted with\r\nthe subject have no doubt at all that the majority will be much more\r\nconsiderable.\r\n\r\nI beg leave, Madam, humbly to represent to your Majesty, in my own\r\nvindication for not having laid my opinion before your Majesty as\r\nsoon as I returned from the Continent, that when I first heard of\r\nthe course taken by the Government early in May, I formed the opinion\r\nwhich I now entertain, but conceived that I must have mistaken the\r\nfacts upon which they were acting; and when I arrived twelve days ago\r\nI was confirmed in the belief (seeing the fixed resolution taken to\r\ndissolve) that I must have been under an erroneous impression as to\r\nthe probable results of the elections. But I have since found ample\r\nreason for believing that my original conviction was perfectly well\r\nfounded, and that no grounds whatever exist sufficient to make any\r\none who considers the subject calmly, and without the bias of either\r\ninterest or prejudice, really believe that this ill-fated proceeding\r\ncan have any other result than lasting injury to your Majesty's\r\nservice, to the progress of sound and just views of policy, and to\r\nthe influence of those in whom the Crown and the country alike should\r\nrepose confidence.\r\n\r\nThat a number of short-sighted persons whose judgments are warped by\r\nexclusive attention to a single subject, or by personal feelings, or\r\nby party views (and these narrow and erroneous), may have been loudly\r\nclamorous for the course apparently about to be pursued, is extremely\r\npossible, and affords no kind of excuse for it. Many of these will be\r\nthe slowest to defend what they have so unfortunately called for; some\r\nwill be among the first to condemn it when a manifest failure shall\r\nhave taken place, and general discomfiture shall throw a few local\r\nsuccesses into the shade.\r\n\r\nMy advice is humbly offered to your Majesty, as removed far above such\r\nconfined and factious views; as the parent of all your people; as both\r\nbound and willing to watch over their true interests; and as charged\r\nby virtue of your exalted office with the preservation of the public\r\npeace, the furtherance of the prosperity, and the maintenance of the\r\nliberties of your subjects.\r\n\r\nI am, with profound respect, Madam, your Majesty's faithful and\r\ndutiful Subject,\r\n\r\nBROUGHAM.[59]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 58: Mention has been made earlier of the resentment\r\n    which Brougham cherished against his late colleagues, after\r\n    his exclusion from the Whig Cabinet, and this letter, on the\r\n    proposal to dissolve Parliament, was, no doubt, prompted by\r\n    that feeling.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 59: Parliament, however, notwithstanding this\r\n    rescript of Lord Brougham, was dissolved, and the Ministry\r\n    went to the country with the cry of a fixed duty on corn, as\r\n    against a sliding scale, and they attacked, as monopolists, at\r\n    once the landowner, who enjoyed protection for his wheat,\r\n    and the West Indian proprietor, who profited by the duty on\r\n    foreign sugar. The Conservatives impugned the general\r\n    policy of the Whig Administration. The result, a majority of\r\n    seventy-six, was an even greater Conservative triumph than the\r\n    most sanguine of the party anticipated.--_See_ Introductory\r\n    Note, _ante_, p. 253.

Those who intended to keep him from being useful to\r\nthe Queen, from the fear that he might ambitiously touch upon her\r\nprerogatives, have been completely foiled; they thought they had\r\nprevented Her Majesty from yielding anything of importance to him by\r\ncreating distrust through imaginary alarm. The Queen's good sense,\r\nhowever, has seen that the Prince has no other object in all he seeks\r\nbut a means to Her Majesty's good. The Court from highest to lowest is\r\nbrought to a proper sense of the position of the Queen's husband.\r\nThe country has marked its confidence in his character by passing the\r\nRegency Bill _nem. con._ The Queen finds the value of an active right\r\nhand and able head to support her and to resort to for advice in time\r\nof need. Cabinet Ministers treat him with deference and respect. Arts\r\nand science look up to him as their especial patron, and they find\r\nthis encouragement supported by a full knowledge of the details of\r\nevery subject.

Our little tour was most successful, and we enjoyed it of all\r\nthings; nothing could be more enthusiastic or affectionate than our\r\nreception _everywhere_, and I am happy to hear that our presence has\r\nleft a favourable impression, which I think will be of great use.\r\nThe loyalty in this country is certainly _very striking_. We enjoyed\r\nPanshanger[60] still more than Woburn; the country is quite beautiful,\r\nand the house so pretty and _wohnlich_; the picture-gallery and\r\npictures very splendid.

He said: \"The Prince has been urging me to accept the Blue Riband\r\nbefore I quit office, and I wished to tell you that I am very anxious\r\nthat this should not be pressed upon me by the Queen; it may be a\r\nfoolish weakness on my part, but I wish to quit office without having\r\nany honour conferred upon me; the Queen's confidence towards me is\r\nsufficiently known without any public mark of this nature. I have\r\nalways disregarded these honours, and there would be an inconsistency\r\nin my accepting this. I feel it to be much better for my reputation\r\nthat I should not have it forced upon me. Mr Pitt never accepted\r\nan order, and only the Cinque Ports on being pressed to do so. Lord\r\nGrenville accepted a peerage, but never any other honour or advantage,\r\nand I wish to be permitted to retire in like manner. If I was a poor\r\nman, I should have no hesitation in receiving money in the shape of\r\nplace or pension; I _only don't wish_ for place, because I do not\r\n_want_ it.\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of conversation Lord Melbourne said that he considered\r\nit very improbable that he should ever again form a part of any\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\nHe did not think that a violent course was at all to be apprehended\r\nfrom Lord John Russell; he said Lord John had been far more of a\r\n\"finality\" man than he had, and in the Cabinet had always been averse\r\nto violent change. He added, \"I think you are in error in forming the\r\nopinion which you have of him.\"\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne thought the Queen very much disliked being talked _at_\r\nupon religion; she particularly disliked what Her Majesty termed a\r\n_Sunday face_, but yet that it was a subject far more thought of and\r\nreflected upon than was [thought to be?] the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: A DREADED MOMENT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _15th August 1841._\r\n\r\n... Lord Melbourne well knows the feeling which your Majesty\r\ndescribes. The expectation of an event which is dreaded and\r\ndeprecated, and yet felt to be certain and imminent, presents itself\r\ncontinually to the mind and recurs at every moment, and particularly\r\nin moments of satisfaction and enjoyment. It is perhaps no consolation\r\nto be told that events of this nature are necessary and incidental to\r\nyour Majesty's high situation, but Lord Melbourne anxiously hopes that\r\nthe change, when it does take place, will not be found so grievous\r\nas your Majesty anticipates, and your Majesty may rely that Lord\r\nMelbourne will do everything in his power to reconcile it to your\r\nMajesty's feelings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _17th August 1841._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is very glad to hear of the Princess's tooth.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is much obliged to your Majesty for informing him about\r\nthe mourning.\r\n\r\nHe is quite well and will be ready when your Majesty sends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by Mr Anson._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _23rd August 1841._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell was staying at the Castle, and asked to-day for an\r\naudience of Her Majesty, and was closeted for a long time. The Prince\r\nasked Her Majesty what Lord John came for. The Queen said he came\r\nabout several things, but particularly he wished to impress upon the\r\nQueen that Her Majesty should not allow Sir Robert Peel to propose any\r\nnew Grants in Parliament, as they (the Whigs) could not well oppose\r\nit, and this being felt, the whole unpopularity would fall upon the\r\nQueen's person. An idea existed that the Tories were always jobbing\r\nwith money, and the grant for the building the new stables at Windsor\r\nhad shown how suspicious people were.\r\n\r\nLord John did not speak clearly out, but on consultation with Lord\r\nMelbourne the Queen thought Lord John must have alluded to Peel having\r\nspoken equivocally at the end of his speech relative to the Prince's\r\nannuity, and would now probably propose a further grant, and would say\r\nthe time was now come in order to stand well with the Queen. The Queen\r\nreplied that she would never allow such a thing to be proposed and\r\nthat it would be a disgrace to owe any favour to that Party.\r\n\r\nThe only answer the Prince gave was that these views were _very\r\nagreeable_ for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: A CARRIAGE ACCIDENT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _24th August 1841._\r\n\r\n... Our accident[65] was not so very bad, and considering that it is\r\nthe _very first_ that had happened in the course of _five summers_,\r\nwith _so many_ carriages and horses, one cannot be surprised. I\r\nbeg leave also to say that I _can_ get out _very_ quick. I am very\r\nthankful that you agree to the couriers. I am a little sorry that you\r\nhave put poor Mamma off _so_ late, as she is _very_ much hurt at it, I\r\nfear, by what I hear, and accuses me of it. But that will, I trust,\r\nbe forgiven. You don't say that _you_ sympathise with me in my present\r\nheavy trial,[66] the heaviest I have ever had to endure, and which\r\nwill be a sad heartbreaking to me--but I know you do feel for me. I am\r\nquiet and prepared, but still I fell very _sad_, and God knows! very\r\nwretched at times, for myself and my country, that _such_ a change\r\nmust take place. But God in His mercy will support and guide me\r\nthrough all. Yet I feel that my constant headaches are caused by\r\nannoyance and vexation!\r\n\r\nAdieu, dearest Uncle! God bless you!

We have\r\njust delivered the Speech in the House of Lords, and the debate will\r\ncommence at five o'clock. We understand that the amendment is to be a\r\nrepetition of the motion of want of confidence, which Sir Robert Peel\r\nmade in the House of Commons before the dissolution, and nearly in the\r\nsame terms. It is to be moved by Lord Ripon[67] in the House of\r\nLords, and by Mr. Stuart Wortley[68] in the House of Commons. It is\r\nunderstood to be their intention to avoid, as much as possible, debate\r\nupon the Corn Laws, and upon the other topics in the Speech, and to\r\nplace the question entirely upon the result of the General Election\r\nand the proof which that affords that the Ministry does not possess\r\nthe confidence of the country. Lord Melbourne thinks that it will not\r\nbe found easy to repress debate in the House of Commons, but would not\r\nbe surprised if the course which it is intended to pursue should much\r\nshorten it in the House of Lords. Lord Melbourne will write again to\r\nyour Majesty after the debate, and will certainly come down to-morrow,\r\nunless anything unexpected should occur to prevent him.\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary to receive the address of the Convocation in some\r\nmanner or another. Lord Melbourne will write confidentially to the\r\nArchbishop[69] to learn how it may be received in the quietest manner\r\nand with the least trouble. Lord Melbourne has little doubt that the\r\nLords and Commons will send their addresses by the officers of the\r\nHousehold.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne entreats your Majesty to pick up your spirits.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 67: The first Earl (1782-1859) who had, as Lord\r\n    Goderich, been Premier in 1827-1828.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 68: J.

No one of the Tory\r\nleaders, except Sir Robert Peel, appears disposed to speak.\r\n\r\nShould the Address be voted to-night, and reported to-morrow, it may be\r\npresented to your Majesty by Lord Marcus Hill[71] on Saturday.\r\n\r\nBut should the debate be continued over this night, the report of the\r\nAddress can hardly take place till Monday.

Upon his\r\narrival he found that there was no precedent of the House meeting\r\nagain after an Address, without receiving an answer from the Crown.\r\nLord Erroll therefore delivered the answer in the terms which had been\r\nsubmitted by Lord Melbourne to your Majesty, and it appeared to give\r\nsatisfaction. The debate will probably terminate in the House of\r\nCommons to-night; at the same time it may not. If it does we must\r\nplace our resignation in your Majesty's hands on Saturday, and it must\r\nbe announced to the Houses of Parliament on Monday. Your Majesty\r\nwill then do well not to delay sending for some other person beyond\r\nTuesday. Lord Melbourne will write to your Majesty more fully upon all\r\nthese subjects to-morrow, when he will know the result of the night's\r\ndebate, and be able more surely to point out the course of events.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne received the Eau-de-Cologne, and returns your Majesty\r\nmany thanks for it.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne understands that the Duke of Wellington is, in fact,\r\nvery desirous of having the Foreign Seals,[72] and that if your\r\nMajesty feels any preference for him in that department the slightest\r\nintimation of your Majesty's wish in that respect will fix him in his\r\ndesire to have it.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 72: The Duke had been Foreign Secretary in 1835.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWILTON CRESCENT, _28th August 1841._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has\r\nthe honour to report that the Amendment to the Address was carried by\r\n91, the numbers being--\r\n\r\n  For the Address         269\r\n  For the Amendment       360\r\n                          ---\r\n                           91\r\n                          ---\r\n\r\nThe Tory party proposed that the House should meet this day, and the\r\nSpeaker signified that he should take the Chair at twelve o'clock.

Albert will not stay for the dinner, and I expect him back at\r\nabout eleven to-night. He went at half-past eleven this morning. It is\r\nthe first time that we have ever been separated for so long since our\r\nmarriage, and I am quite melancholy about it.\r\n\r\nYou will forgive me if I mention it to you, but I understand that the\r\nQueen Dowager has been somewhat offended at your not taking leave of\r\nher when she came here, and at your not answering her, when she\r\nwrote to you. Perhaps you would write to her and soften and smoothen\r\nmatters. She did not the least expect you to come to her. Believe me\r\nalways, your most devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _28th August 1841._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs to\r\nacknowledge gratefully the communication which he has just received\r\nfrom your Majesty. Lord Melbourne feels certain that your Majesty's\r\nsense and firmness will enable your Majesty to bear up under this\r\nwhich your Majesty names a severe trial. The kindness of your\r\nMajesty's expressions emboldens Lord Melbourne to say that he also\r\nfeels deeply the pain of separation from a service, which has now for\r\nfour years and more been no less his pleasure than his pride.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne would have been anxious to have waited upon your\r\nMajesty to-day, but he feels that his presence is in some degree\r\nmaterial at a meeting, at which not only the present situation of your\r\nMajesty's servants, but also their future conduct and prospects, will\r\nbe considered.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is sure that your Majesty will at once perceive that\r\nit would not have a good appearance if he were to return to Windsor\r\nimmediately after having announced his resignation to the House of\r\nLords on Monday next.\r\n\r\nIt is right that there should be no appearance of delay or of\r\nunwillingness to carry into effect the wishes of both Houses of\r\nParliament, and, therefore, your Majesty will forgive Lord Melbourne\r\nif he suggests that it would be well if your Majesty could make up\r\nyour mind to appoint Sir R. Peel on Monday next, so that there might\r\nbe as little delay as possible in the formation of a new Government.\r\nOn all accounts, and particularly on account of the lateness of\r\nthe Season, it is desirable that this should be done as speedily as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_29th August 1841._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. He knows\r\nwell what that feeling of working under the impression of trouble and\r\nannoyance is, but if the first gloom is brushed away, confidence and\r\nhope and spirits return, and things begin to appear more cheerful.\r\nLord Melbourne is much obliged by your Majesty's enquiries. He slept\r\nwell, but waked early, which he always does now, and which is a sure\r\nsign of anxiety of mind.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne will be ready to attend your Majesty at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DELAY UNDESIRABLE]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PARTING WITH LORD MELBOURNE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by Mr Anson._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _29th August 1841._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is to take his farewell audience of the Queen\r\nto-morrow, and Her Majesty has appointed Sir Robert Peel to come down\r\nhere at three o'clock to-morrow.\r\n\r\nI went with Lord Melbourne from luncheon to his room. He seemed in\r\ntolerable spirits, though somewhat sad when he alluded to taking leave\r\nof the Queen. He said he was anxious that Her Majesty should lose no\r\ntime in writing to appoint Sir Robert Peel to be here to-morrow, for\r\nthough he was not afraid of Sir Robert taking affront, his Party would\r\nbe too ready to construe any delay on the Queen's part into a slight.\r\nHe said the Prince had been with him just before, and amongst other\r\nthings had urged him to continue to him and to the Queen his advice\r\nand assistance, especially on measures affecting their private\r\nconcerns and family concerns; he told Lord Melbourne it was on these\r\npoints that he felt Lord Melbourne's advice had been peculiarly sound,\r\nand there was no reason why this should not be continued, and any\r\ncommunication might be made through me. Lord Melbourne said that\r\nthe Prince had also entered upon the subject of the Baroness, and\r\nexpressed the constant state of annoyance he was kept in by her\r\ninterference. Lord Melbourne said to me: \"It will be far more\r\ndifficult to remove her after the change of Government than now,\r\nbecause if pressed to do it by a Tory Minister, the Queen's prejudice\r\nwould be immediately aroused.\" I admitted this, but said that though\r\nthe Prince felt that if he pressed the point against the Baroness\r\nremaining, he should be able to carry it, still his good feeling and\r\naffection for the Queen prevented him from pressing what he knew would\r\nbe painful, and what could not be carried without an exciting scene;\r\nhe must remain on his guard, and patiently abide the result. People\r\nwere beginning much better to understand that lady's character, and\r\ntime must surely work its own ends.\r\n\r\nOn my being sent for by the Prince, Lord Melbourne said, \"I shall\r\nsee you again before I take my leave.\" I was much affected by the\r\nearnestness with which this was said, and said I would certainly be\r\nwith him before he saw the Queen to-morrow.\r\n\r\nThe Prince said that Her Majesty was cheerful and in good spirits,\r\nand the only part of the approaching scene which he dreaded was\r\nthe farewell with Lord Melbourne. The Queen had, however, been much\r\nrelieved by the Prince arranging for her hearing from Lord Melbourne\r\nwhenever she wished it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_30th August 1841._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and thanks\r\nyour Majesty much for the very clever and interesting etchings which\r\nyour Majesty most kindly sent him yesterday evening. Lord Melbourne\r\nwill ever treasure them as remembrances of your Majesty's kindness and\r\nregard, which he prizes beyond measure.\r\n\r\nThey will, as your Majesty says, certainly recall to recollection a\r\nmelancholy day, but still Lord Melbourne hopes and trusts that with\r\nthe divine blessing it will hereafter be looked back upon with less\r\ngrief and bitterness of feeling, than it must be regarded at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE PRINCE'S POSITION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by Mr Anson._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _30th August 1841._\r\n\r\nDirectly I got here this morning the Prince sent for me, and said he\r\nhad been made somewhat uneasy by a conversation he had just had with\r\nthe Queen. Her Majesty said that after the manner in which the Tories\r\nhad treated the Prince (relative to annuity) he ought now to keep them\r\nat a distance. She said they would try to flatter him, and would all\r\ncome to see him; this he should resist, and should refuse to see them,\r\nat all events for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Prince wished me to mention this to Lord Melbourne when I went to\r\ntake leave of him, and to urge Lord Melbourne to set this right with\r\nthe Queen by his advice before he parted with the Queen, reminding him\r\nthat his view had always been that from this moment the Prince would\r\ntake up a new position, and that the Queen, no longer having Lord\r\nMelbourne to resort to in case of need, must from this moment consult\r\nand advise with the Prince. That Lord Melbourne should urge the Queen\r\nto have no scruple in employing the Prince, and showing that unless\r\na proper understanding existed from the first, he in attempting to do\r\ngood would be easily misrepresented.\r\n\r\nI found Lord Melbourne alone in his dressing-room and put this case\r\nbefore him. He said he had always thought that when he left the\r\nservice of the Queen the Prince would of necessity be brought forward,\r\nand must render great assistance to the Queen; and the Queen's\r\nconfidence in his judgment having so much increased, this consequence\r\nwas the more natural. The Prince must, however, be very cautious at\r\nfirst, and in a little time he would fall into it. He must be\r\nvery careful not to alarm the Queen, by Her Majesty for an instant\r\nsupposing that the Prince was carrying on business with Peel without\r\nher cognisance.\r\n\r\nIf it were possible for any one to advise Peel, he would recommend\r\nthat he should write fully to Her Majesty, and _elementarily_, as Her\r\nMajesty always liked to have full knowledge upon everything which was\r\ngoing on. He would advise the Queen to be cautious in giving a verbal\r\ndecision, that she should not allow herself to be _driven into a\r\ncorner_, and forced to decide where she felt her mind was not made up\r\nand required reflection.\r\n\r\nPeel should be very careful that intelligence came first from him\r\ndirect. King William was very particular upon this point, so was the\r\nQueen.\r\n\r\nI asked Lord Melbourne if he had considered the future position of\r\nhimself with the Queen, and also of Peel with the Queen. He said he\r\nowned he had not and would avoid entering into any discussion--he felt\r\nsure that he should be regarded with extreme jealousy, not so much by\r\nPeel as by the party. He would be looked upon as Lord Bute had been in\r\nhis relation to George III.,--always suspected of secret\r\nintercourse and intrigue. He would make me the medium of any written\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Peel's position with the Queen, he thought that\r\ncircumstances must make it. He thought the Queen must see him oftener\r\nthan King William did him, as he thought the present state of things\r\nwould require more frequent intercourse. The late King used to see\r\nhim once a week after the Levée, seldom oftener; all the rest of the\r\nbusiness was transacted by correspondence, but this mode, though it\r\nhad its merits in some respect, very much impeded the public business.\r\n\r\nThe less personal objections the Queen took to any one the better, as\r\nany such expression is sure to come out and a personal enemy is\r\nmade. It was also to be recollected that Peel was in a very different\r\nposition now, backed by a large majority, to when the other overture\r\nwas made. He had the power _now_ to extort what he pleased, and he\r\nfancied he saw the blank faces of the heads of the Party when Peel\r\ntold them that he had agreed to the dismissal or resignation of only\r\nthree of the Queen's ladies.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne said the Queen was afraid she never could be at ease\r\nwith Peel, because his manner was so embarrassed, and that conveyed\r\nembarrassment also to her, which it would be very difficult to get\r\nover.\r\n\r\nThe Queen took leave of Lord Melbourne to-day. Her Majesty was much\r\naffected, but soon recovered her calmness.\r\n\r\nPeel had his first audience at half-past three o'clock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MELBOURNE'S OPINION OF THE PRINCE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_30th August 1841_ (6 P.M.).\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. The\r\nannouncement has been made in both Houses of Parliament. A few words\r\nwere said by Lord Stanley[73] in the House of Commons, and nothing in\r\nthe House of Lords.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne cannot satisfy himself without again stating to your\r\nMajesty in writing what he had the honour of saying to your Majesty\r\nrespecting his Royal Highness the Prince. Lord Melbourne has formed\r\nthe highest opinion of His Royal Highness's judgment, temper, and\r\ndiscretion, and he cannot but feel a great consolation and security\r\nin the reflection that he leaves your Majesty in a situation in\r\nwhich your Majesty has the inestimable advantage of such advice and\r\nassistance. Lord Melbourne feels certain that your Majesty cannot do\r\nbetter than have recourse to it, whenever it is needed, and rely upon\r\nit with confidence.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne will be anxious to hear from your Majesty as to what\r\nhas passed with Sir R. Peel. Your Majesty will, Lord Melbourne is\r\nsure, feel that the same general secrecy which your Majesty has always\r\nobserved respecting public affairs is more particularly necessary at\r\nthe present moment.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne earnestly hopes that your Majesty is well and composed,\r\nand with the most anxious wishes for your Majesty's welfare and\r\nhappiness, remains ever your Majesty's most devoted and attached\r\nServant, and he trusts that he may add, without presumption, your\r\nMajesty's faithful and affectionate Friend.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 73: Who now became Colonial Secretary.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE HOUSEHOLD]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum: Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nYour Majesty might say, if to your Majesty it seems good, that in\r\nconsequence of the Addresses voted by both Houses of Parliament, your\r\nMajesty's servants had tendered their resignations, and that for the\r\nsame reason your Majesty had accepted those resignations. That your\r\nMajesty's present servants possessed your Majesty's confidence,\r\nand that you only parted with them in deference to the opinion of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nThat your Majesty naturally had recourse to Sir Robert Peel as\r\npossessing the confidence of the great Party which constitutes the\r\nmajority of both Houses, and that you were prepared to empower him to\r\nform an Administration.\r\n\r\nThat your Majesty did not conceive that the giving him this commission\r\nof itself empowered him to advise the removal of the officers of your\r\nMajesty's Household; that you conceive that all that the Constitution\r\nrequired was that the Sovereign's Household should support the\r\nSovereign's Ministers; but that you were prepared to place at his\r\ndisposal, and to take his advice upon all the offices of the Household\r\nat present filled by members of either House of Parliament, with\r\nthe exception of those whom your Majesty might think proper to\r\nname, _i.e._, Lord Byron[74]--and it should be understood that this\r\nexception was not to extend further than to him.\r\n\r\nIf Sir Robert Peel should wish that in case of Lord Byron's remaining\r\nit should be considered as a fresh appointment made by his advice,\r\nthis wish might properly be acceded to.\r\n\r\n_The Ladies._--If any difficulty should arise it may be asked to be\r\nstated in writing, and reserved for consideration. But it is of great\r\nimportance that Sir Robert Peel should return to London with full\r\npower to form an Administration. Such must be the final result, and\r\nthe more readily and graciously it is acquiesced in the better.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty must take care not to be driven to the wall, and to\r\nbe put into a situation in which it is necessary to Aye or No. No\r\npositive objection should be taken either to men or measures.\r\n\r\nIt must be recollected that at the time of the negotiation in 1839\r\nLord Melbourne and Lord John Russell were still at the head of a\r\nmajority in the House of Commons.

Ripon's career was a curious one;\r\n    he was a singularly ineffective Prime Minister, and indeed did\r\n    not, during the course of his Ministry (August 1827-January\r\n    1828), ever have to meet Parliament. He was disappointed\r\n    at not being invited to join the Wellington Ministry,\r\n    subsequently joined the Reform Ministry of Lord Grey, but\r\n    followed Lord Stanley, Sir James Graham, and the Duke of\r\n    Richmond out of it. In August 1841 he moved the vote of want\r\n    of confidence in the Melbourne Ministry, and became President\r\n    of the Board of Trade in Peel's Government.

The first interview with Sir Robert Peel has gone off well, and\r\nonly lasted twenty minutes; and he sends the Queen to-morrow, in\r\nwriting, the proposed arrangements, and will only come down on\r\nWednesday morning. He first wished to come to-morrow, but on the\r\nQueen's saying that he need not to do that, but might send it and only\r\ncome down Wednesday, he thought the Queen might prefer having it to\r\nconsider a little, which she said she certainly should, though she\r\nmeant no want of confidence. The Queen, in the first instance, stated\r\nthat she concluded he was prepared for her sending for him, and then\r\nstated exactly what Lord Melbourne wrote, viz., the resignation having\r\ntaken place in consequence of the Addresses--the Queen's great regret\r\nat parting with her present Ministers--the confidence she had in them,\r\nand her only acceding in consequence of the Addresses in Parliament,\r\nand then that consequently she looked to him (Sir Robert Peel) as\r\npossessing the confidence of both Houses of Parliament to form an\r\nAdministration. He made many protestations of his sorrow, at what must\r\ngive pain to the Queen (as she said to him it did), but of course said\r\nhe accepted the task. The Duke of Wellington's health too uncertain,\r\nand himself too prone to sleep coming over him--as Peel expressed\r\nit--to admit of his taking an office in which he would have much to\r\ndo, but to be in the Cabinet, which the Queen expressed her wish he\r\nshould. He named Lord De Grey[76] as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,\r\nand Lord Eliot[77] as Secretary for Ireland, who, he said, were both\r\nmoderate people. The Queen said she gave up to him the officers of\r\nState and those of her Household who were in Parliament, and he then\r\nasked if Lord Liverpool would be agreeable as Lord Steward (the Queen\r\nsaid he would), and if she would object to Lord Jersey as Master of\r\nthe Horse (she said she would not), as she believed he understood it\r\nperfectly. He said he was so anxious to do everything which could be\r\nagreeable to the Queen, that he wished her to name whom she should\r\nlike as Lord Chamberlain; she said he might suggest some one, but as\r\nhe would not, and pressed the Queen to name whoever she pleased,\r\nshe said she should like the Duke of Rutland, and he said he would\r\ncertainly name it to him. The Queen said that Lord Melbourne had\r\nalways been very particular to name no one who might be disagreeable\r\nto her in the Household, and Sir R. Peel said he felt this, and\r\nshould be most anxious to do what could be agreeable to me and for my\r\ncomfort, and that he would even sacrifice any advantage to this. The\r\nQueen mentioned the three Ladies' resignation, and her wish not to\r\nfill up the three Ladies' places immediately. She mentioned Lady\r\nByron,[78] to which he agreed immediately, and then said, as I had\r\nalluded to those communications, he hoped that he had been understood\r\nrespecting the _other_ appointments (meaning the Ladies), that\r\nprovided I chose some who had a leaning towards the politics of the\r\nAdministration, I might take any I liked, and that he quite understood\r\nthat I should notify it to them. The Queen said this was her rule, and\r\nthat she wished to choose moderate people who should not have scruples\r\nto resign in case another Administration should come in, as changing\r\nwas disagreeable to her. Here it ended, and so far well. He was\r\nvery anxious the Queen should understand _how_ anxious he was to do\r\neverything which was agreeable to the Queen. The Queen wishes to know\r\nif Lord Melbourne thinks she should name the Duchess of Buccleuch\r\nMistress of the Robes, on Wednesday, and if she shall ask Sir Robert\r\nto sound the Duchess, or some one else, and then write to appoint her?\r\nShe thinks of proposing Lady de la Warr and Lady Abercorn by and by as\r\nthe two Ladies, but these she will sound herself through other people,\r\nor Lady Canning, or Lady Rosslyn, in case these others should not take\r\nit. She should say she meant to sound those, and no more. What the\r\nQueen felt when she parted from her dear, kind friend, Lord Melbourne,\r\nis better imagined than described; she was dreadfully affected for\r\nsome time after, but is calm now. It is very, very sad; and she cannot\r\nquite believe it yet. The Prince felt it very, very much too, and\r\nreally the Queen cannot say how kind and affectionate he is to her,\r\nand how anxious to do everything to lighten this heavy trial; he was\r\nquite affected at this sad parting. We do, and shall, miss you so\r\ndreadfully; Lord Melbourne will easily understand what a change it\r\nis, after these four years when she had the happiness of having Lord\r\nMelbourne always about her. But it will not be so long till we meet\r\nagain. Happier and brighter times will come again. We anxiously hope\r\nLord Melbourne is well, and got up well and safe. The Queen trusts he\r\nwill take care of his valuable health, now more than ever.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 76: Thomas, Earl de Grey (1781-1859); he was the\r\n    elder brother of Lord Ripon, who had been previously known\r\n    as Mr Robinson and Viscount Goderich, and whose son, besides\r\n    inheriting his father's and uncle's honours, was created\r\n    Marquis of Ripon.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 77: Afterwards third Earl of St Germans.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 78: Lady Byron had been Miss Elizabeth\r\n    Chandos-Pole.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by Mr Anson._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _31st August 1841._\r\n\r\nI was sent up to Town to-day to see Lord Melbourne and Sir Robert\r\nPeel. I found Lord Melbourne as usual up in his bedroom. He had\r\nreceived the account of Her Majesty's first interview with Peel, which\r\nhe thought very satisfactory. Sir Robert very much regretted that he\r\nshould have been the instrument of obliging Her Majesty to change her\r\nGovernment. The Queen had said to Sir Robert that though she did not\r\nconceive the Minister could demand any of the Household appointments,\r\nstill it was Her Majesty's intention to give up to him the great\r\noffices of State, and all other places in the Household filled by\r\npeople in Parliament. He was to send his proposed list for offices the\r\nnext day and be at Windsor the morning after that. Lord Melbourne\r\nhad written to the Queen the night before, stating his opinion of the\r\nPrince--that he had great discretion, temper, and judgment, and that\r\nhe considered him to be well worthy of Her Majesty's confidence, and\r\nthat now was the time for Her Majesty to feel comfort and assistance\r\nfrom giving him her fullest confidence. He had just received the\r\nQueen's answer to this, saying what \"pleasure it had given the Queen\r\nto receive his letter with this expression of his opinion of her\r\nbeloved husband, and that what he said could not fail to increase\r\nthe confidence which she already felt in him. He was indeed a great\r\ncomfort to her in this trying moment; at times she was very low indeed\r\nthough she strove to bear up. It would always be a satisfaction to\r\nher to feel secure of Lord Melbourne's faithful and affectionate\r\nfriendship to her and the Prince. She hoped after a time to see him\r\nhere again, and it would always be a pleasure to her to hear from him\r\nfrequently.\"\r\n\r\nFrom South Steet I went to Sir Robert Peel's. I told him I came to\r\nspeak to him about Lord Exeter, whom the Prince proposed to make\r\nthe head of his Household, should it not interfere with any of Sir\r\nRobert's arrangements for the Queen. Sir Robert said he was so good a\r\nman and one that he felt sure the Prince would like, and he therefore\r\nthought he had better propose the situation to him at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MELBOURNE'S OFFICIAL FAREWELL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _31st August 1841._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne had the pleasure of receiving last night both your\r\nMajesty's letters, the one dated four o'clock, and written immediately\r\nafter your Majesty's interview with Sir R. Peel, the other dated\r\nhalf-past nine. Lord Melbourne thanks your Majesty much for them both,\r\nand for the expressions of kindness contained in them.

It appears to Lord Melbourne that nothing\r\ncould be better.

In the spirit\r\nin which the negotiation has been commenced I see the prospect of a\r\ntermination of it, which will be not so unsatisfactory to your\r\nMajesty as your Majesty anticipated, and not, Lord Melbourne trusts,\r\ndisadvantageous to the country....\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne concludes with the most anxious wishes for your\r\nMajesty's happiness and with expressing a great admiration of the\r\nfirmness, prudence, and good sense with which your Majesty has\r\nconducted yourself.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne begs to be remembered to His Royal Highness most\r\nrespectfully, most affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_31st August 1841._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has just\r\nreceived your Majesty's letter.

Recollect\r\nhow precious is your Majesty's health, and how much health depends\r\nupon tranquillity of mind....\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne will either write to Sir Francis Chantrey[79] to-morrow\r\nmorning, or call upon him and settle without further delay about the\r\nBust. There is no end of subscriptions to Monuments, but perhaps your\r\nMajesty will do well to subscribe to Sir David Wilkie's.[80]\r\n\r\nYour Majesty is very good about the blue Ribband, but Lord Melbourne\r\nis certain that upon the whole, it is better for his own position and\r\ncharacter that he should not have it.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 79: Sir Francis Chantrey, the sculptor, born in\r\n    1781, died on 25th November 1841.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 80: Sir David Wilkie, Painter-in-Ordinary to the\r\n    Queen, had died on 1st June, aged fifty-six.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PEEL'S RECEPTION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Clarendon[81] to Viscount Melbourne.[82]_\r\n\r\nGROSVENOR CRESCENT, _31st August 1841._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MELBOURNE,--You may like to know that Peel was perfectly\r\nsatisfied with his reception yesterday, and does full justice to the\r\nQueen's declaration of her regret at parting with her Ministers, which\r\nhe said it was quite natural she should feel, and quite right she\r\nshould express.

Viscount Palmerston begs to be allowed to tender to your Majesty\r\nthe grateful thanks of himself and of Viscountess Palmerston for your\r\nMajesty's gracious expressions towards them. Viscount Palmerston sees\r\nwith deep regret the termination of those duties in your Majesty's\r\nservice, in the course of which he has had the honour of experiencing\r\nfrom your Majesty so much condescending personal kindness, and\r\nsuch flattering official confidence; and it affords him the highest\r\ngratification to have obtained your Majesty's approbation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _2nd September 1841._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. He received\r\nyour Majesty's letter yesterday evening, and was very glad to learn\r\nfrom it that your Majesty was not ill satisfied with Sir Robert Peel,\r\nand that the arrangements were going on smoothly, which it is highly\r\ndesirable that they should. Your Majesty should desire Sir Robert\r\nPeel to give notice to all those who have insignia of office, such\r\nas Seals, Wands, to give up, to attend at Claremont on Friday; but of\r\ncourse he will do this of himself. Your Majesty will have much to go\r\nthrough upon that day and much that is painful. Your Majesty should\r\nspare yourself and be spared as much as possible. It will not be\r\nnecessary for Lord Melbourne to go down. He may be considered as\r\nhaving resigned at the Audience which he had of your Majesty at\r\nWindsor, and Lord Melbourne has ventured to tell Lord Lansdowne that\r\nhe thinks he need not do so either, and that your Majesty will excuse\r\nhis attendance. Lord Melbourne need say nothing about the Secretaries\r\nof State, with all of whom your Majesty is so well acquainted; but\r\nperhaps your Majesty will not omit to thank Mr Baring[83] cordially\r\nfor his services. He is a thoroughly honest man and an able public\r\nservant. If your Majesty could say to the Lord Chancellor,[84] \"that\r\nyou part with him with much sorrow; that you are sensible that much of\r\nthe strength of the late Administration was derived from the manner\r\nin which he discharged the duties of his office, and that you consider\r\nhis retirement a great and serious loss to the country,\" it would\r\ncertainly be no more than he deserves.\r\n\r\nIt is thought by some who know him here that the Duke of Rutland will\r\nbe so extremely pleased with the offer being made, and that by your\r\nMajesty yourself, that he will accept it; but he is a year older than\r\nLord Melbourne, and therefore hardly fit for any very active duty....\r\n\r\nThe appointment of Colonel Arbuthnot will of course be very agreeable\r\nto the Duke of Wellington. The Arbuthnots are quiet, demure people\r\nbefore others; but they are not without depth of purpose, and they are\r\nvery bitter at bottom.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty will not forget the two Knights for Mr de la Beche[85]\r\nand Major Monro.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne begins to hope that this affair will be got through\r\nmore satisfactorily and with less annoyance than your Majesty\r\nanticipated. As long as your Majesty is desirous of receiving his\r\ncommunications, he will be always most careful to give your Majesty\r\nhis impartial opinion and the best advice which he has to offer. His\r\nmost fervent prayer will always be for your Majesty's welfare and\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 83: The retiring Chancellor of the Exchequer.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 84: Lord Cottenham.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 85: Sir Henry T. de la Beche, an eminent geologist.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MELBOURNE'S LAST OFFICIAL LETTER]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _2nd September 1841._\r\n\r\n....Lord Melbourne hopes and trusts that when to-morrow is over your\r\nMajesty will recover from that depression of spirits under which your\r\nMajesty now labours. Lord Melbourne never doubted that it would be\r\nso, but is glad to learn from your Majesty the support and consolation\r\nwhich your Majesty finds in the advice and affection of the Prince.\r\n\r\nThis is the last letter which Lord Melbourne will send in a box. He\r\nwill to-morrow morning return his keys to the Foreign Office, and\r\nafter that your Majesty will be good enough to send the letters, with\r\nwhich you may honour Lord Melbourne, through Mr Anson.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne most anxiously wishes your Majesty every blessing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: COUNCIL AT CLAREMONT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _3rd September 1841._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne earnestly hopes that your Majesty is well after this\r\ntrying day.[86] Lord Melbourne has thought and felt for your Majesty\r\nall this morning.

In the concerns of a\r\ngreat nation like this there will always be some difficulties and\r\nentanglements, but upon the whole the present state is good and the\r\nprospect is good for the future. There is no reason to expect that\r\nSir Robert Peel will either be desirous or be able to take a very\r\ndifferent course from that which has been taken by your Majesty's late\r\nservants, and some difficulties will certainly be removed, and some\r\nobstacles smoothed, by the change which has lately taken place.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the effect which will be produced upon the comfort of\r\nyour Majesty's private life, it would be idle in Lord Melbourne,\r\nafter what your Majesty has said, to doubt of the manner in which your\r\nMajesty will feel the change, which must take place in your Majesty,\r\nto long accustomed habits and relations. But your Majesty may rest\r\nassured of Lord Melbourne's devoted and disinterested attachment\r\nto your Majesty, and that he will devote himself to giving to your\r\nMajesty such information and advice as may be serviceable to your\r\nMajesty with the sole view of promoting your Majesty's public\r\ninterests and private happiness.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne hopes, and indeed ventures to expect, that your\r\nMajesty, upon reflection and consideration of the real state of\r\ncircumstances, will recover your spirits, and Lord Melbourne has\r\nhimself great satisfaction in thinking upon the consideration of\r\nthe advice which he has given, that it has not tended to impair your\r\nMajesty's influence and authority, but, on the contrary, to secure to\r\nyour Majesty the affection, attachment, approbation, and support of\r\nall parties.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this correspondence Lord Melbourne has thought it his\r\nduty to your Majesty to express himself with great freedom upon\r\nthe characters of many individuals, whose names have come under\r\nconsideration, but Lord Melbourne thinks it right to say that he may\r\nhave spoken upon insufficient grounds, that he may have been mistaken,\r\nand that the persons in question may turn out to be far better than he\r\nhas been induced to represent them.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 86: A Council had been held at Claremont for the\r\n    outgoing Ministers to give up their Seals of Office, which\r\n    were bestowed upon Sir Robert Peel and the incoming Cabinet.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MELBOURNE ON THE NEW MINISTRY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _4th September 1841._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. He was most\r\nhappy to hear yesterday the best account of everything that had taken\r\nplace at Claremont. Everybody praised, in the highest manner, the\r\ndignity, propriety, and kindness of your Majesty's deportment, and if\r\nit can be done without anything of deceit or dissimulation, it is well\r\nto take advantage of the powers and qualities which have been given,\r\nand which are so well calculated to gain a fair and powerful influence\r\nover the minds and feelings of others. Your Majesty may depend upon\r\nit, that the impression made upon the minds of all who were present\r\nyesterday, is most favourable. Of course, with persons in new and\r\nrather awkward situations, some of whom had never been in high office\r\nbefore, all of whom had not been so now for some years, there was a\r\ngood deal of embarrassment and mistakes. Forms which are only gone\r\nthrough at long intervals of time, and not every day, are necessarily\r\nforgotten, and when they are required nobody knows them. But Lord\r\nMelbourne cannot really think that they looked cross; most probably\r\nthey did look shy and embarrassed. Strange faces are apt to give the\r\nidea of ill humour....\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne anxiously hopes that your Majesty is well and happy\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _5th September 1841._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. Your Majesty\r\nmay depend upon it, that if Lord Melbourne hears anything respecting\r\nyour Majesty, which it appears to him to be important or advantageous,\r\nthat your Majesty should know, Lord Melbourne will not fail to convey\r\nit to your Majesty.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne encloses the exact names of the two gentlemen to whom\r\nKnighthood has been promised by your Majesty....\r\n\r\nYour Majesty is very good, very good indeed, to think of doing what\r\nyour Majesty mentions for Fanny; but Lord Melbourne fears that it\r\nwould hardly suit with their present situation, or with the comfort of\r\ntheir domestic life. But Lord Melbourne mentioned the matter yesterday\r\nto his sister, and he encloses the letter which she has written to him\r\nthis morning, after reflecting upon the subject. By that letter your\r\nMajesty will perceive that Jocelyn is not so much in debt, as Lord\r\nMelbourne's letter had led your Majesty to suppose....\r\n\r\nLord B---- is a very old friend of Lord Melbourne's. They were at Eton\r\ntogether, and intimate there. He is a gentlemanly man and a good man,\r\nbut not very agreeable. Few of the P----s are, and very bitter in\r\npolitics; but still Lord Melbourne is glad, for old acquaintance'\r\nsake, that your Majesty has taken him. Lord Melbourne must again\r\nrepeat that when he writes with so much freedom about individual\r\ncharacters, it is only to put your Majesty in possession of what he\r\nknows respecting them, and not with a view of inducing your Majesty to\r\nobject to their being appointed....\r\n\r\nMight not Fanny have the Bedchamber Woman's place? It would be a help\r\nto her, and would not take her away from home. This only strikes Lord\r\nMelbourne as he is writing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MELBOURNE ON PEEL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_6th September 1841._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne wrote the above yesterday, but had no opportunity of\r\nsending it, as there was no post. Lord Melbourne has since seen Lady\r\nPalmerston, and finds that his last suggestion about Fanny will not\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne encloses Lady Palmerston's two notes upon the subject,\r\nwhich will explain to your Majesty what she wishes. But if Jocelyn is\r\nhimself to get a place, this will be a better arrangement, and puts an\r\nend to all the others.\r\n\r\nWhat Lady Palmerston says about Sir R. Peel is very unjust. There\r\nis no shabbiness whatever in his not coming to a decision upon the\r\nfactory question.[87]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 87: Lady Palmerston (no doubt in sympathy with Lord\r\n    Ashley) expected some factory legislation to be announced.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Countess of Gainsborough._[88]\r\n\r\nCLAREMONT, _6th September 1841._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST LADY GAINSBOROUGH,--I had the pleasure of receiving your\r\ntwo kind letters of the 24th and 25th ult. yesterday, and thank you\r\nmuch for them. I am so happy that you are _really_ better....\r\n\r\nI hoped that you would be pleased at what you thank me for; you see\r\nI _did not_ forget what you told me once at Windsor when we were\r\nout driving, and I assure you that Lord Melbourne was very anxious\r\nto do it. Last week was a most painful, trying one to me, and this\r\nseparation from my truly excellent and kind friend Lord Melbourne,\r\n_most_ distressing. You will understand _what_ a change it must be to\r\nme. I am, however, so happy in my home, and have such a perfect angel\r\nin the Prince, who has been such a comfort to me, that one must be\r\nthankful and grateful for these blessings, and take these hard trials\r\nas lessons sent from above, for our best.\r\n\r\nOur little girl makes great progress, and suffers comparatively but\r\nvery little from her teething. We came here to be _quiet_ for a few\r\ndays, as this place is so very private.\r\n\r\nThe Baroness will write to Lord Gainsborough to say that I wish much\r\nyou would take Lady Lyttelton's waiting, which begins on 23rd of\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\nThe Prince begs to be kindly named to you, and I to Fanny and your\r\nbrother, and pray believe me always, dearest Lady Gainsborough, ever\r\nyours most affectionately,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\nPray thank Fanny for her kind letter.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 88: Formerly, as Lady Barham, a Lady of the\r\n    Bedchamber.

Sir Robert Peel may also tell Lord De la Warr that\r\nit is unnecessary for him to appear in uniform, as the Queen\r\nalways dispenses with this in the country. This applies also to the\r\nMinisters, who the Queen does not expect or wish should appear in\r\nuniform at Councils which are held in the country. The Queen concludes\r\nthat it will be necessary to hold a Council some time next week to\r\nswear in some of the new Officers who are not Privy Councillors; but\r\nSir Robert Peel will be able to tell the Queen when he thinks this\r\nwill be necessary.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 89: See _ante_, p 156.(Ch.

The Queen believes that\r\nhis political views are not violent either way, and she knows that he\r\nis peculiarly agreeable to her Uncle, which has, therefore, prompted\r\nher to write this to Sir Robert Peel. The Queen seizes the same\r\nopportunity to say that she is also very anxious that a moderate\r\nand conciliatory person should be sent to Lisbon, as it is of great\r\nimportance there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nCLAREMONT, _8th September 1841._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I begin my letter to-day, for fear I should have no\r\ntime to write to-morrow. Your kind letter gave me great pleasure, and\r\nI must own your silence on all that was going on distressed me very\r\nmuch! It has been indeed a sad time for me, and I am still bewildered,\r\nand can't believe that my excellent Lord Melbourne is no longer\r\nmy Minister, but he will be, as you say, and has _already_ proved\r\nhimself, _very_ useful and _valuable_ as my friend out of office.\r\nHe writes to me often, and I write to him, and he gives really the\r\nfairest and most impartial advice possible. But after seeing him for\r\nfour years, with very few exceptions--_daily_--you may imagine that I\r\n_must_ feel the change; and the longer the time gets since we parted,\r\nthe _more_ I feel it. _Eleven days_ was the _longest_ I ever was\r\nwithout seeing him, and this time will be elapsed on Saturday, so you\r\nmay imagine what the change must be. I cannot say what a comfort and\r\nsupport my beloved Angel is to me, and how well and how kindly\r\nand properly he behaves. I cannot resist copying for you what Lord\r\nMelbourne wrote to me about Albert, the evening after we parted; he\r\nhas already praised him greatly to me, before he took leave of me. It\r\nis as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Lord Melbourne cannot satisfy himself without again stating to your\r\nMajesty in writing what he had the honour of saying to your Majesty\r\nrespecting H.R.H. the Prince. Lord Melbourne has formed the highest\r\nopinion of H.R.H.'s judgment, temper, and discretion, and he cannot\r\nbut feel a great consolation and security in the reflection that\r\nhe leaves your Majesty in a situation in which your Majesty has the\r\ninestimable advantage of such advice and assistance. Lord Melbourne\r\nfeels certain that your Majesty cannot do better than have recourse to\r\nit, whenever it is needed, and rely upon it with confidence.\"\r\n\r\nThis naturally gave me great pleasure, and made me very proud, as it\r\ncomes from a person who is no flatterer, and would not have said it if\r\nhe did not think so, or feel so. The new Cabinet you have by this time\r\nseen in the papers.\r\n\r\nThe Household (of which I send you a list) is well constituted--_for\r\nTories_.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen has written to me to say Bourqueney has announced Ste\r\nAulaire[90] as Ambassador. This is very well, but let me beg you, for\r\ndecency's sake, to stop his coming immediately; if _even not meant_\r\nto, it would have the effect of their sending an ambassador the moment\r\nthe Government changed, which would be too marked, and most _offensive\r\npersonally_ to _me_. Indeed Guizot behaved very badly about refusing\r\nto sign the Slave Trade Treaty[91] which they had so long ago settled\r\nto do; it is unwise and foolish to irritate the late Government who\r\nmay so easily come in again; for Palmerston will _not_ forgive nor\r\n_forget_ offences, and then France would be worse off than before,\r\nwith England. I therefore _beg_ you to stop Ste Aulaire for a little\r\nwhile, else _I_ shall feel it a great personal offence.\r\n\r\n_9th._--I have had a letter from Lord Melbourne to-day, who is much\r\ngratified by yours to him.... Now adieu! Believe me, always, your\r\ndevoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 90: See _post_, p. 334. (Ch.

I cannot any longer now refrain to enquire\r\nafter you, after all you have gone through lately, and I must\r\ncongratulate you with all my heart on having so well completed your\r\ndifficult task.\r\n\r\nThere is but one voice of praise, I hear, of your perfect composure\r\nand beautiful conduct during the trying scenes of last week. It has\r\ngratified me more than I can express, for I had fully expected it of\r\nyou, and it has made me very happy to find that it has been generally\r\nremarked and has given so much satisfaction. Everybody feels deeply\r\nfor you, and the devotion and zeal in your service is redoubled by\r\nthe interest your trying position has evoked. May our Heavenly Father\r\nsupport and guide you always as hitherto, is my constant prayer!\r\n\r\nI hope that the selection of your Government is to your own\r\nsatisfaction, and though the change must have been trying to you, I\r\ntrust that you will have perfect confidence in the able men who form\r\nyour Council. Our beloved late King's anxious wishes to see Wellington\r\nand Peel again at the head of the Administration is now fulfilled. His\r\nblessing rests upon you.\r\n\r\nExcuse my having touched upon this subject, but I could not keep\r\nsilent whilst the heart is so full of earnest good wishes for your and\r\nthe country's prosperity.\r\n\r\nI hope that an article of the newspapers, of the indisposition of your\r\ndarling child, is not true, and that she is quite well. God bless and\r\nprotect her!...\r\n\r\nI am much amused with reading your Life by Miss Strickland,[92] which,\r\nthough full of errors, is earnest on the whole, and very interesting\r\nto _me_. However, I wish she would correct the gross errors which\r\notherwise will go down to posterity. She ought to have taken first\r\nbetter information before she published her work....\r\n\r\nWith my affectionate love to dear Prince Albert, believe me ever, my\r\ndearest Niece, your most devoted and affectionate Aunt,\r\n\r\nADELAIDE.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 92: Miss Agnes Strickland (1808-1874), who also\r\n    edited _Letters of Mary Queen of Scots_, etc.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by Mr Anson._\r\n\r\nCLAREMONT, _9th September 1841._\r\n\r\nThe Ministerial arrangements are now nearly completed.

Told him also of its being the\r\nQueen's wish that a short report of the debates in each House should\r\nalways be sent to Her Majesty, from him in the Commons and from the\r\nDuke of Wellington in the Lords.\r\n\r\nThe Queen had a letter to-day from the Queen Dowager, which was kindly\r\nmeant, but which made Her Majesty rather angry, complimenting Her\r\nMajesty on the good grace with which she had changed her Government,\r\nand saying that the late King's blessing rested upon her for calling\r\nthe Duke of Wellington and Peel to her Councils, etc....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN CRITICISES APPOINTMENTS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Sir Robert Peel._\r\n\r\n_9th September 1841._\r\n\r\nThe Queen takes this opportunity of writing to Sir Robert Peel\r\n_confidentially_ about another person: this is about Lord ----. The\r\nQueen is strongly of opinion that Lord ---- should _not_ be employed\r\nin any post of importance, as his being so would, in her opinion,\r\nbe detrimental to the interests of the country. The Queen wishes Sir\r\nRobert to state this to Lord Aberdeen as her opinion. The Queen is\r\ncertain that Sir Robert will take care that it should not be known\r\ngenerally that this is her opinion, for she is always most anxious to\r\navoid anything that might appear personal towards anybody. The Queen\r\ncannot refrain from saying that she cannot quite approve of Sir\r\nCharles Bagot's appointment,[93] as from what she has heard of his\r\nqualities she does not think that they are of a character quite to\r\nsuit in the arduous and difficult position in which he will be placed.\r\nAt the same time the Queen does not mean to object to his appointment\r\n(for she has already formally approved of it), but she feels it her\r\nduty to state frankly and at all times her opinion, as she begs Sir\r\nRobert also to do unreservedly to her. For the future, it appears to\r\nthe Queen that it would be best in all appointments of such importance\r\nthat before a direct communication was entered into with the\r\nindividual intended to be proposed, that the Queen should be informed\r\nof it, so that she might talk to her Ministers fully about it; not\r\nbecause it is likely that she would object to the appointment, but\r\nmerely that she might have time to be acquainted with the qualities\r\nand abilities of the person. The Queen has stated this thus freely to\r\nSir Robert as she feels certain that he will understand and appreciate\r\nthe motives which prompt her to do so. The Queen would wish the\r\nCouncil to be at two on Tuesday, and she begs Sir Robert would inform\r\nher which of the Ministers besides him will attend.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 93: As Governor-General of Canada.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir Robert Peel to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_9th September 1841._\r\n\r\n...

I did\r\nnot think Her Majesty would wish to be informed of the issue of writs,\r\nnecessarily following the appointments to certain offices, of all\r\nwhich Her Majesty had approved. I certainly ought to have written\r\nto Her Majesty previously to the adjournment of the House of Commons\r\nuntil Thursday the _16th of September_. It was an inadvertent omission\r\non my part, amid the mass of business which I have had to transact,\r\nand I have little doubt that if I had been in Parliament I should have\r\navoided it.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of my having vacated my seat, and of having\r\nthus been compelled to leave to others the duty of proposing the\r\nadjournment of the House, was one cause of my inadvertence.\r\n\r\nBoth the Duke of Wellington and I fully intended to make a report to\r\nHer Majesty after the close of the Parliamentary business of each day,\r\nand will do so without fail on the reassembling of Parliament.\r\n\r\nI am, my dear Sir, very faithfully yours,\r\n\r\nROBERT PEEL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DIPLOMATIC APPOINTMENTS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _10th September 1841._\r\n\r\n... Lord Melbourne has no doubt that Sir Robert Peel has the most\r\nanxious wish to do everything that can be agreeable to your Majesty.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty should not omit to speak fully and seriously to him upon\r\nthe disposal of great appointments. Their Diplomatic Corps, from which\r\nAmbassadors and Governors are generally taken, is the weakest part of\r\ntheir establishment. They have amongst them men of moderate abilities\r\nand of doubtful integrity, who yet have held high offices and\r\nhave strong claims upon them. The public service may suffer most\r\nessentially by the employment of such men. Lord Melbourne would say\r\nto Peel that \"affairs depend more upon the hands to which they are\r\nentrusted than upon any other cause, and that you hope he will well\r\nconsider those whose appointment to high and important situations\r\nhe sanctions, and that he will not suffer claims of connection or of\r\nsupport to overbalance a due regard for your Majesty's service and the\r\nwelfare of the country.\" Such an expression of your Majesty's opinion\r\nmay possibly be a support to Sir Robert Peel against pretensions which\r\nhe would be otherwise unable to resist; but this is entirely submitted\r\nto your Majesty's judgment, seeing that your Majesty, from an exact\r\nknowledge of all that is passing, must be able to form a much more\r\ncorrect opinion of the propriety and discretion of any step than Lord\r\nMelbourne can do....\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne has a letter from Lord John Russell, rather eager for\r\nactive opposition; but Lord Melbourne will write to your Majesty more\r\nfully upon these subjects from Woburn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: CANADA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWOBURN ABBEY, _12th September 1841._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne has this morning received your Majesty's letter of\r\nyesterday. Lord Melbourne entirely agrees with your Majesty about\r\nappointments. He knows, as your Majesty does from experience,\r\nthat with all the claims which there are to satisfy, with all the\r\nprejudices which are to be encountered, and with all the interests\r\nwhich require to be reconciled, it is impossible to select the best\r\nmen, or even always those properly qualified. He is the last man who\r\nwould wish that a Minister who has the whole machine of the Government\r\nbefore him should be necessarily thwarted or interfered with in the\r\nselection of those whom he may be desirous to employ. Lord Melbourne\r\nwould therefore by no means advise your Majesty to throw difficulty in\r\nthe way of the diplomatic arrangements which may be proposed, unless\r\nthere should be in them anything manifestly and glaringly bad. The\r\nnomination of Lord ---- would have been so, but otherwise it cannot\r\nvery greatly signify who is the Ambassador at Vienna, or even at\r\nPetersburg or Paris. Stuart de Rothesay[94] and Strangford[95] are not\r\ngood men, either of them, but it will be difficult for Lord Aberdeen\r\nto neglect their claims altogether. Heytesbury[96] is an able man, the\r\nbest they have. Sir Robert Gordon[97] is an honest man, slow but not\r\nilliberal. It would be well if your Majesty showed Lord Aberdeen that\r\nyou know these men, and have an opinion upon the subject of them.\r\n\r\nCanada is another matter. It is a most difficult and most hazardous\r\ntask. There has been recent rebellion in the country. A new\r\nConstitution has lately been imposed upon it by Parliament. The two\r\nProvinces have been united, and the united Province is bordered by a\r\nmost hostile and uncontrollable community, the United States of North\r\nAmerica. To govern such a country at such a moment requires a man of\r\ngreat abilities, a man experienced and practical in the management\r\nof popular assemblies.... It is possible that matters may go smoothly\r\nthere, and that if difficulties do arise Sir C. Bagot may prove more\r\nequal to them than from his general knowledge of his character Lord\r\nMelbourne would judge him to be....\r\n\r\nUpon the subject of diplomatic appointments Lord Melbourne has\r\nforgotten to make one general observation which he thinks of\r\nimportance. Upon a change of Government a very great and sudden change\r\nof all or many of the Ministers at Foreign Courts is an evil and to be\r\navoided, inasmuch as it induces an idea of a general change of policy,\r\nand disturbs everything that has been settled. George III. always set\r\nhis face against and discouraged such numerous removals as tending to\r\nshake confidence abroad in the Government of England generally and to\r\ngive it a character of uncertainty and instability. It would be well\r\nif your Majesty could make this remark to Lord Aberdeen.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 94: The new Ambassador to St Petersburg.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 95: Percy, sixth Viscount Strangford (1780-1855),\r\n    formerly Ambassador to Constantinople, whom Byron described as\r\n\r\n      \"Hibernian Strangford, with thine eyes of blue,\r\n      And boasted locks of red or auburn hue.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 96: See _post_, p. 329.

The\r\nmail for India, which should have been despatched on the 1st, had been\r\ndetained till Monday the 6th by the direction of your Majesty's late\r\nMinisters, in order to enable your Majesty's present servants to\r\ntransmit to India and China any orders which it might seem to them\r\nto be expedient to issue forthwith. Further delay would have been\r\nproductive of much mercantile inconvenience, and in India probably of\r\nmuch alarm. In this emergency your Majesty's Ministers thought\r\nthat your Majesty would be graciously pleased to approve of their\r\nexercising at once the power of directing the immediate transmission\r\nto India of these Instructions.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty must have had frequently before you strong proofs of\r\nthe deep interest taken by Russia in the affairs of Herat, and your\r\nMajesty cannot but be sensible of the difficulty of maintaining in\r\nEurope that good understanding with Russia which has such an important\r\nbearing upon the general peace, if serious differences should exist\r\nbetween your Majesty and that Power with respect to the States of\r\nCentral Asia.\r\n\r\nBut even if the annexation of Herat to the kingdom of Cabul were\r\nnot to have the effect of endangering the continuance of the good\r\nunderstanding between your Majesty and Russia, still your Majesty will\r\nnot have failed to observe that the further advance of your Majesty's\r\nforces 360 miles into the interior of Central Asia for the purpose\r\nof effecting that annexation, could not but render more difficult\r\nof accomplishment the original intention of your Majesty, publicly\r\nannounced to the world, of withdrawing your Majesty's troops from\r\nAfghanistan as soon as Shah Sooja should be firmly established upon\r\nthe throne he owes to your Majesty's aid.\r\n\r\nThese considerations alone would have led Lord Ellenborough to desire\r\nthat the execution of the orders given on the 4th of June should at\r\nleast be delayed until your Majesty's confidential servants had had\r\ntime to consider maturely the Policy which it might be their duty to\r\nadvise your Majesty to sanction with respect to the countries on the\r\nright bank of the Indus; but financial considerations strengthened\r\nthis desire, and seemed to render it an imperative duty to endeavour\r\nto obtain time for mature reflection before any step should be taken\r\nwhich might seriously affect the tranquillity of Europe, and must\r\nnecessarily have disastrous effects upon the Administration of India.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that the political and military charges now incurred\r\nbeyond the Indus amounted to £1,250,000 a year--that the estimate of\r\nthe expense of the additions made to the Army in India, since April\r\n1838, was £1,138,750 a year, and that the deficit of Indian Revenue\r\nin 1839-40 having been £2,425,625, a further deficit of £1,987,000 was\r\nexpected in 1840-41.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty must be too well informed of the many evils consequent\r\nupon financial embarrassment, and entertains too deep a natural\r\naffection for all your Majesty's subjects, not to desire that in\r\nwhatever advice your Majesty's confidential servants may tender to\r\nyour Majesty with respect to the Policy to be observed in Afghanistan,\r\nthey should have especial regard to the effect which the protracted\r\ncontinuance of military operations in that country, still more any\r\nextension of them to a new and distant field, would have upon the\r\nFinances of India, and thereby upon the welfare of eighty millions of\r\npeople who there acknowledge your Majesty's rule.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 98: President of the Board of Control.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 99: For the progress of affairs in Afghanistan,\r\n    _see_ Introductory Notes for 1839-1842.\r\n      (to Ch.

It seems to the Queen that the course intended\r\nto be pursued--namely to take time to consider the affairs of India\r\nwithout making any precipitate change in the Policy hitherto pursued,\r\nand without involving the country hastily in expenses, is far the best\r\nand safest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DIPLOMATIC APPOINTMENTS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Aberdeen._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _19th September 1841._\r\n\r\nIn the conversation that the Queen had with Lord Aberdeen last week,\r\nshe omitted mentioning two persons to him. The one is Lord Heytesbury;\r\nthe Queen believes him to be a very able man, and would it not\r\ntherefore be a good thing to employ him in some important mission? The\r\nother person is Mr Aston, who is at Madrid; the Queen hopes it may be\r\npossible to leave him there, for she thinks that he acted with great\r\ndiscretion, prudence, and moderation since he has been there, and the\r\npost is one of considerable importance. He was, the Queen believes,\r\nlong Secretary to the Legation at Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Aberdeen to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nFOREIGN OFFICE, _21st September 1841._\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen presents his most humble duty to your Majesty....\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen has seen the favourable opinion which your Majesty has\r\nbeen graciously pleased to express of Lord Heytesbury, and he humbly\r\npresumes to think that this honour is not unmerited. The situation\r\nof Governor-General of India has recently been proposed by Sir Robert\r\nPeel for Lord Heytesbury's acceptance, which has been declined by him,\r\nand it is understood that Lord Heytesbury is not at present desirous\r\nof public employment.[100]\r\n\r\nYour Majesty's servants have not yet fully considered the propriety\r\nof submitting to your Majesty any proposal of a change in the Spanish\r\nMission; but the opinion which your Majesty has been pleased to\r\nsignify respecting the conduct of Mr Aston at Madrid appears, in\r\nthe humble judgment of Lord Aberdeen, to be fully confirmed by the\r\ncorrespondence in this Office.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen would, however, venture humbly to mention that the\r\nperson filling this Mission has usually been replaced on a change of\r\nthe Administration at home. Should this be the case in the present\r\ninstance, Lord Aberdeen begs to assure your Majesty that the greatest\r\ncare will be taken to select an individual for your Majesty's\r\napprobation who may be qualified to carry into effect the wise, just,\r\nand moderate policy which your Majesty has been graciously pleased to\r\nrecognise in the conduct of Mr Aston.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 100: He was made Governor and Captain of the Isle of\r\n    Wight, and Governor of Carisbrooke Castle.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MELBOURNE AND PEEL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by Mr Anson._\r\n\r\nROYAL LODGE, _21st September 1841._\r\n\r\nSaw Baron Stockmar this morning at the Castle, and had a good deal of\r\nconversation with him on various matters. He is very apprehensive that\r\nevil will spring out of the correspondence now carried on between the\r\nQueen and Lord Melbourne. He thinks it is productive of the greatest\r\npossible danger, and especially to Lord Melbourne; he thought no\r\nGovernment could stand such undermining influence. I might tell this\r\nto Lord Melbourne, and say that if he was totally disconnected from\r\nhis Party, instead of being the acknowledged head, there would not\r\nbe the same objection. He said, Remind Lord Melbourne of the time\r\nimmediately after the Queen's accession, when he had promised the King\r\nof the Belgians to write to him from time to time an account of all\r\nthat was going on in this country; and upon Lord Melbourne telling\r\nhim of this promise, he replied, This will not do. It cannot be kept a\r\nsecret that you keep up this correspondence, and jealousy and distrust\r\nwill be the fruit of a knowledge of it. \"Leave it to me,\" he said, \"to\r\narrange with the King; you cease to write, and I will put it straight\r\nwith the King.\"\r\n\r\nThe Baron seemed to expect Lord Melbourne to draw the inference from\r\nthis that a correspondence between Lord Melbourne and the Queen was\r\nfraught with the same danger, and would, when known, be followed\r\nby distrust and jealousy on the part of Sir Robert Peel. I said I\r\nreconciled it to myself because I felt that it had been productive of\r\nmuch good and no harm--and that, feeling that it was conducted on\r\nsuch honourable terms, I should not, if it were necessary, scruple to\r\nacquaint Sir Robert Peel of its existence. The Baron said, \"Ask Lord\r\nMelbourne whether he would object to it.\" He said Peel, when he heard\r\nit, would not, on the first impression, at all approve of it; but\r\nprudence and caution would be immediately summoned to his aid, and he\r\nwould see that it was his policy to play the generous part--and would\r\nsay he felt all was honourably intended, and he had no objection to\r\noffer--\"but,\" said the Baron, \"look to the result. Distrust, being\r\nimplanted from the first, whenever the first misunderstanding arose,\r\nor things took a wrong turn, all would, in Peel's mind, be immediately\r\nattributed to this cause.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _24th September 1841._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I have already thanked you for your two kind\r\nletters, but I did not wish to answer them but by a Messenger. I feel\r\nthankful for your praise of my conduct; all is going on well, but it\r\nwould be needless to attempt to deny that I _feel_ the _change_, and\r\nI own I am much happier when I need _not_ see the Ministers; luckily\r\nthey do not want to see me often. I feel much the King's kindness\r\nabout Ste Aulaire;[101] I shall see him here on Tuesday next.\r\n\r\nI return you our excellent friend Melbourne's letter, which I had\r\nalready seen, as he sent it me to read, and then seal and send. I miss\r\nhim much, but I often hear from him, which is a great pleasure to me.\r\nIt is a great satisfaction to us to have Stockmar here; he is a great\r\nresource, and is now in excellent spirits.\r\n\r\nMamma is, I suppose, with you now, and we may expect her here either\r\nnext Thursday or Friday. How much she will have to tell us! I am very\r\ngrateful for what you say of Claremont, which could so easily be\r\nmade perfect; and I must say we enjoy ourselves there always\r\n_particulièrement_....

The diplomatic appointments are as well as they could be made.\r\nAt least Lord Melbourne thinks so--at least as much in consequence\r\nof those whom they exclude, as of those whom they admit. The Duke of\r\nBeaufort will do better for Petersburg than for Vienna. He is hardly\r\nequal to the place, which requires a clever man, it being more\r\ndifficult to get information there, and to find out what is going on,\r\nthan in any other country in Europe.... But Lord Melbourne does not\r\nmuch regard this, and the Duke of Beaufort possesses one advantage,\r\nwhich is of the greatest importance in that country. He is a soldier,\r\nwas the Duke of Wellington's Aide-de-Camp, and served during much of\r\nthe Peninsular War. He will therefore be able to accompany the Emperor\r\nto reviews, and to talk with him about troops and man[oe]uvres. Sir\r\nRobert Gordon and Sir S. Canning will do very well.[102]\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is very glad to hear that your Majesty was pleased and\r\nimpressed with Archdeacon Wilberforce's[103] sermon and his manner of\r\ndelivering it. Lord Melbourne has never seen nor heard him. His father\r\nhad as beautiful and touching a voice as ever was heard. It was very\r\nfine in itself. He spoiled it a little by giving it a methodistical\r\nand precatory intonation.\r\n\r\nHayter has been to Lord Melbourne to-day to press him to sit to him,\r\nwhich he will do as soon as he has done with Chantrey. Chantrey says\r\nthat all Lord Melbourne's face is very easy except the mouth. The\r\nmouth, he says, is always the most difficult feature, and he can\r\nrarely satisfy himself with the delineation of any mouth, but Lord\r\nMelbourne's is so flexible and changeable that it is almost impossible\r\nto catch it.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 102: For Vienna and Constantinople.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 103: Samuel, son of William Wilberforce, at this\r\n    date Archdeacon of Surrey, and chaplain to Prince Albert;\r\n    afterwards, in 1844, appointed Bishop of Oxford, and\r\n    eventually translated to the See of Winchester.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MELBOURNE'S ADVICE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _1st October 1841._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. He received\r\nyour Majesty's letter yesterday evening, and cannot express to your\r\nMajesty how much obliged he feels by your Majesty's taking the trouble\r\nto give him so much information upon so many points. Ste Aulaire's\r\nhair-powder seems to make a very deep and general impression.[104]\r\nEverybody talks about it. \"He appears to be very amiable and\r\nagreeable,\" everybody says, but then adds, \"I never saw a man wear so\r\nmuch powder.\" A head so whitened with flour is quite a novelty and a\r\nprodigy in these times. Lord Melbourne has not yet seen him, but means\r\nto call upon him immediately. Lord Melbourne is upon the whole\r\nglad that the Duke of Beaufort has declined St Petersburg. It is an\r\nappointment that might have been acquiesced in, but would not have\r\nbeen approved. Bulwer[105] will not be a bad choice to accompany Sir\r\nCharles[106] to Canada. Your Majesty knows Bulwer well. He is clever,\r\nkeen, active; somewhat bitter and caustic, and rather suspicious. A\r\nman of a more straightforward character would have done better, but\r\nit would be easy to have found many who would have done worse. Lord\r\nMelbourne is very glad that it has been offered to the Prince to be at\r\nthe head of this Commission, and that His Royal Highness has accepted\r\nit. It is an easy, unexceptionable manner of seeing and becoming\r\nacquainted with a great many people, and of observing the mode of\r\ntransacting business in this country. The Commission itself will be\r\na scene of very considerable difference of opinion. Lord Melbourne\r\nis for decorating the interior of the Houses of Parliament, if it be\r\nright to do so, but he is not for doing it, whether right or wrong,\r\nfor the purpose of spending the public money in the encouragement of\r\nthe Fine Arts. Whether it is to be painting or sculpture, or both; if\r\npainting, what sort of painting, what are to be the subjects chosen,\r\nand who are to be the artists employed? All these questions furnish\r\nample food for discussion, difference, and dispute. Chantrey says\r\nfresco will never do; it stands ill in every climate, will never stand\r\nlong in this, even in the interior of a building, and in a public work\r\nsuch as this is, durability is the first object to be aimed at. He\r\nsays that there is in the Vatican a compartment of which the middle\r\nportion has been painted by Giulio Romano[107] in fresco, and at each\r\nof the ends there is a figure painted by Raphael in oil. The fresco\r\npainting has been so often repaired in consequence of decay, that not\r\na vestige of the original work remains; while the two figures painted\r\nby Raphael in oil still stand out in all their original freshness, and\r\neven improved from what they were when first executed....\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne dined and slept on Wednesday at Wimbledon.[108] He\r\nmet there Lord and Lady Cottenham, Lord[109] and Lady Langdale, Lord\r\nGlenelg and his brother, Mr Wm. Grant, who was his private secretary,\r\nand is an amusing man. Lord Melbourne is going there again to-morrow\r\nto stay until Monday. The place is beautiful; it is not like\r\nClaremont, but it is quite of the same character, and always puts Lord\r\nMelbourne in mind of it. The Duchess has many merits, but amongst them\r\nis the not small one of having one of the best cooks in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 104: Madame de Lieven wrote to Aberdeen, 12th\r\n    September 1841: \"Ne jugez pas cet Ambassadeur par son\r\n    exterieur; il personnifie un peu les Marquis de Molière....\r\n    Passez-lui ses cheveux poudrés, son air galant et papillon\r\n    auprès des femmes.

She thinks that it would be extremely inconvenient if\r\nAudiences were to be granted to Peers for the purpose of presenting\r\nPetitions or Addresses. The Queen knows that it has always been\r\nconsidered a sort of right of theirs to ask for and receive an\r\nAudience of the King or Queen. But the Queen knows that upon several\r\noccasions Lord Melbourne and Lord John Russell wrote to the Peers who\r\nrequested Audiences, stating that it would be very inconvenient for\r\nthe Queen, particularly in the country, and that they had better\r\neither put off asking for it, till the Queen came to town, or send\r\nwhat they had to say; communicate in writing--which was complied with.\r\nIf, therefore, Sir James Graham would state this to Lord Radnor, he\r\nmay probably give up pressing for an Audience. Should he, however,\r\nurge his wish very strongly, the Queen will see him in the manner\r\nproposed by Sir James. The Queen would wish to hear from Sir James\r\nagain before she gives a final answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE CHINESE CAMPAIGN]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord Ellenborough to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nINDIA BOARD, _2nd October 1841._\r\n\r\nLord Ellenborough, with his most humble duty to your Majesty, humbly\r\nacquaints your Majesty that your Majesty's Ministers, taking into\r\nconsideration the smallness of the force with which the campaign in\r\nChina was commenced this year, and the advanced period of the season\r\nat which the reinforcements would arrive (which reinforcements would\r\nnot so raise the strength of the Army as to afford any reasonable\r\nexpectation that its operations will produce during the present year\r\nany decisive results), have deemed it expedient that instructions\r\nwould be at once issued to the Indian Government with a view to the\r\nmaking of timely preparations for the campaign of 1842.[111]\r\n\r\nYour Majesty's Ministers are of opinion that the War with China should\r\nbe conducted on an enlarged scale, and the Indian Government will\r\nbe directed to have all their disposable military and naval force\r\nat Singapore in April, so that the operations may commence at the\r\nearliest period which the season allows.\r\n\r\nLord Ellenborough cannot but entertain a sanguine expectation that\r\nthat force so commencing its operations, and directed upon a point\r\nwhere it will intercept the principal internal communication of the\r\nChinese Empire, will finally compel the Chinese Government to accede\r\nto terms of Peace honourable to your Majesty, and affording future\r\nsecurity to the trade of your Majesty's subjects.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 111: Ningpo was taken by Sir Hugh Gough on 13th\r\n    October 1841, and no further operations took place till the\r\n    spring of the following year. _See_ Introductory Note, _ante_,\r\n    p. 254.

He will, Lord\r\nMelbourne believes, require only one more sitting, which he wishes to\r\nbe at the distance of a week from the last, in order that he may\r\ntake a fresh view of the bust, and not become reconciled to its\r\nimperfections by continually looking at it. It may give the Prince\r\nsome idea of the national feeling which prevails here, when he is told\r\nthat Lord Melbourne upon asking Sir F. Chantrey what ought to be done\r\nif foreign artists were employed to paint the Houses of Parliament,\r\nreceived from him the following answer: \"Why, their heads ought to be\r\nbroke and they driven out of the country, and, old as I am, I should\r\nlike to lend a hand for that purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _5th October 1841._\r\n\r\n... Lord Melbourne, by telling your Majesty what Sir Francis Chantrey\r\nsaid respecting foreign artists, and by requesting your Majesty to\r\nrepeat it to the Prince, by no means intended to imply that there was\r\nany disposition on the part of His Royal Highness to recommend the\r\nemployment of foreigners. He only meant to convey the idea of the\r\nstrength of the prejudice which is felt by enlightened and able men\r\nupon the subject. Lord Melbourne has been sitting this morning to\r\nHayter for the picture of the marriage, and he (Hayter) held an\r\nentirely contrary language. His tone is: \"If foreign artists are more\r\ncapable than English, let them be employed. All I require is that the\r\nwork should be done as well as it can be.\" The English are certainly\r\nvery jealous of foreigners, and so, Lord Melbourne apprehends, are\r\nthe rest of mankind, but not knowing himself any nation except the\r\nEnglish, he cannot venture to make positively that assertion. Lord\r\nMelbourne has been reading the evidence given before the committee of\r\nthe House of Commons upon this subject. It is well worth attention,\r\nparticularly Mr Eastlake's,[112] which appears to Lord Melbourne to be\r\nvery enlightened, dispassionate, and just....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 112: Afterwards Sir Charles Eastlake, Keeper of the\r\n    National Gallery, 1843-1847, President of the Royal Academy,\r\n    1850-1865.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE PRINCE'S GRANT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by Mr Anson._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _6th October 1841._\r\n\r\nSat by Her Majesty last night at dinner.\r\n\r\nThe Queen had written to Lord Melbourne about coming to the Castle,\r\nbut in his answer he had made no allusion to it; she did not know\r\nwhether this was accidental or intentional, for he very often gave no\r\nanswer to questions which were put.\r\n\r\nI told Her Majesty that I feared he had raised an obstacle to his\r\nvisit by making a strong speech against the Government just at the\r\ntime he was thinking of coming. That this attack had identified him as\r\nthe leader of his Party, at a moment when I had been most anxious\r\nthat he should abstain from taking an active part, and by withdrawing\r\nhimself from politics he would enable himself to become the more\r\nuseful friend to Her Majesty. The Queen had not seen the speech,\r\nwas sorry he had felt himself obliged to make it, but it would\r\nbe difficult for him to avoid it after having been so long Prime\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty told me that previous to the exit of the late Government,\r\nLord John had earnestly cautioned Her Majesty not to propose any\r\nnew grant of money, as it would in the case of £70,000 for the new\r\nstables, however unfairly, bring great unpopularity upon the Queen. I\r\nsaid in regard to any increase to the Prince's annuity, I thought\r\nit would be very imprudent in him to think of it, except under very\r\npeculiar circumstances which might arise, but which could not yet be\r\nforeseen. The Queen said that _nothing_ should induce Her Majesty to\r\naccept such a favour from these Ministers. Peel probably now regretted\r\nhis opposition to the grant, but it was, and was intended to be, a\r\npersonal insult to herself, and it was followed up [by] opposition\r\nto her private wishes in the precedency question, where the Duke of\r\nWellington took the lead against her wishes, as Peel had done in the\r\nCommons against the Prince's grant. She never could forget it, and no\r\nfavour to her should come from such a quarter. I told Her Majesty I\r\ncould not rest the Prince's case on Her Majesty's objections if they\r\nwere the only ones which could be brought forward. If the case again\r\nrose I feared Her Majesty would find many who before, from Party\r\nviews, voted according to Her Majesty's wishes, would now rank on the\r\nopposite side.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty asked Dr Hawtrey the evening before who was the cleverest\r\nboy at Eton.\r\n\r\nDr Hawtrey made a profound bow to the Queen and said, \"I trust your\r\nMajesty will excuse my answering, for if I did I make 600 enemies at\r\nonce.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by Baron Stockmar._\r\n\r\n_6th October 1841._\r\n\r\nThe Queen had asked Lord Melbourne whether he would soon visit her at\r\nWindsor. He had not replied on that point, but had written to Prince\r\nAlbert in order to learn first the Prince's opinion on the feasibility\r\nof the matter.\r\n\r\nThe Prince sent for me and consulted with me. I was of opinion that\r\nthe Prince had better refrain from giving an answer, and that I should\r\ngive my opinion in the written form of a Memorandum, with which Anson\r\nshould betake himself to town. He was to read it aloud to Melbourne,\r\nand orally to add what amplifications might be necessary.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was done.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: RELATIONS WITH PEEL]\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Memorandum was as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Sir Robert Peel has yet to make his position opposite[113] the\r\n    Queen, which for him to obtain is important and desirable for\r\n    obvious reasons. I have good cause to doubt that Sir Robert\r\n    is sure within himself of the good-will and confidence of the\r\n    Queen. As long as the secret communication exists between Her\r\n    Majesty and Lord Melbourne, this ground, upon which alone Sir\r\n    Robert could obtain the position necessary to him as Premier,\r\n    must remain cut away from under his feet. I hold, therefore,\r\n    this secret interchange an _essential injustice_ to Sir\r\n    Robert's present situation. I think it equally wrong to call\r\n    upon the Prince to give an opinion on the subject, as he has\r\n    not the means to cause his opinion to be either regarded or\r\n    complied with. In this particular matter nobody has paramount\r\n    power to do right or wrong but the Queen, and more especially\r\n    Lord Melbourne himself. To any danger which may come out of\r\n    this to Her Majesty's character, the caution and objection\r\n    must come from him, and from him alone; and if I was standing\r\n    in his shoes I would show the Queen, of my own accord,\r\n    and upon constitutional grounds _too_, that a continued\r\n    correspondence of that sort must be fraught with imminent\r\n    danger to the Queen, especially to Lord Melbourne, and to the\r\n    State.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 113: _I.e._ with.]\r\n\r\nI then gave Anson the further arguments with which he was to accompany\r\nthe reading out of this Memo.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DISCRETION URGED ON MELBOURNE]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MELBOURNE'S INFLUENCE]\r\n\r\nOn the next day Anson went to Melbourne and told him that his note to\r\nhim had raised a great consultation, that the Prince felt much averse\r\nto giving any opinion in a case upon which he could exercise no\r\ncontrol, and in which, if it was known that he had given his sanction,\r\nhe would be held responsible for any mischief which might arise. He\r\nhad consulted Baron Stockmar, who had written the enclosed opinion,\r\nwhich the Prince had desired Anson to read to Lord Melbourne.\r\nMelbourne read it attentively twice through, with an occasional change\r\nof countenance and compression of lips. He said on concluding\r\nit: \"This is a most decided opinion indeed, quite an '_apple[114]\r\nopinion_.'\" Anson told him that the Prince felt that if the Queen's\r\nconfidence in Peel was in a way to be established, it would be\r\nextremely shaken by his (Lord Melbourne's) visit at such a moment. He\r\nfelt that it would be better that Lord Melbourne's appearance should\r\nbe in London, where he would meet the Queen only on the terms of\r\ngeneral society, but at the same time he (the Prince) was extremely\r\nreluctant to give an opinion upon a case which Lord Melbourne's own\r\nsense of right ought to decide. Anson added how he feared his speech\r\nof yesterday in the House of Lords[115] had added another impediment\r\nto his coming at this moment, as it had identified him with and\r\nestablished as the head of the Opposition party, which he (Anson) had\r\nhoped Melbourne would have been able to avoid. Melbourne, who was then\r\nsitting on the sofa, rushed up upon this, and went up and down the\r\nroom in a violent frenzy, exclaiming--\"God eternally d--n it!\"\r\netc., etc. \"Flesh and blood cannot stand this. I only spoke upon\r\nthe defensive, which Ripon's speech at the beginning of the session\r\nrendered quite necessary. I cannot be expected to give up my position\r\nin the country, neither do I think that it is to the Queen's interest\r\nthat I should.\"\r\n\r\nAnson continued that the Baron thought that no Ministry could stand\r\nthe force of such an undercurrent influence, that all the good that\r\nwas to be derived from pacifying the Queen's mind at the change had\r\nbeen gained, and that the danger which we were liable to, and which\r\nthreatened him in particular, could only be averted by his own\r\nstraightforward decision with the Queen. Anson asked him if _he_ saw\r\nany danger likely to arise from this correspondence. After a long\r\npause he said, \"_I certainly cannot think it right_,\" though he\r\nfelt sure that some medium of communication of this sort was no new\r\nprecedent. He took care never to say anything which could bring his\r\nopinion in opposition _to Sir Robert's, and he should distinctly\r\nadvise the Queen to adhere to her Ministers in everything,[116]\r\nunless he saw the time had arrived at which it might be\r\nresisted_.[117] The principal evil, replied Anson, to be dreaded from\r\nthe continuance of Lord Melbourne's influence was, according to the\r\nBaron's opinion, that so long as the Queen felt she could resort to\r\nLord Melbourne for his advice, she never would be disposed (from not\r\nfeeling the necessity) to place any real confidence in the advice she\r\nreceived from Peel.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 114: No doubt Lord Melbourne said an \"apple-pie\"\r\n    opinion.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 115: At the opening of the Session Lord Ripon had\r\n    reprobated the late Government for resorting to temporary\r\n    expedients, and Lord Melbourne, on the second reading of the\r\n    Exchequer-bills Funding Bill, caustically but good-humouredly\r\n    replied to the attack.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 116: _Note by Baron Stockmar._--If he wishes to\r\n    carry this out consistently and quite honestly, what then is\r\n    the value of his advice, if it be only the copy of that of Sir\r\n    R. Peel?]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 117: _Note by Baron Stockmar._--This means, in my\r\n    way of reading it: \"The Queen, by her correspondence with\r\n    me, puts Peel into my hands, and there I mean to let him stay\r\n    unhurt, until time and extraneous circumstances--but more\r\n    especially the advantage that will accrue to me by my secret\r\n    correspondence with the Queen--shall enable me to plunge, in\r\n    all security, the dagger into his back.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Liverpool to Baron Stockmar._[118]\r\n\r\nFIFE HOUSE, _7th October 1841._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BARON,--Peel sent for me this morning to speak to me about\r\nthe contents of his letter to me. After some general conversation on\r\nmatters respecting the Royal Household, he said that he had had\r\nmuch satisfaction in his intercourse lately with Her Majesty, and\r\nspecifically yesterday, and he asked me whether I had seen Her Majesty\r\nor the Prince yesterday, and whether they were satisfied with him. I\r\ntold him that except in public I had not seen Her Majesty, and except\r\nfor a moment in your room I had not seen the Prince; but that as he\r\nspoke to me on this matter, I must take the opportunity of saying a\r\nword to him about _you_, from whom I had learnt yesterday that both\r\nthe Queen and Prince are extremely well pleased with him. That I\r\nhad known you very long, but that our great intimacy began when King\r\nLeopold sent you over just previous to the Queen's accession; that we\r\nhad acted together on that occasion, and that our mutual esteem and\r\nintimacy had increased; that your position was a very peculiar one,\r\nand that you might be truly said to be a species of second parent to\r\nthe Queen and the Prince; that your only object was their welfare, and\r\nyour only ambition to be of service to them; that in this sense you\r\nhad communicated with Melbourne, and that I wished that in this sense\r\nyou should communicate with him (Peel). He said that he saw the matter\r\nexactly as I did, that he wished to communicate with you, and felt the\r\ngreatest anxiety to do everything to meet the wishes of the Queen and\r\nPrince in all matters within his power, and as far as consistent\r\nwith his known and avowed political principles; that in all matters\r\nrespecting the Household and their private feelings that the smallest\r\nhint sufficed to guide him, as he would not give way to any party\r\nfeeling or job which should in any way militate against Her Majesty\r\nor His Royal Highness's comfort; that he wished particularly that it\r\nshould be known that he never had a thought of riding _roughshod_ over\r\nHer Majesty's wishes; that if you would come to him at any time, and\r\nbe candid and explicit with him, you might depend upon his frankness\r\nand discretion; that above all, if you had said anything to him, and\r\nexpressed a wish that it might not be communicated even to the Duke of\r\nWellington, (that was his expression), that he wished me to assure you\r\nthat your wishes should be strictly attended to. Pray give me a line\r\nto say that you do not disapprove of what I have done. We had a great\r\ndeal more conversation, but with this I will not now load my letter,\r\nbeing ever sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nLIVERPOOL.\r\n\r\nDirect your answer to this house.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 118: This letter was submitted to the Queen.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: AUDIENCES OF PEERS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _8th October 1841._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. He has this\r\nmorning received your Majesty's letter of yesterday. There can be no\r\ndoubt that your Majesty is right about the Audiences which have been\r\nrequested....\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel is probably right in supposing that the claim of a\r\nPeer to an Audience of the Sovereign originated in early times, and\r\nbefore the present course of government by responsible advisers was\r\nfully and decidedly established, which it hardly can be said to have\r\nbeen until after the accession of the House of Hanover, but the custom\r\nof asking for such Audiences, and of their being in general granted,\r\nwas well known, and has for the most part been observed and adhered\r\nto. Lord Melbourne remembers that during the part of the French War,\r\nwhen considerable alarm began to prevail respecting its duration, and\r\nthe serious aspect which it was assuming, George III. gave Audiences\r\nto the Duke of Norfolk and others which he certainly would not have\r\nbeen inclined to do if he had not thought himself bound by his duty\r\nand by Constitutional precedent. At the time of the passing of the\r\nRoman Catholic Relief Act, George IV. received very many Peers, much\r\nno doubt against his will, who came to remonstrate with him upon the\r\ncourse which his Ministers were pursuing. William IV. did the same at\r\nthe time of the Reform Bill, and certainly spoke upon the subject in\r\na manner which Lord Melbourne always thought indiscreet and imprudent.\r\nUpon the whole, the practice has been so much acted upon and\r\nestablished, that Lord Melbourne will certainly not think it wise to\r\nmake any alteration now, especially as it has in itself beneficial\r\neffects, especially as in a time of strong political feeling it is a\r\nsatisfaction to the people to think that their wishes and opinions are\r\nlaid before the Sovereign fairly and impartially. It is not likely to\r\nbe a very heavy burthen, inasmuch as such Audiences are only asked at\r\nparticular moments, and they are not in themselves very burthensome\r\nnor difficult to deal with. It is only for the Sovereign to say that\r\nhe is convinced of the good motives which have actuated the step, and\r\nthat consideration will be given to the matter and arguments which\r\nhave been stated.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne has one vague recollection of a correspondence upon\r\nthis subject between Lord Holland and some King, but does not remember\r\nthe circumstances with any accuracy.\r\n\r\nDuncannon[119] persuaded Brougham to give up asking an Audience upon\r\ncondition of Lord Melbourne's promising to place his letters in your\r\nMajesty's hands, which he did.[120] Lord Charlemont[121] also was\r\nprevented in some manner or another, which Lord Melbourne forgets.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, Lord Melbourne thinks that it is best to concede this\r\nprivilege of the Peerage, whether it actually exists or not, but to\r\nrestrain it within due and reasonable bounds, which in ordinary times\r\nit is not difficult to do. Extraordinary times must be dealt with as\r\nthey can be....\r\n\r\nLady A---- is, as your Majesty says, good-natured. She talks three or\r\nfour times as much as she ought, and like many such women often says\r\nexactly the things she ought not to say. Lady B---- has ten times the\r\nsense of her mother, and a little residue of her folly.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 119: Ex-First Commissioner of Land Revenue.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 120: See _ante_, pp. 293 and 335-6.\r\n      (Ch.

Your Majesty will nevertheless perceive that the\r\nDuke considers, upon the whole, \"that Lord Ellenborough is better\r\nqualified than any man in England for the office of Governor-General.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 122: He was Joint Chief Clerk of the Pleas in the\r\n    Queen's Bench, a sinecure conferred on him by his father, who\r\n    was Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench, 1802-1818.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: AFFAIRS IN SPAIN]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _12th October 1841._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--- ... Respecting the Spanish affairs,[123] I can\r\ngive you perfectly satisfactory intelligence concerning the Infants'\r\nreturn. Espartero sees them return with the greatest regret, but said\r\nhe felt he could not prevent them from doing so. If, however, they\r\nshould be found to intrigue at all, they will not be allowed to\r\nremain. Respecting a marriage with the eldest son of Dona Carlotta, I\r\nknow _positively_ that Espartero _never_ would _hear_ of it; but, on\r\nthe other hand, he is equally strongly opposed to poor little Isabel\r\nmarrying any French Prince, and I must add that _we_ could _never\r\nallow that_. You will see that I have given you a frank and fair\r\naccount....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 123: The Queen-mother, who was living in Paris, had\r\n    been deprived by a vote of the Cortes of the guardianship of\r\n    the young Queen, Isabella II., and risings in her interest now\r\n    took place at Pampeluna and Vittoria.

Lord Melbourne\r\nearnestly hopes that your Majesty continues well.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is very glad to hear of the appointment of Lord\r\nEllenborough. The reasons which your Majesty gives are sound and just,\r\nand it is of great importance that a man not only of great ability but\r\nof high station, and perfectly in the confidence of the Government at\r\nhome, should be named to this important post. Lord Ellenborough is a\r\nman of great abilities, of much knowledge of India, of great industry\r\nand of very accurate habits of business, and Lord Melbourne knows of\r\nno objection to his appointment, except the loss of him here, where,\r\nwhether in or out of office, he has always been of great service.\r\nHe has hitherto been an unpopular man and his manners have been\r\nconsidered contemptuous and overbearing, but he is evidently much\r\nsoftened and amended in this respect, as most men are by time,\r\nexperience, and observation. Lord Fitzgerald[124] is a very able\r\npublic man, Lord Melbourne would say one of the most able, if not the\r\nmost able they have; but Lord Melbourne is told by others, who know\r\nLord Fitzgerald better, that Lord Melbourne overrates him. He is a\r\nvery good speaker, he has not naturally much industry, and his\r\nhealth is bad, which will probably disable him from a very close and\r\nassiduous attention to business. It is, however, upon the whole an\r\nadequate appointment, and he is perhaps more likely to go on smoothly\r\nwith the Court of Directors, which is a great matter, than Lord\r\nEllenborough.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 124: On Lord Ellenborough becoming Governor-General,\r\n    Lord Fitzgerald and Vesci, an ex-M.P., and former Chancellor\r\n    of the Irish Exchequer, succeeded him at the Board of\r\n    Control.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: FRANCE AND SPAIN]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Aberdeen to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nFOREIGN OFFICE, _16th October 1841._\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen, with his most humble duty, begs to lay before\r\nyour Majesty a private letter from M. Guizot, which has just been\r\ncommunicated to him by M. de Ste-Aulaire, on the recent attempt\r\nin favour of Queen Christina in Spain. Your Majesty will see that\r\nalthough M. Guizot denies, with every appearance of sincerity, all\r\nparticipation of the French Government in this attempt, he does not\r\nconceal that it has their cordial good wishes for its success. These\r\nfeelings, on the part of such a Government as that of France, will\r\nprobably be connected with practical assistance of some kind, although\r\nM. Guizot's declarations may perhaps be literally true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Aberdeen._\r\n\r\nThe Queen must say that she fears the French are at the bottom of it,\r\nfor their jealousy of our influence in Spain is such, that the Queen\r\nfears they would not be indisposed to see civil war to a certain\r\ndegree restored rather than that Spain should go on quietly supported\r\nby us.[125] The Queen, however, hopes that, as far as it is possible,\r\nthe English Government will support the present Regent, who is\r\nthoroughly attached to England, and who, from all that the Queen\r\nhears of him, is the fittest man they have in Spain for the post he\r\noccupies; and indeed matters till now had gone on much more quietly\r\nthan they had for some time previous, since Espartero is at the head\r\nof the Government. The French intrigues should really be frustrated.\r\nThe Queen certainly thinks that M. Guizot's veracity is generally not\r\nto be doubted, but the conduct of France regarding Spain has always\r\nbeen very equivocal.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 125: See _post_, p. 349. (Ch.

Of these, the most eminent in respect to the qualifications\r\nrequired in the office of Master, and to academical distinction,\r\nare:--\r\n\r\n    Professor Whewell.[126]\r\n    The Rev. Mr Martin,[127] Bursar of the College.\r\n    The Rev. Dr Wordsworth,[128] Head Master of Harrow School,\r\n        and son of the present Master of Trinity.\r\n\r\nThe latter is a highly distinguished scholar, but his success as Head\r\nMaster of Harrow has not been such as to overcome the objection which\r\napplies on general grounds to the succession of a father by a son in\r\nan office of this description.\r\n\r\nProfessor Whewell is a member of Trinity College of the highest\r\nscientific attainments. His name is probably familiar to your Majesty\r\nas the author of one of the Bridgewater Treatises,[129] and of other\r\nworks which have attracted considerable notice.\r\n\r\nHe is a general favourite among all who have had intercourse with him\r\nfrom his good temper and easy and conciliatory manners. Though not\r\n_peculiarly_ eminent as a divine (less so at least than a writer on\r\nscientific and philosophical subjects), his works manifest a deep\r\nsense of the importance of religion and sound religious views. The\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury[130] and the Bishop of London[131] (himself\r\nof Trinity College) incline to think that the most satisfactory\r\nappointment upon the whole would be that of Professor Whewell.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel, after making every enquiry into the subject, and with\r\na deep conviction of the importance of the appointment, has arrived at\r\nthe same conclusion, and humbly therefore recommends to your Majesty\r\nthat Professor Whewell should succeed Dr Wordsworth as Master of\r\nTrinity College, Cambridge.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 126: Then Knightsbridge Professor of Moral\r\n    Philosophy.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 127: Francis Martin, afterwards Vice-Master, died\r\n    1868.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 128: Christopher Wordsworth, afterwards Bishop of\r\n    Lincoln.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 129: By the will (dated 1825) of the eighth Earl\r\n    of Bridgewater--who must not be confounded with the third and\r\n    last Duke, projector of inland navigation--£8,000 was left\r\n    for the best work on the \"Goodness of God as manifested in\r\n    the Creation.\" The money was divided amongst eight persons,\r\n    including Whewell, who wrote on Astronomy considered in\r\n    reference to Natural Theology.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 130: William Howley.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 131: O.

Her earnest wish is that the English Government should\r\nbe firm, and uphold the Regent as far as it is in our power. The Queen\r\nhas perused M. Guizot's letter with great attention, but she cannot\r\nhelp fearing that assistance and encouragement has been given in\r\nsome shape or other to the revolts which have taken place. The Queen\r\nChristina's residence at Paris is very suspicious, and much to be\r\nregretted; every one who saw the Queen and knew her when Regent, knew\r\nher to be clever and _capable_ of governing, had she but attended\r\nto her duties. This she did not, but wasted her time in frivolous\r\namusements and neglected her children sadly, and finally left them.\r\nIt was her _own_ doing, and therefore it is not the kindest conduct\r\ntowards her children, but the very _worst_, to try and disturb the\r\ntranquillity of a country which was just beginning to recover from the\r\nbaneful effects of one of the most bloody civil wars imaginable.\r\n\r\nThe Queen is certain that Lord Aberdeen will feel with her of what\r\nimportance it is to England that Spain should not become subject to\r\nFrench interests, as it is evident _France wishes_ to make it. The\r\nmarriage of Queen Isabel is a most important question, and the Queen\r\nis likewise certain that Lord Aberdeen sees at once that we could\r\nnever let her marry a French Prince. Ere long the Queen must speak to\r\nLord Aberdeen on this subject. In the meantime the Queen thought\r\nit might be of use to Lord Aberdeen to put him in possession of her\r\nfeelings on the state of Spain, in which the Queen has always taken a\r\nvery warm interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nPANSHANGER, _21st October 1841._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. He received\r\nhere yesterday your Majesty's letter of the 19th inst., and he\r\nearnestly hopes that your Majesty has arrived quite safe and well in\r\nLondon. Besides the family, we have had hardly anybody here except\r\nLady Clanricarde.[132] Yesterday Sir Edward L. Bulwer[133] came,\r\nbeating his brother hollow in ridiculousness of attire, ridiculous as\r\nthe other is. He has, however, much in him, and is agreeable when you\r\ncome to converse with him....\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is rather in doubt about his own movements. Lord\r\nLeicester[134] presses him much to go to Holkham, where Lord\r\nFortescue,[135] Mr Ellice[136] and others are to be, and considering\r\nLord Leicester's age, Lord Melbourne thinks that it will gratify him\r\nto see Lord Melbourne again there. But at Holkham they shoot from\r\nmorning until night, and if you do not shoot you are like a fish\r\nupon dry land. Lord Melbourne hardly feels equal to the exertion, and\r\ntherefore thinks that he shall establish himself for the present\r\nat Melbourne, where he will be within reach of Trentham, Beau\r\nDesert,[137] Wentworth,[138] and Castle Howard,[139] if he likes to\r\ngo to them. The only annoyance is that it is close to Lord and Lady\r\nG----, whom he will be perpetually meeting.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 132: A daughter of George Canning, the Prime\r\n    Minister.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 133: Afterwards Lord Lytton, the novelist.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 134: The famous country gentleman, \"Mr Coke of\r\n    Norfolk.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 135: Hugh, second Earl, K.G.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 136: The Right Hon.

In France there is a great outcry that a Bourbon must be the\r\nfuture husband of the Queen of Spain, etc. I must say that as the\r\nSpaniards and the late King changed themselves the Salic custom which\r\nPhilip V. had brought from France,[140] it is natural for the rest of\r\nEurope to wish that no Bourbon should go there. Besides, it must be\r\nconfessed that the thing is not even easy, as there is great hatred\r\namongst the various branches of that family. The King of the French\r\nhimself has always been _opposed_ to the idea of one of his sons going\r\nthere; in France, however, that opinion still exists, and Thiers had\r\nit, strongly.\r\n\r\nI confess that I regret that Queen Christina was encouraged to\r\nsettle at Paris, as it gave the thing the appearance of something\r\npreconcerted. I believe that a wish existed that Christina would\r\nretire peaceably and _par la force des circonstances_, but now this\r\ntook a turn which I am sure the King does not like; it places him,\r\nbesides, into _une position ingrate_; the Radicals hate him, the\r\nModerates will cry out that he has left them in the lurch, and the\r\nCarlists are kept under key, and of course also not much pleased. I\r\nmeant to have remained in my wilds till yesterday, but my Ministers\r\nwere so anxious for my return, there being a good many things on the\r\n_tapis_, that I came back on Tuesday, the 19th....\r\n\r\nHere one is exactly shut up as if one was in a menagerie, walking\r\nround and round like a tame bear. One breathes here also a mixture\r\nof all sorts of moist compounds, which one is told is fresh air, but\r\nwhich is not the least like it. I suppose, however, that my neighbour\r\nin Holland, where they have not even got a hill as high as yours in\r\nBuckingham Gardens, would consider Laeken as an Alpine country. The\r\ntender meeting of the old King and the new King,[141] as one can\r\nhardly call him a young King, must be most amusing. I am told that if\r\nthe old King had not made that love-match, he would be perfectly\r\nable to dethrone his son; I heard that yesterday from a person rather\r\nattached to the son and hating the father. In the meantime, though\r\none can hardly say that he is well at home, some strange mixture of\r\ncut-throats and ruined soldiers of fortune had a mind to play us some\r\ntricks here; we have got more and more insight into this. Is it by\r\ninstigation from him personally, or does he only know of it without\r\nbeing a party to it? That _is_ difficult to tell, the more so as he\r\nmakes immense demonstration of friendly dispositions towards us,\r\nand me in particular. I would I could make a _chassez croisez_ with\r\nOtho;[142] he would be the gainer in solids, and I should have sun and\r\nan interesting country; I will try to make him understand this, the\r\nmore so as you do not any longer want me in the West.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 140: The Pragmatic Sanction of Philip V. was\r\n    repealed in 1792 by the Cortes, but the repeal was not\r\n    promulgated by the King.

The Queen\r\nmay be mistaken, for she is not very well acquainted with the judicial\r\nofficers in Ireland, but it strikes her that Serjeant Jackson belonged\r\nto the very violent Orange party in Ireland, and if this should be the\r\ncase she suggests to Sir Robert Peel whether it would not be better\r\n_not_ to appoint him. If, on the other hand, the Queen should be\r\nmistaken as to his political opinions, she would not disapprove of his\r\nsucceeding Mr Pennefather.\r\n\r\nThe Queen saw in the papers that Lord Stuart de Rothesay is already\r\ngone. The Queen can hardly believe this, as no Ambassador or Minister\r\n_ever_ left England without previously asking for an Audience and\r\nreceiving one, as the Queen wishes always to see them before they\r\nrepair to their posts. Would Sir Robert be so very good as to ask Lord\r\nAberdeen whether Lord Stuart de Rothesay is gone or not, and if he\r\nshould be, to tell Lord Aberdeen that in future she would wish\r\nhim always to inform her when they intend to go, and to ask for an\r\nAudience, which, if the Queen is well, she would always grant. It is\r\npossible that as the Queen said the other day that she did not wish\r\nto give many Audiences after the Council, that Lord Aberdeen may have\r\nmisunderstood this and thought the Queen would give none, which was\r\n_not_ her intention. The Queen would be thankful to Sir Robert if he\r\nwould undertake to clear up this mistake, which she is certain (should\r\nLord Stuart be gone) arose entirely from misapprehension.\r\n\r\nThe Queen also wishes Sir Robert to desire Lord Haddington to send her\r\nsome details of the intended reductions in the Fleet which she sees by\r\na draft of Lord Aberdeen's to Mr Bulwer have taken place.[144]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 143: Recently appointed Solicitor-General; Sergeant\r\n    J.

I told [Lord Melbourne] that, as I read the English Constitution,\r\nit meant to assign to _the Sovereign in his functions a deliberative\r\npart_--that I was not sure the Queen had the means within herself to\r\nexecute this deliberative part properly, but I was sure that the only\r\nway for her to execute her functions at all was to be strictly honest\r\nto those men who at the time being were her Ministers. That it was\r\nchiefly on this account that I had been so very sorry to have found\r\nnow, on my return from the Continent, that on the change of the\r\nMinistry a capital opportunity to read a great Constitutional maxim\r\nto the Queen had not only been lost by Lord Melbourne, but that he had\r\nhimself turned an instrument for working great good into an instrument\r\nwhich must produce mischief and danger. That I was afraid that, from\r\nwhat Lord Melbourne had been so weak as to have allowed himself to be\r\ndriven into, _against his own and better conviction_, the Queen must\r\nhave received a most pernicious bias, which on any future occasion\r\nwould make her inclined to act in a similar position similarly to that\r\nwhat she does now, being convinced that what she does _now_ must be\r\nright on all future occasions, or else Lord Melbourne would not have\r\nsanctioned it. Upon this, Lord Melbourne endeavoured to palliate, to\r\nrepresent the danger, which would arise from his secret correspondence\r\nwith the Queen as very little, to adduce precedents from history,\r\nand to screen his present conduct behind what he imagined Lord Bute's\r\nconduct had been under George III.[145] I listened patiently, and\r\nreplied in the end: All this might be mighty fine and quite calculated\r\nto lay a flattering unction on his own soul, or it might suffice to\r\ntranquillize the minds of the Prince and Anson, but that I was too old\r\nto find the slightest argument in what I had just now heard, nor could\r\nit in any way allay my apprehension. I began then to dissect all\r\nthat he had produced for his excusation, and showed him--as I thought\r\nclearly, and as he admitted convincingly--that it would be impossible\r\nto carry on this secret commerce with the Sovereign for any length\r\nof time without exposing the Queen's character and creating mighty\r\nembarrassments in the quiet and regular working of a Constitutional\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nMy representations seemed to make a very deep impression, and Lord\r\nMelbourne became visibly nervous, perplexed, and distressed. After\r\nhe had recovered a little I said, \"I never was inclined to obtrude\r\nadvice; but if you don't dislike to hear my opinion, I am prepared to\r\ngive it to you.\" He said, \"What is it?\" I said, \"You allow the Queen's\r\nconfinement to pass over quietly, and you wait till her perfect\r\nrecovery of it. As soon as this period has arrived, you state of\r\nyour own accord to Her Majesty that this secret and confidential\r\ncorrespondence with her must cease; that you gave in to it, much\r\nagainst your feelings, and with a decided notion of its impropriety\r\nand danger, and merely out of a sincere solicitude to calm Her\r\nMajesty's mind in a critical time, and to prevent the ill effects\r\nwhich great and mental agitation might have produced on her health.\r\nThat this part of your purpose now being most happily achieved, you\r\nthought yourself in duty bound to advise Her Majesty to _cease all\r\nher communications_ to you on political subjects, as you felt it wrong\r\nwithin yourself to receive them, and to return your political advice\r\nand opinions on such matters; that painful as such a step must be to\r\nyour feelings, which to the last moment of your life will remain those\r\nof the most loyal attachment and devotion to the Queen's person, it\r\nis dictated to you by a deep sense of what you owe to the country, to\r\nyour Sovereign, and to yourself.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 145: For some time after the accession of George\r\n    III., Bute, though neither in the Cabinet nor in Parliament,\r\n    was virtually Prime Minister, but he became Secretary of State\r\n    on 25th March 1761.

It certainly is a very unfortunate thing that the Queen\r\nChristina was encouraged to fix her residence at Paris, and the\r\nsuspicion arising, therefore, cannot but be very injurious both to the\r\nKing of the French and to the French nation.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne returns his warmest thanks for your Majesty's kind\r\nexpressions. He felt the greatest pleasure at seeing your Majesty\r\nagain and looking so well, and he hopes that his high spirits did\r\nnot betray him into talking too much or too heedlessly, which he is\r\nconscious that they sometimes do.\r\n\r\nThe King Leopold, Lord Melbourne perceives, still hankers after\r\nGreece; but Crowns will not bear to be chopped and changed about in\r\nthis manner. These new Kingdoms are not too firmly fixed as it is, and\r\nit will not do to add to the uncertainty by alteration....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DISPUTE WITH UNITED STATES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir Robert Peel to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWHITEHALL, _28th October 1841._\r\n\r\n... Sir Robert Peel humbly assures your Majesty that he fully\r\nparticipates in the surprise which your Majesty so naturally expresses\r\nat the extraordinary intimation conveyed to Mr Fox[146] by the\r\nPresident of the United States.[147]\r\n\r\nImmediately after reading Mr Fox's despatch upon that subject, Sir\r\nRobert Peel sought an interview with Lord Aberdeen. The measure\r\ncontemplated by the President is a perfectly novel one, a measure of a\r\nhostile and unjustifiable character adopted with pacific intentions.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel does not comprehend the object of the President,\r\nand giving him credit for the desire to prevent the interruption of\r\namicable relations with this country, Sir Robert Peel fears that\r\nthe forcible detention of the British Minister, after the demand of\r\npassports, will produce a different impression on the public mind,\r\nboth here and in the United States, from that which the President must\r\n(if he be sincere) have anticipated. It appears to Sir Robert Peel\r\nthat the object which the President professes to have in view would be\r\nbetter answered by the immediate compliance with Mr Fox's demand for\r\npassports, and the simultaneous despatch of a special mission to this\r\ncountry conveying whatever explanations or offers of reparation the\r\nPresident may have in contemplation.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel humbly assures your Majesty that he has advised\r\nsuch measures of preparation to be taken in respect to the amount of\r\ndisposable naval force, and the position of it, as without bearing\r\nthe character of menace or causing needless disquietude and alarm, may\r\nprovide for an unfavourable issue of our present differences with the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel fears that when the President ventured to make to Mr\r\nFox the communication which he did make, he must have laboured under\r\napprehension that M'Leod might be executed in spite of the efforts of\r\nthe general Government of the United States to save his life.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 146: British Minister at Washington.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 147: One Alexander M'Leod was tried at Utica on\r\n    the charge of being implicated in the destruction of the\r\n    _Caroline_ (an American vessel engaged in carrying arms to the\r\n    Canadian rebels), in 1837, and in the death of Mr Durfee, an\r\n    American. The vessel had been boarded by Canadian loyalists\r\n    when lying in American waters, set on fire and sent over\r\n    Niagara Falls, and in the affray Durfee was killed. M'Leod\r\n    was apprehended on American territory, and hence arose the\r\n    friction between the two countries.

She certainly _is_ surprised at the\r\nstrange and improper tone in which Lord Howard's[148] despatches are\r\nwritten, and can only attribute them to an over-eager and, she fully\r\nbelieves, mistaken feeling of the danger to which he believes the\r\nthrone of the Queen to be exposed.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has carefully perused Lord Aberdeen's draft, which she\r\nhighly approves, but wishes to suggest to Lord Aberdeen whether upon\r\nfurther consideration it might not perhaps be as well to _soften_ the\r\nwords under which she has drawn a pencil line, as she fears they might\r\nirritate Lord Howard very much.\r\n\r\nThe Queen is induced to copy the following sentences from a letter she\r\nreceived from her cousin, the King of Portugal, a few days ago, and\r\nwhich it may be satisfactory to Lord Aberdeen to see:--\r\n\r\n\"_Je dois encore vous dire que nous avons toutes les raisons de nous\r\nlouer de la manière dont le Portugal est traité par votre Ministre des\r\nAffaires Étrangères, et nous ferons de notre côté notre possible pour\r\nprouver notre bonne volonté.\"_\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 148: Lord Howard de Walden, Minister Plenipotentiary\r\n    at Lisbon.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: SECRETARIES OF STATE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _1st November 1841._\r\n\r\n... Now for His Royal Highness's questions....\r\n\r\nHow the power of Prime Ministry grew up into its present form it is\r\ndifficult to trace precisely, as well as how it became attached, as\r\nit were, to the office of First Commissioner of the Treasury. But\r\nLord Melbourne apprehends that Sir Robert Walpole was the first man\r\nin whose person this union of powers was decidedly established, and\r\nthat its being so arose from the very great confidence which both\r\nGeorge I. and George II. reposed in him, and from the difficulty which\r\nthey had in transacting business, particularly George I., from their\r\nimperfect knowledge of the language of the country.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Secretary of State, Lord Melbourne is not prepared\r\nfrom memory to state the dates at which the different arrangements of\r\nthat office have taken place. There was originally but one officer,\r\nand at the present the three are but the heads of the different\r\ndepartments of one office. The first division was into two, and they\r\nwere called the Secretary for the Northern and the Secretary for\r\nthe Southern department. They drew a line across the world, and each\r\ntransacted the business connected with the countries within his\r\nown portion of the globe. Another division then took place, and the\r\nForeign affairs were confided to one Secretary of State, and the Home\r\nand Colonial affairs to the other; but the present arrangement was\r\nfinally settled in the year 1793, when the junction was formed between\r\nMr Pitt on the one hand, and those friends of Mr Fox who left him\r\nbecause they differed with him upon the French Revolution. The Home\r\naffairs were placed in the hands of one Secretary of State, the\r\nForeign of another, and the Colonial and Military affairs of a third,\r\nand this arrangement has continued ever since.[149] The persons then\r\nappointed were the Duke of Portland,[150] Lord Grenville,[151] and Mr\r\nDundas,[152] Home, Foreign, and Colonial Secretaries.\r\n\r\nWriting from recollection, it is very possible that Lord Melbourne may\r\nbe wrong in some of the dates which he has ventured to specify.[153]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 149: A fourth Secretary of State was added at\r\n    the time of the Crimean War, so as to separate Colonial and\r\n    Military affairs, and a fifth after the Indian Mutiny to\r\n    supersede the President of the Board of Control. _See_ Lord\r\n    Melbourne's letter of 31st December 1837, _ante_, p. 100.\r\n      (Ch.

England always appears cold, heartless, and\r\nsulky in comparison....\r\n\r\nWith respect to the questions put to me by your Majesty at the desire\r\nof His Royal Highness, Lord Melbourne begs leave to assure your\r\nMajesty that he will be at all times most ready and anxious to give\r\nany information in his power upon points of this sort, which are very\r\ncurious, very important, very worthy to be enquired into, and\r\nupon which accurate information is not easily to be found. All the\r\npolitical part of the English Constitution is fully understood,\r\nand distinctly stated in Blackstone and many other books, but the\r\nMinisterial part, the work of conducting the executive government, has\r\nrested so much on practice, on usage, on understanding, that there is\r\nno publication to which reference can be made for the explanation\r\nand description of it. It is to be sought in debates, in protests, in\r\nletters, in memoirs, and wherever it can be picked up. It seems to\r\nbe stupid not to be able to say at once when two Secretaries of State\r\nwere established; but Lord Melbourne is not able. He apprehends that\r\nthere was but one until the end of Queen Anne's reign, and that two\r\nwere instituted by George I., probably because upon his frequent\r\njourneys to Hanover he wanted the Secretary of State with him, and at\r\nthe same time it was necessary that there should be an officer of the\r\nsame authority left at home to transact the domestic affairs.\r\n\r\n_Prime Minister_ is a term belonging to the last century. Lord\r\nMelbourne doubts its being to be found in English Parliamentary\r\nlanguage previously. Sir Robert Walpole was always accused of having\r\nintroduced and arrogated to himself an office previously unknown to\r\nthe Law and Constitution, that of Prime or Sole Minister, and we learn\r\nfrom Lady Charlotte Lindsay's[154] accounts of her father, that in his\r\nown family Lord North would never suffer himself to be called _prime_\r\nMinister, because it was an office unknown to the Constitution. This\r\nwas a notion derived from the combined Whig and Tory opposition to Sir\r\nRobert Walpole, to which Lord North and his family had belonged.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is very sorry to hear that the Princess Royal continues\r\nto suffer from some degree of indisposition. From what your Majesty\r\nhad said more than once before, Lord Melbourne had felt anxiety upon\r\nthis subject, and he saw the Baron yesterday, who conversed with him\r\nmuch upon it, and informed him of what had taken place. Lord Melbourne\r\nhopes that your Majesty will attribute it only to Lord Melbourne's\r\nanxious desire for the security and increase of your Majesty's\r\nhappiness, if he ventures to say that the Baron appears to him to have\r\nmuch reason in what he urges, and in the view which he takes. It is\r\nabsolutely required that confidence should be reposed in those who\r\nare to have the management and bear the responsibility, and that they\r\nshould not be too much interrupted or interfered with.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 154: Daughter of Lord North (afterwards Earl of\r\n    Guilford) and wife of Lieut.-Colonel the Hon. John Lindsay.\r\n    She lived till 1849--a link with the past.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: SECRETARIES OF STATE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _5th November 1841._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. Not feeling\r\nsatisfied of the correctness of the information which he had given to\r\nyour Majesty respecting the office of Secretary of State, he yesterday\r\nevening requested Mr Allen[155] to look into the matter, and he has\r\njust received from him the enclosed short memorandum, which he has the\r\nhonour of transmitting to your Majesty. This shows that Lord Melbourne\r\nwas quite wrong with respect to the period at which two Secretaries\r\nof State were first employed, and that it was much earlier than he had\r\nimagined.\r\n\r\nThe year 1782, when the third Secretary of State was abolished, was\r\nthe period of the adoption of the great measure of Economical Reform\r\nwhich had been introduced by Mr. Burke in 1780.\r\n\r\nThe present arrangement was settled in 1794, which is about the time\r\nwhich Lord Melbourne stated.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 155: Secretary and Librarian at Holland House.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD MELBOURNE'S POSITION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _7th November 1841._\r\n\r\n... Your Majesty asks whether Lord Melbourne thinks that Prince\r\nMetternich holds the opinion of Sir Robert Gordon, which he expresses\r\nto Lord Beauvale. It is difficult to say what Prince Metternich's\r\nreal sentiments are. Lord Melbourne takes him not to have a very high\r\nopinion of the abilities of others in general, and he is not unlikely\r\nto depreciate Sir Robert Gordon to Lord Beauvale. Sir Robert Gordon is\r\na man of integrity, but he is tiresome, long and pompous, which cannot\r\nbe agreeable to the Prince, who has about him much of the French\r\nvivacity, and also much of their settled and regular style of\r\nargument....\r\n\r\nWith respect to the latter part of your Majesty's letter, Lord\r\nMelbourne returns for the expressions of your Majesty's kindness his\r\nwarm and grateful thanks. Your Majesty may rest assured that he will\r\nalways speak to your Majesty without scruple or reserve, and that he\r\nwill never ask anything of your Majesty, or ever make a suggestion,\r\nwhich he does not consider to be for your Majesty's service and\r\nadvantage. Lord Melbourne is of opinion that his visits to the Palace\r\nshould not only avoid exciting suspicion and uneasiness in your\r\nMajesty's present advisers, a result of which he has very little\r\napprehension, but they should not be so frequent as to attract public\r\nnotice, comment, and observation, of which he would be more fearful.\r\nA public rumour, however unfounded and absurd, has more force in this\r\ncountry than objections which have in them more of truth and reality.\r\nUpon these grounds, and as your Majesty will probably not see much\r\ncompany at present, and the parties therefore will be a good deal\r\nconfined to the actual Household, Lord Melbourne thinks it would\r\nperhaps be as well if he were not again to dine at the Palace at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe course which it may be prudent to take hereafter will depend very\r\nmuch upon that which cannot now be foreseen, namely, upon the general\r\ncourse which will be taken by politics and political parties. In this\r\nLord Melbourne does not at present discern his way, and he will\r\nnot therefore hazard opinions which would not be founded upon any\r\ncertainty, and might be liable to immediate change and alteration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: STOCKMAR'S ADVICE]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: STOCKMAR'S EXPOSTULATIONS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum: Baron Stockmar to Viscount Melbourne._\r\n\r\n_23 November 1841._\r\n\r\nThe apprehension which haunts me since my return to England is well\r\nknown to you. It was my intention to have written to you upon it some\r\ntime hereafter, but the contents of a certain letter, sent by you just\r\nbefore your departure, accelerates the execution of my design. From\r\nyour own expressions used some time back, I was led to expect that you\r\nwould be glad to take advantage _of any fair opportunity_ which might\r\ncontribute towards that devoutly to be wished for object, viz., to let\r\na certain correspondence die a natural death. You may easily conceive\r\nhow much I felt disappointed when I heard that you had written\r\nagain, without a challenge, and that, without apparent cause, you had\r\nvolunteered the promise to write from time to time. This happens at\r\na moment when _your_ harassing apprehension received new life and\r\nstrength from two incidents which I think it my duty to make known to\r\nyou, and of which the one came to pass _before_, the other after, your\r\ndeparture from here. Some weeks back I was walking in the streets with\r\nDr Prætorius,[156] when, finding myself opposite the house of one\r\nof my friends, it came across my mind to give him a call. Prætorius\r\nwanted to leave me, on a conception that, as a stranger, he might\r\nobstruct the freedom of our conversation. I insisted, however, on his\r\nremaining with me, and we were shown into the drawing-room, where\r\nin all there were five of us. For some minutes the conversation had\r\nturned on insignificant things, when the person talking to me said\r\nquite abruptly: \"So I find the Queen is in daily correspondence with\r\nLord Melbourne.\" I replied, \"Who told you this?\" The answer was, \"Mrs\r\nNorton; she told me the other evening. Don't you believe that Lord\r\nMelbourne has lost his influence over the Queen's mind; he daily\r\nwrites to her, and receives as many answers, in which she communicates\r\neverything to him.\" Without betraying much emotion I said, \"I don't\r\nbelieve a word of it; the Queen may have written once or twice on\r\nprivate matters, but the daily correspondence on all matters is\r\ncertainly the amplification of a thoughtless and imprudent person, who\r\nis not aware of such exaggerated assertions.\" My speech was followed\r\nby a general silence, after which we talked of other things, and\r\nsoon took our leave. When we were fairly in the open air, Prætorius\r\nexpressed to me his amazement at what he had heard, and he remained\r\nfor some time at a loss to comprehend the character of the person who,\r\nfrom mere giddiness, let out so momentous a secret.\r\n\r\nThe other fact took place the day after you had left. From the late\r\nevents at Brussels, it had become desirable that I should see Sir\r\nRobert Peel. From Belgium we travelled over to Home politics. I\r\nexpressed my delight at seeing the Queen so happy, and added a hope\r\nthat more and more she would seek and find her real happiness in her\r\ndomestic relations only. He evidently caught at this, and assured me\r\nthat he should at all times be too happy to have a share in anything\r\nwhich might be thought conducive to the welfare of Her Majesty. That\r\nno consideration of personal inconvenience would ever prevent him from\r\nindulging the Queen in all her wishes relating to matters of a private\r\nnature, and that the only return for his sincere endeavours to please\r\nHer Majesty he looked to, was honesty in public affairs. Becoming then\r\nsuddenly emphatic, he continued, \"But on this I must insist, and I\r\ndo assure you, that that moment I was to learn that the Queen takes\r\nadvice upon public matters in another place, I shall throw up; for\r\nsuch a thing I conceive the country could not stand, and I would not\r\nremain an hour, whatever the consequences of my resignation may be.\"\r\n\r\nFully sensible that he was talking at me, I received the charge with\r\nthe calmness of a good conscience, and our time being exhausted I\r\nprepared for retreat. But he did not allow me to do so, before he had\r\nfound means to come a second time to the topic uppermost in his own\r\nmind, and he repeated, it appeared to me with increased force of tone,\r\nhis determination to throw up, fearless of all consequences, that\r\nmoment he found himself and the country dishonestly dealt by.\r\n\r\nI think I have now reported to you correctly the two occurrences which\r\nof late have added so much to my antecedent suspicions and fears.\r\nPermit me to join to this a few general considerations which, from\r\nthe nature of the recited incidents alone, and without the slightest\r\nintervention of any other cause, must have presented themselves to my\r\nmind. The first is, that I derive from the events related quite ground\r\nenough for concluding that the danger I dread is great and imminent,\r\nand that, if ill luck is to have its will, no human power can prevent\r\nan explosion for a day, or even for an hour. The second is the\r\ncontemplation--what state will the Queen be placed in by such a\r\ncatastrophe? That in my position, portraying to myself all the\r\nconsequences of such a possibility, I look chiefly to the Queen, needs\r\nhardly, I trust, an excuse.... Can you hope that the Queen's character\r\nwill ever recover from a shock received by a collision with Peel, upon\r\nsuch a cause? Pray illustrate to yourself this particular question by\r\ntaking a purely political and general survey of the time and period\r\nwe live in at this moment. In doing so must you not admit that all\r\nEngland is agreed that the Tories must have another trial, and that\r\nthere is a decided desire in the nation that it should be a fair\r\none? Would you have it said that Sir Robert Peel failed in his\r\ntrial, merely because the Queen alone was not fair to him, and that\r\nprincipally you had aided her in the game of dishonesty? And can you\r\nhope that this game can be played with security, even for a short\r\ntime only, when a person has means of looking into your cards whom\r\nyou yourself have described to me some years ago as a most passionate,\r\ngiddy, imprudent and dangerous woman? I am sure beforehand that\r\nyour loyalty and devotion has nothing to oppose to the force of my\r\nexposition. There are, however, some other and minor reasons which\r\nought likewise to be considered before you come to the determination\r\nof trusting entirely to possibilities and chance. For the results of\r\nyour deliberation you will have to come to will in their working and\r\neffects go beyond yourself, and must affect two other persons. These\r\nwill have a right to expect that your decision will not be taken\r\nregardless of that position, which accidental circumstances have\r\nassigned to them, in an affair the fate of which is placed entirely\r\nwithin your discretion. This is an additional argument why you should\r\ndeliberate very conscientiously. A mistake of yours in this respect\r\nmight by itself produce fresh difficulties and have a complicating and\r\nperplexing retro effect upon the existing ones; because both, seeing\r\nthat they must be sufferers in the end, may begin to look only to\r\ntheir own safety, and become inclined to refuse that passive obedience\r\nwhich till now constitutes the vehicle of your hazardous enterprize.\r\n\r\nApproaching the conclusion of this letter, I beg to remind you of a\r\nconversation I had with you on the same subject in South Street, the\r\n25th of last month.[157] Though you did not avow it then in direct\r\nwords, I could read from your countenance and manner that you assented\r\nin your head and heart to all I had said, and in particular to the\r\nadvice I volunteered at the end of my speech. At that time I pointed\r\nout to you a period when I thought a decisive step ought to be\r\ntaken on your part. This period seems to me to have arrived. Placing\r\nunreserved confidence into your candour and manliness, I remain, for\r\never, very faithfully yours,\r\n\r\nSTOCKMAR.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 156: Librarian and German Secretary to Prince\r\n    Albert.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 157: _Ante_, pp. 352-3.

I would\r\nhave written sooner, had I not been a little bilious, which made\r\nme very low, and not in spirits to write. The weather has been so\r\nexceedingly relaxing, that it made me at the end of the fortnight\r\nquite bilious, and this, you know, affects the spirits. I am much\r\nbetter, but they think that I shall not get my appetite and spirits\r\nback till I can get out of town; we are therefore going in a week at\r\nlatest. I am going for a drive this morning, and am certain it will\r\ndo me good. In all _essentials_, I am better, if possible, than last\r\nyear. Our little boy[158] is a wonderfully strong and large child,\r\nwith very large dark blue eyes, a finely formed but somewhat large\r\nnose, and a pretty little mouth; I _hope_ and _pray_ he may be like\r\nhis dearest Papa. He is to be called _Albert_, and Edward is to be his\r\nsecond name. Pussy, dear child, is still _the_ great pet amongst us\r\nall, and is getting so fat and strong again.\r\n\r\nI beg my most affectionate love to dearest Louise and the dear\r\nchildren. The Queen-Dowager is recovering wonderfully.\r\n\r\nI beg you to forgive this letter being so badly written, but my feet\r\nare being rubbed, and as I have got the box on which I am writing on\r\nmy knee, it is not easy to write quite straight--but you must _not_\r\nthink my hand trembles. Ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\nPussy is _not_ at all pleased with her brother.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 158: His Majesty King Edward VII., born 9th\r\n    November.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE INFANT PRINCE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nTRENTHAM, _1st December 1841._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has had\r\nthe honour of receiving here your Majesty's letters of yesterday,\r\nby which he learns with sincere pleasure and satisfaction that your\r\nMajesty is so much recovered as to go to Windsor on so early a day as\r\nyour Majesty names. Lord Melbourne hears with great concern that your\r\nMajesty has been suffering under depression and lowness of spirits....\r\nLord Melbourne well knows how to feel for those who suffer under it,\r\nespecially as he has lately had much of it himself.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is much rejoiced to hear so good an account of the Heir\r\nApparent and of the Princess Royal, and feels himself greatly obliged\r\nby the information respecting the intended names and the sponsors.\r\nLord Melbourne supposes that your Majesty has determined yourself upon\r\nthe relative position of the two names, but _Edward_ is a good English\r\nappellation, and has a certain degree of popularity attached to\r\nit from ancient recollections. Albert is also an old Anglo-Saxon\r\nname--the same, Lord Melbourne believes, as Ethelred--but it has not\r\nbeen so common nor so much in use since the Conquest. However, your\r\nMajesty's feelings, which Lord Melbourne perfectly understands, must\r\ndetermine this point. The notion of the King of Prussia[159] gives\r\ngreat satisfaction here, and will do so with all but Puseyites and\r\nNewmanites and those who lean to the Roman Catholic faith. His strong\r\nProtestant feelings, and his acting with us in the matter of the\r\nSyrian Bishop, have made the King of Prussia highly popular in\r\nthis country, and particularly with the more religious part of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty cannot offer up for the young Prince a more safe and\r\njudicious prayer than that he may resemble his father. The character,\r\nin Lord Melbourne's opinion, depends much upon the race, and on both\r\nsides he has a good chance. Be not over solicitous about education. It\r\nmay be able to do much, but it does not do so much as is expected from\r\nit. It may mould and direct the character, but it rarely alters it.\r\nGeorge IV. and the Duke of York were educated quite like English boys,\r\nby English schoolmasters, and in the manner and upon the system of\r\nEnglish schools. The consequence was that, whatever were their faults,\r\nthey were quite Englishmen. The others, who were sent earlier abroad,\r\nand more to foreign universities, were not quite so much so. The late\r\nking was educated as a sailor, and was a complete sailor....\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne will tell your Majesty exactly what he thinks of John\r\nRussell's reply to the Plymouth address. It is very angry and very\r\nbitter, and anger and bitterness are never very dignified. Lord\r\nMelbourne certainly would not have put in those sarcasms upon the Duke\r\nof Wellington and Sir Robert Peel, for their change of opinion and\r\nconduct upon the Roman Catholic question. But the tone of the rest\r\nof the answer is, in Lord Melbourne's opinion, just and right. We\r\ncertainly delivered the affairs of the country into their hands in a\r\ngood state, both at home and abroad, and we should be acting unfairly\r\nby ourselves if we did not maintain and assert this upon every\r\noccasion. Lord Melbourne's notion of the conduct which he has to\r\npursue is, that it should not be aggressive, but that it must be\r\ndefensive. He would oppose no right measures, but he cannot suffer\r\nthe course of policy which has been condemned in him to be adopted by\r\nothers without observation upon the inconsistency and injustice....\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne concludes with again wishing your Majesty health and\r\nhappiness, and much enjoyment of the country.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 159: King Frederick William IV., who was to be a\r\n    sponsor.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PRINCE OF WALES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir James Graham to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWHITEHALL, _6th December 1841._\r\n\r\nSir James Graham, with humble duty, begs to enclose for the Signature\r\nof your Majesty the Letters Patent creating His Royal Highness,\r\nthe Prince of the United Kingdom, Prince of Wales and Earl of\r\nChester.[160]\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that it is your Majesty's pleasure to have this Creation\r\ninserted in the _Gazette_ of to-morrow night, Sir James Graham has\r\ngiven directions, which will ensure the publication, though the\r\nLetters Patent themselves may not be completed.

It was a nasty warm\r\nand very rainy day, but to-day is very bright, clear and dry, and we\r\nwalked out early and felt like prisoners freed from some dungeon. Many\r\nthanks for your kind letter of the 2nd, by which I grieve to see\r\nthat you are not quite well. But let me repeat again, you _must_ not\r\ndespond so; you must not be so out of spirits. I have likewise been\r\nsuffering so from _lowness_ that it made me quite miserable, and I\r\nknow how difficult it is to fight against it. I am delighted to hear\r\nthat all the children are so well. I wonder very much who our little\r\nboy will be like. You will understand _how_ fervent my prayers and\r\nI am [sure] _everybody's_ must be, to see him resemble his angelic\r\ndearest Father in _every, every_ respect, both in body and mind. Oh!\r\nmy dearest Uncle, I am sure if you knew _how_ happy, how blessed I\r\nfeel, and how _proud_ I feel in possessing _such_ a perfect being as\r\nmy husband, as he is, and if you think that you have been instrumental\r\nin bringing about this union, it must gladden your heart! How happy\r\nshould I be to see our child grow up _just_ like him! Dear Pussy\r\ntravelled with us and behaved like a grown-up person, so quiet and\r\nlooking about and coquetting with the Hussars on either side of the\r\ncarriage. Now adieu! Ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE APPROACHING CHRISTENING]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCASTLE HOWARD, _22nd December 1841._\r\n\r\n... Lord Melbourne will consider himself most highly honoured by being\r\ninvited to the christening, and will hold himself in readiness to\r\nattend, whenever it may take place. He has written to Mr Anson in\r\nanswer to the letter which he received from him this morning. Lord\r\nMelbourne has been obliged to consent to receive an address from\r\nDerby, and has fixed Monday the 27th inst. for that purpose. He could\r\nhave wished to have avoided this, but it was impossible, and he must\r\nmake the best of it that he can, which he conceives will be effected\r\nby conceiving his reply in very guarded terms, and in a tone defensive\r\nof his own administration, but not offensive to those who have\r\nsucceeded him....\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is very glad to hear of the feelings of the King of\r\nPrussia. For religious matters he is at present very popular with many\r\nin this country, and popularity, though transient and uncertain, is\r\na good thing while it lasts. The King of the Belgians should not be\r\nsurprised or mortified at the conduct of the King of Holland. We must\r\nexpect that people will act according to their nature and feelings.\r\nThe Union of Belgium and Holland has been for a long time the first\r\nwish and the daily dream of the House of Orange. It has been the great\r\nobject of their lives, and by the separation, which took place in\r\n1830, they saw their fondest hopes disappointed and destroyed at once.\r\nIt must be expected that under such a state of things, they will be\r\nunquiet, and will try to obtain what they so eagerly desire and have\r\nonce possessed.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is much rejoiced to hear that your Majesty is in the\r\nenjoyment of such good health. Your Majesty's observations upon your\r\nown situation are in the highest degree just and prudent, and it is\r\na sign of a right mind and of good feelings to prize the blessings we\r\nenjoy, and not to suffer them to be too much altered by circumstances,\r\nwhich may not turn out exactly according to our wishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE UNITED STATES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Aberdeen to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nFOREIGN OFFICE, _24th December 1841._\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen presents his most humble duty to your Majesty. He\r\nventures to request your Majesty's attention for a moment to the\r\ncharacter of your Majesty's present relations with the Government of\r\nthe United States. Your Majesty is aware that several questions of\r\ngreat difficulty and importance have been long pending between the two\r\nGovernments.[161] Some of these have become more complicated than\r\nthey were ten years ago; and any of them might, at any moment, lead to\r\nconsequences of the most disastrous nature.\r\n\r\nInstead of continuing negotiations, necessarily tedious and which\r\npromise to be interminable, your Majesty's servants are humbly of\r\nopinion that an effort ought to be made, by a Special Mission at\r\nWashington, to bring all these differences promptly to an adjustment.\r\nThe public feeling in the United States at this time does not appear\r\nto be unfavourable for such an attempt. Should it be undertaken by a\r\nperson whose rank, character, and abilities would ensure respect, and\r\nwhose knowledge of the subjects under discussion, and of the people of\r\nthe country, together with his conciliatory manners, would render him\r\ngenerally acceptable, your Majesty might perhaps indulge the hope of a\r\nsuccessful result.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen humbly ventures to think that such a person may be found\r\nin Lord Ashburton,[162] whom he submits for your Majesty's gracious\r\napprobation.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 161: The question of the North-West Boundary had\r\n    long been one source of dispute; another was the right the\r\n    British Government claimed of searching vessels suspected of\r\n    being engaged in the slave trade.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 162: Alexander, first Lord Ashburton, who had held\r\n    office in Peel's short Ministry, and married Miss Bingham of\r\n    Philadelphia.

The Queen was not at all well\r\nagain yesterday, being again troubled with lowness. The Melbourne\r\ncorrespondence still is carried on, but I think not in its\r\npristine vigour by any means. He has taken no notice of the Baron's\r\nremonstrance to him, and we are in the dark in what manner, if at all,\r\nhe means to deal with it.\r\n\r\nI have sat by Her Majesty at dinner several times lately. I should say\r\nthat Her Majesty interests herself less and less about politics, and\r\nthat her dislike is less than it was to her present Ministers, though\r\nshe would not be prepared to acknowledge it. Her Majesty is a good\r\ndeal occupied with the little Princess Royal, who begins to assume\r\ncompanionable qualities. In the evening, instead of her usual\r\nconversation with her old Prime Minister, some round game at cards is\r\nsubstituted, which always terminates at eleven. The Prince, to\r\namuse the Queen at this, has nearly left off his chess; his\r\namusements--shooting or hunting--always commence and terminate between\r\neleven and two, not to interfere with Her Majesty's arrangements, in\r\nwhich he is included as her companion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nMELBOURNE, _29th December 1841._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. He received\r\nhere yesterday your Majesty's letter of the 25th inst., upon a paper\r\nadorned with many quaint and humorous Christmas devices, and Lord\r\nMelbourne begs to offer to your Majesty, most sincerely and most\r\nfervently, the good wishes of the Season. Lord Melbourne will be in\r\ntown on Friday evening next, and after that day will wait upon your\r\nMajesty, whenever your Majesty is pleased to command....\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is very glad to hear that the King of the Belgians is\r\nreassured by his journey to Mons and his reception upon it. He need\r\nnot mind the King of Holland, if he can keep all right at Paris.\r\n\r\nThe railway smash[163] is awful and tremendous, as all railway mishaps\r\nare, and Lord Melbourne fears must always be. These slips and falls\r\nof earth from the banks are the greatest danger that now impends over\r\nthem, and if they take place suddenly and in the dark, Lord Melbourne\r\ndoes not see how the fatal consequences of them are to be effectually\r\nguarded against. They are peculiarly likely to happen now, as the\r\ncuttings have been recently and hastily made, the banks are very\r\nsteep, and the season has been peculiarly wet, interrupted by severe\r\nfrosts.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne received the deputation from Derby, a large and\r\nrespectable one, here on Monday last. The address was very guarded,\r\ntemperate, and judicious, and Lord Melbourne strove to construct his\r\nanswer in the same manner.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 163: This accident took place on 24th December in\r\n    the Sonning Hill cutting, two and a half miles from Reading.\r\n    Eight persons were killed on the spot.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\r\n\r\nTO CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE session was mainly occupied by the great Ministerial measure of\r\nfinance, direct taxation by means of income tax being imposed, and the\r\nimport duties on a large number of articles being removed or relaxed,\r\nMr Gladstone, now at the Board of Trade, taking charge of the bills.\r\nTwo more attempts on the Queen's life were made, the former again on\r\nConstitution Hill by one Francis, whose capital sentence was commuted;\r\nthe latter by a hunchback, Bean, who was sentenced to eighteen months'\r\nimprisonment. An Act was promptly passed to deal with such outrages\r\nin future as misdemeanours, without giving them the importance of high\r\ntreason. Lord Ashley's Bill was passed, prohibiting woman and child\r\nlabour in mines and collieries. But the Anti-Corn Law League of\r\nManchester was not satisfied with the policy of the Government and\r\nobjected to the income tax; while riots broke out in the manufacturing\r\ndistricts of the North.\r\n\r\nIn Afghanistan, the disasters of the previous year were retrieved; Sir\r\nRobert Sale, who was gallantly defending Jellalabad, made a _sortie_\r\nand defeated Akbar Khan; General Nott arrived at Ghuznee, but found it\r\nevacuated; he destroyed the citadel and removed the Gates of Somnauth.\r\nGeneral Pollock swept the Khyber Pass and entered Cabul. The captives\r\ntaken on the retreat from Cabul were recovered--Lady Macnaghten and\r\nLady Sale among them. In retribution for the murder of Macnaghten,\r\nthe great bazaar of Cabul, where his remains had been dishonoured,\r\nwas destroyed by Pollock; the British force was then withdrawn. Dost\r\nMahommed made himself again ruler of Cabul, and a proclamation of\r\nLord Ellenborough announced that the British Government accepted any\r\nSovereign and Constitution approved by the Afghans themselves.\r\n\r\nIn China, also, operations were successfully terminated, Chapoo being\r\ntaken in May, and an attack by Admiral Parker upon Nanking being\r\nonly averted by the conclusion of a favourable treaty, involving\r\nan indemnity, the cession by China of Hong Kong, and the opening of\r\nimportant ports to commerce.\r\n\r\nA dispute had arisen between this country and the United States as\r\nto the boundary line between the latter country and the British\r\nPossessions in North America. Lord Ashburton was accordingly sent\r\nout on a special mission to effect the adjustment of this and other\r\ndisputes, and a treaty was concluded for the purpose of defining each\r\ncountry's territorial rights, and imposing mutual obligations for the\r\nsuppression of the Slave Trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n1842\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Adelaide to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSUDBURY HALL, _4th January 1842._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR NIECE,--Most grateful for your very amiable kind letter full\r\nof good wishes for me, I hasten to answer it and to assure you that I\r\ndeeply feel all your affectionate kindness to me in wishing my life to\r\nbe prolonged. From ill-health I have become such a useless member of\r\nyour family, that I must wonder you have not long been tired of me. I\r\nwish I was more able to be of any use to you which you might like\r\nto make of me. My services would be most faithful, I can assure you.\r\nShould my life be spared, there may perhaps yet be a time when I can\r\nprove to you, that what I say is not merely a _façon de parler_, but\r\nmy sincere wish.\r\n\r\nYour domestic happiness, dearest Victoria, gives me great satisfaction\r\nwhenever I think of it, and that is very often. God continue it so,\r\nuninterrupted, is my daily prayer.\r\n\r\nYour approbation of my little offering to my dear godchild gives me\r\nmuch pleasure. It occupied me several days during my illness to make\r\nthe drawing, weak as I then was, and it was a _pleasant occupation_.\r\n\r\nWe have frost again, with a clear blue sky, which is much better for\r\nme than the damp close weather of last week, which oppressed me so\r\nmuch. I breathe again, and my spirits get their usual tone, which they\r\nhad lost, but I still cough a great deal, which is very fatiguing.\r\n\r\nWill you kiss your darlings in my name and bless them, and pray\r\nbelieve me ever, my dear Niece, your most affectionately devoted Aunt,\r\n\r\nADELAIDE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: WINDSOR]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nBROADLANDS,[1] _5th January 1842._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs to\r\nreturn to your Majesty and to His Royal Highness his thanks for all\r\nthe kindness shown him at Windsor. He was very happy to find himself\r\nthere again and in your Majesty's society. He has seen many fine\r\nplaces and much fine country, but after all there is nothing like\r\nWindsor and the Park. Twenty very fine places might easily be made out\r\nof the latter. Lord Melbourne as he drove to Bagshot was very glad to\r\nsee the plantations at and about Cumberland Lodge and onwards so well\r\nand judiciously thinned. He had a very prosperous journey here. It is\r\na lovely place, with the greatest beauty that a place can have, a\r\nvery swift, clear, natural stream, running and winding in front of the\r\nhouse. The whole place is much improved since Lord Melbourne saw it\r\nlast; a great deal of new pleasure-ground has been made. The trees,\r\ncypresses, elders, planes, elms, white poplars and acacias are very\r\nfine indeed....\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne thinks of staying here six or seven days, and then\r\nreturning to London and going to Brocket Hall and Panshanger, but\r\nhe has not fixed his plans decidedly, which he is never very fond of\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne was delighted at thinking that he left your Majesty\r\nin good health, which he earnestly hopes and fervently prays may,\r\ntogether with every other blessing, long continue.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: The house of Lord Palmerston in Hants.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Aberdeen to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nFOREIGN OFFICE, _6th January 1842._\r\n\r\n... Sir Robert Peel has informed Lord Aberdeen that he had mentioned\r\nto your Majesty the suggestion of the King of Prussia to confer the\r\nOrder of the Black Eagle[2] upon the Prince of Wales, immediately\r\nafter the christening of his Royal Highness. Lord Aberdeen therefore\r\nabstains from troubling your Majesty with any observations on this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: Founded by Frederick I. in 1701.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DISASTERS IN AFGHANISTAN]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord Fitzgerald to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_8th January 1842._\r\n\r\nLord Fitzgerald, with his most humble duty to your Majesty, begs\r\nleave humbly to inform your Majesty that despatches have been this\r\nday received at the India House from the Earl of Auckland,\r\nGovernor-General of India, which most officially confirm to too great\r\nan extent the disastrous intelligence contained in the public journals\r\nof yesterday, the particulars of which the editors of these journals\r\nhad received by express messengers from Marseilles.[3]\r\n\r\nThis intelligence is of a most painful character, and though the\r\ndetails which have arrived do high honour to the courage and the\r\ngallantry of your Majesty's forces, as well as of the East India\r\nCompany's Army, yet the loss sustained has been very great, and many\r\nvaluable officers have fallen the victims of a widespread conspiracy\r\nwhich seems to have embraced within its confederation the most warlike\r\ntribes of the Afghan nation.\r\n\r\nLord Fitzgerald begs leave most humbly to lay before your Majesty an\r\ninteresting despatch from Lord Auckland, comprising the most important\r\ndetails of the late events in Afghanistan.\r\n\r\nIt is very satisfactory to Lord Fitzgerald to be enabled humbly to\r\nacquaint your Majesty that Lord Auckland has decided on waiting\r\nthe arrival of his successor, Lord Ellenborough, and states to Lord\r\nFitzgerald that he will feel it to be his duty to remain in his\r\n[Government], in the present critical state of affairs, until he is\r\nrelieved by the new Governor-General.\r\n\r\nAll of which is most humbly submitted to your Majesty, by your\r\nMajesty's most dutiful Subject and Servant,\r\n\r\nFITZGERALD AND VESCI.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: _See_ Introductory Note, 1841, _ante_, p. 254.\r\n    The rebellion broke out at Cabul on 2nd November, and Sir\r\n    Alexander Burnes was murdered.

He has this\r\nmorning received your Majesty's letter of the 10th inst., and is glad\r\nto infer from it that your Majesty and the Prince are both well and in\r\ngood spirits.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Oxford affair, your Majesty is aware that for a\r\nlong time a serious difference has been fermenting and showing itself\r\nin the Church of England, one party leaning back towards Popery, and\r\nthe other either wishing to keep doctrines as they are, or, perhaps,\r\nto approach somewhat nearer to the dissenting Churches. This\r\ndifference has particularly manifested itself in a publication, now\r\ndiscontinued, but which has been long going on at Oxford, entitled\r\n_Tracts for the Times_, and generally called the Oxford Tracts. The\r\nProfessorship of Poetry is now vacant at Oxford, and two candidates\r\nhave been put forward, the one Mr Williams, who is the author of one\r\nor two of the most questionable of the Oxford Tracts, and the other Mr\r\nGarbett, who is a representative of the opposite party. Of course the\r\nresult of this election, which is made by the Masters of Arts of the\r\nUniversity, is looked to with much interest and anxiety, as likely\r\nto afford no unequivocal sign of which is the strongest party in the\r\nUniversity and amongst the clergy generally. It is expected that Mr\r\nGarbett will be chosen by a large majority....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE MORNING CHRONICLE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _17th January 1842._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs to\r\nacknowledge your Majesty's letter of the 15th, which he has received\r\nhere this morning.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne does not think this Puseyite difference in the Church\r\nso serious or dangerous as others do. If it is discreetly managed,\r\nit will calm down or blow over or sink into disputes of little\r\nsignificance. All Lord Melbourne fears is lest the Bishops should be\r\ninduced to act hastily and should get into the wrong. The Puseyites\r\nhave the most learning, or rather, have considered the points more\r\nrecently and more accurately than their opponents.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne hopes that the Spanish affair will be settled.\r\nLord Melbourne cannot doubt that the French are wrong. Even if the\r\nprecedents are in their favour, the Spanish Court has a right to\r\nsettle its own etiquette and its own mode of transacting business, and\r\nto change them if it thinks proper.[4]\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne was at Broadlands when the Article to which your\r\nMajesty alludes appeared in the _Morning Chronicle_, and he talked\r\nit over with Palmerston. He does not think that Palmerston wrote it,\r\nbecause there were in it errors, and those errors to Palmerston's\r\ndisadvantage; but it was written by Easthope under the impression that\r\nit conveyed Palmerston's notions and opinions. Your Majesty knows very\r\nwell that Palmerston has long had much communication with the _Morning\r\nChronicle_ and much influence over it, and has made great use of it\r\nfor the purpose of maintaining and defending his own policy. In this\r\nsort of matter there is much to be said upon both sides. A Minister\r\nhas a great advantage in stating his own views to the public, and if\r\nPalmerston in the Syrian affair had not had as devoted an assistant\r\nas the _Morning Chronicle_, he would hardly have been able to maintain\r\nhis course or carry through his measures. It has always been Lord\r\nMelbourne's policy to keep himself aloof from the public press and to\r\nhold it at arm's-length, and he considers it the best course, but\r\nit is subject to disadvantages. You are never in that case strongly\r\nsupported by them, nor are the motives and reasons of your conduct\r\ngiven to the public with that force and distinctness which they might\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne has no doubt that your Majesty's assurance is well\r\nfounded, and that the present Government are anxious for the welfare\r\nand prosperity and tranquillity of Spain. It cannot be otherwise.\r\n\r\nPalmerston dislikes Aberdeen and has a low opinion of him. He thinks\r\nhim weak and timid, and likely to let down the character and influence\r\nof the country. Your Majesty knows that Lord Melbourne does not\r\npartake these opinions, certainly not at least to anything like the\r\nextent to which Palmerston carries them.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is going down to Panshanger to-morrow, where he\r\nunderstands that he is to meet Lord and Lady Lansdowne and Lord and\r\nLady Leveson.[5] Lord Melbourne will take care and say nothing about\r\nBrighton, but is glad to hear that your Majesty is going thither.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: An Ambassador, M. de Salvandy, had been sent\r\n    from France to Madrid. Espartero, the Regent, required the\r\n    credentials to be presented to him and not to the young Queen.\r\n    The French Ambassador having refused to comply, an unseemly\r\n    dispute arose, and M. de Salvandy left Madrid.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: The late Lord Granville and his first wife,\r\n    only child of the Duc de Dalberg, and widow of Sir Ferdinand\r\n    Acton.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _18th January 1842._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR UNCLE,--Not to miss my day, I write a line to thank you for\r\nyour kind letters of the 10th and 13th, but shall write fully by the\r\nmessenger. Our Claremont trip was very enjoyable, only we missed Pussy\r\nso much; another time we shall take her with us; the dear child was\r\nso pleased to see us again, particularly dear Albert, whom she is _so_\r\nfond of.... We think of going to Brighton early in February, as the\r\nphysicians think it will do the children great good, and perhaps it\r\nmay _me_; for I am very strong as to fatigue and exertion, but not\r\nquite right otherwise; I am growing thinner, and there is a want of\r\ntone, which the sea may correct.\r\n\r\nAlbert's great _fonction_[6] yesterday went off beautifully, and he\r\nwas so much admired in all ways; he always _fascinates_ the people\r\nwherever he goes, by his very modest and unostentatious yet dignified\r\nways. He only came back at twelve last night; it was very kind of him\r\nto come. The King of Prussia means, I believe, to cross on the 20th.\r\nNow _addio_. Ever your most affectionate Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: The Prince laid the foundation stone of the new\r\n    Royal Exchange.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Duke of Wellington to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLONDON, _21st January 1842._\r\n\r\nField-Marshal the Duke of Wellington presents his humble duty to your\r\nMajesty.

He is in such good\r\nhealth, as to be able to perform any duty upon which your Majesty may\r\nthink proper to employ him; and he will attend your Majesty's gracious\r\nceremony at Windsor Castle on Tuesday morning, the 25th Jan. inst.\r\n\r\nAll of which is humbly submitted to your Majesty by your Majesty's\r\nmost dutiful and devoted Subject and Servant,\r\n\r\nWELLINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Melbourne._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _22nd January 1842._\r\n\r\nThe Queen cannot say _how grieved_ she is, and the Prince also, at\r\nhearing of Lord Melbourne's serious indisposition, by his letter this\r\nmorning. How _very_ provoking if he cannot come on Tuesday. It will\r\nbe the _only_ important ceremony during the Queen's reign which Lord\r\nMelbourne has _not_ been present at, and it grieves her _deeply_. It\r\nwas already a deep mortification not to see him in his old place, but\r\nnot to see him _at all_ is _too_ provoking. If Lord Melbourne should\r\nsoon get well we shall hope to see him later during the King's[7]\r\nstay. The Prince is gone to Greenwich to meet the King, and I expect\r\nthem about five o'clock.\r\n\r\nThe Queen hopes to hear soon of Lord Melbourne's being better, and\r\nexpresses again her very sincere regret at his being prevented from\r\ncoming.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: Frederick Wilham IV., King of Prussia.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE SLAVE TRADE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Aberdeen to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_28th January 1842._\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen presents his most humble duty to your Majesty. Some time\r\nago, your Majesty was graciously pleased to express a desire to have\r\na copy of the Treaty concluded by your Majesty with the Four Great\r\nPowers of Europe, for the more effectual suppression of the Slave\r\nTrade.[8] Lord Aberdeen has had one prepared for your Majesty's use,\r\nwhich he humbly begs to lay before your Majesty.\r\n\r\nIn obeying your Majesty's commands Lord Aberdeen thinks it his duty,\r\nat the same time, to state to your Majesty that, with the exception of\r\nsome alterations and additions of little importance, the Treaty in\r\nits present form had existed for a considerable time in the Foreign\r\nOffice. He found, also, that there had been a reluctance to sign it on\r\nthe part of the French Government; but as the objection was chiefly of\r\na personal nature, it was speedily removed. The only share, therefore,\r\nwhich Lord Aberdeen can properly be said to have had in this\r\ntransaction is that of having been enabled to afford your Majesty\r\nthe great satisfaction of completing this blessed work at an earlier\r\nperiod than would otherwise have been the case.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: The treaty conferred a mutual right of search.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _1st February 1842._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has to\r\nthank your Majesty for the letters of the 28th and the 31st ult., the\r\nlast of which he received this morning.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is very glad that your Majesty opens the Parliament\r\nin person. Your Majesty knows Lord Melbourne's opinion, that it ought\r\nalways to be done, when it can be, without reference to Ministers,\r\npolitics, or political questions. Lord Melbourne hopes to be able to\r\ngo to the House in the evening, but he fears that it would be too much\r\nfor him if he were to attempt to attend also in the morning.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne was in despair at hearing of poor Eos.[9] Favourites\r\noften get shot; Lord Melbourne has known it happen often in his time.\r\nThat is the worst of dogs; they add another strong interest to a life\r\nwhich has already of itself interest enough, and those, God knows!\r\nsufficiently subject both to accident and decay.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is sorry to do anything that could trouble your Majesty\r\nin the slightest degree, but he doubts not that your Majesty is\r\nalready aware of the matter, and therefore he has less scruple in\r\nsending to your Majesty a letter[10] which he has received from the\r\nDuke of Sussex. Upon the plea of not being well, Lord Melbourne has\r\nput off seeing the Duke upon this subject until after Monday next,\r\nand when he does see him, he will try to keep him quiet, which your\r\nMajesty knows when he has got a thing of this sort into his head, is\r\nno easy matter.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: A favourite greyhound of the Prince, accidentally\r\n    shot by Prince Ferdinand. _See_ King Leopold's letter, 4th\r\n    February.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 10: This letter is not preserved among the Queen's\r\n    papers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE KING OF PRUSSIA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _1st February 1842._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR UNCLE,--I have to thank you for a kind, short note of the 27th\r\ninst., which I received on Sunday. I gave your kind message to the\r\nKing of Prussia, who was much _touché_ by it. He is a most amiable\r\nman, so kind and well-meaning, and seems so much beloved. He is so\r\namusing too. He is very anxious that Belgium should become _liée_ with\r\nGermany, and I think, dearest Uncle, that it would be for the _real_\r\ngood of Belgium if it could be so. You will have heard how perfectly\r\nand splendidly everything went off on the 25th. Nothing could have\r\ndone better, and _little_ Albert (_what_ a pleasure that he has that\r\n_dearest_ name!) behaved so well. The King left us yesterday morning\r\nto go to town, where we follow him to-morrow; he was quite sad to\r\nleave Windsor, which he admired so much. He dined with the Sutherlands\r\nyesterday, and dines with the Duke of Wellington to-day, and the\r\nCambridges to-morrow. On Thursday he dines with us (he lodges in\r\nBuckingham Palace), and on Friday takes his departure. He is really a\r\nmost agreeable visitor, though I must own that I am somewhat knocked\r\nup by our great exertions.\r\n\r\nUncle Ferdinand is very well, and we are delighted with dear\r\nLeopold;[11] he is so much improved, and is such a modest, sensible\r\nboy.\r\n\r\nI can't say much for poor Gusti,[12] though I love him, but he is\r\nreally too odd and inanimate. I hope Louise will see the King of\r\nPrussia. You have heard our great misfortune about dear Eos; she is\r\ngoing on well, but slowly, and still makes us rather anxious. It made\r\nme quite ill the first day, and keeps me fidgety still, till we know\r\nthat she is quite safe.

I fear you had cold weather yesterday for the opening of\r\nParliament. To-day we have here a tremendous fog; Heaven grant that\r\nit may not be so heavy on the Thames! else the King's journey will be\r\nrendered difficult.\r\n\r\nWe expect him to-morrow about eleven o'clock; he wishes to be at\r\nAntwerp at five, which would indicate his departure from hence at\r\nthree o'clock. There can be no doubt that nothing could be better\r\nthan to link this country as much as possible to Germany. The public\r\nfeeling was and is still favourable to this, but in Germany some years\r\nago they were childishly ultra, and kicked us off most unnecessarily,\r\nwhich renders everything of the sort now much less easy. In a\r\npolitical point of view the King's journey will prove useful, as it\r\ntakes him still more out of the clutches of Russia and gives him more\r\n_correct_ views of what is going on in the West of Europe.\r\n\r\nI wish the King may also talk to his helter-skelter cousin in Holland;\r\nif the man goes on in his wild intrigues, though he will get most\r\nprobably nothing by it _himself_, he may do a great deal of harm,\r\nand may force us to incline more towards France for fear of _his_\r\nintrigues with France.\r\n\r\nI was extremely sorry to hear the accident which befell dear Eos, a\r\ngreat friend of mine. I do not understand how your uncle managed it;\r\nhe ought rather to have shot somebody else of the family. Ernest\r\nhas then been going on fast enough; all I hear of the lady is very\r\nsatisfactory.[14] I don't yet know when he means to come here.\r\n\r\nNow I must conclude. In haste, ever, my dear Victoria, your\r\naffectionate Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 13: Lord Aberdeen wrote to Madame de Lieven: \"I\r\n    passed a great deal of time with the King of Prussia when he\r\n    was in this country, and perfectly subscribe to the truth\r\n    of the description you gave me of him before his\r\n    arrival--intelligent, high-minded, and sincere. Like all\r\n    Germans, he is sometimes a little in the clouds, but his\r\n    projects are generous, and he wishes to do what is right.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 14: He married the Princess Alexandrina of Baden on\r\n    3rd May 1842.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _8th February 1842._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I thank you _de tout mon c[oe]ur_ for your kind\r\nletter of the 4th, which I received the day before yesterday. You\r\nhave now seen our good, kind, amiable King of Prussia, for whom I have\r\nreally the greatest affection and respect. We were quite sorry to lose\r\nhim, and he was much affected at going. He is so open and natural, and\r\nseems really so anxious to do good whenever he can. His liberality and\r\ngenerosity here has been immense. He is very much displeased with his\r\n\"helter-skelter cousin,\"[15] and quite unhappy at the state of things\r\nin that country....\r\n\r\nErnest's marriage is a _great, great delight_ to us; thank God! I say,\r\nas I so ardently wished it, and Alexandrina is said to be really _so_\r\nperfect. I have begged Ernest beforehand to pass his honeymoon with\r\nus, and I beg you to urge him to do it; for he witnessed our first\r\nhappiness, and we must therefore witness his.\r\n\r\nLeopold is a dear, sweet boy, really, so full of feeling, and so very\r\ngood-tempered and modest; the King was charmed with him and he with\r\nthe King. I am happy to say faithful Eos is quite convalescent; she\r\nwalks about wrapped up in flannel.\r\n\r\nWe are off for Brighton the day after to-morrow; I can't say I _like_\r\nit at all. We were, and the boy too, all three, vaccinated from the\r\nsame child yesterday! Now adieu!

I hardly dare to\r\nexpect it, but it will make me very happy should you be able to fulfil\r\nyour kind intention.\r\n\r\nI was happy to hear how well the holy ceremony went off on Tuesday,\r\nand how splendid the whole was. The earnest attention of the King\r\nof Prussia to the ceremony, and the manner with which he read the\r\nresponses, was universally remarked and admired. May your dear child,\r\nour beloved Prince of Wales, follow his pious example in future, and\r\nbecome as truly estimable and amiable and good as his Godfather really\r\nis. He is indeed most charming, and so very agreeable and affable to\r\nevery one, that he must be loved and respected by all who have the\r\ngood fortune to approach him. I hope he does not over-fatigue himself,\r\nfor he does a great deal in the short time of his stay in England.

I have the\r\nhonour to be, Sir, with sincere respect, your Royal Highness's most\r\nfaithful and humble servant,\r\n\r\nROBERT PEEL.\r\n\r\n_P.S._--I do not think that the measure which I have brought forward\r\nfor the diminution of the duties on the import of foreign corn, will\r\ndeprive us of any portion of the support or goodwill of our friends.\r\nMany wish that the reduction had not been carried so far, but almost\r\nall are aware of the consequences of rejecting or obstructing the\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: AFGHANISTAN]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord Fitzgerald and Vesci to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nINDIA BOARD, _1st March 1842._\r\n\r\nLord Fitzgerald, with his most humble duty to your Majesty, requests\r\npermission humbly to submit to your Majesty, that the communications\r\nreceived yesterday at the India House present a dark and alarming\r\npicture of the position and danger of the British troops in\r\nAfghanistan.[16]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Governor-General's despatch announcing these melancholy\r\ntidings also states that no strictly official intelligence had reached\r\nhim from Cabul, yet the opinion of Lord Auckland evidently is, that\r\nthe reports on which his despatch is founded are but too likely to be\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nFrom them it would appear that a numerous and excited native\r\npopulation had succeeded in intercepting all supplies, that the army\r\nat Cabul laboured under severe privations, and that in consequence of\r\nthe strict investment of the cantonments by the enemy, there remained,\r\naccording to a letter from the late Sir William Macnaghten to an\r\nofficer with Sir Robert Sale's force, only three days' provision in\r\nthe camp.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances it can perhaps be but faintly hoped that any\r\ndegree of gallantry and devotion on the part of your Majesty's forces\r\ncan have extricated them from the difficulties by which they were\r\nencompassed on every side.\r\n\r\nCapitulation had been spoken of, and it may, unhappily, have become\r\ninevitable, as the relieving column, expected from Candahar, had been\r\ncompelled by the severity of an unusual season to retrace its march.\r\n\r\nThe despatches from Calcutta being voluminous, and embracing minute\r\nunofficial reports, Lord Fitzgerald has extracted and copied those\r\nparts which relate to the military operations in Afghanistan, and most\r\nhumbly submits them to your Majesty.\r\n\r\nHe at the same time solicits permission to annex a _précis_ of some\r\nof the most important of the private letters which have been forwarded\r\nfrom India; and, as your Majesty was graciously pleased to peruse\r\nwith interest some passages from the first journal of Lady Sale, Lord\r\nFitzgerald ventures to add the further extracts, transmitted by Lord\r\nAuckland, in which Lady Sale describes successive actions with the\r\nenemy, and paints the state of the sufferings of the army, as late as\r\nthe 9th of December.\r\n\r\nNothing contained in any of these communications encourages the\r\nhope of Sir Alexander Burnes's safety. In one letter the death of\r\nan individual is mentioned, who is described as the assassin of that\r\nlamented officer.\r\n\r\nAll of which is most humbly submitted to your Majesty by your\r\nMajesty's most dutiful Subject and Servant,\r\n\r\nFITZGERALD AND VESCI.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16: _See_ Introductory Note, _ante_, pp. 254, 370.\r\n     (Intro Note to Ch.

It rained very much\r\nall Monday evening at Portsmouth, but, nevertheless, we visited the\r\n_St Vincent_ and the _Royal George_ yacht, and the Prince went all\r\nover the Dockyards.\r\n\r\nIt stormed and rained all night, and rained when we set off on bord\r\nthe _Black Eagle_ (the _Firebrand_ that was) for Spithead on Tuesday\r\nmorning; it, however, got quite fine when we got there, and we went on\r\nboard the _Queen_, and a glorious sight it was; she is a magnificent\r\nship, so wide and roomy, and though only just commissioned, in the\r\nbest order. With marines, etc., her crew is near upon a thousand men!\r\nWe saw the men at dinner, and tasted the grog and soup, which pleased\r\nthem very much. Old Sir Edward Owen is very proud of her.\r\n\r\nIt was a great pleasure for the Queen to be at sea again, and not a\r\ncreature _thought_ even of being sick. The saluting of all those\r\ngreat ships in the harbour at once, as we came out and returned, has a\r\nsplendid effect.\r\n\r\nThe Queen was also much pleased at seeing four of the crew of the\r\n_Emerald_ again whom she knew so well _nine years_ ago! The Prince was\r\ndelighted with all he saw, as were also our Uncle and Cousins; these\r\nlast, we are sorry to say, leave us on Monday,--and we go up to Town\r\non Tuesday, where the Queen hopes to see Lord Melbourne soon.\r\n\r\nThe Queen sends Lord Melbourne a letter from the Queen of Portugal,\r\nall which tends to show how _wrong_ it is to _think_ that they connive\r\nat the restoration of the Charter....\r\n\r\nLady Dunmore is in waiting, and makes an excellent Lady-in-Waiting.\r\nLord Hardwicke the Queen likes very much, he seems so straightforward.\r\nHe took the greatest care of the Queen when on board ship.\r\n\r\nWas not his father drowned at Spithead or Portsmouth?[17]\r\n\r\nThe Queen hopes to hear that Lord Melbourne is very well.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 17: \"His father, Sir Joseph Yorke,\" Lord Melbourne\r\n    replied, \"was drowned in the Southampton River, off Netley\r\n    Abbey, when sailing for pleasure.

Our dear Uncle and dear Cousins have\r\njust left us, and we are very sorry to see them go; for the longer one\r\nis together the more intimate one gets, and they were quite become as\r\nbelonging to us, and were so quiet and unassuming, that we shall\r\nmiss them much, particularly dear Leopold, whom poor Uncle Ferdinand\r\nrecommended to my especial care, and therefore am really very anxious\r\nthat we should settle something for his _future_. Uncle Ferdinand\r\nlikes the idea of his passing some time at Brussels, and some time\r\nhere, very much, and I hope we may be able to settle that. Uncle and\r\nCousins were sorry to go.\r\n\r\nYou will have heard how well our Portsmouth expedition went off; the\r\nsea was quite smooth on Tuesday, and we had a delightful visit to\r\nthe _Queen_, which is a splendid ship. I think it is in these immense\r\nwooden walls that our real greatness exists, and I am proud to think\r\nthat no _other_ nation _can_ equal us in _this_....\r\n\r\nNow _addio!_ Ever your most affectionate Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE FALL OF CABUL]\r\n\r\n_Lord Fitzgerald and Vesci to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_10th March 1842._\r\n\r\nLord Fitzgerald, with his most humble duty to your Majesty, begs leave\r\nmost humbly and with deep sorrow to lay before your Majesty reports\r\nwhich he has only within this hour received.\r\n\r\nThey are to be found in a despatch from the Governor and Council of\r\nBombay, and unhappily confirm, to an appalling degree, the disastrous\r\nintelligence from Afghanistan. The commercial expresses, which reached\r\nLondon yesterday, gave to the public some of the details of the fall\r\nof Cabul; and Lord Fitzgerald laments that it is his painful duty most\r\nhumbly to inform your Majesty that the despatches just arrived confirm\r\nto their full extent the particulars of Sir William Macnaghten's fate,\r\nand of the fate of that remnant of gallant men who, on the faith of\r\na capitulation, had evacuated that cantonment which they had defended\r\nwith unavailing courage.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the despatch from the Council of Bombay, Lord\r\nFitzgerald humbly ventures to submit to your Majesty a letter\r\naddressed to him by Mr Anderson, the Acting-Governor of that\r\nPresidency, with further details of these melancholy events.\r\n\r\nThe despatches from the Governor-General of India come down to the\r\ndate of the 22nd of January (three days previous to the tragical death\r\nof Sir William Macnaghten). Lord Auckland was then uninformed of the\r\nactual state of the force in Cabul, though not unprepared for severe\r\nreverses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE GARTER]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir Robert Peel to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWHITEHALL, _20th March 1842._\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and will\r\ntake an opportunity to-morrow of ascertaining your Majesty's pleasure\r\nwith respect to the remaining Garter which still remains undisposed\r\nof, as your Majesty may probably think it advisable that the\r\nInvestiture of all the Knights selected for the vacant Garters should\r\ntake place at the same time.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel humbly represents to your Majesty that those Peers who\r\nmay severally be considered from their rank and station candidates\r\nfor this high distinction, have behaved very well in respect to it,\r\nas since Sir Robert Peel has had the honour of serving your Majesty he\r\nhas never received, excepting in the cases of the Duke of Buckingham\r\nand recently of Lord Cardigan, a direct application on the subject of\r\nthe Garter.\r\n\r\nOf those who from their position and rank in the Peerage, and from\r\nthe Garter having been heretofore conferred on their ancestors or\r\nrelations, may be regarded as competitors, the principal appear to Sir\r\nRobert Peel to be the following:--\r\n\r\n  The Duke of Cleveland\r\n  The Duke of Montrose\r\n  The Marquis of Hertford\r\n  The Marquis of Bute\r\n  The Marquis of Abercorn\r\n  The Marquis Camden\r\n  The Marquis of Londonderry.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel names all, without meaning to imply that the\r\npretensions of all are very valid ones. He would humbly represent for\r\nyour Majesty's consideration, whether on account of rank, fortune and\r\ngeneral character and station in the country, the claims of the Duke\r\nof Cleveland do not upon the whole predominate.[18]\r\n\r\nHis Grace is very much mortified and disappointed at Sir Robert Peel's\r\nhaving humbly advised your Majesty to apply the general rule against\r\nthe son's succeeding the father immediately in the Lieutenancy of a\r\ncounty to his case in reference to his county of Durham.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel thinks it better to write to your Majesty upon\r\nthis subject, as your Majesty may wish to have an opportunity of\r\nconsidering it.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18: The Garter was conferred on the Duke of\r\n    Cleveland.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE EARL OF MUNSTER]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN AND THE INCOME TAX]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _21st March 1842._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. A letter from\r\nCharles Fox to Lady Holland, and which she has sent to me, informs me\r\nof the shocking end of Munster,[19] which your Majesty will have heard\r\nlong before you receive this. Charles Fox attributes it entirely to\r\nthe vexatious and uneasy life which he led with Lady Munster, but he\r\nwas always, as your Majesty knows, an unhappy and discontented man,\r\nand there is something in that unfortunate condition of illegitimacy\r\nwhich seems to distort the mind and feelings and render them incapable\r\nof justice or contentment.\r\n\r\nIt is not impossible that upon this event application may be made to\r\nyour Majesty for the continuance of the pension upon the Privy Purse\r\nto his son. As Lord Melbourne advised your Majesty to continue these\r\npensions upon the late King's death, perhaps it may not be improper\r\nthat he should now say that it is his strong opinion that they should\r\nnot be continued further. There is no reason for it. They are not\r\nvery rich, but neither are they poor, and they have very opulent\r\nconnections and relations. It appears to me that the first opportunity\r\nshould be taken to show that it is not your Majesty's intention\r\nto charge the Crown with the maintenance and support of all these\r\nfamilies, which will otherwise be the case. Lord Melbourne thinks\r\nit not improper to mention this matter thus early, as otherwise the\r\n[compassionate] feelings naturally raised by such an event might lead\r\nto a different determination.\r\n\r\nThere is another matter mentioned in your Majesty's letter, relating\r\nto money, which is of considerable importance, and that is the\r\ndetermination taken by your Majesty to subject your own provision\r\nto the proposed duty on income. When it was put to your Majesty Lord\r\nMelbourne is disposed to think that your Majesty's determination[20]\r\nwas right, and it certainly will be very popular, which in the present\r\ncircumstances of the country and state of public feelings is a great\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it is giving up a principle of the Constitution,\r\nwhich has hitherto exempted the Sovereign from all direct taxation,\r\nand there are very great doubts entertained whether the announcement\r\nto Parliament of the intention was not in a constitutional point of\r\nview objectionable, inasmuch as it pronounced the opinion of the\r\nCrown upon a tax which was still under discussion. It is also a great\r\npecuniary sacrifice, and, as your Majesty says, together with the loss\r\nof the Duchy of Cornwall and other revenues, will make a great change\r\nin your Majesty's pecuniary circumstances. These defalcations can only\r\nbe repaired by care and economy. Your Majesty has all the most right\r\nfeelings and the best judgment about money, and Lord Melbourne has\r\nno doubt that your Majesty will so act as to avoid pecuniary\r\nembarrassment--the only difficulty which Lord Melbourne fears for your\r\nMajesty, and the only contingency which could involve your Majesty in\r\nserious personal inconvenience.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne thanks your Majesty much for the kindness of your\r\nletter....\r\n\r\nEverybody says that the marriage between Miss Stuart and Lord\r\nWaterford[21] is likely to take place. It is said that he would do\r\nalmost anything rather than go to St. Petersburg. Lord Melbourne has\r\nnot seen Lord Waterford, but he is said to be very good-looking; we\r\nknow him to be rich and of high rank, and, after all, that sort of\r\ncharacter is not disliked by all ladies. Perhaps also she counts\r\nupon the effect of her influence to soften, to tranquillise, and to\r\nrestrain.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne hears a very bad account of Lord Anglesey's affairs.\r\nHis case is a hard one, for these pecuniary difficulties are owing to\r\nthe extravagance of others, and by no means to his own. Lord Melbourne\r\nsaw Uxbridge and Ellen at Lady Palmerston's on Saturday evening. The\r\nlatter seemed in good spirits, and said that she did not mean to shut\r\nherself up too closely in Hertfordshire.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne thought that your Majesty would be pleased with\r\nLambeth. The view from the great window in the drawing-room over the\r\nriver, and to the Houses of Parliament and the Abbey, is very fine\r\nindeed, but like all London views can rarely be seen in consequence of\r\nthe foggy atmosphere....\r\n\r\nNo doubt your Majesty and His Royal Highness must be anxious for a\r\nlittle quiet and repose, which Lord Melbourne hopes that your Majesty\r\nwill enjoy. Lord Melbourne had feared that your Majesty's health was\r\nnot quite so good as it appeared.... Lord Melbourne concludes this\r\nvery long letter with the most fervent expression of his most sincere\r\nwishes for your Majesty's health and happiness.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne in speaking of poor Lord Munster forgot to mention that\r\nat the Levée on Wednesday last he followed Lord Melbourne down the\r\nlong gallery as he was going away, came up to him with great emotion\r\nof manner, pressed his hand warmly, and said that he wished to take\r\nthe earliest opportunity of thanking Lord Melbourne for all the\r\nkindness he had shown him whilst he had been in office.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 19: The Earl of Munster, son of William IV. and Mrs.\r\n    Jordan, shot himself, 20th March.

He is much\r\nrejoiced to learn that your Majesty has had fine weather and has\r\nenjoyed it. It rained here hard yesterday in the morning, but cleared\r\nup about half-past twelve and was very fine indeed. Lord Melbourne\r\nwent over to Brocket Hall and enjoyed it much. He does not intend\r\nto return to London until Monday next, when the House of Lords\r\nreassembles. It is to be hoped that we shall then soon have the Corn\r\nBill up from the Commons and pass it. The Income Tax will give some\r\ntrouble, but that done, and the Poor Law Bill, the end of the Session\r\nmay begin to be looked forward to.\r\n\r\nThe sale of Strawberry Hill[22] naturally excites interest, and things\r\nare not unlikely to be sold high. The collection has after all\r\nbeen kept together, and the place has remained in the family of his\r\nniece,[23] the Duchess of Gloucester, to whom he bequeathed it, longer\r\nthan he himself expected. He says in one of his letters that he would\r\nsend a statue down to Linton, Sir Horace Mann's place in Kent, because\r\nthere it had a better chance of remaining permanently, \"for as to this\r\npoor bauble of a place,\" he adds, \"it will be knocked to pieces in a\r\nvery few years after my decease.\" It has stood, however, and remained\r\nfive-and-forty years, a longer period than he had anticipated. Some\r\nof the works, such as the bell by Benvenuto Cellini, and the antique\r\nEagle, are very fine; others are only curious. Lord Melbourne would\r\nnot give much money for a mere curiosity, unless there were also some\r\nintrinsic merits or beauty.\r\n\r\nWhat is the value of Cardinal Wolsey's cap, for instance? It was not\r\ndifferent from that of any other Cardinal, and a Cardinal's cap is no\r\ngreat wonder.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne returns Lord Munster's letter. It is without date, but\r\nwas evidently written in contemplation of the dreadful act which he\r\nafterwards perpetrated. It is very melancholy. Lord Melbourne\r\nwas certain that your Majesty would send to Lord Adolphus[24] the\r\nassurance which you have done, and that you would be anxious to assist\r\nhis children, and promote their interests by every means in your\r\npower. But both their brothers and they must be made sensible that\r\nthey must make some effort for themselves.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is very glad to learn that your Majesty intends to\r\noffer the Round Tower[25] to the Duke of Sussex. It is in every\r\nrespect kind. It will be of essential service to him, and it will\r\ngratify him most exceedingly.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne thinks that your Majesty's decision respecting the\r\nGoverness[26] is right. It should be a lady of rank; but that she\r\nshould be a woman of sense and discretion, and capable of fulfilling\r\nthe duties of the office, is of more importance than whether she is a\r\nDuchess, a Marchioness, or a Countess. The selection is difficult, but\r\nif your Majesty can find a person, it would not be well to consider\r\neither high or low rank as a disqualification.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne intends to take advantage of his freedom from the\r\nrestraints of office in order to see a little of the bloom of spring\r\nand summer, which he has missed for so many years. He has got one or\r\ntwo horses, which he likes well enough, and has begun to ride again a\r\nlittle. Lord Melbourne wishes your Majesty much of the same enjoyment,\r\ntogether with all health, happiness, and prosperity.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 22: Near Twickenham, formerly the residence of\r\n    Horace Walpole, and filled with his collection of pictures and\r\n    _objets de vertu_.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 23: The Duke of Gloucester, brother of George\r\n    III., married in 1766 Maria, Countess-Dowager Waldegrave,\r\n    illegitimate daughter of Sir Edward Walpole, and niece of\r\n    Horace Walpole.

Your Majesty may depend upon it\r\nthat Lord Melbourne will do everything in his power to discourage and\r\nrestrain factious and vexatious opposition, not only on account of\r\nyour Majesty's wish, but because he disapproves it as much as your\r\nMajesty can possibly do. But everything in his power he fears is but\r\nlittle. The leaders of a party, or those who are so called, have but\r\nlittle sway over their followers, particularly when not in Government,\r\nand when they have it not in their power to threaten them with\r\nany very serious consequences, such as the dissolution of the\r\nAdministration. Mr Pulteney, afterwards Earl of Bath, is reported to\r\nhave said that political parties were like snakes, guided not by their\r\nheads, but by their tails. Lord Melbourne does not know whether this\r\nis true of the snake, but it is certainly so of the party. The conduct\r\nof the Opposition upon the resolution respecting the Income Tax is\r\nrendered peculiarly ridiculous by the result. They forcibly put it off\r\nuntil after the holidays, and then upon the first day of the meeting\r\nthey vote it without a division. What is this but admitting that they\r\nlooked to a movement in the country which they have not been able to\r\ncreate? Moreover, all Oppositions that Lord Melbourne has ever seen\r\nare more or less factious. The Opposition of Mr Fox to Mr Pitt was the\r\nleast so, but these were great men, greater than any that exist at\r\nthe present day, although Lord Melbourne is by no means inclined to\r\ndepreciate his own times. The factiousness of one Opposition naturally\r\nproduces the same in the next. They say, \"They did so to us; why\r\nshould we not do so to them?\" Your Majesty may rest assured that\r\nLord Melbourne will do everything he can to prevent delay, and to\r\naccelerate the transaction of the public business.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne sends a letter which he has received this morning from\r\nthe Duke of Sussex, and which expresses very right and proper feeling.\r\nLord Melbourne has written in reply that, \"Your Majesty was no doubt\r\ninfluenced principally by your natural affection for him, and by your\r\nsense of the generosity of his conduct towards Lord Munster, but that\r\nif any thought of Lord Melbourne intervened, your Majesty could not\r\nhave given a higher or a more acceptable proof of your approbation and\r\nregard.\"\r\n\r\nThe Garters[27] seem to Lord Melbourne to be given well enough. Your\r\nMajesty's feelings upon the subject are most kind and amiable. But\r\nthese things cannot be helped, and it is upon the whole advantageous\r\nthat each party should have their portion of patronage and honours.\r\nIf there is very distinguished service, the Garter should be bestowed\r\nupon it. Otherwise, in Lord Melbourne's opinion, it is better given\r\nto noblemen of high rank and great property. The chapter in\r\nEcclesiasticus, read in St George's Chapel on Obiit Sunday, well\r\ndescribes those who ought to have it, with the exception of those \"who\r\nfind out musical tunes.\" Lord Melbourne does not think it well given\r\nto Ministers. It is always then subject to the imputation of their\r\ngiving it to themselves, and pronouncing an approbation of their own\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne hopes that the Pope's standing sponsor for the young\r\nPrince of Portugal is a sign of complete reconciliation with the See\r\nof Rome. It is a very awkward thing for a Roman Catholic Government to\r\nbe at variance with the Pope. He is still a very ugly customer.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is very much concerned to hear of the Baron's[28]\r\nillness--very much indeed; he is an excellent and most valuable man,\r\nwith one of the soundest and coolest judgments that Lord Melbourne has\r\never met with. Your Majesty knows that Lord Melbourne has never had\r\na favourable opinion of his health. There seems to be about him a\r\nsettled weakness of the stomach, which is in fact the seat of health,\r\nstrength, thought and life. Lord Melbourne sees that a great physician\r\nsays that Napoleon lost the battle of Leipsic in consequence of some\r\nvery greasy soup which he ate the day before, and which clouded his\r\njudgment and obscured his perceptions.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is very glad to hear that your Majesty has amused\r\nyourself so well in the country, and is not surprised that you are\r\nunwilling to quit it. He means himself to see a little of the coming\r\nin of the spring, which he has not done for many years.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 27: The recipients had been the King of Saxony,\r\n    the Duke of Beaufort, the Duke of Buckingham, the Marquess of\r\n    Salisbury, the Duke of Cleveland.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 28: Baron Stockmar.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: A BRILLIANT BALL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _19th April 1842._\r\n\r\nDEAREST UNCLE,--I am so sorry to see by your kind letter of the\r\n15th that you are all so _enrhumés_, but hear to-day from Vecto that\r\nCharlotte is quite well again. I am quite bewildered with all the\r\narrangements for our _bal costumé_, which I wish you could see; we are\r\nto be Edward III. and Queen Philippa, and a great number of our Court\r\nto be dressed like the people in those times, and very correctly, so\r\nas to make a grand _Aufzug_; but there is such asking, and so many\r\nsilks and drawings and crowns, and God knows what, to look at, that I,\r\nwho hate being troubled about dress, am quite _confuse_.\r\n\r\nTo get a little rest we mean to run down to Claremont with the\r\nchildren from Friday to Monday. My last ball was very splendid, and I\r\nhave a concert on Monday next....\r\n\r\nI hope Ernest and dear Alexandrine will come in June, and stay some\r\ntime _quietly_ with us in the country. I saw another beautiful letter\r\nof hers, so well and sensibly and religiously written, it would have\r\npleased you. Now adieu!

Lord Melbourne has\r\nbeen so much occupied with the debates in the House of Lords during\r\nthe last two days, that he has ventured to put off replying to your\r\nMajesty's letters, which he trusts that your Majesty will excuse.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne did not leave the ball until ten minutes after one, and\r\nas there were so many persons there, which Lord Melbourne thinks quite\r\nright and was very glad to see, Lord Melbourne had little hope of\r\nseeing your Majesty again, and therefore ventured to take advantage of\r\nhaving ordered his carriage at half-past twelve and of its having\r\ncome at the time that it was ordered. It was a very brilliant and very\r\nbeautiful and a very gay ball.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is very sorry to be obliged to express his fear that\r\nyour Majesty will prove more in the right than he was about the\r\nduration of Parliament. There will be much debate in the Committee\r\nupon the details of the Income Tax, and the discussions upon the\r\nTariff of duties, which affects so many interests, are likely to be\r\nvery long indeed. There is one good thing in the House of Lords, and\r\nthat is that it never much delays or obstructs public business....\r\n\r\nAs Lord Melbourne drove down the Park on Saturday evening last to dine\r\nwith his sister, he could see clearly into your Majesty's room, so\r\nas to be able to distinguish the pictures, tables, etc., the candles\r\nbeing lighted and the curtains not drawn. Your Majesty was just\r\nsetting off for the Opera.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PRINCE ALBERT AND THE ARMY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Sir Robert Peel._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _20th April 1842._\r\n\r\nThe Queen encloses the Prince's letter to Sir Robert Peel, containing\r\nhis acceptance of the Guards. At the same time, both the Prince and\r\nQueen feel much regret at the Prince's leaving the 11th, which is,\r\nif possible, enhanced by seeing the Regiment out to-day, which is\r\nin beautiful order. It was, besides, the Regiment which escorted the\r\nPrince from Dover to Canterbury on his arrival in England in February\r\n'40. The Queen fears, indeed knows, that Lord Cardigan will be deeply\r\nmortified at the Prince's leaving the Regiment, and that it will have\r\nthe effect of appearing like another slight to him; therefore, the\r\nQueen much wishes that at some fit opportunity[29] a mark of favour\r\nshould be bestowed upon him....\r\n\r\nThe Queen hopes Sir Robert will think of this.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 29: Lord Cardigan was promoted Major-General in\r\n    1847.

Lord Melbourne learns with the\r\ngreatest satisfaction that Lady Lyttelton has undertaken the important\r\nand interesting charge, for which she is so well fitted. Lord\r\nMelbourne is most sincerely of opinion that no other person so well\r\nqualified could have been selected. Lord Melbourne will keep the\r\nmatter strictly secret; he has not yet mentioned it to any one, nor\r\nhas he heard it mentioned by any other person, which, as it must be\r\nknown to some, rather surprises him. Unreserved approbation cannot\r\nbe expected for anything, but when it is known, Lord Melbourne\r\nanticipates that it will meet with as general an assent as could be\r\nanticipated for a choice in which all the community will take, and\r\nindeed have, so deep an interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: GOETHE AND SCHILLER]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nBROCKET HALL, _15th May 1842._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. He is\r\nvery sorry indeed, and entreats your Majesty's pardon for his great\r\nomission on Monday evening. He was never told that he was to pass\r\nbefore your Majesty at the beginning; at the same time he admits\r\nthat it was a blundering piece of stupidity not to find this out of\r\nhimself. After this he never saw the glimmer of a chance of being able\r\nto get near to your Majesty.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne wonders much who could have whispered to your Majesty\r\nthat he felt or expressed anything but the most unqualified admiration\r\nof the ball, which was the most magnificent and beautiful spectacle\r\nthat he ever beheld. Lord Melbourne also believes it to be very\r\npopular, for the reasons which your Majesty mentions.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty having generally chosen handsome and attractive girls for\r\nthe Maids of Honour, which is very right, must expect to lose them in\r\nthis way. Lord Melbourne is very glad of the marriage. Lord Emlyn[30]\r\nalways seemed to him a very pleasing young man, and well calculated to\r\nmake a woman happy.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne felt quite sure that there had been a mistake about Ben\r\nStanley, which was the reason that he mentioned his name. He is sorry\r\nthat he has made a fool of himself by writing. Having had so much to\r\ndo with invitations during the two last years, he was not altogether\r\nunnaturally mortified to find himself not invited there.[31] Stanley\r\nis not a man to whom Lord Melbourne is very partial, but we must give\r\nevery one his due. Lord Melbourne always discourages to the utmost of\r\nhis power the notion of any one's having a right or claim to be asked,\r\nwhich notion, however, has a strong possession of the minds of people\r\nin general.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is come down here again, being determined to see this\r\nspring thoroughly and completely. His feelings are like those, so\r\nbeautifully described by Schiller, of Max Piccolomini,[32] when, after\r\na youth passed entirely in war, he for the first time sees a country\r\nwhich has enjoyed the blessings of peace. The Germans seem to Lord\r\nMelbourne generally to prefer Goethe to Schiller, a decision which\r\nsurprises him, although he feels that he has no right to dictate to\r\na people, of whose language he does not understand a word, their\r\njudgment upon their own authors. But the one, Schiller, seems to him\r\nto be all truth, clearness, nature and beauty; the other, principally\r\nmysticism, obscurity, and unintelligibility.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne intends to return on Wednesday, and will have the\r\nhonour and pleasure of waiting upon your Majesty on Thursday.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 30: The second Earl Cawdor, who married Miss Sarah\r\n    Mary Cavendish.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 31: Edward John, afterwards second Lord Stanley of\r\n    Alderley, was nicknamed Ben, after \"Sir Benjamin Backbite.\"\r\n    He had mentioned to Lord Melbourne that he was disappointed at\r\n    not receiving an invitation to the Royal Ball.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 32: In the Wallenstein Trilogy.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _20th May 1842._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST VICTORIA,--I found here yesterday a very long and dear\r\nletter from your august hand, which made me very happy. Your _fête_\r\nI believe to have been most probably one of the most splendid _ever_\r\ngiven. There is hardly a country where so much magnificence exists;\r\nAustria has some of the means, but the Court is not elegant from its\r\nnature.

Sir Robert Peel humbly submits his opinion to your Majesty that\r\nMr Landseer's eminence as an artist would fully justify his having\r\nthe honour of Knighthood, and would not give any legitimate ground of\r\ncomplaint to any other artist on account of a similar distinction not\r\nbeing conferred on him.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel proposes therefore to write to Mr Landseer on the\r\nsubject, as your Majesty's opinion appears to be in favour of his name\r\nappearing with the others, should he wish for the distinction....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Melbourne._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _28th May 1842._\r\n\r\nThe Queen is quite vexed at having been quite unable to write to Lord\r\nMelbourne sooner, but we have been so occupied that she could not. She\r\nwas so vexed too to have not had her head turned the other way when\r\nshe met him yesterday, but she was looking at the Prince, her Uncle,\r\nand Cousins riding, and only turned to see Lord Melbourne's groom whom\r\nshe instantly recognised, but too late, alas! The Queen spent a\r\nvery merry, happy birthday at dear old Claremont, and we finished by\r\ndancing in the gallery. She was grieved Lord Melbourne could not be\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nWe have got our dear Uncle Mensdorff[33] and his four sons here, which\r\nis a great happiness to us. Dear Uncle (who Lord Melbourne is aware is\r\na _most_ distinguished officer) is a delightful and amiable old man,\r\nand the sons are all so nice and amiable and kind and good; Lord\r\nMelbourne remembers seeing Alexander here in 1839, and that the\r\nQueen was very partial to him. The two eldest and the youngest--Hugo,\r\nAlphonse, and Arthur--are all amiable, though none near so\r\ngood-looking, but so very well brought up and so unassuming. The\r\nsecond is very clever. And it is quite beautiful to see the love the\r\nfather has for his sons, and _vice versâ_--and the affection the four\r\nbrothers have for one another; this is so rarely seen that it does\r\none's heart good to witness it. The Queen has appointed the Duchess of\r\nNorfolk in Lady Lyttelton's place, and intends appointing Lady Canning\r\nin Lady Dalhousie's, who has resigned from ill-health.\r\n\r\nLady Lyttelton _is_ established here in her new office, and does\r\neverything admirably.\r\n\r\nThe Queen must conclude here as she has got so much to do--hoping Lord\r\nMelbourne is well.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 33: _See_ p. 97.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LANDSEER DECLINES KNIGHTHOOD]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir Robert Peel to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWHITEHALL, _31st May 1842._\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel, with his humble duty to your Majesty, begs leave to\r\nacquaint your Majesty, that he has just seen Mr Landseer.\r\n\r\nMr Landseer repeated his expressions of deep and sincere gratitude for\r\nthe favour and kindness with which your Majesty had contemplated\r\nhis claims for professional distinction, but appeared to retain the\r\nimpression that he had yet scarcely done enough to entitle him to the\r\nhonour which it was contemplated to bestow upon him.\r\n\r\nIn the course of conversation he observed that he was now occupied\r\nupon works of a more important character than any that he had yet\r\ncompleted, and mentioned particularly an equestrian portrait of your\r\nMajesty. He said that when these works were finished, and should they\r\nprove successful and meet with your Majesty's approbation, he might\r\nfeel himself better entitled to receive a mark of your Majesty's\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\nAs these were evidently his sincere impressions and wishes, Sir Robert\r\nPeel forbore from pressing upon him the immediate acceptance of the\r\nhonour of Knighthood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: ATTEMPT ON THE QUEEN]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: JOHN FRANCIS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _31st May 1842._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE.--I wish to be the first to inform you of what\r\nhappened yesterday evening, and to tell you that we are _saines et\r\nsauves_. On returning from the chapel on Sunday, Albert was observing\r\nhow civil the people were, and then suddenly turned to me and said it\r\nappeared to him as though a man had held out a pistol to the carriage,\r\nand that it had hung fire; accordingly, when we came home he mentioned\r\nit to Colonel Arbuthnot, who was only to tell it to Sir J. Graham and\r\nSir Robert Peel, and have the police instructed, and _nobody else_.\r\nNo one, however, who was with us, such as footmen, etc., had seen\r\nanything at all. Albert began to doubt what he believed he had seen.\r\nWell, yesterday morning (Monday) a lad came to Murray[34] (who of\r\ncourse knew nothing) and said that he saw a man in the crowd as\r\nwe came home from church, present a pistol to the carriage, which,\r\nhowever, did not go off, and heard the man say, \"Fool that I was not\r\nto fire!\" The man then vanished, and this boy followed another man\r\n(an old man) up St James's Street who repeated twice, \"How very\r\nextraordinary!\" but instead of saying anything to the police, asked\r\nthe boy for his direction and disappeared. The boy accordingly was\r\nsent to Sir Robert Peel, and (doubtful as it all still was) every\r\nprecaution was taken, still keeping the thing completely secret, not\r\na soul in the house knowing a word, and accordingly after some\r\nconsultation, as _nothing_ could be done, we drove out--many police\r\nthen in plain clothes being distributed in and about the parks, and\r\nthe two Equerries riding so close on each side that they must have\r\nbeen hit, if anybody had; still the feeling of looking out for such a\r\nman was not _des plus agréables_; however, we drove through the parks,\r\nup to Hampstead, and back again. All was so quiet that we almost\r\nthought of nothing,--when, as we drove down Constitution Hill, very\r\nfast, we heard the report of a pistol, but not at all loud, so that\r\nhad we not been on the alert we should hardly have taken notice of\r\nit. We saw the man seized by a policeman _next to whom he was standing\r\nwhen he_ fired, but we did not stop. Colonel Arbuthnot and two others\r\nsaw him take aim, but we only _heard_ the report (looking both the\r\nother way). We felt both very glad that our drive had had the effect\r\nof having the man seized. Whether it was loaded or not we cannot yet\r\ntell, but we are again full of gratitude to Providence for invariably\r\n_protecting_ us! The feeling of horror is very great in the public,\r\nand great affection is shown us. The man was yesterday examined at the\r\nHome Office, is called John Francis, is a cabinet-maker, and son of a\r\nmachine-maker of Covent Garden Theatre, is good-looking (they say). I\r\nhave never seen him at all close, but Arbuthnot gave the description\r\nof him from what he saw on Sunday, which exactly answered. Only twenty\r\nor twenty-one years old, and _not_ the _least_ mad--but very cunning.\r\nThe boy identified him this morning, amongst many others. Everything\r\nis to be kept secret _this_ time, which is very right, and altogether\r\nI think it is being well done. Every further particular you shall\r\nhear. I was really not at all frightened, and feel _very_ proud at\r\ndear Uncle Mensdorff calling me \"_sehr muthig_,\" which I shall ever\r\nremember with peculiar pride, coming from so distinguished an officer\r\nas he is! Thank God, my Angel is also well! but he says that had\r\nthe man fired on Sunday, he must have been hit in the head! God is\r\nmerciful; that indeed we must feel daily more! Uncle and cousins were\r\nquite horrified.... Ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\nYou will tell Louise _all_, of course.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 34: The Hon.

Is it possible?--can it be true? was my first question.\r\nHowever, the detailed accounts leave no doubt that a pistol was\r\npointed at you again, though not fired. It is really shocking that\r\nsuch wretches exist who dare tempt (_sic_) to alarm you--though in\r\nthis instance there was nothing alarming except the evil spirit which\r\ninspired the boy.\r\n\r\nHow grateful must we not feel to our merciful God, who protects you so\r\nvisibly, and gives you courage and confidence in Him, who is and ever\r\nwill be your safest guard and support. Trust in Him and you will not\r\nfail to be well guided.\r\n\r\nI hope it is true that you were not aware of what had happened when\r\nyou went to church, not to be disturbed in your devotions, and that\r\nthe account did not agitate you.\r\n\r\nEdward[35] came yesterday from town, but he knew nothing but that a\r\npistol had been taken from a man in the Park. We hardly believed\r\nthe story till the papers informed us of the truth.

He was much\r\nshocked at learning, which he did not do until six o'clock yesterday\r\nevening, the event which took place on Monday. After what took place\r\non Sunday, it must have been a trial to your Majesty's nerves, and\r\nstill more to those of the Prince, to go out on Monday; but it appears\r\nto Lord Melbourne that your Majesty judged quite correctly in doing\r\nso. Lord Melbourne hardly knows what to say of this repeated attempt.\r\nIt is a depravity and a malice as unintelligible as it is atrocious.\r\nLord Melbourne is at least as grateful as any one of your Majesty's\r\nsubjects, and the gratitude is universal and fervent for your\r\nMajesty's safety.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne had ridden over in the morning to visit Lord and Lady\r\nUxbridge in their rural retirement, and upon his return to Brocket\r\nHall, about six o'clock, found the morning newspaper with the accounts\r\nof what had happened. If they had sent him down a messenger on Monday\r\nnight, which it would have been better to have done, he would have\r\nbeen yesterday in his place in the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne found Uxbridge enveloped in parcels and boxes, which\r\nhe was busy unpacking, Lady Uxbridge reclining by the stream under the\r\nshade of a plane-tree, and the two young ladies somewhat pensive. The\r\nplace looked beautiful, but Lord Melbourne fears that all its beauty\r\nwill not be a compensation to them for London at this time of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE ADDRESS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir James Graham to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWHITEHALL, _1st June 1842._\r\n\r\nSir James Graham, with humble duty to your Majesty, submits a copy\r\nof the Answer to the Address; and an alteration has been made in the\r\nAnswer which Sir James Graham hopes may render it conformable to the\r\ntender and generous feelings which your Majesty has deigned to express\r\nwith reference to the Prince.\r\n\r\nThe two Houses of Parliament followed the exact precedent which\r\nhas been established in Oxford's case; and although the life of the\r\nPrince, so dear to your Majesty, is highly valued by all your loving\r\nsubjects, yet the crime of treason attaches only to an attack on the\r\nsacred person of your Majesty; and the expressions used by Parliament\r\nwith reference to these atrocious crimes, when directed against the\r\nSovereign, are necessarily inapplicable to any other person, and could\r\nnot be used with propriety. Hence the omission in the former case\r\nof all allusion to the Prince; and the silence of Parliament on the\r\npresent occasion is to be ascribed to the same cause--not to any cold\r\nindifference, which the general feeling of attachment to the Prince\r\nentirely forbids.\r\n\r\nThe above is humbly submitted by your Majesty's dutiful Subject and\r\nServant,\r\n\r\nJ. R. G. GRAHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _6th June 1842._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I was sure of the kind interest you would take in\r\nthe event of the 29th and 30th. I am most thankful for your very kind,\r\nlong letter of the 3rd, which I received the day before yesterday. I\r\nhave so little time--as we are just setting off for Ascot--that I\r\ncan hardly write anything to you. There seems no doubt whatever that\r\nFrancis is totally without accomplices, and a _mauvais sujet_. We\r\nshall be able probably to tell you more when we see you. I am grieved\r\nthat you have deferred your visit again. We are then to expect your\r\narrival either on the Tuesday or Wednesday? Very thankful we should be\r\nsoon to hear whom you bring with you.\r\n\r\nDear Uncle and the Cousins are delighted with Windsor, and the weather\r\nis beautiful, only unfortunately _too_ hot to be pleasant. I rode on\r\nmy little Barb at a review of Cavalry at Wormwood Scrubbs on Saturday,\r\n_dont je suis bien fière_. Now adieu! dearest Uncle.

Sale, who with his column had thrown\r\n    himself into Jellalabad on 13th November 1841, and had heard\r\n    Brydon's narrative, made a _sortie_ on 7th April, and secured\r\n    a great victory over Akbar Khan, whose force outnumbered\r\n    Sale's by five to one.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 37: General Pollock, whom Auckland had selected\r\n    for the command, and who found everything in confusion on the\r\n    frontier, swept the Khyber Pass of the enemy, and joined\r\n    Sale. The insurrection had spread to Candahar, where General\r\n    (afterwards Sir William) Nott was in command with a force of\r\n    10,000 men. He heard of Macnaghten's murder on 31st January,\r\n    and, like Sale, refused to follow the order received (under\r\n    coercion, as he believed) from Elphinstone to return to India.\r\n    On the contrary, he ordered all Afghans to leave Candahar,\r\n    marched out himself and attacked and dispersed the enemy,\r\n    12,000 strong; while a flank movement made by the enemy on\r\n    the city was repulsed with great loss. General (afterwards Sir\r\n    Richard) England started from Quetta with reinforcements, but\r\n    met with a reverse at Haikalzai; meanwhile also Colonel\r\n    Palmer had had to make terms at Ghuznee, and had to encounter\r\n    treachery. Nott, who was badly in want of money and ammunition\r\n    for the troops, sent imperative orders to General England to\r\n    reinforce him, which he did early in May.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DEBATE ON THE INCOME TAX]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _10th June 1842._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. He has\r\nthought it better not to interrupt your Majesty with letters during\r\nthe bustle of the last week, but he cannot omit to express to your\r\nMajesty how much he was struck with the letter of the 2nd inst. which\r\nhe received, and how entirely he concurs in the justice and propriety\r\nof your Majesty's feelings and observations. Let us hope that we shall\r\nhave no more of these horrid attempts, which are generated by the\r\nwild notions of the time, and by the expectation, extravagant and\r\nunfounded, so industriously inculcated into the public mind, of\r\nadvantages to be derived from change and confusion; Lord Melbourne\r\nanxiously hopes that the painful impressions which such events\r\nare calculated to produce upon your Majesty's mind, and which they\r\nnecessarily must produce, will pass away and that nothing will happen\r\nto renew and revive them.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is happy to hear from Normanby that everything passed\r\noff well and successfully at Windsor and at Ascot. The last is always\r\nrather a doubtful and disagreeable ordeal to pass through.\r\n\r\nWe should have got through the debate upon the Income Tax this evening\r\nin the House of Lords, if Lansdowne had not unfortunately this morning\r\nhad an access of gout in the hand, which prevented him from attending,\r\nand obliged the debate to be deferred. Lord Melbourne hopes that the\r\nresolution which Lansdowne is to move[38] is put in such a shape as to\r\nvindicate our course, and at the same time not to condemn that which\r\nhas been adopted overmuch, nor to pledge us for the future....\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne earnestly hopes that your Majesty is well and not too\r\nmuch affected by the heat of this weather, which does not suit Lord\r\nMelbourne very well. In conjunction with a large dinner which we had\r\nat the Reform Club in honour of the Duke of Sussex, it has given Lord\r\nMelbourne a good deal of headache and indisposition. The Duke was in\r\nvery good humour, and much pleased with the dinner, but he was by no\r\nmeans well or strong.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 38: This Resolution was in favour of altering the\r\n    Corn, Sugar, and Timber Duties, in preference to imposing an\r\n    Income Tax.

We arrived here\r\nyesterday morning, having come by the railroad, from Windsor, in half\r\nan hour, free from dust and crowd and heat, and I am quite charmed\r\nwith it.[39] We spent a delightful time at Windsor, which would have\r\nbeen still pleasanter had not the heat been such, ever since Saturday\r\nweek, that one is quite overcome; the grass is quite brown, and the\r\nearth full of wide cracks; there has not been a drop of rain since the\r\n24th, my birthday! We rode and walked and danced, and I think I never\r\nwas better than in all this fatigue and exercise....\r\n\r\nI get every day fonder of dearest, excellent Uncle Mensdorff and the\r\ndear cousins, who are so amiable and good and unassuming; really, in\r\nsociety they keep quite in the background. They are out and out the\r\nnicest cousins we have. I am sure what I can do for them I shall be\r\ntoo happy to do. Alexander is the most distinguished and solid,\r\nbut Alphonse and Arthur the most unassuming. There is something so\r\npeculiarly _good_ in dear Arthur! and they are all five so fond of\r\nPussy, and she so fond of them....

Lord\r\nMelbourne is very glad to hear that your Majesty has enjoyed in the\r\nsociety of your near and dear relations so much happiness, which, like\r\nall other things, must have its portion of alloy in their departure.\r\nLord Melbourne was much pleased with the short conversation which\r\nhe had with Count Mensdorff at Stafford House, and it is highly\r\ninteresting to see at this distance of time a man who has been engaged\r\nin affairs so important and of so awful and melancholy a character.\r\nYour Majesty is surely right in terming your cousins young men; if\r\nthe health and constitution be good, thirty-six is a young man,\r\ntwenty-nine and thirty-two very young men, and twenty-five quite a\r\nboy. The weather has been very hot but very fine. The rain was so much\r\nrequired that Lord Melbourne cannot lament its coming, but he also\r\nregrets the hot suns which it has banished.\r\n\r\nThe course which had been taken upon the Income Tax in the House of\r\nCommons,[40] contrary to Lord Melbourne's wish and opinion, rendered\r\nit impossible for Lord Melbourne directly to support the Bill in the\r\nHouse of Lords without offending and separating himself from the whole\r\nbody of those who supported the last Government.\r\n\r\nHe therefore acquiesced in the resolution, which was moved by Lord\r\nLansdowne, and which did not oppose the measure, but declared that it\r\nmight have been avoided if the course which we had proposed had been\r\ntaken. In the debate Lord Melbourne argued as strongly as he could in\r\nfavour of the tax, and ended by declaring that if it was imposed, he\r\ncould not pledge himself for the future against maintaining and even\r\nextending it. Lord Melbourne is anxious to make this explanation of\r\nhis conduct to your Majesty, and hopes therefore that your Majesty\r\nwill forgive his writing thus much upon this subject. Lord Melbourne\r\nvery much lamented that the business did not terminate as amiably as\r\nit began, and that a contest should have been got into respecting the\r\nthird reading of the Bill; but considering that the measure had passed\r\nby accident through its first stages without any debate, and that\r\nthere were Lords who were still desirous of speaking upon it, it was\r\nimprudent of the Ministers not at once to give another day for that\r\npurpose, especially as they were sure to be compelled to do so by\r\nrepeated motions of adjournment.\r\n\r\nThe feelings which your Majesty expresses upon the conviction of this\r\nman[41] are natural, and such as must arise in your Majesty's bosom;\r\nbut Lord Melbourne knows very well that your Majesty will at once see\r\nthe necessity of not yielding to your own feelings, and of leaving the\r\nissue entirely in the hands of your advisers.\r\n\r\nWithout any reference to personal or particular circumstances, without\r\nadverting to your Majesty's age, sex, qualities mental or personal,\r\nwithout attending to any sentiments of attachment or affection which\r\nmay be felt for your Majesty's person, it must be remembered that your\r\nMajesty's life is, from the position which you occupy and the office\r\nwhich you fill, the most important life in these realms; it is also\r\ntoo clear that it is the most exposed life in the country, the life\r\nthe most obnoxious[42] to danger; and therefore it is a duty to throw\r\naround it every protection which the law and the execution of the law\r\ncan afford.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne was sure that your Majesty, being fond of speed, would\r\nbe delighted with the railway. Lord Melbourne hopes that your Majesty\r\nwas not much affected by the heat, which he feared that you would be.\r\n\r\nHas your Majesty read the last volume of Madame D'Arblay's (Miss\r\nBurney) Diary, which contains the account of her service in the family\r\nof George III.?[43] It is a curious [work], gives a curious account of\r\nthe _intérieur_, and shows the King and Queen and the Princesses in a\r\nvery amiable light.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 40: Lord John Russell had strenuously opposed the\r\n    Income Tax Bill, but had been defeated by large majorities.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 41: Frances was tried on 17th June, and convicted.\r\n    The death sentence was commuted to one of transportation for\r\n    life.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 42: Used in the classical sense of \"exposed to\";\r\n    _cf._ \"obnoxia fato.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 43: The first five volumes were published this\r\n    year, Madame D'Arblay having died in 1840, at the age of\r\n    eighty-seven.

From the seat of war, the intelligence is most satisfactory.

The only\r\nobservation that can be made upon these attempts is, that hitherto\r\nthey appear to have been made by those who have not the means of\r\nexecuting their own wicked designs, and that they are not marked by\r\nthe same determination and the same long and ferocious preparation\r\nwhich characterised in France the conduct of Fieschi and Alibaud.[46]\r\nLord Melbourne is not of opinion that the extension of mercy to\r\nFrancis--which from what Lord Melbourne hears of the opinion of the\r\njudges he apprehends to have been unavoidable--could have had any\r\neffect in encouraging this man to a similar act; at the same time it\r\nis impossible to say what may have had an effect upon the mind, and\r\nwe can only collect the intentions of men from the deeds which they\r\nperform.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne thanks your Majesty much for your letter of the 26th\r\nult.

My beloved brother was unexpectedly taken\r\naway from us before yesterday evening. Before yesterday morning he\r\nwent to Neuilly to take leave of my parents, previous to his departure\r\nfor St Omer. The horses ran away: he had the unfortunate idea to jump\r\nout from his barouche--a thing I cannot understand, as he had on\r\nall occasions an uncommon presence of mind--fell upon his head, and\r\nexpired a few hours afterwards, in presence of my too unfortunate\r\nparents, without having recovered his consciousness. It is the\r\ngreatest misfortune that could happen to us.\r\n\r\nWe are quite stunned by the sudden and horrid blow, and I cannot\r\nbelieve it yet, although I have before me the letter of my poor\r\nparents. They are full of courage and resignation to the will\r\nof Providence; but I do not understand what will become of them,\r\nparticularly of my mother, who loved so fondly, and with so much\r\nreason, my brother, and of the too unfortunate Hélène. May God help\r\nthem and have mercy on them! Clémentine and Victoire are gone to\r\nPlombières to give to Hélène the fatal news, and bring her back:\r\nit will most probably be her death. My parents wished to see us\r\nimmediately, and we go to-morrow to Paris.\r\n\r\nI am sure, my beloved Victoria, of the share you will take in the\r\nmisfortune, the greatest which could befall us, and I thank you\r\nbeforehand for it.

The King of the Belgians has never dropped a word on\r\nthe subject, but the Queen really feels it her duty by her Uncle to\r\nstate this frankly to Sir Robert Peel, and to say that she thinks it\r\nhighly important that Sir Edward Disbrowe should be removed to some\r\nother Mission. Of course she wishes that this should be done\r\nquietly, but she thinks that with a man like the present King of the\r\nNetherlands, who is continually intriguing in Belgium and making her\r\nUncle's position very painful, it is of the utmost importance that\r\nour Minister there should be totally _unbiassed_--which Sir Edward\r\nDisbrowe most decidedly is not. Could not Sir T. Cartwright be sent\r\nthere, and Sir Edward Disbrowe go to Stockholm?

The Queen is sure that Lord Melbourne\r\nwill have warmly shared the universal horror and regret at the\r\nuntimely and fearfully sudden end of so amiable and distinguished a\r\nPrince as poor Chartres (as we all called the Duke of Orleans) was!\r\nThe loss to France, and indeed Europe, is very great; but to the Royal\r\nFamily, dearest Louise (who all doted on him), and above all to poor\r\nunfortunate Hélène, who adored him (and he was a most devoted husband\r\nto her), and to his two poor little boys of four and one years old--he\r\nis an irreparable loss. The Queen has heard from none yet, but has\r\nseen a letter from Guizot, who was a witness of the _last scene_,\r\nwhich is quite truly reported in the papers; he says it was\r\nfearful--the poor Duke lying and dying on a mattress on the floor\r\nsurrounded by his parents and sisters, kneeling and praying around\r\ntheir dearly beloved Child! Alas! poor Hélène had not even that\r\ncomfort!\r\n\r\nThe Queen is very glad that the Bill for the better security of her\r\nperson has passed so quickly and in so gratifying a manner through\r\nboth Houses.\r\n\r\nWe are here since yesterday week, enjoying the fine weather, and great\r\nquiet and peace; but the news from Paris have damped our spirits.\r\n\r\nThe Queen is charmed with her new sister,[49] who is a most amiable,\r\nsensible, and gentle creature, and without being really handsome, very\r\npretty and pleasing.\r\n\r\nWe return to town to-morrow and the Queen hopes soon to see Lord\r\nMelbourne.

Lord Melbourne also sends the letter which Mr Leigh\r\nHunt has taken the liberty of addressing to your Majesty, as well as\r\nthat which he has addressed to Lord Melbourne. Lord Melbourne will\r\ninform Mr Hunt that he has done this, and it is not at all required\r\nthat any further notice should be taken.[50]\r\n\r\nIt is a very gay and lively work, and has in it some wit and fun.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne had great pleasure yesterday in seeing your Majesty\r\nwell and in good spirits.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 50: The poem was no doubt _The Palfrey; a Love-Story\r\n    of Old Times_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr Leigh Hunt to Viscount Melbourne._\r\n\r\n32 EDWARDES SQUARE, KENSINGTON, _15th July 1842._\r\n\r\nMY LORD,--I was once speaking to Mr Fonblanque[51] of my unwillingness\r\nto trouble your Lordship, when Prime Minister, with a request to lay\r\nmy tragedy of the _Legend of Florence_[52] before Her Majesty; and he\r\nsaid that he was sure your good-nature would not have been displeased\r\nwith it. This is the reason why I now venture to ask whether a similar\r\nkindness might be shown the accompanying little poem, supposing\r\nno etiquette to stand in the way of it. I have no Tory channels of\r\ncommunication with the Palace, nor wish to seek any; neither can I\r\ntrespass upon any friendships of Her Majesty's, unless they can find\r\nmy excuse in some previous knowledge of me. On the other hand, I have\r\nno fear of being supposed by your Lordship to approach one who is no\r\nlonger Premier with less respect than when he was in power. I would\r\neven venture to say, if the mode of testifying it were not so poor a\r\none, that it is in a double spirit of respectfulness the application\r\nis made. Should it be of a nature calculated to give your Lordship any\r\nperplexity, I can only blush for having been the occasion of it, and\r\nbeg it may be laid to the account of an ignorance which lives very\r\nmuch out of the world. The same reason will plead my excuse for\r\nnot knowing whether a letter to Her Majesty ought, or ought not, to\r\naccompany the book; and for begging your Lordship, after its perusal,\r\nto suppress it or otherwise accordingly, in case you can oblige me\r\nin the other part of my request. Your Lordship will perceive that the\r\nAddress prefixed to the poem, not having ventured to ask Her Majesty's\r\npermission, does not presume to call itself a dedication; neither does\r\nit leave the public under any erroneous impression whatsoever as to\r\nthe nature of its intentions: and on this account I not only expect,\r\nof course, no acknowledgment of its receipt on the part of any\r\none about Her Majesty's person, but shall be more than content to\r\nunderstand by your Lordship's own silence that my book has reached its\r\ndestination, and therefore not been considered altogether unworthy of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe bookseller tells me that it is no longer \"the mode\" for authors to\r\npresent their volumes _bound_; but in regard to books intended to go\r\nto Court, he is not quite so certain; and I find it so difficult to\r\ndisassociate the idea of dress from any such proceeding, that I trust\r\nmy inexperience in this respect also will procure me whatever pardon\r\nit may require.\r\n\r\nI have the honour to be, my Lord, your Lordship's ever grateful and\r\nfaithful Servant,\r\n\r\nLEIGH HUNT.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 51: Hunt had founded _The Examiner_ in 1808, and\r\n    Albany Fonblanque (1793-1872) had succeeded him on it as\r\n    leader writer.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 52: Leigh Hunt's play, _A Legend of Florence_, had\r\n    had a great success at Covent Garden in 1840; in 1852 it was\r\n    performed at Windsor by the Queen's command.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE AFFLICTED FAMILY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Queen of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nNEUILLY, _21st July 1842._\r\n\r\nMY BELOVED VICTORIA,--I was unable to thank you the other day for your\r\nkind and feeling letter of the 14th, although I was greatly touched\r\nby it, and I trust you will have excused me. I thank you to-day very\r\nsincerely for both your letters, and for the share and sympathy you\r\nand dear Albert take in our _great misfortune_. I know it is very\r\nheart-felt, and we are all very grateful for it. Victoire and my poor\r\nmother have already given you news from the unfortunate Hélène.\r\nShe has sustained and outlived the first shock and shows wonderful\r\ncourage. She is even well in health, and much better and stronger\r\nin all ways than I had expected. She takes very much upon herself\r\non account of the poor children, to prevent that any melancholy or\r\npainful feeling should be connected for them with the remembrance of\r\ntheir beloved and unfortunate father. My parents show great fortitude\r\nand resignation, but their hearts are for ever broke. They are only\r\nsustained by their feeling of duty. My poor mother bears up for my\r\nfather, and my father bears up to fulfil his duties of father and of\r\nking. Their health is, thank God! good, and my father retains all his\r\nstrength of mind and quickness of judgment; but they are both grown\r\nold in looks, and their hairs are turned quite white.\r\n\r\nThe first days, my poor father could do nothing but sob, and it was\r\nreally heartbreaking to see him. He begins now to have more command\r\nupon his grief, and the presence of your uncle, whom he dearly loves,\r\nseems to do him good. The poor children are well and _merry_ and seem\r\nunconscious of their dreadful loss. From time to time only they jump\r\nround us as if looking for protection. The contrast of their gaiety\r\nwith their horrid misfortune is very painful. Paris is looking\r\nremarkably well and strong. Robert[53] is much grown, extremely quick\r\nand lively, and begins to speak. The remainder of the family is,\r\nas you may easily imagine, in the _deepest affliction_. Nemours\r\nespecially is quite broken down with grief. Chartres was _more_ than\r\na _brother_ to him, as he was _more_ than a _second father_ to us all.\r\nHe was the _head_ and the _heart_ and _soul_ of the whole family. We\r\nall looked up to him, and we found him on all occasions. A _better_,\r\nor even _such_ a brother was never seen; our loss is as great as\r\nirreparable; but God's will be done! He had surely His motives in\r\nsending on my unfortunate parents the horrid affliction in their\r\nold days, and in removing from us the being who seemed the _most\r\nnecessary_ to the hope and happiness of all; we must submit to His\r\ndecrees, hard as they are; but it is impossible not to regret that my\r\npoor brother has not at least found the death of a soldier, which\r\nhe had always wished for, instead of such a useless, horrid, and\r\nmiserable one! It seems, for no one saw him fall, that he did not\r\njump, as we had thought at first, but that he was thrown from the\r\nbarouche, while standing; and I like it in some measure better so, as\r\nGod's will is still more manifest in this way. It is equally manifest\r\nin _all_ the circumstances attending the catastrophe. My poor brother\r\nwas not even to have come to Neuilly. He had taken leave of my parents\r\nthe day before, and would not have gone again if my unfortunate mother\r\nhad not asked him, and if my parents, who were to go to Paris, had not\r\ndelayed their departure....\r\n\r\nI thank you again and again, my beloved Victoria, for all your\r\ninterest and sympathy. I was sure you would think of us and of me: you\r\nknow how much I loved my brother. I little expected to outlive him, as\r\nI had done my beloved Mary;[54] but once more, _God's will be done_. I\r\nremain now and ever, yours most devotedly,\r\n\r\nLOUISE.\r\n\r\nI perceive I forgot mentioning Ernest. Pray thank him for his sympathy\r\nalso. He knows what a brother is, and may feel for us! We expect on\r\nSaturday poor Joinville. My father will have thus his four remaining\r\nsons round him for the opening of the Session, which takes place on\r\nthe 26th, and at which he must preside in person. It is a hard duty\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 53: The young Duc de Chartres, born in 1840.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 54: See _ante_, p. 144. (Ch.

The debate was entirely\r\nconfined to those members who act in concert with the Anti-Corn Law\r\nLeague.[55] It continued until twelve, when Mr Cobden, the Member for\r\nStockport, moved an adjournment of the House, on the ground that none\r\nof your Majesty's servants had taken a part in the debate....\r\n\r\nSeveral members of the Opposition voted with the Government, and\r\ndeclared that they would not be parties to such vexatious proceedings.\r\n\r\nA division on the main question--a Committee to enquire into the state\r\nof the country with a view to the Repeal of the Corn Laws--then took\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe motion was negatived by a majority of 156 to 64--92. The House did\r\nnot adjourn until three this morning.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 55: The Anti-Corn Law League was rapidly gaining\r\n    importance, and fiscal policy occupied a great part of the\r\n    session of 1842.

Yesterday I received your dear letter of the 19th, and I will\r\nanswer it, so as to give you a clear view of the sad case. On the\r\n12th, Tuesday, Chartres had taken leave, as he meant to go to St Omer,\r\nthe 13th; however, in the family the Queen and others said he ought to\r\ncome once more to see them. The King had ordered his carriage to go to\r\ntown on the 13th, to a Council; Chartres meant to have called shortly\r\nafter ten.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to tell you all this, as it shows how strangely\r\ncircumstances turned fatally. Chartres did not want to return once\r\nmore to Neuilly, and the King, if exact, might see him once more\r\nin town. Chartres, however, instead of coming early, set off after\r\neleven; his Off. d'Ordonnance, M. Bertin de Veaux, his _valet de\r\nchambre_, a German, Holder, begged him not to go quite alone in that\r\nsmall phaeton through Paris, as he was in uniform, but all this did\r\nnot avail; he insisted to go in the phaeton and to go _alone_. He set\r\nout later than he expected, and if the King had set out _exactly_ as\r\nhe had named, the parents and the son would probably have met on the\r\nrising avenue of the Champs Elysees, towards the Barrière de l'Étoile\r\nand Arc de Triomphe. However, the King delayed his departure and the\r\nson set off. At the place where from the great avenue one turns off\r\ntowards Neuilly, the horses, which were not even young horses, as I am\r\ntold that he has had them some years, moved by that stupid longing to\r\nget to Neuilly, where they knew their stables, got rather above\r\nthe postillion, and ran _quasi_ away. Chartres got up and asked the\r\npostillion if he could hold his horses no longer; the boy called out\r\n\"Non, Monseigneur\"; he had looked back when he said this, and saw his\r\nmaster for the last time _standing_ in the phaeton. People at some\r\ndistance saw him come out of his carriage and describe a sort of\r\nsemicircle falling down. Nobody knows exactly if he jumped out of the\r\ncarriage, or if he lost his position and fell out. I am inclined to\r\nthink that, trusting to his lightness and agility, he wanted to jump\r\nout, forgetting the impulse which a quick-going carriage gives, as\r\nthere were marks on his knees as if he had first fallen that way. The\r\nprincipal blow was, however, on the head, the skull being entirely\r\nfractured. He was taken up senseless, that is to say confused, but\r\nnot fainting, and carried into a small inn. At first his appearance,\r\nsitting in a chair, was so little altered that people thought it was\r\nnothing of any consequence.\r\n\r\nHe _knew_ no one, and only spoke a few incoherent words in German. The\r\naccident happened about a quarter before twelve, and at four he was no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nI refer for some other details to Albert. Poor Louise looks like a\r\nshadow, and only her great devotion for me supports her. It may serve\r\nas a lesson how fragile all human affairs are. Poor Chartres, it\r\nseems, with the prospect of these camps and altogether, was _never\r\nin better spirits_. But I must end.

I hope and trust that her dear children will occupy\r\nher and divert her attention; only don't let her swallow and suppress\r\nher grief and keep it to herself; that is dreadful, and very hurtful.\r\nLet her give way to her sorrow, and talk of it to her.\r\n\r\nPray, dearest Uncle, will not and ought not Paris to be Duke of\r\nOrleans now?

Poor little Paris is aware of his misfortune\r\nin the way he can be. Hélène told him that he saw everybody weep\r\nbecause he would see no more his beloved father.

He wonders why he does not go any more\r\nin his unfortunate father's room, and why there is no more \"_de cher\r\nPapa_,\" as he says: else he makes no question or observation and is\r\nvery quiet and cheerful. He cannot yet feel what he has lost and his\r\nmelancholy fate: but Hélène does what she can to keep alive in him the\r\nremembrance of his father.... Yours most affectionately,\r\n\r\nLOUISE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _8th August 1842._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. He thanks\r\nyour Majesty much for the letter of the 4th. It can hardly be expected\r\nthat the grief of the French family will, as yet, much diminish, but\r\nLord Melbourne hopes that they are somewhat more composed. He has\r\nheard this morning that Lord and Lady Beauvale were at Boulogne on\r\nSaturday; they would probably cross yesterday, and will be in London\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne understands that Lord Beauvale had an interview of\r\nthree hours with the King of the French. Charles Howard was married\r\nthis morning, and Lord Melbourne is going to meet Lord and Lady\r\nCarlisle and the rest of the family at Baron Parke's[58] at dinner.\r\nLord Melbourne thinks that Lord Prudhoe's marriage[59] was to be\r\nexpected.[60] Upon looking at the Peerage, he is only fifty years old,\r\nand fifty is young enough to marry anybody. The only fault of fifty is\r\nthat it advances too rapidly on to sixty, which, on the other hand, is\r\ntoo old to marry anybody. It is Lord Melbourne's opinion that if a man\r\ndoes marry either at fifty or sixty, he had much better take a young\r\ngirl than a woman of more age and experience. Youth is more malleable,\r\nmore gentle, and has often more respect and compassion for infirmity\r\nthan middle-age.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 58: Afterwards Lord Wensleydale.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 59: To Lady Eleanor Grosvenor.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 60: Admiral Lord Algernon Percy (1792-1865),\r\n    President of the Royal Institution, was created in 1816 Baron\r\n    Prudhoe: in 1847, on the death of his brother, he became\r\n    fourth Duke of Northumberland.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: RESIGNATION OF LORD HILL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord Hill to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nHARDWICKE GRANGE,[61] _9th August 1842._\r\n\r\nLord Hill presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and craves\r\nyour Majesty's gracious permission to lay before your Majesty his\r\nresignation of the Command of your Majesty's Army.\r\n\r\nLord Hill deeply regrets the necessity of taking a step which will\r\ndeprive him of a charge that has been so long committed to his hands,\r\nand for his continuance in which he is indebted to your Majesty's\r\ngrace and favour; but he has again suffered much from the illness\r\nunder which he laboured in the early part of the year, and his health\r\nhas in consequence become so indifferent as to render him unequal to\r\nthe adequate discharge of the various important duties of his command,\r\nwhich therefore he feels he could not retain with due regard to the\r\ninterests of your Majesty's Service.\r\n\r\nLord Hill had flattered himself that he should have been able to have\r\nlaid his application for retirement before your Majesty himself, and\r\npersonally to have expressed to your Majesty his deep and lasting\r\nsense of your Majesty's gracious kindness to him on all occasions.\r\nHaving, however, left London by the advice of his medical attendants,\r\nand being too unwell to undertake a second journey, Lord Hill avails\r\nhimself of this mode of assuring your Majesty of his unabated zeal for\r\nthe Service, of his dutiful devotion to your Majesty's person, and\r\nof the pain and sorrow with which he relinquishes an appointment that\r\nafforded him the honour and advantage of executing your Majesty's\r\ncommands, and receiving many gracious proofs of your Majesty's support\r\nand confidence.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 61: Lord Hill's country house in Shropshire.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: APPOINTMENT OF COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir Robert Peel to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWHITEHALL, _10th August 1842._\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs\r\nleave to acquaint your Majesty that he received at a late hour last\r\nnight the accompanying letter to your Majesty from Lord Hill.

The 16th of August (Tuesday\r\nnext) is the anniversary of a conflict which took place in Manchester\r\nin the year 1819[69] between the Yeomanry Cavalry and the populace,\r\nand it is feared that there may be a great assemblage of persons\r\nriotously disposed on that day.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it appears desirable to your Majesty's\r\nconfidential advisers that a proclamation should be immediately\r\nissued, warning all persons against attendance on tumultuous meetings,\r\nand against all acts calculated to disturb the public peace. It\r\nis necessary that a Council should be held for the issue of this\r\nproclamation, and important that it should arrive in Manchester on\r\nMonday.\r\n\r\nThese considerations have prevented Sir Robert Peel from giving\r\nprevious notice to your Majesty, and having your Majesty's sanction\r\nfor the holding of a Council. On account of the urgency of the case,\r\nhe has requested a sufficient number of Privy Councillors to repair to\r\nWindsor this evening, in order that should your Majesty be graciously\r\npleased to hold a Council, the proclamation may be forthwith issued.\r\nThe members of the Privy Council will be in attendance about half-past\r\nsix o'clock, as Sir Robert Peel has considered that from that time\r\nto half-past seven will probably be the least inconvenient to your\r\nMajesty.\r\n\r\nHe writes this immediately after the breaking up of the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 68: The disturbances of this month, which originated\r\n    in a strike for wages in Lancashire, were inflamed by\r\n    agitators, and rapidly spread through Cheshire, Staffordshire,\r\n    Warwickshire, and Yorkshire, eventually extending to the\r\n    populous parts of Scotland and Wales.

The railroad\r\ncommunications as yet are uninterrupted; no collision has taken place\r\nbetween the troops and the multitude, except at Preston;[71] and Sir\r\nJames Graham is willing to hope that this insurrectionary movement may\r\nbe suppressed without recourse to extreme measures. Every precaution,\r\nhowever, has been taken, and arrangements are made for augmenting\r\nthe force under the command of Sir William Warre, if it should become\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe character of these riots has assumed more decidedly a political\r\naspect. It is no longer a strike for higher wages, but the Delegates,\r\nwho direct the movement, avow that labour shall not be resumed until\r\nthe people's Charter be granted.[72]\r\n\r\nSir James Graham will hasten to-morrow to inform your Majesty of the\r\naccounts which he may receive.\r\n\r\nThe above is humbly submitted by your Majesty's dutiful Subject and\r\nServant,\r\n\r\nJ.

From Manchester, from Wigan, from Preston, the reports\r\nare very good.\r\n\r\nThe movement is not one caused by distress. The demand for employment\r\nhas increased, and the price of provisions--and particularly of\r\npotatoes, bread, and bacon--has rapidly fallen within the last\r\nfortnight or three weeks.\r\n\r\nPeople of property and the Magistrates (notwithstanding their\r\npolitical dissensions) are now acting in harmony, and with more\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\nOrders have been sent to apprehend the Delegates assembled in\r\nManchester, _the very moment_ that the law will warrant their\r\napprehension, and Sir Robert Peel should not be surprised to hear of\r\ntheir committal to Lancaster Castle in the course of to-day.\r\n\r\nEvery vigilance will be exerted with reference to _Cooper_[73] (whom\r\nyour Majesty names) and all other itinerant agitators.\r\n\r\nAs might be naturally expected, the movements and disorderly spirit\r\nspreading from the centre (Manchester) are appearing in remote points;\r\nbut when peace and confidence are thoroughly restored at Manchester,\r\nthe example will quickly tell in the circumjacent districts.\r\n\r\nBirmingham is tranquil and well-disposed. The accounts from Scotland\r\nare favourable.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 73: A Leicester Chartist, who was afterwards tried\r\n    for sedition.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PARLIAMENT PROROGUED]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _17th August 1842._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. He is going\r\ndown to-day to Brocket Hall with Lord and Lady Beauvale. Lord and Lady\r\nPalmerston are coming down to-morrow, and Lord and Lady Cowper will\r\nprobably come over from Panshanger.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty read extremely well in the House of Lords on Friday\r\nlast.[74] Lord Melbourne can judge better of this from the body of the\r\nHouse than he could when he stood close to your Majesty. Nothing can\r\nbe more clear and distinct, and at the same time more natural and free\r\nfrom effort. Perhaps if your Majesty could read a tone louder it would\r\nbe as well. Charles Buller, who was amongst the House of Commons, told\r\nLord Melbourne that, where he stood, the voice, although well heard,\r\nsounded somewhat weak. But this should not be attempted unless it\r\ncan be done with perfect ease. Nothing injures reading so much as the\r\nattempt to push the organ beyond its natural powers.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne hopes that these tumults in the manufacturing districts\r\nare subsiding, but he cannot conceal from your Majesty that he views\r\nthem with great alarm--much greater than he generally thinks it\r\nprudent to express. He fears that they may last in the form of strike,\r\nand turn out much longer than is looked for, as they did in 1832 and\r\n1833.\r\n\r\nThere is a great mass of discontented feeling in the country arising\r\nfrom the actual state of society. It arises from the distress and\r\ndestitution which will fall at times upon a great manufacturing\r\npopulation, and from the wild and extravagant opinions which are\r\nnaturally generated in an advanced and speculative state of society.\r\n\r\nThis discontent has been aggravated and fermented by the language of\r\nevery party in the state. Lord Melbourne can exempt no party from\r\nthis blame, nor hardly any individual except himself. The Tories and\r\nConservatives (not the Leaders, but the larger portion of the party)\r\nhave done what they could to inflame the public mind upon that most\r\ninflammable topic of the Poor Laws. The _Times_ newspaper has been the\r\nmost forward in this. The Whigs and Radicals have done what they could\r\nin the same direction upon the Corn Laws. Mr Attwood[75] and another\r\nset have worked the question of the Currency, and the whole career of\r\nMr O'Connell in Ireland has been too manifest to be mistaken. It is\r\nno wonder if working in this manner altogether they have at last\r\nsucceeded in driving the country into this which is certainly very\r\nnear, if not actually a rebellion.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne earnestly hopes that your Majesty and the Prince, the\r\nPrince, and Princess are all well.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 74: Parliament was prorogued by the Queen in person\r\n    on 12th August.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 75: Who represented the Radical views of the\r\n    Birmingham school.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE DISTURBED DISTRICTS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir James Graham to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWHITEHALL, _18th August 1842._\r\n\r\nSir James Graham, with humble duty, is happily enabled to state to\r\nyour Majesty that the accounts from the disturbed districts received\r\nthis morning are more satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn Lancashire a disposition to resume work has been partially evinced;\r\nand at Preston, where the most vigorous measures were taken in the\r\nfirst instance, there has hardly been a cessation of employment.\r\n\r\nSir James Graham encloses a letter from the Chief Constable of the\r\nCounty of Lancashire detailing a successful resistance to a fresh\r\nattempt on the part of a mob to enter Preston; and he sends also\r\na report from the Mayor of Manchester and from Mr Forster, the\r\nStipendiary Magistrate. Decisive measures will be adopted for the\r\nimmediate apprehension of the Delegates, not only at Manchester, but\r\nin every other quarter where legal evidence can be obtained which will\r\njustify their arrest. The law, which clearly sanctions resistance to\r\nthe entry of these mobs into cities, is now understood by the local\r\nauthorities. A bolder and firmer spirit is rising among all classes\r\npossessing property in defence of their rights against these bands\r\nof plunderers, who are the enemies both of law and of property.\r\nThe prisoners taken in the commission of treasonable felonies are\r\nnumerous; warrants are issued against others whose persons are known:\r\nthe supremacy of the law will be promptly vindicated, and Sir James\r\nGraham entertains the confident hope that order will be soon restored.\r\n\r\nIn the Potteries a signal example was made by a handful of your\r\nMajesty's troops opposed to a riotous multitude which had burnt houses\r\nand spread devastation, and Sir James Graham encloses a letter from\r\nCaptain Powys giving a description of the occurrence. The effect\r\nof this example has been that yesterday throughout this district no\r\nrioting took place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DISTURBANCES IN LONDON]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir James Graham to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWHITEHALL, _19th August 1842._\r\n\r\nSir James Graham, with humble duty, begs to announce to your Majesty\r\nthat the accounts from the North, on the whole, may be considered\r\nsatisfactory....\r\n\r\nFive of the principal Delegates at Manchester have been apprehended.\r\nWarrants are out against four others. A very important seizure of\r\npapers has been made which discloses a conspiracy, extensive in its\r\nramifications, going back as far as July 1841. It is hoped that these\r\npapers, which are still at Manchester, may lead to fresh discoveries.\r\nSir James Graham will send to Manchester to-night an experienced law\r\nofficer, for the purpose of pursuing the investigation on the spot.\r\n\r\nThere was a meeting last night in the neighbourhood of London, of a\r\nviolent character. Sir James Graham had given positive orders to the\r\npolice not to allow any mob, as night approached, to enter London.\r\nNotwithstanding these directions, a mob assembled in Lincoln's Inn\r\nFields about eleven o'clock, and moved through the city to Bethnal\r\nGreen. Sir James Graham had the troops on the alert, but the multitude\r\ndispersed without any serious disturbance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir James Graham to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_20th August 1842._\r\n\r\n...

Lord Stanley would have\r\nsubmitted the draft for your Majesty's approval previous to sending\r\nit, had not an opportunity presented itself of sending it off by a\r\nfast-sailing private ship which sailed this morning, the intelligence\r\nhaving only been received yesterday. The instructions sent to Sir\r\nGeorge Napier, on the 10th of April, but not received when this\r\nunfortunate affair took place, were in substance not to attempt the\r\nsubjugation of these people by direct force, but to warn them that\r\ntheir titles to the land which they occupy would not be recognised by\r\nyour Majesty, that they would have no title to claim protection from\r\nthe aggression of the neighbouring tribes, to interdict communication\r\nbetween them and the settled parts of the Colony, and to prevent any\r\nintercourse by sea with foreign or British traders. The unfortunate\r\nevent which has now occurred will render it necessary to take steps,\r\nas Sir George Napier has already done, for vindicating the power of\r\nyour Majesty's Arms; but when that shall have been effected, Lord\r\nStanley would still hope that a considerable number of these misguided\r\nmen may be induced to return to their allegiance, and to the settled\r\nparts of your Majesty's dominions, and he feels confident that in such\r\nan event he will be fulfilling your Majesty's wishes in directing that\r\nthey may be treated with all possible lenity.\r\n\r\nAll which is humbly submitted by your Majesty's most dutiful Servant\r\nand Subject,\r\n\r\nSTANLEY.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 76: Sir George Napier (1784-1855) governed Cape\r\n    Colony for seven years, and the Boers were extruded from Natal\r\n    by him.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Adelaide to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nBUSHEY HOUSE, _7th September 1842._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST NIECE,--...

We left Dalkeith on Monday, and lunched at\r\nDupplin, Lord Kinnoul's, a pretty place with quite a new house, and\r\nwhich poor Lord Kinnoul displayed so well as to fall head over heels\r\ndown a steep bank, and was proceeding down another, if Albert had not\r\ncaught him; I did not see it, but Albert and I have nearly died with\r\nlaughing at the _relation_ of it. From Dalkeith we went through Perth\r\n(which is _most_ beautifully situated on the Tay) to Scone Palace,[78]\r\nLord Mansfield's, where we slept; fine but rather gloomy. Yesterday\r\nmorning (Tuesday) we left Scone and lunched at Dunkeld, the beginning\r\nof the Highlands, in a tent; _all_ the Highlanders in their fine\r\ndress, being encamped there, and with their old shields and swords,\r\nlooked very romantic; they were chiefly Lord Glenlyon's[79] men.\r\n_He_, poor man! is suddenly become _totally_ blind, and it was very\r\nmelancholy to see him do the _honours_, _not_ seeing _anything_. The\r\nsituation of Dunkeld, down in a valley surrounded by wooded hills,\r\nis very, very pretty. From thence we proceeded to this enchanting\r\nand princely place; the whole drive here was beautiful. All Lord\r\nBreadalbane's[80] Highlanders, with himself at their head, and a\r\nbattalion of the 92nd Highlanders, were drawn up in front of the\r\nHouse. In the evening the grounds were splendidly illuminated, and\r\nbonfires burning on the hills; and a number of Highlanders danced\r\nreels by torchlight, to the bagpipes, which was very wild and\r\npretty....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 77: Lord Breadalbane's house.

Everything\r\nhas gone off so well at Edinburgh, Perth, and elsewhere. This is a\r\nprincely and most beautiful place, and we have been entertained by\r\nLord Breadalbane in a magnificent way. The Highland Volunteers, two\r\nhundred in number (without the officers), keeping guard, are encamped\r\nin the park; the whole place was twice splendidly illuminated, and the\r\nsport he gave the Prince out shooting was on the largest scale.\r\n\r\nThe Highlands and the mountains are too beautiful, and we _must_ come\r\nback for longer another time. The Queen will finish this letter at\r\nDrummond Castle,[81] as we leave this in half an hour.\r\n\r\n_Drummond Castle, 11th._--We arrived here yesterday evening at seven,\r\nhaving had a most beautiful journey. We went with Lord Breadalbane\r\nup the Loch Tay (by water) to Ochmore[82] (I don't know _how_ it is\r\nwritten), a cottage belonging to Lord Breadalbane, close to Killin.\r\nThe morning was very fine, and the view indescribably beautiful; the\r\nmountains so high, and so wooded close to Killin. It is impossible to\r\nsay how kind and attentive Lord Breadalbane and poor Lady Breadalbane\r\n(who is so wretchedly delicate) were to us. We were so sorry to\r\ngo away, and might perhaps have managed to stay two days longer at\r\nTaymouth, were we not fearful of delaying our sea voyage back too\r\nmuch. However, we mean to visit him for longer another time; the\r\nHighlands are so beautiful, and so new to _me_, that we are most\r\nanxious to return there again.\r\n\r\nThe journey from Killin to Comrie was _most_ beautiful, and through\r\nsuch wild scenery--Glen Ogle, which of course Lord Melbourne\r\nknows--and then along Loch Ern. This house is quite a cottage, but\r\nthe situation is fine, and the garden very beautiful. We leave this\r\non Tuesday for Dalkeith[83] where we sleep, and re-embark the next day\r\nfor _England_. We greatly admire the extreme beauty of Edinburgh; the\r\nsituation as well as the town is most striking; and the Prince, who\r\nhas seen so much, says it is the finest town he ever saw. Scone\r\nPalace (where we slept on Tuesday night) is fine, but gloomy; Perth is\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\nThe Queen hopes Lord Melbourne is very well. The Prince begs to be\r\nremembered to him.\r\n\r\nDalkeith is a fine good house, and the park and grounds very pretty.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 81: The seat of Lord Willoughby d'Eresby.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 82: It should be written Auchmore.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 83: The seat of the Duke of Buccleuch.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _20th September 1842._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--Pray accept my best thanks for your kind letter of\r\nthe 15th, which I received on Saturday, the day of our arrival here.\r\nDearest Louise will have told you what I wrote to her. We had a speedy\r\nand prosperous voyage home of forty-eight hours, on board a fine large\r\nand very fast steamer, the _Trident_, belonging to the General Steam\r\nNavigation Company. We found our dear little Victoria so grown and so\r\nimproved, and speaking so plain, and become so independent; I think\r\nreally few children are as forward as she is. She is quite a dear\r\nlittle companion. The Baby is sadly backward, but also grown, and very\r\nstrong. I am so distressed about dearest Louise's still coughing,\r\nbut she tells me it is decreasing. Only pray let her give way to her\r\ngrief; much crying, even if it makes her cough for the moment, can\r\ndo her no real harm, but stifling and swallowing _grief_ (which she\r\n_cannot_ repress) gnaws at the very roots of life and undermines\r\nhealth. Ostend and sea-baths would, I should think, do her good.\r\n\r\nI am very glad that you went to see the King of Prussia, and saw so\r\nmany old friends; Fritz of Mecklenburg[84] is, you know, Albert's very\r\ndear friend; he is just arrived here.\r\n\r\nAlexandrine's brother everybody praises; the whole family are handsome\r\nand well brought up.\r\n\r\nThe Archduke Frederic[85] comes here to-morrow for a week's visit.\r\nEverybody praises him, and Ferdinand liked him very much; all Archduke\r\nCharles's[86] sons are said to be very well brought up. How I wish\r\nArchduke John[87] had come over here!\r\n\r\nNow, dearest Uncle, adieu! and pray believe me, always, your most\r\naffectionate Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\nIt would be _very_ kind of you if you would tell me if there is a\r\nchance of Augustus's marrying Clementine.[88] Don't believe I should\r\nsay a word _against_ it; but I have heard so much about it that I\r\nshould be really and sincerely glad to know a _little_ of the _truth_\r\nfrom _you_.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 84: Frederic William (1819-1904), afterwards Grand\r\n    Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.

It may be doubtful whether the same degree of velocity\r\ncan be attained by means of the screw, particularly in a very large\r\nvessel. Of this a full trial will be made.\r\n\r\nSir John Barrow assures Sir Robert Peel that he has been on board a\r\nsteam-boat moved by the screw, and that the working of the engine is\r\nscarcely perceptible; that there is none of the tremulous motion which\r\naccompanies the beats of the paddles, and that it will be possible to\r\napply an apparatus by means of which the smoke can be consumed, and\r\nthe disagreeable smell in great measure prevented.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel will leave nothing undone to ensure your Majesty's\r\ncomfort and safety in any future naval excursions that your Majesty\r\nmay be pleased to make.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 89: First Lord of the Admiralty.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 90: Barrow had been made second Secretary in 1804\r\n    by Dundas; he was a self-made man, and a most indefatigable\r\n    traveller, writer, and promoter of Arctic exploration.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 91: Admiral of the Fleet Sir George Cockburn\r\n    (1772-1853), First Naval Lord.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: QUEEN ISABELLA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Aberdeen to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_27th September 1842._\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen, with his most humble duty, lays before your Majesty a\r\nletter which he has received from Mr Aston, respecting the marriage\r\nof the Queen of Spain, and which, after what has already passed, may\r\nperhaps cause your Majesty some surprise.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen is humbly of opinion that the language hitherto employed\r\nby your Majesty's Government upon this subject ought not to undergo\r\nany change, and that it ought to be treated entirely as a Spanish\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain would naturally regard a marriage with a son of the King\r\nof the French as injurious to Spain and menacing to Europe, but would\r\nprobably not feel it necessary to give such an opinion respecting any\r\nother alliance. While this might be plainly stated, and the Spanish\r\nGovernment exhorted to act according to their own independent view\r\nof the real interests of the country and of the Queen, Lord Aberdeen\r\nwould humbly propose that the Regent should be explicitly informed by\r\nMr Aston that he must not expect to receive any assistance from your\r\nMajesty's Government in promoting a marriage with a Prince of the\r\nNetherlands.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen believes that the difficulties in the way of such an\r\nalliance will be found to be very great, and especially that the\r\nreligion of the Prince will present an obstacle which in Spain must be\r\nnearly insurmountable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD MELBOURNE ON SCOTLAND]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nBROCKET HALL, _29th September 1842._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has to\r\nacknowledge your Majesty's letter of the 25th inst., which he had the\r\nhonour and pleasure of receiving here on the 27th. Lord Melbourne is\r\nwell aware how much your Majesty's time must have been occupied by the\r\nnumber of visitors at the Castle. We are much rejoiced here that your\r\nMajesty saw the Prince and Princess Liechtenstein.[92] The latter is a\r\ngreat favourite of Lady Beauvale's, to whom she was always very kind,\r\nand who describes her exactly as your Majesty does, as being very\r\n\"amiable and unassuming,\" and though one of the first, if not the\r\nfirst lady at Vienna, as not at all partaking of the insolence and\r\nhauteur which is by some ascribed to the society of that capital. As\r\na beauty, she is perhaps upon too large a scale, except for those who\r\nadmire women of all shapes and sizes; but her eyes and brow are very\r\nfine, and there is a very peculiarly soft and radiant expression about\r\nthem. Lord Melbourne had heard of his Sovereignty, but understands\r\nthat his territory is extremely limited. His possessions as a subject\r\nof Austria are worth a good deal more than his German principality.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne greatly congratulates your Majesty upon the happy\r\nprogress and termination of the expedition to Scotland. He is very\r\nglad of three things--that your Majesty returned by sea, in the\r\nsteamer, and that the passage was a good one....\r\n\r\nThe country is indeed most interesting, full of real picturesque\r\nbeauty and of historical and poetical associations and recollections.\r\nThere is nothing to detract from it, except the very high opinion\r\nthat the Scotch themselves entertain of it. Edinburgh is\r\nmagnificent--situation, buildings, and all--but the boasting of the\r\narticles in the newspapers respecting it almost inclined one to deny\r\nits superiority. It is also, as your Majesty says, most striking to\r\ncontemplate in the Clans the remains of feudal times and institutions.\r\nIt is quite as well, however, particularly for Monarchy, that they are\r\nbut remains, and that no more of them have been left.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne thanks your Majesty much for your kind enquiries after\r\nhis health. He thinks that he is getting better and stronger than he\r\nhas been, and has a notion of trying a little shooting in October.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne begs to be respectfully remembered to the Prince.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 92: Prince Aloysius Joseph of Liechtenstein\r\n    (1796-1858) and his wife, Princess Françoise-de-Paule,\r\n    Countess Kinsky.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _18th October 1842._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I only received your kind letter yesterday, for\r\nwhich my best thanks. I am delighted to hear that Louise's cough is\r\ndecidedly better, and that upon the whole the dear family are well,\r\nthank God! Certainly where He sees fit to afflict, He gives strength\r\nto bear up!\r\n\r\nLouise says Vecto is in great beauty, and the baby magnificent. I wish\r\nyou could see Pussy now; she is (_unberufen_) the picture of health,\r\nand has just cut her first eye-tooth, without the slightest suffering.\r\nWe are going to Brighton on the 1st of November for a month; it is the\r\n_best_ month _there_ and the _worst here_. I think I _may_ announce\r\nAugusta Cambridge's[93] marriage as certain, as I have just received a\r\nnote from the Duke, which is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Being very anxious to communicate to you as soon as possible an event\r\nwhich concerns deeply my family, I take the liberty of requesting you\r\nto let me know on what day and at what hour I may wait upon you.\"\r\n\r\nI shall see him to-morrow, and report the result to Louise on Friday.\r\n\r\nI have just taken leave of poor Esterhazy, who has presented his\r\nletters of recall. He looked wretched, and Lord Aberdeen told me he is\r\nonly ill at being obliged to go; he is quite miserable to do so, but\r\nthe great gentleman at Johannisberg has most ungraciously refused to\r\nlisten to his entreaties to remain, which is very foolish, as they\r\ndon't know who to send in his place. I am _very_ sorry to lose him,\r\nhe is so amiable and agreeable, and I have known him ever since I can\r\nremember anybody; he is, besides, _equally liked_ and on _equally\r\ngood terms_ with _both_ parties _here_, which was of the greatest\r\nimportance. It was touching to see him so low and ill and unlike\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of poor dear Alexandrine's eyes continue _very bad_; she\r\ncannot write at all, or go out, or do anything.\r\n\r\nSay everything proper from us to the whole family, and pray believe\r\nme, always, your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 93: The Princess Augusta of Cambridge, who was\r\n    married to Frederic William, afterwards Grand Duke of\r\n    Mecklenburg-Strelitz, in the following June.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: HISTORICAL STUDIES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nBROCKET HALL, _20th October 1842._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs\r\nleave respectfully to acknowledge your Majesty's of the 15th inst.,\r\nwhich he received here the day before yesterday.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is very glad to hear that your Majesty is reading with\r\nthe Prince. Hallam's work[94] certainly requires much consideration\r\nand much explanation, but it is a fair, solid, impartial work, formed\r\nupon much thought and much reading. St Simon's[95] is an excellent\r\nwork; he has some prejudices, but was a good honest man, and his\r\nbook is full of useful information. If your Majesty wishes for a book\r\nrelating to what passed from one hundred to two hundred years ago,\r\nLord Melbourne would strongly recommend the Private Memoirs of the\r\nLord Chancellor Clarendon (Edward Hyde), not the great work, _The\r\nHistory of the Rebellion_, though that is well worth reading, but the\r\n_Memoirs_, and Bishop Burnet's History of his own time. The reigns\r\nof Charles II., James II., and the Revolution are very curious in\r\nthe latter. During Queen Anne's reign the Bishop was not so much\r\nconsulted, and his work is therefore not so interesting. If your\r\nMajesty wishes to turn your attention to more recent events, Professor\r\nSmyth's[96] lectures upon Modern History, and particularly upon\r\nthe French Revolution, seem to Lord Melbourne sound, fair, and\r\ncomprehensive. Lord Mahon's[97] is also a good work, and gives a good\r\naccount of the reigns of George I. and George II. He has been thought\r\nby some in his last volume to have given too favourable a character of\r\nthe Chevalier, Charles Edward Stuart.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is much touched by what your Majesty says of the\r\nPrincess Royal, and the delight and comfort which your Majesty finds\r\nin her, as well as by the whole picture which your Majesty draws of\r\nyour domestic happiness. When your Majesty refers to what passed\r\nthree years ago, your Majesty may be assured that it is with no small\r\npleasure that Lord Melbourne recalls any share which he may have had\r\nin that transaction, and congratulates himself as well as your Majesty\r\nand the Prince upon results which have been so fortunate both for\r\nyourselves and for the country. Lord Melbourne ventures to hope that\r\nyour Majesty will convey these feelings to the Prince, together with\r\nthe assurance of his respectful remembrance.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 94: The _Constitutional History_, published in\r\n    1827.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 95: Louis Rouffroy, Duc de Saint-Simon, author of\r\n    the celebrated _Mémoires_, published 1829-30.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 96: William Smyth (1765-1849), Regius Professor of\r\n    Modern History at Cambridge.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 97: Afterwards fifth Earl Stanhope: the book\r\n    referred to is his _History of England from the Peace of\r\n    Utrecht to the Peace of Versailles_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: WALMER CASTLE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Duke of Wellington to Sir Robert Peel._\r\n\r\nWALMER CASTLE, _26th October 1842._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR PEEL,--Arbuthnot has shown me your letter to him respecting\r\nthis house.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more convenient to me than to place it at Her Majesty's\r\ndisposition at any time she pleases....\r\n\r\nI am only apprehensive that the accommodation in the Castle would\r\nscarcely be sufficient for Her Majesty, the Prince, and the Royal\r\nchildren, and such suite as must attend....\r\n\r\nIt is the most delightful sea-residence to be found anywhere,\r\nparticularly for children.

Your\r\nopinion respecting George of Hanover's[98] marriage is quite my own,\r\nand I regret that the King does not seem to be inclined to settle it\r\nand fix a day for the celebration of it. I do not know his reasons\r\nagainst it, for I have not heard from him for a long, long time. I am\r\nso sorry to find that the accounts of his health are so indifferent,\r\nand fear he is not careful enough.\r\n\r\nI am happy to hear that you thought the Cambridge visit went off well,\r\nand that the affianced[99] looked and seemed happy. I hope it will\r\nalways be the same, and that the marriage will not be delayed too\r\nlong. I always had imagined that the Duke of Cambridge was rich and\r\nwould give a fortune to his daughters, but I have lately heard that it\r\nis not the case. I do not know what is the usual marriage portion of\r\nan English Princess given by the country. In Germany those portions\r\nare called _die Prinzessin Teuer_.\r\n\r\nWe received 25,000 Fl. each when we married, and 10,000 Fl. for our\r\n_trousseaux_ each.\r\n\r\nIf the young couple are to live in future with the Grand Duke they\r\nwill not want any Plate, but if they are to have a separate _ménage_,\r\nthen they will want it. I shall find it out by and by. I wonder that\r\nthe Duchess likes to part with her fine sapphires. I thought the\r\nturquoises had been intended for Augusta.\r\n\r\nI wish you could see the Convent to which I went the other day. The\r\nnuns belong to the Order of the Cistercian _Trappists_. They are not\r\nallowed to speak amongst themselves--what a relief my visit must\r\nhave been to them!--and they neither eat meat, nor butter, nor\r\neggs--nothing but milk, vegetables and rice. They look healthy, and\r\nthere were several young rather pretty ones amongst them. One, the\r\nbest-looking of them all, Sister Marie Josepha, took me affectionately\r\nby the hand and said, \"I hope the air agrees with you here and that\r\nyou feel better?\" and then she added, \"Come again--will you, before\r\nyou leave this country again?\" She told me that she was born in\r\nIreland and had a German grandfather. She seemed to be the favourite\r\namongst them all, for when I bought of their works and asked them to\r\nmake up my bill, they called Marie Josepha to summon it up, and she\r\nsaid to me, \"Do not stay for that; we will send you your things with\r\nthe bill.\" Two hours after my visit to them I received my things, with\r\na wreath of flowers besides as their gift to me; on the paper attached\r\nto it was written, \"To the Queen-Dowager, from the Reverend Mother and\r\nher Community.\"\r\n\r\nThis old Reverend Mother, the Abbess, was very infirm, and could not\r\nget up from her chair, but she spoke very politely and ladylike to me\r\nin French. She has been forty years in her present _situation_,\r\nand comes from Bretagne. The chaplain of the Convent is also an old\r\nFrenchman, and there are several other French nuns amongst them--one\r\nwho had been condemned to be guillotined in the Revolution, and was\r\nset at liberty just at the moment the execution was to have taken\r\nplace. I should like to know whether these good nuns resumed again at\r\nonce their silence when I left them, or whether they were permitted to\r\ntalk over the events of that day.... Your most affectionately devoted\r\nAunt,\r\n\r\nADELAIDE.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 98: Afterwards King George V. of Hanover.

Many thanks for your most kind and amiable letter of the 28th,\r\nwhich I received yesterday. The prospect of the possibility of dearest\r\nLouise's spending some time with us _quite enchants_ us, and I hope\r\nand trust that you will carry your plan into execution. Our plans,\r\nwhich we only settled last night, are as follows:--the scarlet fever\r\nis on the decrease at Brighton, but not sufficiently so to justify our\r\ngoing there immediately; so we therefore intend going to Walmer with\r\nthe children, but a very reduced suite (as the house is considerably\r\nsmaller than Claremont), on the 10th, and to stay there till the 22nd\r\ninst., when we shall go to Brighton and remain there till the 13th of\r\nDecember. Now if dearest Louise would meet us there then, and\r\nperhaps come back with us here for a little while _then_?

It is difficult to\r\nestimate the moral effect which these victories may produce, not\r\non Asia merely, but throughout Europe also. At the same moment your\r\nMajesty has brought to a triumphant issue two gigantic operations,\r\none in the centre of Asia, the other in the heart of the hitherto\r\nunapproachable Chinese Empire. In the former, past disasters have\r\nbeen retrieved; a signal victory has been achieved on the very spot\r\nmemorable for former failure and massacre; the honour of the British\r\nArms has been signally vindicated; the interests of humanity have been\r\nconsulted by the rescue of the whole of the prisoners; and, after a\r\nseries of victories, the Governor-General of India is free, without\r\ndiscredit, to enter upon measures of internal improvement, and having\r\nestablished the supremacy of British power, to carry on henceforth a\r\nmore pacific policy.\r\n\r\nIn China a termination has been put to the effusion of blood by the\r\nsignature of a treaty which has placed your Majesty's dominions on a\r\nfooting never recognised in favour of any foreign Power--a footing\r\nof perfect equality with the Chinese Empire; which has obtained large\r\nindemnity for the past, and ample security for the future, and which\r\nhas opened to British enterprise the commerce of China to an extent\r\nwhich it is almost impossible to anticipate.

I do not think, or I may say I am pretty\r\ncertain, because I have often seen Donna Maria's letters, they hardly\r\never speak of politics, except just saying that they are surrounded by\r\nsuch very sad people without honour or honesty. I am sure they are\r\nnot French at Lisbon beyond the kindly feelings which result from the\r\nrecollection of Donna Maria's stay at Paris. My constant advice has\r\nbeen to look exclusively to the closest alliance with England, and\r\nFerdinand is now _well aware_ of it; but you know that the Liberal\r\nparty tried to even harm him by representing him as a _mere_ creature\r\nof England. We live in odd times when really one very often thinks\r\npeople mad; their _uncontrouled_ passions do not develop\r\namiable feelings, but on the contrary everything that is bad and\r\nunreasonable....\r\n\r\nYou are a very affectionate and kind Mamma, which is very\r\npraiseworthy; may Heaven preserve your dear little children! Victoria\r\nis very clever, and it will give you great pleasure to see the\r\ndevelopment which takes place with children just at that time of life.\r\nWhat you say of Ernest is unfortunately but too true; that trick of\r\nexaggeration is one of the worst I almost know, and particularly in\r\npeople in high stations, as one finally knows not what to believe,\r\nand it generally ends with people disbelieving all such individuals do\r\nsay....

So earnest is the desire of the Hindoos and of all who are not\r\nMussulmans to recover the gates of the Temple, that when ten or twelve\r\nyears ago Runjeet Singh was making arrangements with Shah Sooja for\r\nassisting him in the endeavour to recover his throne,[111] he wished\r\nto make a stipulation that when Shah Sooja recovered his power he\r\nshould restore the gates to India, and Shah Sooja refused.\r\n\r\nLord Ellenborough transmits for your Majesty's information a copy of\r\nthe Address he intends to publish on announcing that the gates of the\r\nTemple will be restored.[112]\r\n\r\nThe progress of the gates from Ferozepore to Somnauth will be one\r\ngreat national triumph, and their restoration to India will endear the\r\nGovernment to the whole people.[113]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 110: See _ante_, p. 441, note 107.\r\n      (Ch.

I can report very favourably of the healths of young and\r\nold; we are all very flourishing, and have since yesterday perfectly\r\n_May_ weather.

Why attempt to ruin a country (which they\r\nluckily _cannot succeed_ in) merely out of personal dislike to a man\r\nwho certainly has proved himself capable of keeping the country quiet,\r\nand certainly is by far the _most honest_ Spaniard in existence,\r\nwhatever crimes or faults the French may choose to bring against him.\r\nAnd what will be the effect of all this? A total dislike and mistrust\r\nof France, and a still closer alliance with England. I have spoken\r\nthus freely, as a repetition of last year's scenes is _too much_ to\r\nremain silent, and as I have ever been privileged to tell you, dearest\r\nUncle, my feelings, and the truth.\r\n\r\nPoor Lord Hill's death, though fully expected, will grieve you, as it\r\nhas grieved us.\r\n\r\nI am much amused at what you say about Charles, and shall tell it him,\r\nwhen I write to him.

It\r\nenables those legally entitled to the patronage to present a clergyman\r\nto the Living, but the Church Courts have the power, on valid\r\nobjections being made and duly sustained by the parishioners, to set\r\naside the presentation of the patron, and to require from him a new\r\nnomination.\r\n\r\nThe Church, however, requires the absolute repeal of the Act of Anne.\r\n\r\nAn answer to the demands of the Church will now become requisite.\r\n\r\nSir James Graham has been in communication with the law advisers of\r\nyour Majesty in Scotland upon the legal questions involved in this\r\nmatter, and will shortly send for your Majesty's consideration the\r\ndraft of a proposed answer to the General Assembly.[117]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 116: The famous Auchterarder case had decided that,\r\n    notwithstanding the vetoing by the congregation of the nominee\r\n    of the patron, the Presbytery must take him on trial if\r\n    qualified by life, learning, and doctrine,--in other words,\r\n    that the Act of Anne, subjecting the power of the Presbytery\r\n    to the control of the law courts, was not superseded by the\r\n    Veto Act, a declaration made by the General Assembly. In the\r\n    Strathbogie case, a minister had been nominated to Marnock,\r\n    and 261 out of 300 heads of families had objected to him.

He has been\r\nmuch delighted this morning by receiving your Majesty's letter of\r\nthe 28th. He was the more gratified, as he had begun to be a little\r\nannoyed at being such a very long time without hearing from your\r\nMajesty.\r\n\r\nLord Mahon has sent Lord Melbourne his book.[120] Lord Melbourne has\r\nnot yet read it, but he has read the review of it in the _Quarterly_,\r\nwhich seems to be a sort of abstract or abridgment of the book.\r\nThe effect of writing it in French has naturally been to direct all\r\nattention and criticism from the merits of the work to the faults of\r\nthe French. People who have read the work speak of it as entertaining,\r\nand the times are curious and interesting. The characters engaged in\r\nthem, striking and remarkable. Lord Melbourne is very glad to hear\r\nthat Pottinger's conduct is so universally approved. He always\r\nappeared to Lord Melbourne to be a man of great ability, resolution\r\nand discretion, and Lord Melbourne much rejoices that he has turned\r\nout so.\r\n\r\nHallam's opinions Lord Melbourne believes to be in general sound,\r\nand such as have been held and approved by the most able and\r\nconstitutional statesmen in this country.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is much rejoiced to hear of the Princess and the Prince\r\nof Wales, and also that your Majesty is pursuing your studies quietly,\r\ncheerfully, and happily.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is very sensible of the interest which the Baron takes\r\nin his health and which he warmly reciprocates. There is no man whom\r\nhe esteems more, nor of whose head and heart he has a better opinion.\r\n\r\nWe expect here to-morrow the Duchess of Sutherland[121] and Lady\r\nElizabeth Gower,[122] who have been kind enough to propose to pay Lord\r\nMelbourne a visit.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 120: _Essai sur la vie du grand Condé_, afterwards\r\n    published in English.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 121: Formerly Mistress of the Robes.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 122: Afterwards Duchess of Argyll.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\r\n\r\nTO CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nRepeated debates took place during the year (1843) on the Corn Laws,\r\nthe agitation against them steadily growing, Mr Cobden coming on one\r\noccasion into violent conflict with the Premier. The events of\r\nthe previous year in Afghanistan were also the subject of constant\r\ndiscussion in Parliament. A movement of some importance took place in\r\nWales in opposition to the increasing number of toll-bars, bands\r\nof rioters dressed in women's clothes and known as \"Rebecca and her\r\ndaughters,\" demolishing the gates and committing acts of greater or\r\nless violence. A verse in Genesis (xxiv. 60) fancifully applied gave\r\nrise to this name and disguise.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland the system of private patronage in the Established Kirk\r\nhad become very unpopular, the Act of Anne in favour of the nomination\r\nby lay patrons, and the control given to the Law Courts over the\r\nrevising action of the Presbytery being ultimately modified by a\r\ndeclaration of the General Assembly known as the Veto Act. But it\r\nwas decided in what was called the Strathbogie case that the veto was\r\nillusory, the disruption of the old Kirk followed, and on 18th May Dr\r\nChalmers and five hundred other ministers seceded from it in order to\r\nform the Free Church.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland the agitation for Repeal was at its height. O'Connell,\r\nsupported by the _Nation_ newspaper, founded a Repeal Association in\r\nDublin, and monster meetings were held on Sundays on some conspicuous\r\nspot of free and historic associations to claim the re-establishment\r\nof a Parliament on College Green. It was believed that a quarter of\r\na million people were present on one occasion, and the Government,\r\nalarmed at the absolute power wielded by O'Connell over these huge\r\nbodies of men, resolved to prohibit the meetings, and somewhat tardily\r\nissued a Proclamation against that announced for Clontarf on 8th\r\nOctober. O'Connell accordingly disbanded the meeting, but his action\r\ndid not please his more zealous supporters, and his ascendency came\r\nto an end. The agitation collapsed and the principal actors were\r\narrested.\r\n\r\nA military duel fought in the summer of this year, in which a colonel\r\nin the Army was shot by his brother-in-law, made the code of honour\r\nexisting on the subject a burning question, the criminal law of\r\nhomicide being the same then as now. On Prince Albert's suggestion,\r\nthe question was taken up by the heads of the Army and Navy, and the\r\nArticles of War were in the following year amended so as to admit of\r\nan apology and a tender of redress.\r\n\r\nThe better feeling existing between this country and France enabled\r\nthe Queen and Prince to visit Louis Philippe at the Château d'Eu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n1843\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _4th January 1843._\r\n\r\nDEAREST UNCLE,--...

We are _all_\r\nso particularly well, including Pussy, that we intend, to my great\r\ndelight, to prolong our stay till next Monday. This place has a\r\npeculiar charm for us both, and to me it brings back recollections\r\nof the _happiest_ days of my otherwise _dull_ childhood--where I\r\nexperienced such kindness from you, dearest Uncle, which has ever\r\nsince continued. It is true that my _last_ stay here _before_ I came\r\nto the Throne, from November '36 to February '37, was a peculiarly\r\npainful and disagreeable one, but somehow or other, I do _not_ think\r\nof those times, but only of all the former _so_ happy ones. Victoria\r\nplays with my old bricks, etc., and I think you would be pleased to\r\nsee this and to see her _running_ and jumping in the flower garden, as\r\n_old_--though I fear _still little_--_Victoria of former days_ used\r\nto do. She is very well, and such an amusement to us, that I can't\r\nbear to move without her; she is _so_ funny and speaks so well, and in\r\nFrench also, she knows almost everything; she would therefore get on\r\nfamously with Charlotte....\r\n\r\nMight I ask you some questions about Joinville's match,[1] which\r\ninterests me much? First of all, _have_ you heard of his arrival at\r\nRio? Secondly, if the Donna Francesca pleases, is he empowered _at\r\nonce to make the demand_, or must he write home first? How nice it\r\nwould be if the _two_ marriages could take place at _once_; but I\r\nsuppose, under any circumstances, that could _not_ be....\r\n\r\nAlexandrine is nearly quite recovered; she writes such pretty,\r\naffectionate, kind letters, poor dear child, and is so fond of Ernest.\r\nI must say I think _he_ seems improved, as he likes to live _quietly_\r\nwith her, and speaks of her too with the greatest affection.\r\n\r\nNow, my dearest Uncle, let me take my leave, begging you to believe\r\nme, always, your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: He was married to the Princess Francesca of\r\n    Brazil on 1st May.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: HISTORICAL READING]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nBROCKET HALL, _12th January 1843._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and thanks\r\nyour Majesty much for your letter of the 9th inst. which he received\r\nyesterday. Every letter that he receives from your Majesty brings back\r\nto his mind the recollection of times, which, though they were clouded\r\nwith much care and anxiety, were still to Lord Melbourne a period of\r\nmuch happiness and satisfaction....\r\n\r\nHallam has not written a History of the Church, but in all his books\r\nthere is necessarily much about the Church, and much that is worthy of\r\nmention. A short History of the Church is, Lord Melbourne fears, not\r\nto be found, the subject is so large and so difficult that it cannot\r\nbe treated shortly. Dr Short[2] has written and published a clever,\r\nbrief, and distinct summary, but it relates principally to the Church\r\nof England, and in order to be fully understood, requires to be read\r\nby one who has already some acquaintance with the subject.\r\n\r\nThe book which your Majesty remembers Lord Melbourne reading is\r\nthe production of Dr Waddington,[3] whom your Majesty, under Lord\r\nMelbourne's recommendation, made Dean of Durham, which dignity he now\r\nholds. It is a very good book.\r\n\r\nAdolphus's[4] History is by no means a bad book, and will give your\r\nMajesty the facts of the beginning of the reign of George III. well\r\nand accurately enough. The Duke of Sussex once told Lord Melbourne\r\nthat he had asked his father whether Adolphus's account of the\r\nbeginning of his reign was correct, and that the King had replied that\r\nsubstantially it was so, but that there were some mistakes, and that\r\nwhat had been done by one person was often attributed to another.\r\nAdolphus's History will receive some illustration from Horace\r\nWalpole's letters of that period....\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne thinks that he is really getting rid of the gout, and\r\ngathering strength. He still has some doubt whether he shall be able\r\nto go up for the meeting of Parliament.

As you take so kind an interest in our\r\ndear Thesy,[5] I send you a letter which I have received from her\r\nmother-in-law, with an excellent account of her and her infant. Her\r\nhappiness is a great blessing, and I thank God that she is so well\r\nthis time. Can you imagine her with _two boys_? It seems so odd, for\r\nit is but a short time since she was here with us. How time flies\r\nrapidly. I own I was not a little surprised to find that you are\r\nprobably the godmother; or is the little boy only to be named after\r\nyou? I remember well what you said to me when I was asked to be the\r\ngodmother of the first boy, \"_that I could not accept it_,\" as I\r\nmust not take the responsibilities attached to a sponsor with a Roman\r\nCatholic child. On that ground alone, and having learned your opinion\r\nwhich sanctioned my own, I refused it then at the risk of offending\r\nthe dear parents. Now, after all that was said on the subject, if _you\r\nhave accepted_ the offer of becoming sponsor to this little _Victor_,\r\nYOU, as the Head of the English Church, give to understand that _I_\r\nwas wrong in my notions of the duties which our Church imposes upon\r\nsponsors, having refused what you accepted. I tell you fairly\r\nand openly that it has vexed me, but of course I say this only to\r\n_yourself_, dearest Victoria, and not to any one else, for it does not\r\nbecome me to find fault with what you please to do. But I could not\r\nentirely pass it over in silence, and regret that my former refusal\r\nmust now become doubly annoying to my relations. I beg your pardon for\r\nthus frankly stating my feelings to you on a subject which I shall\r\nnow despatch from my mind, and I trust you will not take it ill,\r\nand excuse me for having mentioned it to you _alone_....

I never remember even _talking_ to _you_ on\r\nthe subject, but only heard from Mamma that _you_ had refused doing\r\nso--which I was surprised at. I therefore felt no hesitation in\r\naccepting the offer of Thesy, particularly as I am already godmother\r\nto one of the children of Prince Esterhazy's daughter. I am grieved,\r\ndearest Aunt, that this occurrence should annoy you, but I can\r\n_assure_ you that I do not remember _ever_ having spoken to you on the\r\nsubject at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: GOVERNOR-GENERALSHIP OF CANADA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord Stanley to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nDOWNING STREET, _19th January 1843._\r\n\r\nLord Stanley, with his humble duty, submits to your Majesty that in\r\npursuance of the permission which your Majesty was pleased to give\r\nhim personally, he has this day offered to Sir Charles Metcalfe[6] the\r\nGovernor-Generalship of Canada; and Lord Stanley has much satisfaction\r\nin adding that the offer has been readily and thankfully accepted.\r\nThis appointment, Lord Stanley is convinced, is, under the\r\ncircumstances, the best which could have been made, and he believes\r\nnot only that it will be generally approved, but that Sir Charles\r\nMetcalfe's long experience and tried discretion will afford the best\r\nprospect of conducting the affairs of Canada safely and successfully\r\nthrough the present crisis. As Sir Charles Metcalfe will naturally be\r\nanxious previous to his embarkation (which, however, will probably\r\nnot take place for at least six weeks) to have the honour of being\r\npresented to your Majesty on his appointment, Lord Stanley hopes he\r\nmay be honoured by your Majesty's commands as to the time when it may\r\nbe your Majesty's pleasure to admit him to an audience.

I have just left Mr Drummond's house. No vital part\r\nappears to have been injured, and there is no unfavourable symptom\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nThe assassin gives his name _MacNaghten_, and appears to be a Glasgow\r\nman.\r\n\r\nTwo five-pound notes were, I understand, found upon his person, and\r\na receipt for £750 given to Daniel MacNaghten, confirming, therefore,\r\nthe man's account of his name.\r\n\r\nWe have not hitherto been able to discover that this man had any\r\nalleged grievance or complaint against the Treasury or any public\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nHe has been loitering about the public offices for the last fortnight,\r\nand being questioned, I understand, some days since, by the Office\r\nKeeper of the Council office, said he was a policeman.

It will be most unfortunate indeed if the Law does not attach\r\nits severest penalty to a crime so premeditated and so deliberately\r\nand savagely perpetrated, as that of MacNaghten.\r\n\r\nThe Jury are, however, the sole judges on this point, that is to say,\r\nit rests with them exclusively, either to find an absolute verdict of\r\nguilty of murder, or to acquit on the ground of insanity.\r\n\r\nMacNaghten will be charged with the offence of murder, and every\r\neffort will be made to bring him to condign punishment.\r\n\r\nHis counsel will probably endeavour to establish his insanity.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more collected and intelligent in many respects than\r\nhis conduct in prison. He was conversing with the gaoler, and seemed\r\nnot disinclined to unburden his mind, when he suddenly stopped and\r\nenquired from the gaoler whether such conversations as that which he\r\nwas holding went beyond the prison walls.\r\n\r\nOn being informed that no security could be given that they would\r\nremain secret, he said he should hold his tongue, but that all would\r\ncome out by and by.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel takes the liberty of enclosing for your Majesty's\r\nperusal a note which he has just received from Miss Emily Eden, sister\r\nof Lord Auckland, and of Mrs Charles Drummond.\r\n\r\nIf it should be in your Majesty's power to assign apartments at some\r\nfuture period to Miss Drummond, who lived with her brother Edward, and\r\nwas mainly dependent upon him, it would be a very great comfort to a\r\nlady of the most unexceptionable conduct, and most deeply attached to\r\nher poor brother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nBROCKET HALL, _25th January 1843._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.

The assassination of Mr Drummond, for Lord Melbourne fears it\r\nmust be called so, is indeed a dreadful thing. Lord Melbourne is\r\nnot surprised, for people are very apt to turn all their wrath and\r\nindignation upon the man from whom they actually receive an answer\r\nwhich they do not like, without in the least considering whether he\r\nis really responsible for it. Lord Melbourne used often to be himself\r\nassailed with threats of personal violence. Sometimes he took notice\r\nof them by swearing the peace against those who used them, and having\r\nthem bound over in sureties. Sometimes he disregarded them, but he\r\ndoes not think it either prudent or justifiable entirely to neglect\r\nsuch intimations. Lord Melbourne does not wonder that this event\r\nbrings to your Majesty's recollection what has taken place in your own\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nHallam is, in Lord Melbourne's opinion, right about Ireland. Her\r\nadvocates are very loud in their outcry, but she has not really much\r\nto complain of.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne was very glad to hear of the marriage of Prince\r\nAugustus of Coburg with the Princess Clémentine, as he apprehends that\r\nthe connection must be very agreeable to your Majesty.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne begs to be respectfully and affectionately remembered\r\nto His Royal Highness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: COMMITTAL OF MACNAGHTEN]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir James Graham to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWHITEHALL, _28th January 1843._\r\n\r\nSir James Graham, with humble duty, begs to inform your Majesty, that\r\nthe prisoner Daniel MacNaghten was fully committed for trial this\r\nafternoon. He was not defended before the Magistrates; but in his\r\nmanner he was quite cool, intelligent, and collected; he asked no\r\nquestions, but he expressed a wish to have copies of the Depositions.\r\n\r\nHis trial will probably commence on Friday or Saturday next, and there\r\nis reason to believe that, at the request of his relatives in Glasgow,\r\ncounsel will be retained, and that the plea of insanity will be raised\r\nin his defence.[8]\r\n\r\nEvery preparation is in progress to meet this vague and dangerous\r\nexcuse. It will turn out that the pistols were bought at Paisley by\r\nMacNaghten on the 6th of August last; and information has reached\r\nSir James Graham, which, he thinks, will prove that MacNaghten is a\r\nChartist, that he has attended political meetings at Glasgow, and\r\nthat he has taken a violent part in politics. He yesterday saw a\r\nPresbyterian clergyman, who prayed with him; who pointed out the\r\natrocity of his crime, the innocence of his victim, the pangs\r\nof sorrowing relatives, and who exhorted him to contrition and\r\nrepentance. Some impression was made at the moment; but his general\r\ndemeanour is marked by cold reserve and hardness of heart.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: He was defended by four counsel, including Mr\r\n    Cockburn, afterwards Lord Chief Justice.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE ROYAL FAMILY AND POLITICS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nBROCKET HALL, _2nd February 1843._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and thanks\r\nmuch for the letter of the 30th ult., which he received here yesterday\r\nmorning. He believes it is more prudent not to go to London, but he\r\ngreatly regrets that his not doing so will deprive him for so long a\r\ntime of the honour and pleasure of seeing your Majesty.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Sussex acquainted Lord Melbourne and took his opinion\r\nbefore he issued his cards for the dinner. Lord Melbourne does not\r\nthink that he can have any idea of playing the part to which Lord\r\nErroll alluded. It is better that a dinner should be given somewhere.\r\nHe having nothing of the kind would look too much like giving up\r\nthe whole business and disbanding the party. Lord Melbourne entirely\r\nagrees with your Majesty as to the political conduct which ought to be\r\npursued by the members of the Royal Family, but he remembers no time\r\nin which they have been induced to act with so much prudence and\r\npropriety. Your Majesty will see in Adolphus the very prominent share\r\nwhich the Duke of Cumberland,[9] the General of Culloden, took in the\r\nParty contentions of those days. He was a strong partisan and in a\r\ngreat measure the founder of the Whig party. Lord Melbourne has often\r\nheard George IV. converse upon that subject, and he used to contend\r\nthat it was quite impossible for a Prince of Wales in this country to\r\navoid taking an active part in politics and political contentions. The\r\nfact is, that George III. did not discourage this in his own family\r\nsufficiently, and the King of Hanover always said that his father had\r\nencouraged him in the active part which he took, and which certainly\r\nwas sufficiently objectionable.\r\n\r\nThe assassination of Drummond is indeed a horrible event. Lord\r\nMelbourne does not see as yet any clear, distinct, and certain\r\nevidence of what were the real motives and object of the man. But we\r\nshall hear upon his trial what it is that he urges. Your Majesty will,\r\nof course, recollect that the Jury acquitted Oxford, and there then\r\nwas nothing to do but to acquiesce in the verdict. If the Jury should\r\ntake a similar view of this man's crime, it will be impossible for\r\nthe Government to do anything to remedy the evil which Lord Melbourne\r\nthinks will be caused by such a decision. Lord Melbourne knew Mr\r\nDrummond pretty well. He used formerly to be much in Hertfordshire,\r\nboth at Hatfield and at Gorhambury, and Lord Melbourne has often met\r\nhim at both places, and thought him with all the rest of the world, a\r\nvery quiet, gentlemanly, and agreeable man. Lord Melbourne very well\r\nremembers the murder of Mr Perceval and Bellingham's trial. Lord\r\nMelbourne was then in the House of Commons, but was not present at the\r\ntime the crime was perpetrated. There were differences of opinion as\r\nto the manner in which Sir James Mansfield conducted the trial. Many\r\nthought that he ought to have given more time, which was asked for\r\non the part of the prisoner, in order to search for evidence at\r\nLiverpool. But the law which he laid down in his charge is certainly\r\nsound, correct, and reasonable. Lord Melbourne is very glad to think\r\nthat your Majesty has not to go to the House of Lords to-day.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: This Duke died unmarried in 1765, and his nephew,\r\n    the fourth son of Frederick, Prince of Wales, was created Duke\r\n    of Cumberland in 1766. He in his turn died without issue, in\r\n    1790, and in 1799 the fifth son of George III. (afterwards\r\n    King of Hanover) received the same title.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE AMERICAN TREATY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nBROCKET HALL, _3rd February 1843._\r\n\r\n... Lord Melbourne thinks that the Speech was very well and\r\njudiciously drawn; the only paragraph which he does not like is that\r\nabout the American treaty.[10] It betrays too great an anxiety for\r\npeace, and too much fear of war.[11]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 10: See _ante_, pp. 368, 370 (Ch.

I am very much gratified by your having\r\nshown my hasty scrawl to Sir Robert Peel, and that the sincere\r\nexpression of a conscientious opinion should have given him pleasure.\r\n\r\nIt was natural at first that you should _not_ have liked to take him\r\nas your Premier; many circumstances united against him. But I must\r\nsay for you and your family, as well as for England, it was a great\r\nblessing that so firm and honourable a man as Peel should have become\r\nthe head of your Administration. The State machine breaks often down\r\nin consequence of mistakes made forty and fifty years ago; so it was\r\nin France where even Louis XIV. had already laid the first foundation\r\nfor what happened nearly a hundred years afterwards.\r\n\r\nI believe, besides, Sir Robert sincerely and warmly attached to you,\r\nand as you say with great truth, _quite above_ mere party feeling.\r\nPoor Lady Peel must be much affected by what has happened.... Your\r\ntruly devoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nBROCKET HALL, _12th February 1843._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. He received\r\nhere on Friday last, the 10th, your Majesty's letter of the 8th,\r\nwhich gave him great pleasure, and for which he gratefully thanks your\r\nMajesty. Lord Melbourne is getting better, and hopes soon to be nearly\r\nas well as he was before this last attack, but he still finds his\r\nleft hand and arm and his left leg very much affected, and he does not\r\nrecover his appetite, and worse still, he is very sleepless at night,\r\nan evil which he is very little used to, and of which he is very\r\nimpatient....\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne adheres to all he said about Lord Ashburton and the\r\nTreaty, but he thinks more fire than otherwise would have taken place\r\nwas drawn upon Lord Ashburton by the confident declaration of Stanley\r\nthat his appointment was generally approved. The contrary is certainly\r\nthe case. There is much of popular objection to him from his American\r\nconnection and his supposed strong American interests. Lady Ashburton,\r\nwith whom he received a large fortune, is a born American. But he is\r\nsupposed to possess much funded property in that country, and to\r\nhave almost as strong an interest in its welfare as in that of Great\r\nBritain. With all this behind, it is a bad thing to say that his\r\nappointment was liable to no suspicion or objection. It seems to Lord\r\nMelbourne that what with Ellenborough with the Gates of Ghuznee upon\r\nhis shoulders,[13] and Ashburton with the American Treaty round his\r\nneck, the Ministry have nearly as heavy a load upon them as they can\r\nstand up under, and Lord Melbourne would not be surprised if they were\r\nto lighten themselves of one or the other.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 13: The Somnauth Proclamation created a good deal of\r\n    ridicule.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: POSITION OF THE PRINCE OF WALES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nBROCKET HALL, _13th February 1843._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has just\r\nrecollected that in the letter which he wrote yesterday, he omitted\r\nto advert to a part of your Majesty's last to which your Majesty may\r\nexpect some answer. He means the part relating to the character and\r\nsituation of a Prince of Wales in this country. George IV. was so\r\nconscious of having mixed himself most unrestrainedly in politics,\r\nand of having taken a very general part in opposition to his father's\r\nGovernment and wishes, that he was naturally anxious to exonerate\r\nhimself from blame, and to blame it upon the necessity of his position\r\nrather than upon his own restless and intermeddling disposition. But\r\nLord Melbourne agrees with your Majesty that his excuse was neither\r\nvalid nor justifiable, and Lord Melbourne earnestly hopes that your\r\nMajesty and the Prince may be successful in training and instructing\r\nthe young Prince of Wales, and to make him understand correctly his\r\nreal position and its duties, and to enable him to withstand the\r\ntemptations and seductions with which he will find himself beset, when\r\nhe approaches the age of twenty-one. It is true that Sir John made the\r\nobservation, which Lord Melbourne mentioned to your Majesty, and which\r\nyou now remember correctly. He made it to Sir James Graham, when he\r\nwent to talk to him about the offence which William IV. had taken at\r\nthe Duchess of Kent's marine excursion; and at the receiving of\r\nroyal salutes. Your Majesty was not very long in the situation of\r\nan acknowledged, admitted, and certain Heir Apparent, but still long\r\nenough to be aware of the use which those around you were inclined to\r\nmake of that situation and of the petitions and applications which it\r\nnaturally produced from others, and therefore to have an idea of the\r\ndifficulties of it.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne heartily wishes your Majesty every success in the\r\ninteresting and important task in which you are engaged of forming the\r\ncharacter and disposition of the young Prince.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DOMESTIC HAPPINESS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Adelaide to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCANFORD HOUSE, _14th February 1843._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST NIECE,--Your delightful letter of Tuesday gave me such\r\npleasure and satisfaction that I must thank you with all my heart for\r\nit.

I pray that your\r\ndomestic happiness may last uninterruptedly, and that you may enjoy it\r\nthrough a long, long period of _many, many years_. You cannot say too\r\nmuch of _yourself_ and dear Albert when you write to me, for it is a\r\nmost interesting subject to my heart, I assure you.\r\n\r\nWhat a _shame_ to have put on darling little Victoria a _powdered\r\nwig_!

I am only a little wee bit distressed at your\r\nwriting _on the 10th_, and not taking any notice of the _dearest,\r\nhappiest_ day in my life, to which I owe the present _great_ domestic\r\nhappiness I now enjoy, and which is much greater than I deserve,\r\nthough certainly my Kensington life for the last six or seven years\r\nhad been one of great misery and oppression, and I may expect some\r\nlittle retribution, and, indeed, _after_ my accession, there was a\r\ngreat deal of worry. Indeed I _am_ grateful for possessing (_really\r\nwithout_ vanity or flattery or _blindness_) the _most perfect_ being\r\nas a husband in existence, or who ever did exist; and I doubt whether\r\nanybody _ever_ did love or respect another as I do my dear Angel! And\r\nindeed Providence has ever mercifully protected us, through manifold\r\ndangers and trials, and I feel confident will continue to do so, and\r\nthen let outward storms and trials and sorrows be sent us, and we can\r\nbear all....\r\n\r\nI could not help smiling at the exactitude about Monday the 19th\r\nof June; it is a great happiness to us to think with such certainty\r\n(_D.V._) of your kind visit, which would suit perfectly. _À propos_ of\r\nthis, I am anxious to tell you that we are full of hope of paying you\r\nin August a little visit, which last year was in so melancholy a way\r\ninterrupted; but we think that for _many_ reasons it would be better\r\nfor us to pay you our _first_ visit only at _Ostend_, and not at\r\nBrussels or Laeken; you could lodge us _anywhere_, and we need then\r\nbring but very few people with us--it might also facilitate the\r\nmeeting with Albert's good old grandmother, who fears to cross the\r\nsea, and whose great _wish_ is to behold Albert again--and would\r\nnot be so difficult (_pour la lère fois_) in many ways. I could,\r\nnevertheless, see Bruges and Ghent from thence by help of the\r\nrailroad, and return the same day to Ostend.\r\n\r\nWhat you say about Peel is very just. Good Lord Melbourne is much\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nI hope soon to hear more about Joinville and Donna Francesca. Now,\r\never your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\nWe are all very well (_unberufen_) and move, _to our horror_, to town\r\non Friday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: COBDEN'S ATTACK ON PEEL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir Robert Peel to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWHITEHALL, _18th February (1843)._\r\n\r\n(_Saturday morning._)\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs\r\nleave to acquaint your Majesty that the debate was brought to a\r\nclose this morning about half-past three o'clock.

Cobden and Lord John Russell in favour\r\nof the motion, Mr Attwood, Lord Francis Egerton, and Sir Robert Peel\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the evening there was much excitement and animated\r\ndiscussion, in consequence of the speech of Mr Cobden, who is the\r\nchief patron of the Anti-Corn Law League.\r\n\r\nMr Cobden with great vehemence of manner observed more than once that\r\nSir Robert Peel ought to be held _individually responsible_ for the\r\ndistress of the country.[15]\r\n\r\nCoupling these expressions with the language frequently held at the\r\nmeetings of the Anti-Corn Law League, and by the press in connection\r\nwith it, Sir Robert Peel in replying to Mr Cobden charged him with\r\nholding language calculated to excite to personal violence.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 14: To go into Committee on the depression of the\r\n    manufacturing industry.

He received\r\nsafely your Majesty's letter of the 18th inst. Lord Melbourne entreats\r\nyour Majesty that you never will think for a moment that you can\r\ntire him by questions, or that it can be to him anything but a great\r\npleasure to answer them. He will be only too happy if any information\r\nthat he possesses or can procure can be of the least use or pleasure\r\nto your Majesty. Lord Melbourne conceives that your Majesty must be\r\nsurprised at his complaining of sleeplessness. He is much obliged by\r\nthe suggestion of the camphor. He mentioned it to the gentleman who\r\nattends him, and he said that it was a very good thing, and certainly\r\nhas a soothing and quieting effect, and that in fact there was some\r\nin the draught which Lord Melbourne now takes at night. But Lord\r\nMelbourne has taken to going down to dinner with those who are in the\r\nhouse, and sitting up afterwards until near twelve o'clock, and since\r\nhe has done this he has slept better. We expect the Duke and Duchess\r\nof Bedford for two nights on Wednesday next. Lord and Lady Uxbridge\r\nand Ella and Constance often come over in the morning and eat their\r\nluncheon here, which Lord Melbourne takes very kindly of them. George\r\nByng[17] came the other morning in a waistcoat of Peel's velveteen.\r\nLord Strafford brought the whole piece off the manufacturer, and let\r\nGeorge Byng have enough for a waistcoat. It is a dull blue stuff, and\r\nthe device and inscription not very clear nor easy to make out.[18]\r\n\r\nAdolphus is, as Aberdeen says, too rigidly Tory, but there are plenty\r\nof narratives of the same period, such as Belsham[19] and others, of\r\nwhom it may be said with equal truth that they are too Whig....\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne read the _Edinburgh_ on Madame d'Arblay, which is\r\ncertainly Macaulay's, but thought it unnecessarily severe upon Queen\r\nCharlotte, and that it did not do her justice, and also that it rather\r\ncountenanced too much Miss Burney's dislike to her situation. It\r\nappears to Lord Melbourne that Miss Burney was well enough contented\r\nto live in the Palace and receive her salary, but that she was\r\nsurprised and disgusted as soon as she found that she was expected to\r\ngive up some part of her time to conform to some rules, and to perform\r\nsome duty. Lord Melbourne is sorry to say that he missed the article\r\non Children's Books,[20] a subject of much importance, and in which he\r\nis much interested.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne has received the engraving of the Princess, and is\r\nmuch pleased by it, and returns many thanks.

We have seen the\r\ntrials of Oxford and MacNaghten conducted by the ablest lawyers of the\r\nday--Lord Denman, Chief Justice Tindal, and Sir Wm. Follett,[25]--and\r\n_they allow_ and _advise_ the Jury to pronounce the verdict of _Not\r\nGuilty_ on account of _Insanity_,--whilst _everybody_ is morally\r\n_convinced_ that both malefactors were perfectly conscious and aware\r\nof what they did! It appears from this, that the force of the law is\r\nentirely put into the Judge's hands, and that it depends merely upon\r\nhis charge whether the law is to be applied or not. Could not the\r\nLegislature lay down that rule which the Lord Chancellor does in\r\nhis paper, and which Chief Justice Mansfield did in the case of\r\nBellingham; and why could not the Judges be _bound_ to interpret the\r\nlaw in _this_ and _no other_ sense in their charges to the Juries?[26]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 25: Solicitor-General.

In obedience\r\nto your Majesty's commands he has endeavoured to consider the letter\r\nof the Grand Duke of Baden with reference to the position of the\r\nPrincess Mary[27] in this country. Lord Aberdeen does not find in the\r\nproceedings of the Conference of Great Powers at Vienna, at Aix\r\nla Chapelle, or at Paris, anything which can materially affect the\r\nquestion. The great difficulty with respect to the Princess appears\r\nto arise from the fact that in this country the rank and precedence\r\nof every person are regulated and fixed by law. Should your Majesty be\r\ndisposed to deviate from the strict observance of this, although\r\nLord Aberdeen cannot doubt that it would receive a very general\r\nacquiescence, it is still possible that the Princess might be exposed\r\nto occasional disappointment and mortification....\r\n\r\nThere is a consideration, to which Lord Aberdeen would humbly advert,\r\nwhich may not altogether be unworthy of your Majesty's notice. Your\r\nMajesty does not wish to encourage alliances of this description;\r\nand although there may be no danger of their frequent occurrence,\r\nit cannot be denied that an additional inducement would exist if\r\nPrincesses always retained their own rank in this country.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, Lord Aberdeen would humbly submit to your Majesty that\r\nthe Princess might be received by your Majesty, in the first instance,\r\nwith such distinction as was due to her birth--either by a Royal\r\ncarriage being sent to bring her to your Majesty's presence, or in any\r\nmanner which your Majesty might command--with the understanding that\r\nshe should permanently adopt the title and station of her husband.\r\nYour Majesty's favour and protection, afforded to her in this\r\ncharacter will probably realise all the expectations of the Grand\r\nDuke; and, without acknowledging any positive claim or right, your\r\nMajesty would secure the gratitude of the Princess.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 27: The Princess Mary of Baden had recently married\r\n    the Marquis of Douglas, eldest son of the Duke of Hamilton.\r\n    _See_ p. 439.

There is one circumstance which must be considered and settled,\r\nand which the Queen omitted to mention to Sir Robert Peel when she saw\r\nhim. The chief, indeed the _only_, object of having these Levées, is\r\nto save the Queen the _extreme fatigue_ of the _Presentations_\r\nwhich would come in such a _mass_ together when the Queen _held them\r\nherself_; the Prince naturally holds the _Levées for_ the Queen, and\r\n_represents her_; could not therefore everybody who was presented\r\nto him be made to understand that this would be tantamount to a\r\npresentation to the Queen herself? There might perhaps be an objection\r\non the part of people presented to kneel and kiss the Prince's hand.\r\nBut this could be obviated by merely having the people named to the\r\nPrince. The inconvenience would be _so great_ if nobody at all could\r\nbe presented till late in the season, that something must be devised\r\nto get over this difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LEVÉES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir Robert Peel to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nDOWNING STREET, _18th March 1843._\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs\r\nleave to submit to your Majesty that should your Majesty determine\r\nthat the Prince should hold Levées on behalf of your Majesty, the best\r\ncourse will be to announce the intention from the Lord Chamberlain's\r\nOffice in terms to the following purport:\r\n\r\n    \"His Royal Highness Prince Albert will, by Her Majesty's\r\n    command, hold a Levée on behalf of Her Majesty on ----\r\n\r\n    \"It is Her Majesty's pleasure that presentations to the Prince\r\n    at this Levée shall be considered equivalent to presentations\r\n    to the Queen.\r\n\r\n    \"Addresses to Her Majesty may be presented to Her Majesty\r\n    through the Secretary of State, or may be reserved until Her\r\n    Majesty can hold a Levée in person.\"\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel humbly submits to your Majesty that it would not\r\nbe advisable to _prohibit_ by notice in the _Gazette_ subsequent\r\npresentations to your Majesty. It will probably answer every purpose\r\nto state that they shall be considered _equivalent_, and when your\r\nMajesty shall hold a Levée it may be then notified at the time that\r\nsecond presentations are not necessary.\r\n\r\nWhen the Prince shall hold the Levée, it may be made known at the\r\ntime, without any formal public notification, that kneeling and the\r\nkissing of hands will not be required.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel hopes that the effect of holding these Levées may be\r\nmaterially to relieve your Majesty, but it is of course difficult to\r\nspeak with certainty. He was under the impression that in the reign of\r\nQueen Anne, Prince George had occasionally held Levées on the part\r\nof the Queen during the Queen's indisposition, but on searching the\r\n_Gazette_ of the time he cannot find any record of this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Sir Robert Peel._\r\n\r\nCLAREMONT, _19th March 1843._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Sir Robert's letter, and quite approves of his\r\nsuggestions concerning the Levées. The Prince is quite ready to do\r\nwhatever may be thought right, and the Queen wishes Sir Robert to\r\nact upon the plan he has laid before her in his letter of yesterday.\r\nPerhaps it would be right before making anything public to consider\r\nthe question of Drawing-Rooms likewise, which are of such importance\r\nto the trades-people of London. It would be painful for the Queen to\r\nthink that she should be the cause of disappointment and loss to\r\nthis class of her subjects, particularly at this moment of commercial\r\nstagnation. The Queen conceives that it would be the right thing that\r\nthe same principle laid down for the Levées should be followed with\r\nregard to Drawing-Rooms, the Prince holding them for her. The Queen is\r\nanxious to have soon Sir Robert's opinion upon this subject. The Queen\r\non looking at the almanac finds that _only_ the _two_ next weeks are\r\navailable for these purposes _before_ Easter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir Robert Peel to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWHITEHALL, _27th March 1843._\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and hastens\r\nto reply to your Majesty's note of this date.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel assures your Majesty that he does not think that there\r\nis the slightest ground for apprehension on the occasion of the Levée,\r\nbut Sir Robert Peel will, without the slightest allusion to your\r\nMajesty's communication to him, make personal enquiries into the\r\npolice arrangements, and see that every precaution possible shall be\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nHe begs, however, humbly to assure your Majesty that there never has\r\nreached him any indication of a hostile feeling towards the Prince.\r\nIt could only proceed from some person of deranged intellect, and he\r\nthinks it would be almost impossible for such a person to act upon it\r\non the occasion of a Levée.\r\n\r\nIt may tend to remove or diminish your Majesty's anxiety to know\r\nthat Sir Robert Peel has _walked_ home every night from the House\r\nof Commons, and, notwithstanding frequent menaces and intimations of\r\ndanger, he has not met with any obstruction.\r\n\r\nHe earnestly hopes that your Majesty will dismiss from your mind any\r\napprehension, and sincerely believes that your Majesty may do so with\r\nentire confidence.

We shall, however,\r\npersevere.\r\n\r\nWe left dear Claremont with great regret, and since our return have\r\nbeen regaled with regular March winds, which, however, have not kept\r\nme from my daily walks. To-day it is finer again.\r\n\r\nIt is most kind and good of dearest Albert to hold these Levées for\r\nme, which will be a great relief for hereafter for me. Besides _cela\r\nle met dans sa position_; _he_ and _I_ must be _one_, so that I can\r\n_only be represented_ by _him_.

I am sure you will like it.\r\n\r\nYou will be glad to hear that dear old Eos (who is still at Claremont)\r\nis going on most favourably; they attribute this sudden attack to her\r\nover-eating (she steals whenever she can get anything), living in too\r\nwarm rooms, and getting too little exercise since she was in London.\r\nCertainly her wind was _not_ in the _slightest_ degree affected by\r\nher accident, for in the autumn she coursed better than all the other\r\nyoung dogs, and ran and fetched pheasants, etc., from any distance,\r\nand ran about the very evening she was taken so ill, as if nothing was\r\nthe matter. Evidently part of her lungs must be _very_ sound still;\r\nand they say _no one's_ lungs are _quite sound_.

He owns that he is\r\nvery incredulous about the unwholesomeness of dry champagne, and\r\nhe does not think that the united opinion of the whole College of\r\nPhysicians and of Surgeons would persuade him upon these points--he\r\ncannot think that a \"Hohenlohe\" glass of dry champagne, _i.e._ half a\r\n_schoppen_,[29] can be prejudicial.

The omission\r\nof the health of the Prince is certainly very strange--it would be\r\nvery unusual at any public dinner--but seems quite unaccountable at\r\na dinner given in connection with the interests of one of the Royal\r\nTheatres.\r\n\r\nThe toasts are generally prepared not by the chairman of the meeting,\r\nbut by a committee; but still the omission of the name of the Prince\r\nought to have occurred at once to the Duke of Cambridge, and there\r\ncannot be a doubt that he might have rectified, and ought to have\r\nrectified, the omission.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel is sure your Majesty will approve of his ascertaining\r\nin the first instance the real facts of the case--whether the report\r\nbe a correct one, and if a correct one, who are the parties by whom\r\nthe arrangements in respect to the toasts were made.\r\n\r\nThis being done, Sir Robert Peel will then apply himself to the\r\nexecution of your Majesty's wishes, in the manner pointed out by your\r\nMajesty.\r\n\r\nHe begs humbly to assure your Majesty that he enters most fully into\r\nyour Majesty's very natural feelings, and that he shall always have\r\nthe greatest pleasure in giving effect to your Majesty's wishes\r\nin matters of this nature, and in proving himself worthy of the\r\nconfidence your Majesty is kindly pleased to repose in him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE TOAST OF THE PRINCE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir Robert Peel to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWHITEHALL, _6th April 1843._\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel, with his humble duty to your Majesty, hastens to\r\nmake a communication to your Majesty, on the subject of your Majesty's\r\nletter of this morning, which he hopes will remove from your Majesty's\r\nmind any unfavourable impression with regard to the _toasts_ at the\r\ntheatrical dinner, or to the conduct of the Duke of Cambridge in\r\nreference to them.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel, since he addressed your Majesty, has made enquiry\r\nfrom Colonel Wood, the member for Brecon, who was present at the\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\nIn order to have the real statement of the case, Sir Robert Peel\r\ndid not mention the object of the enquiry. The following were the\r\nquestions and the answers:--\r\n\r\n_Q._ What were the toasts at the theatrical dinner last night?\r\n\r\nCOLONEL WOOD. The first was _The Queen and the Prince_. The Duke said\r\nhe thought he could not give the health of the Queen in a manner more\r\nsatisfactory than by coupling with the name of Her Majesty that of her\r\nillustrious Consort.\r\n\r\nColonel Wood said that his impression was that the Duke meant to do\r\nthat which would be most respectful to the Prince, and that he had\r\nin his mind when he united the name of the Prince with that of your\r\nMajesty, the circumstances of the Prince having recently held the\r\nLevée on behalf of your Majesty.\r\n\r\nIt might perhaps have been better had His Royal Highness adhered to\r\nthe usual custom, and proposed the health of the Prince distinctly and\r\nseparately, but he humbly submits to your Majesty that the _intention_\r\nof His Royal Highness must have been to show respect to the Prince.\r\n\r\nThe reports of public dinners are frequently incorrect, the reporters\r\nbeing sometimes placed at a great distance from the chairman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE KING OF HANOVER]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir Robert Peel to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWHITEHALL, _12th April 1843._\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and will\r\nnot fail to forward by the first opportunity the letter to Lord\r\nEllenborough which accompanied your Majesty's note.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of his conversation yesterday morning with Baron\r\nStockmar, Sir Robert Peel begs to mention to your Majesty that he saw\r\nto-day a private letter from Berlin, which mentioned that the King\r\nof Hanover had apparently abandoned the intention of visiting England\r\nthis year, but that on the receipt of some letters from England, which\r\nhe suspected to be written for the purpose of discouraging his visit,\r\nthe King suddenly changed his intention and wrote a letter to your\r\nMajesty, stating that he had thoughts of such a visit.\r\n\r\nIt was not stated from whence the letters advising the King to remain\r\non the Continent had proceeded.\r\n\r\nThis letter also stated that the King of Hanover proposed to waive\r\nhis rank of Sovereign as far as he possibly could on his arrival in\r\nEngland, and to take his seat in the House of Lords without taking any\r\npart in the proceedings.\r\n\r\nIt added that the King could not, in any event, be in England before\r\nthe latter end of May or beginning of June, and rather hinted that\r\nas his proposed visit was more out of a spirit of contradiction and\r\nimpatience of obstacles being thrown in the way of it, than from any\r\nstrong wish on his part to come here, he might probably change his\r\nintention and defer his visit, particularly if he should find that\r\nthere was no particular impediment in the way of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir Robert Peel to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWHITEHALL, _13th April 1843._\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs\r\nleave to acquaint your Majesty that the Duke of Cambridge having\r\ncalled on Sir Robert Peel this morning, he took an opportunity of\r\nasking His Royal Highness whether he thought the King of Hanover had\r\nmade up his mind to visit England this year.\r\n\r\nThe Duke's reply was, as nearly as possible, as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, the King will certainly come, but I can tell you privately he\r\nmeans to have nothing to do with the House of Lords.

It appears to me that the whole case\r\nmust be considered as hanging together; that is, the desire to be\r\nburied at Kensal Green, that of Freemasons to pay Masonic Honours,[34]\r\nthat the body of the Duchess of Inverness should be interred near to\r\nhis when she dies.\r\n\r\nParties still alive have an interest in the attainment of the two last\r\nobjects, which are quite incompatible with the interment of a Prince\r\nof the Blood, a Knight of the Garter, in St George's Chapel at\r\nWindsor.\r\n\r\nThe Queen's Royal Command might overrule the Duke's desire to be\r\nburied at Kensal Green.[35] Nobody would complain of or contend\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\nBut there will be no end of the complaints of interference by\r\nauthority on the part of Freemasons, and of those who will take part\r\nwith the Duchess of Inverness: and it is a curious fact that there\r\nare persons in Society who are interested in making out that she was\r\nreally married to the Duke.[36] Against this we must observe that it\r\nwill be urged that the omission to insist that the interment should\r\ntake place in the Collegiate Chapel of St George's, Windsor, and thus\r\nto set aside the will, lowers the Royal Family in the opinion of the\r\npublic, and is a concession to Radicalism. But it is my opinion that\r\nthe reasons will justify that which will be done in conformity with\r\nthe will.\r\n\r\nI confess that I don't like to decide upon cases in such haste; and\r\nI cannot consider it necessary that a decision should be made on the\r\ncourse to be taken in respect to the Duke's funeral, on the morrow of\r\nthe day on which he died.\r\n\r\nIt would be desirable to know the opinion of the Lord Chancellor, the\r\nArchbishop, and others.\r\n\r\nI can't think of anything likely to occur, which might alter me: and\r\nI'll abide by that which I have above given.\r\n\r\nIt will be absolutely necessary to take effective measures for the\r\npreservation of the peace at this funeral at Kensal Green: and\r\neven that the magistrates should superintend the procession of the\r\nFreemasons. Believe me, ever yours most sincerely,\r\n\r\nWELLINGTON.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 34: The Duke of Sussex being Grand Master of\r\n    England, and Master of the Lodge of Antiquity.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 35: The body lay in state at Kensington, and was\r\n    eventually buried, as the Duke had desired, in the Kensal\r\n    Green Cemetery.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 36: See _ante_, p. 478, note 33 (this Ch., above).

The Queen thinks\r\nit right that you should inform Lord Howard that the possibility of a\r\nmarriage between Prince Leopold[50] and the Queen of Spain has been\r\nfor some time a favourite thought of hers and mine, and that you\r\nthought that this combination had some advantages which hardly any\r\nother could offer. But that the matter had been and was treated here\r\nas one purely and solely Spanish, in which we carefully abstained from\r\ninterfering with, and that we leave it to work itself out or not by its\r\nown merit.\r\n\r\nThat you wished him to take the same view, but not to lose sight\r\nof it, and to report to you whatever he might hear bearing upon the\r\nsubject.

The Queen hopes that in bringing in the Bill Sir\r\nRobert Peel will make as little of it as possible, in order not to\r\nmake it appear a larger measure than it is.\r\n\r\nThe Regulations strike the Queen as very judicious, and she has little\r\ndoubt that they will raise the military spirit in the Pensioners, and\r\nwill make the measure popular with them, which cannot fail to attach\r\nthem more to the Crown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Sir Robert Peel._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _13th August 1843._\r\n\r\nThe Queen is desirous that whatever is right should be done, but is\r\nstrongly of opinion that the King of Hanover's threat (for as such\r\nit must be regarded) not to leave this country till the affair[53] is\r\ndecided upon, should in _no way_ influence the transaction, as it is\r\nquite immaterial whether the King stays longer here or not.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 53: Of the Crown jewels; _ante_, p. 439.\r\n      (Ch.

The\r\nQueen is anxious (should Lord Aberdeen coincide in this view of\r\nthe subject, as she believes he does) that it should be _clearly_\r\nunderstood by Sir Robert Gordon, and Prince Metternich.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 54: Since the Quadruple Alliance (of England,\r\n    France, Spain, and Portugal) in 1834 to expel Don Carlos and\r\n    Dom Miguel from the Peninsula, the question of the marriage\r\n    of Queen Isabella (then aged four) had been a subject\r\n    of incessant consideration by England and France. The\r\n    Queen-Mother had suggested to Louis Philippe the marriages of\r\n    the Queen to the Duc d'Aumale and of the Infanta (her sister)\r\n    to the Duc de Montpensier: such a proposal, however gratifying\r\n    to the French King's ambition, would naturally not have been\r\n    favourably viewed in England; but Guizot promoted warmly the\r\n    alternative project of a marriage of the Queen to her cousin\r\n    Don Francisco de Asis, Duke of Cadiz, son of Don Francisco de\r\n    Paula, the Infanta being still to marry Montpensier. It was\r\n    believed that, if this marriage of the Queen took place, there\r\n    would be no issue of it, and Louis Philippe's ambition would\r\n    be ultimately gratified. To Palmerston's protest against this\r\n    scheme (before the Melbourne Ministry fell), Guizot replied,\r\n    \"_La Reine aura des enfants et ne mourra pas._\" The other\r\n    possible candidates for the Queen's hand from the French point\r\n    of view were Count Montemolin, the son of Don Carlos, the\r\n    Count de Trapani, son of Francis I., King of the Two Sicilies,\r\n    and thus brother of Queen Christina, and the Duke of Seville,\r\n    a brother of the Duke of Cadiz. Other candidates also favoured\r\n    by the Queen-Mother were (while he was unmarried) Prince\r\n    Albert's brother, and his cousin Leopold, brother of the King\r\n    of Portugal; but the French King was bent upon a marriage\r\n    of the Queen with some descendant of Philip V., and equally\r\n    determined to prevent the Infanta's marriage either with\r\n    Leopold or any other Prince not a descendant of Philip V. The\r\n    view of Prince Albert and of Lord Aberdeen was that it was a\r\n    matter for the young Queen herself and the Spanish people. See\r\n    _ante_, p. 485. (Ch. XII, 20th July, 1843)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Aberdeen to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nFOREIGN OFFICE, _13th August 1843._\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen, with his most humble duty, begs to assure your Majesty\r\nthat he will not fail to give his best attention to your Majesty's\r\ncommunication respecting the marriage of the Queen of Spain.\r\n\r\nIn a recent despatch to Sir Robert Gordon, Lord Aberdeen has repeated\r\nthe opinion entertained by your Majesty's Government, that the\r\nmarriage of the Queen with the son of Don Carlos, instead of leading\r\nto the conciliation and unison of parties, would be more likely to\r\nproduce collision and strife, and to increase the existing animosity\r\nbetween the different political factions by which Spain is distracted.\r\n\r\nThis marriage, however, has always been a favourite project with\r\nAustria and the Northern Courts; and it has also been apparently\r\nsupported by the French Government. It cannot be denied that at\r\nfirst sight there are many considerations by which it may seem to be\r\nrecommended; but the weight of these can only be duly estimated by the\r\nauthorities and people of Spain.\r\n\r\nThe same may be said respecting the marriage of the Queen with any\r\nother Spanish Prince, a descendant of Philip V. which, in the opinion\r\nof many, would be most agreeable to the feelings and prejudices of\r\nthe nation. To this project also it appears that the French Government\r\nhave recently assented.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen humbly thinks that the interests of this country and of\r\nall Europe are deeply concerned in the exclusion of a French Prince\r\nfrom the possibility of receiving the hand of the Queen; and that it\r\nwould not be a wise policy to oppose any marriage by which this should\r\nbe effected, consistently with the free choice of the Queen, and\r\nthe sanction of the Spanish Government and people. The avowed\r\npredilections of Queen Christina, and her increased means of influence\r\nrecently acquired, render this a matter of considerable anxiety and\r\nimportance at the present moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PARLIAMENTARY OBSTRUCTION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Sir Robert Peel._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _16th August 1843._\r\n\r\nThe Queen cannot refrain from writing a line to express her\r\nindignation at the very unjustifiable manner in which the minority\r\nof thirteen members obstructs the progress of business.[55] She\r\nhopes that every attempt will be made to put an end to what is really\r\nindecent conduct. Indeed, how is business to go on at all if such\r\nvexatious opposition prevails? At all events, the Queen hopes that\r\nSir Robert will make _no kind_ of concession to these gentlemen, which\r\n[could] encourage them to go on in the same way.\r\n\r\nThe Queen forgot to say this morning that she thinks it would be\r\nbetter that the Investiture of the Thistle should be put off for the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 55: By opposition to the Bill removing doubts as to\r\n    the admission of Ministers in Scotland.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Sir James Graham._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _22nd August 1843._\r\n\r\nThe Queen returns these papers to Sir J.

Lord Melbourne is much pleased that your Majesty is glad\r\nof Wilhelmina Stanhope's marriage,[57] and was very glad to hear that\r\nyour Majesty had congratulated her and Lady Stanhope upon it,\r\nwhich was very kind, and gave much satisfaction. Lord Dalmeny is an\r\nexcellent young man, and altogether it is an event much to be rejoiced\r\nat, especially as it has been so long delayed, and fears began to\r\nbe entertained that it would never happen. The Duke and Duchess of\r\nSutherland seem also much pleased with Evelyn's[58] marriage. She is a\r\nbeautiful girl, and a very nice person in every respect, and everybody\r\nmust wish her happy. Lord Melbourne has been at Panshanger for two\r\nor three days with Uxbridge and Lady Uxbridge, Ella, and Constance.\r\nUxbridge is having continual cricket matches as he used to have, which\r\nis a very good thing, making the country gay, and pleasing the people.\r\n\r\nMatrimonial affairs, Lord Melbourne is afraid, remain _in statu quo_.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne was very glad to hear from Anson yesterday and to learn\r\nthat he thinks himself getting better. Lord Liverpool had given Lord\r\nMelbourne a very poor account of him. Lord Melbourne hopes that your\r\nMajesty may have a pleasant tour, but he cannot refrain from earnestly\r\nrecommending your Majesty to take care about landing and embarking,\r\nand not to do it in dangerous places and on awkward coasts. Lord\r\nMelbourne is going the day after to-morrow with Lord and Lady Beauvale\r\nto Brocket Hall, and from thence on the 29th to Melbourne, to stay\r\nabout three weeks or a month.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne congratulates your Majesty upon the near approaching\r\ntermination of the Session of Parliament, which is always a relief\r\nto all parties.

We have been quite dismayed and overwhelmed with\r\nthe melancholy intelligence of death after death which has followed\r\nus.

The principal motive now\r\nis to take care that it does not get mixed either in reality or in\r\nappearance with politics, and Lord Melbourne cannot conceal from\r\nyour Majesty that he should lament it much if the result of the visit\r\nshould turn out to be a treaty upon any European matter, unfavourable\r\nto England and favourable to France. Do not let them make any treaty\r\nor agreement there. It can be done elsewhere just as well, and without\r\nany of the suspicion which is sure to attach to any transaction which\r\ntakes place there.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 62: Mr and Mrs William Cowper had only been married\r\n    on 24th June.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _8th September 1843._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST AND MOST BELOVED VICTORIA,--I have been highly gratified\r\nthat you found a moment to write me such a dear letter. I am sure that\r\nthe personal contact with the family at Eu would interest you, and\r\nat the same time remove some impressions on the subject of the King,\r\nwhich are really untrue. Particularly the attempt of representing\r\nhim like the most astute of men, calculating constantly everything to\r\ndeceive people.\r\n\r\nHis vivacity alone would render such a system extremely difficult,\r\nand if he appears occasionally to speak too much and to seem to hold a\r\ndifferent language to different people, it is a good deal owing to his\r\nvivacity and his anxiety to carry conviction to people's mind.\r\n\r\nThe impression of your visit will besides do wonders in removing the\r\nsilly irritation which had been got up since 1840, and which might\r\nhave in the end occasioned serious mischief, and that without being\r\n_in the least_ called for, the passions of nations become very\r\ninconvenient sometimes for their Governors....

We anchored\r\nin Margate Roads at eleven last night, and set off again about five.\r\n\r\nLet me thank you and my beloved Louise in both our names again for\r\nyour _great kindness_ to us, which, believe me, we feel _deeply_. We\r\nwere _so happy_ with you, and the stay was _so delightful_, but so\r\npainfully short! It was such a joy for me to be once again under the\r\nroof of one who has ever been a father to me! I was _very_ sad after\r\nyou left us; it seems so strange that all should be over--but the\r\n_delightful_ souvenir will _ever_ remain. To leave my dearest Louise\r\ntoo was so painful--and also poor Aunt Julia,[64] so immediately after\r\nmaking her acquaintance; pray tell her that, for me. I shall write to\r\nLouise to-morrow. You must forgive my hand being so trembling, but we\r\nare _lighter_ than usual, which causes the tremulous motion to be so\r\nmuch more felt.\r\n\r\nThat God may bless and protect you _all always_ is our fervent prayer.\r\nBelieve me, always, your devoted and grateful Niece and Child,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 63: On the 12th the Queen and Prince Albert sailed\r\n    from Brighton on a visit to King Leopold.

But this is very\r\nungrateful for what I have had, which is so much more than I ever\r\ndared to hope for. The weather is become colder, and yesterday and the\r\nday before were horrid, foggy, raw days; to-day it is finer again....\r\n\r\nFeodore and Ernest came to us yesterday, and I find them both _very_\r\nwell; Feodore is, I think, grown more serious than she was....\r\n\r\nYou remember that when we were together we talked of who Aumale could\r\nmarry; he will only marry a Catholic, and no Spaniard, no Neapolitan,\r\nno Austrian, and also no Brazilian, as Louise tells me. Why should not\r\nPrincess Alexandrine of Bavaria do? It would be a good connection, and\r\nyou say (though not as pretty as Princess Hildegarde) that she is not\r\nill-looking. _Qu'en pensez-vous?_ Then for _Tatane_[66]--a Princess of\r\nSaxony would be extremely _passlich_.\r\n\r\nHow long does Aunt Julia stay with you?\r\n\r\nAlbert, I suppose, writes to you, and I, dearest Uncle, remain ever\r\nand ever, your _most truly_ devoted and _warmly attached_ Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\nWe find Pussy amazingly advanced in intellect, but alas! also in\r\nnaughtiness.

She has been\r\nreflecting upon his proposition that Mr Lytton Bulwer[70] should be\r\nappointed Minister at Madrid, and quite approves it. The Queen trusts\r\nthat he will try and keep on the best terms with the French Minister\r\nthere, and that without in any way weakening our interests, the\r\nrepresentatives of these two powerful countries will act _together_.\r\nThe Queen feels _certain_ that if it is known by _our_ respective\r\nMinisters that _both_ Governments _wish_ to act _together_, and not\r\n_against_ one another, that much irritation will be avoided; and that\r\nour agents, particularly in distant countries, will understand\r\nthat they are _not_ fulfilling the wishes of their Sovereign by\r\nrepresenting every little incident in the most unfavourable light....\r\n\r\nThe Queen hopes that Lord Aberdeen will take some early opportunity of\r\nemploying Mr Aston. Who will replace Mr Bulwer at Paris? his successor\r\nought to be an efficient man, as Lord Cowley[71] is rather infirm.

Louise writes to me about the Duke of Bordeaux\r\ncoming to England making some difficulty, and I wish therefore to\r\nstate what we know of the affair. We _understand_ (for of course\r\nwe have had no direct communication) that the Duc de Bordeaux has\r\nembarked at Hamburg for _Hull_, and intends travelling in Scotland\r\n_before_ he visits England, and _that_ incognito and under the name of\r\nComte _tel et tel_; his being in Scotland when Nemours is in\r\nEngland, and particularly _on a visit to us here_, _could_ make\r\n_no_ difficulty, and even if he were travelling about _incognito_ in\r\nEngland, it could not signify, I think. Moreover, I feel certain that\r\nif he knew that _I_ had invited the Nemours and that they were coming\r\nover shortly, he would go away, as the Legitimists would not be\r\npleased at Nemours being _fêted_ by me--_while their Henry V._ was\r\n_not_ even noticed or received. I could easily, and indeed have almost\r\ndone so, make it known generally that _I_ expect the Nemours, and I\r\nwould say _immediately_, and he would be sure to get out of the way.\r\nI cannot tell you _how very_ anxious we are to see the Nemours; I have\r\nbeen thinking of nothing else, and to lose this great pleasure would\r\nbe too mortifying. Moreover, as I really and truly do not think it\r\nneed be, it would be _best_ if the Nemours could come _before_ the\r\n10th of November; which is the _latest_ term when they could come? Now\r\npray, dearest Uncle, do settle this for me; you have no notion _how_\r\nwe wish it. I will be sure to let you know what I hear, and if there\r\nis anything you could suggest about this, I need not say but that we\r\nshall attend to it with pleasure.

He is to be informed\r\nindirectly that the Nemours are coming at the beginning of next month\r\non a visit to us, in consequence of a pressing invitation of ours;\r\nthis alone will keep him off, as the contrast would be disagreeable to\r\nthe Legitimists. Independent of this, his disembarkation at Hull, and\r\nproceeding at once to Scotland, seems to indicate his wish to be in\r\nprivate.\r\n\r\nThe great event of the day is O'Connell's arrest;[73] they have found\r\nbail, but the trial will shortly commence. The case against him is\r\n_very_ strong, the lawyers say.\r\n\r\nEverything is perfectly quiet at Dublin. You will have seen how\r\nO'Connell has abused the King; it is all because our visit to Eu\r\nhas put an end to _any_ hopes of assistance from France, which\r\nhe pretended there would be, and he now declares for the Duc de\r\nBordeaux!...\r\n\r\nYou must encourage the dear King and Queen to send over some of the\r\ndear family often to us; _ils seront reçus a bras ouverts_....\r\n\r\nWe intend to take advantage of Feodore and Ernest's going to the Queen\r\nDowager's to pay a visit to Cambridge, where we have never been; we\r\nmean to set off to-morrow week, to sleep at Trinity Lodge that night,\r\nand the two following nights at Lord Hardwicke's,[74] which is close\r\nto Cambridge.

There\r\nis a pretty general impression of the Duc de Bordeaux's visit being\r\na got-up thing for various political intrigues. I confess I do not\r\nunderstand the link with Ireland, or at least the importance of his\r\nbeing well received by the Roman Catholics, but am strongly impressed\r\nthat his presence whether in Scotland, England, or Ireland is for\r\nno good, and therefore think it our duty that we should render it\r\ndifficult for him to protract it. The Queen and myself think that the\r\nuncertainty of his being received at Court or not is doing harm, and\r\nwould _much_ wish, therefore, that it was _decidedly_ stated _that\r\nthe Queen will not receive him_. His coming here without ever asking\r\n(indeed knowing that it was disliked), as well as the part which\r\nAustria and Prussia seem to have taken in the matter, do not\r\nstrengthen his claim for such a favour. No good can come from the\r\nreception, and the King of the French must prefer its not taking\r\nplace. Let us, therefore, settle that point, and show that we are\r\nneither afraid of him nor prepared to be made dupes of.\r\n\r\nThe Queen is desirous that no official person should treat the Duke\r\nwith a distinction which is likely to attract unnecessary attention.\r\nBelieve me, always yours truly,\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE DUC DE NEMOURS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _24th October 1843._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I had the happiness of receiving your most kind\r\nletter of the 20th yesterday, for which I thank you very much. The\r\ngood news of the dear Nemours coming is a great happiness to us, and\r\nI fervently hope and trust that the Duc de Bordeaux will be kept off,\r\nwhich I _fully_ expect he will. Suppose, however, he could _not_ be,\r\nand the Nemours could not come _then_, would the King not kindly allow\r\nthem to come later? Even if the Chambers were to be sitting--such\r\na little _Ausflug_ of ten days only could really not be a great\r\ninconvenience? Surely if you were to mention this to the dear King,\r\nwith my affectionate respects, he would grant it. It is besides only\r\nin _case_ Bordeaux should come to London, which I _really_ think he\r\nwill _not_, if he once knows that the Nemours are coming. And I must\r\nadd that I think Nemours not coming at _all_ this year, after it had\r\nbeen announced, would have a bad effect, particularly as people\r\nhere think that some great Powers have instigated Bordeaux's coming\r\nhere,--and even think that the Roman Catholics and Repealers in\r\nIreland mean to make use of him. Consequently Nemours _not_ coming _at\r\nall_, should he be prevented from coming at the beginning of November,\r\nwould not be a good thing _politically_, independent of the _extreme\r\ndisappointment_ it would cause us....\r\n\r\nThe accounts both you and Louise gave me of good Hadjy and Chica give\r\nme great pleasure, as I take a lively interest in both, and am very\r\nfond of them. We found amongst some very curious old miniatures\r\nseveral of Catherine of Braganza when young (Charles II.'s wife),\r\nwhich are so like Chica;[77] it is curious how sometimes you can trace\r\nlikenesses many generations back....\r\n\r\nPray offer our respects to _all_.

In consequence of\r\nthis information, it was thought to be dangerous for the Prince to\r\nwalk or to expose himself in the neighbourhood of Holyrood House. He\r\nwas frequently driven in a carriage to Lord Morton's,[79] where he\r\nremained for a few hours, taking exercise in the park, and playing\r\nwith Lord Morton's children. It is the recollection of this which has\r\nled the Prince to make his acknowledgments on the present occasion.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen also begs humbly to mention to your Majesty that on his\r\narrival here he found the Duke and Duchess of Buccleuch in expectation\r\nof a visit from the Duc de Bordeaux, on his way from Glasgow\r\nto Carlisle. Lord Aberdeen informed the Duke and Duchess of the\r\nobjections which might exist to this visit; but he believes that\r\ncommunications on the subject had already gone too far to render\r\nit possible to break it off with any degree of propriety. The great\r\nattentions paid by the Duke and his predecessors to the French Royal\r\nFamily, both during the former and last emigration, sufficient account\r\nfor this desire on the part of the Prince.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 78: George Sholto, nineteenth Earl of Morton\r\n    (1789-1858).]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 79: Dalmahoy, Midlothian.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: VISIT TO CAMBRIDGE]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: BETROTHAL OF THE DUC D'AUMALE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _31st October 1843._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I had the pleasure of receiving your dear and kind\r\nletter of the 27th yesterday, by which I learn that you are all well\r\nand going on the 4th. Forgive me, dearest Uncle, if I say that I am\r\nglad that you are _at length_ going back to Belgium, as (though I\r\nfully understand from _personal_ experience how delightful it must be\r\nto be in the midst of that dear and perfect family) I think these long\r\nabsences distress your faithful Belgians a little.\r\n\r\nWe returned on Saturday, highly pleased and interested with our\r\ntour,[80] though a little _done up_. I seldom remember more enthusiasm\r\nthan was shown at Cambridge, and in particular by the Undergraduates.\r\nThey received my dear Angel, too, with the greatest enthusiasm. This\r\nis useful, as these young people _will all, in time_, have a certain\r\npart to play; they are the rising generation, and an event of this\r\nkind makes a lasting impression on their minds.\r\n\r\nYou will have heard from Louise that there is no longer any impediment\r\nto the dear Nemours coming, which you may easily conceive gives me the\r\ngreatest satisfaction. Since then, I have heard that Bordeaux does not\r\nintend visiting London till he sees by the papers that the Nemours are\r\ngone. I saw a letter from a gentleman, with whom he had been staying,\r\nand who says that he is very pleasing and unaffected, and very easily\r\namused, and quite pleased \"with missing a few pheasants, and dancing\r\nquadrilles in the evening to a pianoforte.\" Poor fellow! his fate\r\ncertainly is a melancholy one. He should renounce, buy some property\r\nin Germany, and marry, and settle there.\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear of Montpensier's arrival, and that my favourite\r\nChica is in your good graces; she is a dear natural child. I am so\r\nimpatient to see my dear Victoire and good Nemours--who was always a\r\ngreat ally of mine--again!\r\n\r\nThe Grand Duke came here last night, and goes away after luncheon, and\r\nleaves England on Thursday. He is charmed with all he has seen, and I\r\nmust say is very amiable and civil. He has got a most charming large\r\ndog, called Dragon, like a Newfoundland, only brown and white, with\r\nthe most expressive eyes imaginable and _si bien dressé_. Prince\r\nAlexander of the Netherlands is also coming down to take leave this\r\nweek. We never had so many visitors.\r\n\r\nI am beyond everything interested with that beautiful novel by\r\nRellstab,[81] _1812_, which I know you admire so much. The description\r\nof the Russian Campaign is incomparable, and so beautifully written.\r\nYou quite _see_ everything before you. Have you read his other, _Paris\r\nund Algier_? By the by, have you read Custine's[82] book on Russia?\r\nThey say it is very severe on Russia, and full of hatred to the\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nWe found the children very well, and Bertie quite recovered, but poor\r\nfat Alice (who, I _must_ say, is becoming _very_ pretty) has had the\r\nearache.\r\n\r\nMamma with Feo and Ernest are with the Queen Dowager at Witley Court\r\nsince Thursday last, and only return next Thursday (the day after\r\nto-morrow).

Ever, dearest Uncle, your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\nI open my letter, dearest Uncle, to say that I have _just_ seen in a\r\nconfidential despatch from Lord Cowley that Aumale is authorised\r\nto ask for the hand of the daughter of the Prince de Salerno[83] (a\r\nsingular coincidence after what I wrote to you in _utter ignorance_\r\nof this report), and that he was also to find out what the opinions of\r\nthe Neapolitan Royal Family were respecting an alliance with the Queen\r\nof Spain.

One of the grounds on which they\r\ndeprecated the Resolution was the passing of it in the absence of full\r\nand complete information from India, in respect to the policy and to\r\nthe events which led to the occupation of Scinde.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, as well on the general Constitutional\r\nground, as with reference to the present state of the public\r\ncorrespondence in regard to Scinde, and the particular relation of\r\nthe Governor-General to the East India Company, and the Court of\r\nDirectors, Sir Robert Peel humbly advises your Majesty to forbear\r\nfrom expressing an opinion, in a private communication to the\r\nGovernor-General, with regard to events in Scinde or to the policy\r\nhereafter to be pursued in respect to that country.

Wimpole\r\nis a curious place. Lord Melbourne is not exactly aware how the Yorkes\r\ngot hold of it.[88] There is much history and more poetry connected\r\nwith it. Prior[89] mentions it repeatedly, and always calls the first\r\nLady Harley, the daughter of the Duke of Newcastle, Belphebe.[90] If\r\nHardwicke should have a daughter, he should christen her Belphebe.

Possibly your Royal Highness has\r\nthis book regularly sent to you.\r\n\r\nI think, before Her Majesty promises a visit to Witley Court, there\r\nare one or two points worthy of consideration which are in favour\r\nof proposing to the Queen Dowager to meet the Queen at Drayton Manor\r\nfirst. The Queen would have to go and to return in the same day. The\r\nQueen Dowager might remain either one night or two nights at Drayton.\r\nSecondly, the Birmingham and Derby line is not on the same level with\r\nthe line which goes to Droitwich (eleven miles from Witley Court), and\r\nthere is a little delay in posting a carriage, or in passing from the\r\nlower line of railway to the upper.\r\n\r\nThirdly, there is the passage for Her Majesty, though not through\r\nBirmingham as in an ordinary travelling carriage, yet in the immediate\r\noutskirts of the town, and this twice in the same day.\r\n\r\nThe Corporation (which is a completely Radical one) might solicit\r\npermission to present an Address to Her Majesty at the station.\r\n\r\nThere would, I am sure, be nothing but demonstrations of the greatest\r\nloyalty and attachment to Her Majesty, but there would probably be\r\na great concourse of people, and some delay, if the Address were\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nPerhaps your Royal Highness will think of these suggestions, which I\r\nam induced to offer by the desire to foresee everything which may have\r\na bearing upon the personal comfort of the Queen.\r\n\r\nI have the honour to be, Sir, with sincere respect, your Royal\r\nHighness's most faithful and humble Servant,\r\n\r\nROBERT PEEL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE DUCHESSE DE NEMOURS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _14th November 1843._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST, KINDEST UNCLE,--A long and most _interesting_ letter\r\nreached me on Sunday, dated 9th and 10th, and I beg to return my\r\nwarmest thanks for it. The confidence you show me I feel deeply and\r\ngratefully, and you may rely on my discretion. Before I touch upon any\r\nof the subjects in your letter I will give you news of our visitors.\r\nThe dear Nemours arrived safely after a good passage on Saturday, well\r\nbut very tired. They are now quite recovered, and we are too happy to\r\nhave them here. Nemours looks well, and is very kind and amiable, but\r\nI think there is a seriousness since poor Chartres' death which used\r\nnot to be formerly, though he always was _reserved_, and that, I\r\nthink, he is _not_ now. Dearest Victoire is _amazingly_ improved and\r\n_développée_--really quite wonderfully so. We are all so struck by it,\r\nby her good sense and by her conversation; and with that she has\r\nkept that innocence and gentleness which she always had--and is _so\r\nlovely_, dear sweet child. I must always look at her, and she, dear\r\nchild, seems so pleased to see me again. I find her _grown_, but grown\r\nvery thin, and she has not those bright colours she used to have. All\r\nthat you say of Bordeaux is just what Nemours says, and what Guizot\r\nwrites, and what _I_ and also Sir Robert Peel _always_ felt and\r\nthought. Aberdeen, with the greatest wish to do _all_ that is kind and\r\nright, _really thought_ that B. was only come to amuse himself,\r\nand had no idea till _now_ that the feeling in France in _all_ the\r\ndifferent parties was so strong. You will have heard by this time that\r\nwe have decided _not_ to receive B. in _any way_ whatever. It is a\r\npleasure to hear how mildly and sensibly Nemours speaks upon all these\r\nsubjects, and indeed every subject....\r\n\r\nI think you did _uncommonly right_ in what you answered the poor King\r\nabout the _arrêté_ in favour of the _Prussians_, and I am very glad\r\nyou _have_ done so. It will have a good effect here.\r\n\r\nLouise will tell you how we celebrated good Bertie's birthday. The\r\nchildren are in great favour with the Nemours.\r\n\r\nPray, dearest Uncle, do not forget to send me the list of Rellstab's\r\nworks.

He has not yet\r\nreceived any communication from the Duc de Lévis, notwithstanding he\r\nhad been led to expect it, from a notice repeatedly conveyed to him to\r\nthat effect. It seems probable that in consequence of what the Duc\r\nde Lévis may have heard, as well as from the course pursued by the\r\nfriends of the Duc de Bordeaux, Lord Aberdeen may not now see him\r\nat all. Should this be the case, Lord Aberdeen is rather inclined\r\nto regret it; as although he would formerly have seen him with some\r\nreluctance, he would now be glad to have an opportunity of expressing\r\nhis sentiments very plainly respecting the proceedings of the Prince\r\nand his adherents in this country.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen understands from Sir Robert Peel that your Majesty would\r\nlike to be informed of any particulars connected with the Levée lately\r\nheld by the Duc de Bordeaux. Lord Aberdeen would willingly communicate\r\nthese particulars, but in reality there is very little to be added\r\nto the official accounts contained in the _Morning Post_, which it\r\nis obvious are inserted by authority. He saw M. de Ste Aulaire this\r\nmorning, who was a good deal excited by what has taken place, and has\r\nwritten very fully to Paris; but he knew nothing more than he had seen\r\nin the newspapers.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be worth mentioning to your Majesty that at the\r\npresentation of the Address by M. Chateaubriand[92] on Friday, the\r\ncries of \"Vive le Roi!\" and \"Vive Henri V.!\" were so loud as to be\r\ndistinctly audible in the Square. Lord Aberdeen understands that this\r\nenthusiasm has been the cause of serious differences amongst many of\r\nthose who had come to pay their respects to the Duc de Bordeaux, a\r\nlarge portion of whom are by no means disposed to recognise him as\r\nKing during the life of the Duc d'Angoulême.[93]\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen cannot learn that any other member of the Diplomatic\r\nBody has been presented to the Duc de Bordeaux, and does not believe\r\nthat any such presentation has taken place. Indeed, there appears to\r\nbe a general disinclination that such should be the case; although\r\nsome of them feel considerable difficulty in consequence of the\r\nrelationship existing between their Sovereigns and the Prince.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 92: François, Vicomte de Chateaubriand (1768-1848),\r\n    a great supporter of the Bourbons, and made a Peer in 1815.

Sir Charles continues to show\r\ngreat discretion and firmness in his most arduous and unsatisfactory\r\nsituation, and deserves much praise and encouragement.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 94: Governor-General of Canada.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: VISIT TO CHATSWORTH]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBELVOIR CASTLE, _4th December 1843._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--Being much hurried, I can only write you a few\r\nlines to thank you for your kind letter of the 29th, received this\r\nmorning. You will have heard from Louise the account of our stay\r\nat Drayton (which is a very nice house), and of Albert's brilliant\r\nreception at Birmingham. We arrived at Chatsworth on Friday, and left\r\nit at nine this morning, quite charmed and delighted with everything\r\nthere. Splendour and comfort are so admirably combined, and the Duke\r\ndoes everything so well. I found many improvements since I was there\r\neleven years ago. The conservatory is out and out the finest thing\r\nimaginable of its kind. It is one mass of glass, 64 feet high, 300\r\nlong, and 134 wide.[95] The grounds, with all the woods and cascades\r\nand fountains, are so beautiful too. The first evening there was a\r\nball, and the next the cascades and fountains were illuminated, which\r\nhad a beautiful effect. There was a large party there, including\r\nmany of the Duke's family, the Bedfords, Buccleuchs, the Duke of\r\nWellington, the Normanbys, Lord Melbourne (who is much better),\r\nand the Beauvales. We arrived here at half-past two, we perform our\r\njourney so delightfully on the railroad, so quickly and easily. It\r\nputs me in mind of our dear stay in Belgium, when we stop at the\r\nvarious stations.\r\n\r\nAlbert is going out hunting to-morrow, which I wish was _over_, but I\r\nam assured that the country is much better than the Windsor country.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Bordeaux's proceedings in London are most highly improper.\r\n\r\nThe Queen Dowager is also here.\r\n\r\nWe leave this place on Thursday for home, which, I own, I shall be\r\nglad of at last. Ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 95: It was built by Mr Joseph Paxton, then\r\n    Superintendent of the Gardens, whose intelligence had\r\n    attracted the Duke of Devonshire's attention.

You ask in your letter about the manner in\r\nwhich my children say their prayers? They say it when in their beds,\r\nbut not kneeling; how absurd to find _that_ necessary, as if it could\r\nhave anything to do with making our prayers more acceptable to the\r\nAlmighty or more holy. How really clever people can have those notions\r\nI don't understand. I am sorry it is the case there, where there is\r\nso much good and, I am certain, real piety. Dear Pussy learning her\r\nletters I should like to see and hear; I am sure she will learn them\r\nvery quick. Has Bertie not learned some more words and sentences\r\nduring your absence?...\r\n\r\nYour attached and devoted sister,\r\n\r\nFEODORA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PRINCE ALBERT WITH THE HOUNDS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _12th December 1843._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I thank you much for your kind letter of the 7th,\r\nwhich I received as usual on Sunday. Louise will be able to tell\r\nyou _how_ well the remainder of our journey went off, and how well\r\nAlbert's hunting answered.[96] One can hardly credit the absurdity of\r\npeople here, but Albert's riding so boldly and hard has made such a\r\nsensation that it has been written all over the country, and they make\r\nmuch more of it than if he had done some great act!\r\n\r\nIt rather disgusts one, but still it had done, and does, good, for\r\nit has put an end to all impertinent sneering for the future about\r\nAlbert's riding. This journey has done great good, and my beloved\r\nAngel in particular has had _the greatest success_; for instance, at\r\nBirmingham the good his visit has done has been immense, for Albert\r\nspoke to all these manufacturers _in their own language_, which they\r\ndid not expect, and these poor people have only been accustomed to\r\nhear demagogues and Chartists.\r\n\r\nWe cannot understand how you can think the country about Chatsworth\r\n_not_ pretty, for it is (with the exception of the moors) beautiful,\r\nwooded hills and valleys and rapid streams. The country round Belvoir\r\nI do not admire, but the view from the castle is very fine and\r\nextensive, and Albert says puts him so in mind of the Kalenberg....\r\n\r\nPray have you heard anything about Aumale's plans? Dear little Gaston\r\nseems much better.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Bordeaux has been informed of my and the Government's\r\nextreme displeasure at their conduct; they say there shall be no more\r\nsuch displays. He was to leave London yesterday, only to return again\r\nfor a day, and then to leave England altogether.\r\n\r\nWith Albert's love, ever, dearest Uncle, your most devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 96: The Prince hunted with the Belvoir hounds on the\r\n    5th.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: AN AMERICAN VIEW OF MONARCHY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _15th December 1843._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST VICTORIA,--I am most happy to see that your journey passed\r\nso well, and trust you are not sorry to be again in your very dear\r\nand comfortable home, and with your dear children. People are\r\nvery strange, and their great delight is to find fault with their\r\nfellow-creatures; what harm could it have done them if Albert had\r\n_not_ hunted at all? and still I have no doubt that his having hunted\r\nwell and boldly has given more satisfaction than if he had done Heaven\r\nknows what praiseworthy deed; _ainsi est et sera le monde_.\r\n\r\nI am glad also that the Birmingham course succeeded so well; the theme\r\nhad been for some years, particularly amongst manufacturers, that\r\nRoyalty was useless and ignorant, and that the greatest blessing would\r\nbe, to manufacture beyond measure, and to have an American form of\r\nGovernment, with an elective head of State.\r\n\r\nFortunately, there has always hitherto been in England a very\r\naristocratic feeling freely accepted by the people, who like it, and\r\nshow that they like it.... I was much amused, some time ago, by a\r\nvery rich and influential American from New York assuring me that they\r\nstood in great need of a Government which was able to grant protection\r\nto property, and that the feeling of many was for Monarchy instead\r\nof the misrule of mobs, as they had it, and that he wished very much\r\n_some branch of the Coburg family might be disposable_ for such a\r\nplace. _Qu'en dites-vous_, is not this flattering?...\r\n\r\nThere is nothing very remarkable going on, besides I mean to write\r\nagain on some subjects. Give my best love to Albert, and Pussy, who\r\nmay remember me perhaps, and I remain, ever, my beloved Victoria, your\r\ndevoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _19th December 1843._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--Your kind and dear letter of the 15th, written\r\nin your true wit and humour, reached me on Sunday and gave me great\r\npleasure. We have had also most wonderfully mild weather, but _I_\r\nthink very disagreeable and unseasonable; it always makes me so\r\nbilious. The young folks are very flourishing and prosperous--Pussette\r\nknowing all her letters, and even beginning to read a little. When I\r\nmentioned your birthday to her, she said, \"I cried when I saw Uncle\r\nLeopold,\" which _was_ the case, I am sorry to say, the first time she\r\nsaw you this year....\r\n\r\nI don't believe that the _white_ flag on the house at Belgrave\r\nSquare[97] is true. Lord Melbourne and the Beauvales were here for\r\nthree nights; and it was a pleasure to see Lord Melbourne so much\r\nhimself again; the first evening he was a good deal excited and talked\r\nand laughed as of old; the two other evenings he was in the quite\r\nsilent mood which he often used to be in formerly, and really _quite_\r\nhimself, and there was hardly any strangeness at all. Lady Beauvale is\r\nreally a _very, very_, charming person, and so attentive and kind to\r\nboth her husband and Lord Melbourne. Our little chapel here (which is\r\nextremely pretty) is to be consecrated this morning, and Lady Douro\r\ncomes into Waiting for the first time. To-morrow Mamma gives us a\r\ndinner. Poor Lord Lynedoch[98] is, I fear, dying, and Lord Grey is so\r\nbad he cannot last long.[99]\r\n\r\nEver your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 97: The house occupied by the Duc de Bordeaux.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 98: Thomas, Lord Lynedoch, had died the previous\r\n    day, aged ninety-five.
