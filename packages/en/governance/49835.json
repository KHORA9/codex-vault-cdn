It would be unnecessary to prove a proposition which is\r\nso universally acknowledged and felt. It has happened however, that, in\r\nour approaches towards this crisis, the Public understanding has been\r\nbut little addressed upon the subject; so that the appeal which is now\r\nsuddenly made to their passions and imaginations, finds them unprepared\r\nwith that knowledge of the true circumstances of the case, which can\r\nalone enable them to govern those passions, and control those\r\nimaginations. Let us then endeavour to recover the time which has been\r\nlost, by taking a deliberate view of the circumstances which produce\r\nthis crisis.\r\n\r\nThe crisis, is the proximity of the term which may conclude the East\r\nIndia Company's rights, to the exclusive trade with India and China, and\r\nto the powers of government now exercised by them over the Indian\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nThe rights of the East India Company are two-fold; and have long been\r\ndistinguished as, their _permanent_ rights, and their _temporary_\r\nrights. Those rights are derived to them from distinct Charters, granted\r\nto them at different times by Parliament. By the former, they were\r\ncreated a _perpetual_ Corporate Society of Merchants, trading to\r\nIndia[1]. By the latter, they obtained, for a _limited period of time_,\r\nthe exclusive right of trading with India and China, and of executing\r\nthe powers of government over those parts of the Indian territory, which\r\nwere acquired either by conquest or by negotiation. The Charter\r\nconveying the latter limited rights, is that which will expire in the\r\ncourse of the ensuing year 1814; on the expiration of which, the\r\nexclusive trade to the East will be again open to the British population\r\nat large, and the powers of the India Government will lapse in course\r\nto the Supreme Government of the British Empire, to be provided for as\r\nParliament in its wisdom may judge it advisable to determine.\r\n\r\nThe renewal of an _expired_ privilege cannot be pursued upon a ground of\r\n_right_. The exclusive Charter of the Company is _a patent_, and their\r\npatent, like every other patent, is limited as to _its duration_. But\r\nthough the patentee cannot allege a ground of right for the renewal of\r\nhis patent, he may show such strong pretensions, such good claims in\r\nequity, such weighty reasons of expediency for its renewal, as may\r\nensure its attainment. Such are the claims and the pretensions of the\r\nEast India Company to a renewal of their Charter; and as such they have\r\nbeen promptly and cheerfully received, both by the Government and the\r\ncountry at large.\r\n\r\nBut the progress of society, during a long course of years, is of a\r\nnature to produce a considerable alteration in the general state of\r\nthings; the state of things must, therefore, naturally be called into\r\nconsideration, upon the expiration of the term of years which determines\r\nthe exclusive Charter of the East India Company; in order to inquire,\r\nwhether that Charter should be renewed precisely in the same terms, and\r\nwith the same conditions, as before; or whether the actual state of\r\npublic affairs demands, that some alteration, some modification, of\r\nterms and conditions, should be introduced into the Charter or System\r\nwhich is to succeed.\r\n\r\nThe arduous task of this investigation must necessarily fall upon those\r\npersons, who chance to be in the Administration of the Country, at the\r\nlatest period to which the arrangements for the renewal of the Charter\r\ncan be protracted; and it is hardly possible to imagine a more difficult\r\nand perplexing position, for any Administration. Those persons, if they\r\nhave any regard for the duties which they owe to the Public, will\r\nconsider themselves as standing _between two interests_; the interest of\r\nthose who are about to lose an exclusive right, and the interest of\r\nthose who are about to acquire an open and a common one. They will be\r\ndisposed to listen, patiently and impartially, to the pretensions of\r\nboth parties; of those who pray for the renewal of an exclusive\r\nprivilege, and of those who pray that they may not be again wholly\r\nexcluded from the right which has reverted. And although they may amply\r\nallow the preference which is due to the former petitioners, yet they\r\nwill endeavour to ascertain, whether the latter may not, with safety to\r\nthe public interest, receive some enlargement of the benefits, which the\r\nopportunity opens to them, and from which they have been so long\r\nexcluded.\r\n\r\nWhile they thus look alternately to each of these interests, and are\r\nengaged in striving to establish a reconciliation between the two, it\r\nwill be neither equitable nor liberal for one of the interested parties\r\nto throw out a doubt to the Public, whether they do this \"from a\r\nconsciousness of strength, and a desire of increasing their own power\r\nand influence, or from a sense of weakness and a wish to strengthen\r\nthemselves by the adoption of popular measures[2].\" And the author of\r\nthe doubt may find himself at length obliged to determine it, by an\r\nawkward confession, that Ministers do not do it \"with any view of\r\naugmenting their own patronage and power[3].\"\r\n\r\nIt is thus that the Ministers of the Crown have conducted themselves, in\r\nthe embarrassing crisis into which they have fallen. Fully sensible of\r\nthe just and honourable pretensions which the East India Company have\r\nestablished in the course of their long, important, and distinguished\r\ncareer, they have consented to recommend to Parliament, _to leave the\r\nwhole system of Indian Government and Revenue to the Company_, under the\r\nprovisions of the Act of 1793; together with _the exclusive trade to\r\nChina_, as they have hitherto possessed them; but, at the same time,\r\nconsidering the present state of the world, and its calamitous effects\r\nupon the commercial interest in general, they are of opinion, that some\r\nparticipation in the Indian trade, thus reverting, might possibly be\r\nconceded, under due regulations, to British merchants not belonging to\r\nthe East India Company; which would not impair the interests either of\r\nthe Public or of the Company.\r\n\r\nIn this moderate opinion, they are fully justified, by the consent of\r\nthe Company, to admit the Merchants of the out-ports to a share in the\r\nIndian trade. And thus far, all is amicable. But the out-port Merchants\r\nhaving represented to Government, that the condition, hitherto annexed\r\nto a Licensed Import Trade,--of bringing back their Indian Cargoes to\r\nthe port of London, and of disposing of them solely in the Company's\r\nsales, in Leadenhall Street,--would defeat the object of the concession;\r\nand that the delay, embarrassment, and perplexity, which such an\r\narrangement would create, would destroy the simple plan of their\r\nventure; and having therefore desired, that they might be empowered to\r\nreturn with their cargoes to the ports from whence they originally\r\nsailed, and to which all their interests are confined; Government, being\r\nconvinced of the justice of the representation, have proposed that the\r\nImport Trade may be yielded to the Out-ports, _under proper\r\nregulations_, as well as the Export Trade. To this demand the Court of\r\nDirectors peremptorily refuse their consent; and upon this _only point_\r\nthe parties are now at issue. This question alone, retards the final\r\narrangements for the renewal of their Charter.\r\n\r\nYet it is this point, which one of the parties interested affirms, to be\r\n\"a question of the last importance to the safety of the British Empire\r\nin India, and of the British Constitution at home;\" and therefore\r\nundertakes to resist it, with all the determination which the importance\r\nof so great a stake would naturally inspire. But, when we compare the\r\nreal measure in question with the menacing character which is thus\r\nattempted to be attached to it, we at once perceive something so\r\nextravagantly hyperbolical, something so disproportionate, that it at\r\nonce fixes the judgment; and forces upon it a suspicion, that there is\r\nmore of policy and design, than of truth and sincerity in the assertion.\r\nThat objections to the measure might arise, capable of distinct\r\nstatement and exposition, is a thing conceivable; and, these being\r\nstated, it would be a subject for consideration, how far they were\r\nremovable. But to assert, in a round period, that the safety of the\r\nempire in Europe and Asia is fundamentally affected in the requisition,\r\nthat a ship proceeding from Liverpool or Bristol to India, might return\r\nfrom India to Liverpool or Bristol, instead of to the Port of London,\r\nis calculated rather to shake, than to establish, confidence in those\r\nwho make the assertion. Yet this is the question which the country is\r\nnow called upon to consider, as one tending to convulse the British\r\nConstitution. Surely, if the foundations of the empire in both\r\nhemispheres have nothing more to threaten them, than whether the\r\nout-port shipping shall carry their cargoes home to their respective\r\nports, or repair to the dock-yards in the port of London, the most timid\r\npolitician may dismiss his alarms and resume his confidence. When the\r\nEast India Company, by conceding a regulated Export Trade, have at once\r\ndemonstrated the absurdity of all the predictions which foretold, in\r\nthat Trade, the overthrow of the Indian Empire; we may confidently\r\nbelieve, that the Import Trade will prove as little destructive, and\r\nthat its danger will be altogether as chimerical as the former.\r\n\r\nWhether the Court of Directors endeavour to fix that menacing character\r\nupon the proposed Import Trade, as a bar against any further\r\nrequisition, is a question which will naturally occur to any\r\ndispassionate person, who is not immediately and personally interested\r\nin the conditions of the Charter; and he will be strongly inclined to\r\nthe affirmative in that question, when he finds, that the reason which\r\nthey have alleged for their resistance, is their apprehension of the\r\nincreased activity which the practice of smuggling would acquire, from\r\nthe free return of the out-port ships from India to their respective\r\nports. It is not a little extraordinary, that they should so strenuously\r\nurge this argument against those persons, who, while they propose the\r\nmeasure, are themselves responsible for the good management and\r\nprotection of the revenue; and who must therefore be supposed to feel\r\nthe necessity of providing means and regulations, adapted to the measure\r\nwhich they propose. The Ministers of the Crown have not failed to inform\r\nthe Court of Directors, that, in consequence of the communications which\r\nthey have had with the Commissioners of the Customs and Excise upon the\r\nsubject, they find that the Directors have greatly over-rated the danger\r\nwhich they profess to entertain; and they acquaint them, that new\r\nregulations will be provided to meet the new occasion; and that the\r\nout-port ships and cargoes will be subject to forfeiture upon the\r\ndiscovery of any illicit articles on board. Yet the Court of Directors\r\nstill persist in declaring, that the hazard of _smuggling_ is _the\r\nreason_ why they will not grant to the out-ports an import trade; and\r\nthis, through a fear of compromising \"the safety of the British Empire\r\nin India, and the British Constitution at home.\"\r\n\r\nA calm and temperate observer, who scrupulously weighs the force and\r\nmerits of this reasoning, will naturally be forced into so much\r\nscepticism as to doubt, whether there may not be some _other reasons_,\r\nbesides the safety of the Empire, which may induce the East India\r\nCompany to stand so firm for the condition of bringing all the import\r\nIndian trade _into the Port of London_? Whether there may not be some\r\nreasons, of a _narrower_ sphere than those of the interests of the\r\nEmpire? In searching for such reasons, it will occur to him, that the\r\nPort of London is the seat of the Company's immediate and separate\r\ninterests; and he will shrewdly suspect, that those interests are the\r\n_real_, while those of the Empire are made the _ostensible_, motive for\r\nso vigorous a resistance. When he reflects, _that it is proposed to\r\nleave the Company in the undisturbed possession of all the power of\r\nGovernment over the Indian Empire, which they have hitherto enjoyed;\r\nthat they are to remain possessed, as heretofore, of the exclusive trade\r\nto China, from whence four-fifths of their commercial profit is\r\nderived_; that they themselves have virtually admitted the falsity of\r\nthe theoretical mischiefs, foretold as the certain results of an\r\nout-port trade, by having agreed to concede that trade, to the extent\r\nrequired by Government; that they equally allow, an import trade for the\r\nmerchants of the out-ports; but make their resistance upon the single\r\npoint, that the import trade should be all brought together into their\r\nown warehouses, and should be disposed of in their own sales in\r\nLeadenhall Street: when he combines all these considerations, he will\r\nthink that he plainly discovers, that the interests of the Empire at\r\nlarge are not quite so much involved in the question as they proclaim;\r\nand that, if any interests are more pressingly calculated than others,\r\nit must be their own, and not the Public's. If their interests are to be\r\naffected by the measure, let them fairly state it, and show the extent;\r\nbut let them not endeavour to defend them covertly, under an artful and\r\nfactious allegation of _the ruin of the British Constitution_. And if\r\nthey really do apprehend that the Constitution would be endangered, let\r\nthem not hazard such consequences by their own proceedings. Let them not\r\ncome forward as advocates for the preservation of the Empire, if their\r\nrhetoric is to sink into a threat, of \"_shutting up the great shop of\r\nthe India House.\"_\r\n\r\nIt may be well to call to the recollection of the East India Company,\r\nthat they owe their present state to an assertion of those very rights\r\nto open trade which have now been brought forward; for, when the first,\r\nor London East India Company had experienced certain disappointments and\r\nfailures, various adventurers came forward with claims similar to those\r\nwhich have been alleged by the merchants of the present day, and\r\nobtained an incorporation, to the prejudice of the old Company; and\r\nalthough the old, or London East India Company, afterwards effected an\r\nunion with the new, or English East India Company, and with them gave\r\norigin to the present Company, yet the UNITED EAST INDIA COMPANY should\r\nnot forget, how much the activity of the Indian trade was stimulated by\r\nthe assertion of the rights of their predecessors, _to participate in\r\nthe trade which had been granted exclusively to a former Company_.\r\n\r\nGRACCHUS.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The _rights and pretensions_ of the Company are fully considered in\r\nthe Tenth Letter.\r\n\r\n[2] Considerations on the Danger of laying open the Trade with India and\r\nChina, p. 13.\r\n\r\n[3] Ibid. p. 18.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, January 13, 1813._\r\n\r\nIt is a distinguishing character appertaining to Britons, to express\r\nforcibly their feelings, whenever they think they discover any\r\ndisposition to encroach upon their rights. It is not therefore to be\r\nwondered at, that the communication of the papers, on the subject of the\r\nEast India Company's Charter, which was made by the Directors to the\r\nProprietors, on the 5th instant, should have produced the effect which\r\nwas then manifested; of an almost unanimous disposition, to support the\r\nDirectors in their resistance of a measure, which, at the time, was\r\nregarded as an invasion, on the part of the Government, of the\r\nestablished rights of the East India Company.\r\n\r\nBut now that the momentary ebullition of that spirit has had time to\r\nsubside, and to give place to cool and sober reflection, it may not be\r\nunacceptable to the Proprietors at large to look calmly and attentively\r\ninto the subject; and to examine its bearings on their own substantial\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nIt must be manifest to every man, who will only refer to the accounts\r\nwhich have been published in the Reports of the Select Committee of the\r\nHouse of Commons, that, from the magnitude of the Company's debt, it\r\nwould be impossible to calculate the time at which the Proprietors could\r\ncontemplate any augmentation of their present dividends of 10½ per\r\ncent.; even though the Charter, instead of being within one year of its\r\nexpiration, had an extended period of twenty years to operate.\r\n\r\nIt is equally manifest, from the correspondence of the Court of\r\nDirectors with Government, that, in agreeing to the proposition of\r\nopening the Export Trade to the out-ports of the United Kingdom, they\r\nwere free from any apprehension, that the continuance of the present\r\ndividend could be endangered by their conceding that point. And,\r\ntherefore, although the Proprietors were precluded from entertaining any\r\nreasonable expectation of _an increase_ to their dividends, they were\r\nperfectly warranted to consider the continuance of that which they now\r\nreceive, as free from any hazard, in consequence of the extension\r\nproposed to be granted to the Export Trade.\r\n\r\nWhether they may remain in the same confidence, under _all_ existing\r\ncircumstances, is a question which the Proprietors are now earnestly\r\nsolicited to examine. The point at issue (if I may apply that expression\r\nto a case, in which the Company are upon the disadvantageous ground of\r\npetitioning for the renewal of a privilege, now about to expire) is,\r\nwhether the ships which shall be permitted to clear out from the\r\nout-ports of the United Kingdom, ought to be allowed to return to any\r\ngiven description of those ports, or whether they should all be\r\ncompelled to enter at the Port of London? And upon _this point_ is made\r\nto hinge a question, which may affect (not the _British Empire and\r\nConstitution_, but) the main interest of the Proprietors, namely, _their\r\ndividends_. For no man can be so inconsiderately sanguine as to suppose,\r\nthat the Company, under the present pressure of their pecuniary\r\nembarrassments, (whatever may have been the causes from whence they have\r\narisen;) embarrassments proceeding from a debt, in India and in England,\r\nof _more than forty-two millions_; nearly four millions of which are in\r\naccepted bills on England, which will shortly become due, and for the\r\npayment of which there are not funds at the India House; no man can be\r\nso inconsiderately sanguine as to suppose, that the dividend may not\r\nbecome a little precarious, under such circumstances. It must be evident\r\nto the most superficial observer, that the credit of the Company with\r\nthe Public can only be sustained by the prompt and liberal aid of\r\nParliament; and it will hardly be maintained, that it is a _propitious_\r\nmode of soliciting that aid, to connect with the solicitation an avowed\r\ndetermination to oppose a measure, which Government represent it to be\r\ntheir duty to recommend to Parliament, for the general benefit of the\r\ncommunity; a measure, founded on, and growing out of, the principle of\r\nthe Charter of 1793, which first opened the private trade between India\r\nand this country; the provisions respecting which trade have been\r\nprogressively extended at subsequent periods, and of which trade the\r\nPublic will now call for a further enlargement and participation, as a\r\njust and necessary qualification to the proposed renewal of the\r\nCompany's Charter.\r\n\r\nThe City of London, indeed, is _now_ an exception, and apparently a very\r\nweighty one, to this general call; but it will lose much of that weight\r\nwith the Public, and must fall into the scale of an interested party,\r\nwhen it is recollected, that so long as the question between the Company\r\nand the Public was, whether the commerce with India should remain a\r\nstrict monopoly, or whether a participation in it should be granted to\r\nindividuals, under the restriction of importing to London the\r\ncommercial interest of the metropolis was powerfully incited against the\r\nCompany; and that, to that great commercial interest, supported by the\r\nweight of Mr. Dundas's opinion, and to the more enlarged view which Lord\r\nWellesley took of the subject, the extension that has hitherto been\r\ngiven to the private trade with India is to be attributed. The\r\nexperience of twelve years has now proved, that both India and the\r\nparent state have greatly benefited by that extension; and it has\r\nfollowed, as a necessary consequence of that experience, that the active\r\nand intelligent merchants of the other large ports of the United\r\nKingdom, have urged their fair pretensions, to be admitted to a share in\r\nthe profits of that widely diffused trade; by sending their merchandise\r\nfrom their own ports, and by receiving the returning cargoes into their\r\nown warehouses, in those ports.\r\n\r\nA reference to the printed papers (as has already been signified) will\r\nshow, that the Court of Directors were prevailed upon to concede _the\r\nfirst_ of those points, but that they have been immoveable with respect\r\nto _the second_; although their own commercial knowledge must have made\r\nit evident to them, that the concession of the first, that is, _a free\r\nexport_, would be nugatory, unless supported by the benefit arising from\r\nthe _freedom of import_; which is not only in the proportion of four to\r\none in amount to the export, but is requisite to give that unity to the\r\nconcern, without which great commercial establishments cannot be kept\r\nup.\r\n\r\nSuch is the state of the question, or, as it has been called, by some\r\nstrange perversion of ideas, the _negotiation_, between the Company, as\r\napplicants for a renewal of their Charter which is about to expire, and\r\nthe Government, through whose aid it is to be solicited, or at least,\r\nwithout whose concurrence it is certainly very questionable, whether\r\nthey would be able to obtain it. These are the circumstances, under\r\nwhich the affairs of the East India Company must necessarily, and\r\nspeedily, be brought forward, for the consideration of Parliament. Can\r\nit, then, be considered an exaggerated view of the hazards of such a\r\nsituation, to suppose, that some guardian of the public purse may deem\r\nit requisite to inquire, whether the application for pecuniary aid from\r\nParliament ought not to be preceded by a substantial proof, not of\r\nconcession, for they have in fact nothing to concede, but of something\r\nlike accommodation on the part of the Proprietors? And in that event,\r\nmight it not be questioned, whether, since the dividend of 10 per cent.\r\nwas sanctioned upon an assumption, that the revenue of the Company\r\nyielded a _surplus_ of upwards of a million; now, when instead of a\r\nsurplus, a _deficit_ is admitted to exist, the dividend ought not to be\r\nreduced, not merely to the standard from which it had been raised under\r\nthe supposed prosperous state of the Company's affairs, but to a\r\nstandard to be regulated by the amount of the ascertained profits upon\r\ntheir own trade, under whatever circumstances it may hereafter be\r\nconducted?\r\n\r\nIt is not meant to insinuate, that any condition of the kind alluded to\r\nis likely to be imposed, in granting the relief so pressingly required\r\nby the present exigencies of the Company; but if a necessity for the\r\nwinding up of their affairs, as an exclusive Company, should arrive, and\r\nif their own resources, with the profits they may derive from their\r\ncommerce as a Corporate Body, should not be adequate to the payment of a\r\ndividend of 10½ per cent.; could it reasonably be expected, that\r\nParliament would, in _all future times_, extend its liberality towards\r\nthe Proprietors of India stock, to the extent of _securing to them_ a\r\ncontinuance of their present dividend?\r\n\r\nIt is to be feared, that those who may have calculated upon such a\r\nresult, have taken a false measure of their _prospective situation_; and\r\nit is on account of this apprehension, that it appears highly important\r\nto call the attention of the Proprietors to the care of their own\r\nsubstantial interest in the dividend; an interest, which to them is, and\r\nmust be paramount.\r\n\r\nGRACCHUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thursday, January 14, 1813._\r\n\r\nIt is at all times an object equally interesting and instructive, to\r\ntrace the origin of laws and institutions, and to follow them in the\r\nprogress of their operation; but this inquiry becomes more powerfully\r\nattractive, when the pursuit is stimulated by an anxiety to defend a\r\nsupposed right, or to acquire an extension of advantages which are\r\nalready possessed.\r\n\r\nSuch an investigation appearing to be a necessary sequel of the subject\r\ntreated of in a former communication, let us now take a succinct view of\r\nthose provisions of the Act of 1793, by which the East India Company,\r\nupon the last renewal of their Charter for a fixed time, were called\r\nupon to relax from the exclusive restrictions of the monopoly which they\r\nhad so long enjoyed. Taking that Act as the source and origin from\r\nwhence the present India Question arises, let us briefly follow the\r\nsubject in its progress, down to the propositions that are now before\r\nthe Public.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to premise, that the Company had, from an early period\r\nof their commerce, granted as a favour and indulgence to the Captains\r\nand Officers of their ships, permission to fill a regular portion of\r\ntonnage with certain prescribed articles, upon their private account,\r\nsubject to the condition; that those privileged articles should be\r\nlodged in the warehouses of the Company, that they should be exposed by\r\nthem at their sales, and that they should pay from 7 to 5 per cent. to\r\ncover the charge of commission and merchandise.\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1793, relieved the trade carried on under this indulgence, by\r\nreducing the rates of charge to 3 per cent.; which was established as\r\nthe rate, at which the more enlarged trade, for the first time allowed\r\nby that Act to private merchants unconnected with the Company, should\r\npay to the Company; which trade was then limited to 3000 tons, the\r\nshipping for which was to be provided by the Company, who were to be\r\npaid freight for such tonnage, and were to have the same control over\r\nthe goods which might be imported, as they already exercised over the\r\ntrade of their Captains and Officers.\r\n\r\nIt was soon found, that the conditions, under which this trade was\r\nopened, changed its operations, so as to render the privilege of little\r\nvalue. The residents in India, for whose benefit it was professed to\r\nhave been principally intended, presented memorials upon the subject to\r\nthe Governments abroad; and the merchants of London represented to the\r\nauthorities in England, the necessity of an enlargement of the\r\nprinciple, as well as a correction of the regulations. It is not\r\nnecessary, to go into any detail of the reasons upon which those\r\napplications were supported; because Mr. Dundas, who then presided over\r\nthe affairs of India, and who had introduced and carried through\r\nParliament the Bill of 1793, did in the most explicit terms inform the\r\nCourt of Directors, in his letter of the 2d April, 1800, that \"he should\r\nbe uncandid, if he did not fairly acknowledge, that experience had\r\nproved it to be inadequate to the purposes for which it was\r\nintended--and that therefore he was clear, that the clause in the Act\r\nought to be repealed, and in place thereof _a power be given to the\r\nGovernments abroad, to allow the British subjects, resident in India, to\r\nbring home their funds to Britain on the shipping of the country_;\" that\r\nis to say, on ships built in India. This letter, of the President of the\r\nBoard of Control, was referred by the Court of Directors to a special\r\nCommittee of their body; who, in a very elaborate Report, dated 27th\r\nJan. 1801, that is to say, after the deliberation of eight months,\r\ndeclared that it was impossible for them to acquiesce in the proposition\r\nthen made by Mr. Dundas. They supported their opposition by a variety of\r\narguments, from which the following short passage need alone be\r\nselected:--\"The proposals which have been brought forward by certain\r\ndescriptions of men, both in India and in England, for the admission of\r\ntheir ships into the trade and navigation between India and Europe,\r\n_proposals which extend to the establishment of a regular and systematic\r\nprivilege_ in favour of such ships, appear, when maturely weighed, and\r\nfollowed into all their operations, _to involve principles and effects\r\ndangerous to the interests both of the Company and of the nation_; that\r\n_the adoption of those principles would, immediately and essentially,\r\naffect both the system of policy which the Legislature has established\r\nfor maintaining the connexion and communication between this country and\r\nBritish India, and the chartered privileges of the East India Company_.\r\nAnd the introduction of any practice of this nature, would tend to widen\r\ngradually, and indefinitely, the channel of intercourse between India\r\nand Britain; to multiply the relations between the two countries; and to\r\npour Europeans of the lower sort into India, and Indian sailors into\r\nthis country; to lessen, by both these means, the respect for the\r\nEuropean character; _to disturb and shake our government there_; and, in\r\na word, to lead progressively but surely to colonization.\"\r\n\r\nThe language employed by the Court of Directors at the present day, in\r\nopposition to the proposition for allowing private ships returning from\r\nIndia to import to the places from whence they had sailed upon their\r\noutward voyage, is feeble and languid; in comparison with the passage\r\nwhich has been just now recited, from the Report of their Special\r\nCommittee, made upwards of twelve years ago, upon the proposition then\r\nsubmitted by Mr. DUNDAS. That Minister, in his reply of the 21st March,\r\n1801, to the Court of Directors, observed, \"_I have reviewed my own\r\nopinions with the most jealous attention, and I have weighed, with the\r\nmost anxious care, the arguments of those who suppose that the system\r\nwhich I have recommended, is likely to produce any inconvenience or\r\ndanger to the rights, privileges, and exclusive interests of the East\r\nIndia Company: but it is my misfortune to view the subject in an\r\nopposite light. If any thing can endanger that Monopoly, it is_ AN\r\nUNNECESSARY ADHERENCE TO POINTS NOT ESSENTIAL TO ITS EXISTENCE.\" Mr.\r\nDundas then adverted to a letter of the 30th September, recently\r\nreceived from the Governor-General, Marquis Wellesley, which, he said,\r\n\"had with clearness and precision ably detailed and demonstrated the\r\ngrounds of those opinions.\"\r\n\r\nBut, the judgment and reasoning of Mr. Dundas, elucidated by the\r\narguments of Marquis Wellesley, (which were founded on the knowledge of\r\nwhat, at the time, was passing under the eye of the Governor-General,)\r\nhad not influence upon the Court of Directors, sufficient to make them\r\nadopt the proposition of the President of the Board of Control; and\r\nstill less, the enlargement of that proposition, as suggested by Lord\r\nWellesley; who represented, \"the great advantages that would result to\r\nthe Sovereign State, by encouraging the shipping and exportation of\r\nIndia; and, that if the capital of the Merchants in India, should not\r\nsupply funds sufficient for the conduct of the whole private Export\r\nTrade from India to Europe, no dangerous consequences could result from\r\napplying, to this branch of commerce, capital drawn directly from the\r\nBritish Empire in Europe:\" thereby taking that trade from foreign\r\nnations, whose participation in it was become \"_alarmingly increasing_.\"\r\n\r\nThese distinct and concurring opinions, of the President of the Board of\r\nControl and the Governor-General, could not prevail upon the Court of\r\nDirectors to \"alter the opinion they had delivered.\" They accordingly\r\ndrew up paragraphs, to be sent to the Governments in India, conveying\r\ntheir _final resolutions and instructions_.--\"The British residents in\r\nIndia,\" they said, \"aided by those who take up their cause here (_viz._\r\nthe King's Ministers and the Merchants of London), desire to send their\r\nown ships to Britain, with private merchandise; and the principle of\r\nemploying British capital in this trade, is also contended for. This\r\ntrade, although it might for a time be carried on through the existing\r\nforms of the Company, would at length supersede them; the British\r\ncommerce with India, instead of being, as it is now, _a regulated\r\nmonopoly_, would deserve, more properly, the character of a regulated\r\nfree trade; a title, which it is to be feared would not suit it long.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the substance of the paragraphs which the Directors had\r\nprepared, upon the propositions we have been considering; although both\r\nthe one and the other of those propositions explicitly provided, _that\r\nall the private trade with India, export as well as import, should be\r\nconfined to the Port of London_. The Board of Control, though no longer\r\npresided at by Mr. Dundas, interposed its authority; and, on the 2d\r\nJune, 1801, the Directors were enjoined not to send those paragraphs to\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nThe language of the Court of Directors in 1813, upon the question of the\r\nImport Trade, is, as has been already affirmed, feeble and languid in\r\ncomparison with that which the same body employed in 1800 and 1801, with\r\nregard to the admission of India-built ships in the carrying trade\r\nbetween Britain and India; but Indian-built ships have, from that time\r\nto the present, been employed in that trade, and none of the alarming\r\nconsequences, which the Directors had predicted, have resulted from that\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nMay it not therefore be reasonably assumed, that the alarm under which\r\nthey now profess themselves to be, would prove to be equally unfounded;\r\nthat the direful influence upon the Constitution and Empire, which the\r\nDirectors tell us is to be apprehended, from any change in the existing\r\nsystem that shall admit private ships returning from India to import at\r\nthe places whence they had cleared out, would be found to be as little\r\nentitled to serious consideration; and that neither the public revenue,\r\nnor the immediate interests of the Company, would be endangered by an\r\nexperiment, which the Government and the Company would be equally bound\r\nto watch; and which Parliament could at all times control, and if\r\nnecessary, absolutely bring to a termination?\r\n\r\nGRACCHUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Saturday, Jan. 16, 1813._\r\n\r\nHaving hitherto taken a view of those parts of the India Question, which\r\nmore immediately relate, to the commercial interests of this country,\r\nand to the Proprietors of East India Stock; let us now advert to the\r\ndeportment of the Directors towards the Ministers of the Crown, in their\r\nlast communication made to the Court of Proprietors.\r\n\r\nIt appears, from the printed papers, that as long back as the month of\r\nApril, the President of the Board of Control put the Court of Directors\r\nin full possession of the _final opinion_ of His Majesty's Ministers;\r\nconcerning the privileges of trade which, they conceived, it would be\r\ntheir duty to submit to Parliament, as the basis of a Charter. Early in\r\nthe month of December, a deputation from the Court of Directors appears\r\nto have been admitted, by special appointment, to a conference; in which\r\nit is known to every clerk and messenger about the offices, as well as\r\nto every member of that deputation, that the three Secretaries of State,\r\nthe First Lord of the Treasury, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer\r\nattended. And it is equally notorious, that two subsequent meetings were\r\nheld, between the same parties. We are warranted to infer, from the\r\nletter of Lord Buckinghamshire, that the discussions which took place at\r\nthose several conferences, were declared to be open and unreserved; with\r\na view that the Members of Government, and the Members of the\r\nDeputation, might freely, and without restraint of form, deliver their\r\nreasons for the opinions which they respectively held.\r\n\r\nThe impression which the Court of Directors received, from the conduct\r\nof the Ministers of the Crown, in those conferences, is manifested in\r\nthe Letter from the Chairman and Deputy Chairman to the President of the\r\nBoard of Control, of the 30th December, in which \"they return sincere\r\nacknowledgments for the attention with which their representations had\r\nbeen listened to, in the various interviews with which they had been\r\nhonoured by his Lordship, and His Majesty's Ministers, who attended.\"\r\n\r\nIn conferences of this nature, and between parties thus relatively\r\ncircumstanced, all that was to be expected from the Ministers of the\r\nCrown was, that they should listen with attention to the representations\r\nmade to them, and should reply to those representations, so as to\r\ncommand the acknowledgment of the inferior party. If, in the issue, (to\r\nuse the words of Mr. Dundas to the same authorities in 1801,) \"after\r\nhaving reviewed their opinions with the most jealous attention, and\r\nafter having weighed, with the most anxious care, the arguments brought\r\nforward, it was still their misfortune to view the subject in an\r\nopposite light\" to that which presented itself to the judgment of the\r\nDirectors; it was not to be expected, that they should surrender their\r\nown judgment to that of the Directors, who stood in the anomalous\r\ncharacter of defendants and judges in their own cause.\r\n\r\nAt the time that these conferences were terminated, the Ministers appear\r\nto have entertained an expectation, that the subject would not be\r\nfurther agitated, until an official communication should be made upon it\r\nfrom Government. The Court of Directors, however, met on the 18th\r\nDecember, and entered something very like a protest, by anticipation,\r\nagainst the measure, which they knew, (from what appears to have passed\r\nat the conferences,) would be the subject of that official\r\ncommunication; and they transmitted it to the India Board. By the\r\nirregularity of this proceeding; which bore upon the face of it the\r\nappearance of a design, either of intimidating Government from coming to\r\nthe final decision which they had signified, or of creating a bar\r\nagainst future discussion; they precluded Government from going into any\r\ndetail of argument, and consequently, the reply of the President of the\r\nBoard of Control appears to have been principally intended, to convey\r\nofficially to the Court of Directors that result, which the Members of\r\nthe Deputation were already in possession of; namely, \"those conditions,\r\nupon which alone, consistently with their public duty, the King's\r\nServants could submit a proposition to Parliament for the renewal of the\r\nCharter.\"\r\n\r\nTo this official communication, the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the\r\nEast India Company sent a reply, wherein they offer some explanation of\r\nthe irregularity; but, in their opposition to the ultimate determination\r\nof Government, they call upon the King's confidential servants, to\r\nimpart to them all the reasons which had determined them to think, that\r\n\"the privilege of Eastern commerce should be extended to British\r\nmerchants;\" and also, the specific regulations which they may propose to\r\nadopt, for giving additional security to the revenue against smuggling.\r\n\r\nThe President of the Board of Control, thus called upon to step out of\r\nhis sphere, or to admit the Court of Directors to _Cabinet discussions_,\r\nwas constrained to acquaint them, that \"the duty of Ministers had been\r\nperformed, by communicating to the Company the conditions on which they\r\nwere disposed to submit the business to Parliament;\" at the same time\r\ninforming them, that they would find most of the reasons, which had\r\ndetermined the judgment of Ministers to yield to the representations of\r\nthe out-port merchants, stated \"in the petitions presented by those\r\nmerchants to the Houses of Parliament.\" And he finally referred them,\r\nwith confidence, to the \"justice and wisdom of Parliament, for obtaining\r\na due regard to their interests.\"\r\n\r\nIf the Court of Directors did not entertain feelings and views very\r\ndifferent from those of the community at large, in consequence of that\r\npeculiar position which renders them _defendants, and judges, in their\r\nown cause_, they could not fail to contemplate with applause, the\r\ntemper, patience, and regard to public engagements, which mark the whole\r\nproceedings of Government on this arduous occasion. But, being at one\r\nand the same moment, petitioners and arbitrators, and having their\r\njudgments biassed under those clashing characters, they have not always\r\nkept themselves within the capacity, in which alone they can\r\nconsistently treat with the Government of the country. In their\r\ncommunications with the Servants of the Crown, respecting the renewal of\r\ntheir Charter, all that they are authorized to pretend to, is to have a\r\ndistinct knowledge of the conditions, on which the Government think they\r\nshall be justified in the sight of the country, in proposing to\r\nParliament the renewal of their Charter; and, in the course of obtaining\r\nthis information, they have experienced the utmost consideration, and\r\nhave received the most ample and unreserved communications from His\r\nMajesty's confidential servants; who have given their attention to every\r\nargument urged by those who appeared as representatives of the Court of\r\nDirectors, and have put them in possession of all the grounds upon which\r\nthey differ from them in opinion. After having done this, they have\r\ndischarged their highly responsible duty to the Public; and if \"_they\r\nhave the misfortune to view the subject in an opposite light_,\" the\r\nCompany's records will show them, that this is not the first time a\r\nradical difference of opinion had subsisted, concerning their\r\npretensions, between the King's Ministers and the Court of Directors.\r\n\r\nSuch being the true state of the case, it becomes a subject of grave\r\ninquiry, why the Directors, in the Court of Proprietors held at the\r\nIndia House on the 5th instant, took no step whatever for moderating the\r\nspirit which was then shown; or for rectifying the false impressions\r\nwhich were there testified, respecting the deportment of His Majesty's\r\nMinisters. It does not appear, that any one of the Directors who were\r\nparties in those various conferences, in which they acknowledge to the\r\nPresident of the Board of Control that they experienced so much\r\nattention, took any forward step to set right the misrepresentations\r\nwhich were delivered; or to repel the charges, implied or declared, of\r\ncontempt, neglect, encroachment, &c. which were so freely imputed to the\r\nServants of the Crown. But they left the spirit which had improperly\r\nbeen excited, to act by the impulse of an erroneous impression; omitting\r\nto render to the Government that justice, which the frankness of their\r\nproceedings strongly called for.\r\n\r\nA review of the debate at the India House,--with the Directors, either\r\nsilently withholding what they were enabled to impart in justification\r\nof the Government, or by the rhetoric of some of them tending to blow\r\nwider the flames of discord,--would almost authorize a suspicion, that\r\nthe Directors were not displeased at the fever which their silence\r\nnourished. It is therefore earnestly to be hoped, for the honour of the\r\nEast India Company, and more especially for the interest of the\r\nProprietors, that some Director, or other individual, may, at the next\r\nGeneral Court, strive to efface the memory of the last; who may call\r\nupon the Deputation, to render to the Ministers of the Crown whatever\r\njustice is due to them, for their conduct in the late discussions; and\r\nwho may recommend a revision of the statement, in which they represent\r\nto those Ministers, that the terms on which Government have offered to\r\nthe Company a Charter, are such as may \"_leave their dividend unprovided\r\nfor_,\" and \"_create a necessity for their going to Parliament_!\" For,\r\nunless they have brought themselves to a state to suppose, that\r\nMinisters and the Public have lost all intelligence, they must know,\r\nthat both Ministers and the Public are well aware, that they are\r\nactually under _a necessity of going to Parliament_ for aid, as soon as\r\nParliament shall be assembled; and that, at the present moment, _their\r\ndividend_ may, in strictness, be considered as _unprovided for_.\r\n\r\nGRACCHUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, January 19, 1813._\r\n\r\nThe writers, who have recently undertaken to defend and justify the\r\nopposition of the Court of Directors to any extension of the Import\r\nTrade from India to the out-ports of the kingdom, have laid a peculiar\r\nstress upon an opinion conveyed in that part of Mr. Dundas's Letter of\r\nthe 2d of April 1800, in which that Minister was considering \"the\r\n_agents_ to be employed at home; to manage the private trade of\r\nindividuals from India, and to take care of their interests in the\r\ncargoes of the returning ships.\" He states his opinion, that \"there is\r\nno use of any interference by the Company; that the great interest to be\r\nattended to on _the part of the Company_, is, that no goods come from\r\nIndia that are not deposited in the Company's warehouses; and that the\r\ngoods, so imported, be exposed at the Company's sales, agreeably to the\r\nrules prescribed for that purpose.\"\r\n\r\nIn taking ground upon any principle, it is necessary to ascertain\r\nwhether it applies to the case in point. That it was a great interest to\r\nthe East India Company to watch and control the trade carrying on under\r\ntheir own licenses, is obvious; and this the Company could not\r\neffectually do, unless that Trade, on its return from India, was brought\r\nunder their own eye, and collected within the sphere of their own\r\ncontrol; which is confined to the Port of London. But the case, to which\r\nthis argument is now applied by the advocates for the Company, is so\r\nessentially deficient, that the principles appear to be wholly\r\ninapplicable. In this _new case_, the extended trade would be carried\r\non, not under _the Company's licenses_, but under _the provision of\r\nParliament_; and the protection and control of that trade would become\r\nthe care, not of the Company, but of the executive Government. Here then\r\nthe determination of that trade would be governed, not by the separate\r\ninterest of the Company (which alone came within the scope of Mr.\r\nDundas's argument), but by the combined interests of the Company and the\r\nPublic at large. To this _combined interest_, Mr. Dundas's argument was\r\n_not_ directed; and it is a fallacy in reasoning, to apply a partial\r\nargument to a general case.\r\n\r\nBut, let us grant what these advocates assume; that the opinion here\r\ndelivered by Mr. Dundas, does really apply to the case in question. May\r\nnot that have happened at the present day, which actually did happen\r\nwith regard to the regulations of the Charter of 1793? Might not new\r\nlight be thrown upon a subject in 1813, which was supposed to have been\r\nthoroughly investigated in 1800? And, as the candour and openness of Mr.\r\nDundas caused him, in 1800, to avow, that the provisions of 1793 were\r\n_inadequate_, and prompted him strenuously to recommend the adoption of\r\na _new principle_; is it not possible that, taking into his view all the\r\ncircumstances which bear upon the question at the present day, he might,\r\nhad his life been spared, have been convinced, that the extraordinary\r\nand unforeseen changes which have taken place in the political and\r\ncommercial world, might have now rendered it, not only expedient but,\r\nnecessary to relax, in some degree, upon the point of the import trade\r\nfrom India?\r\n\r\nAt an early period of the present discussion, Ministers appear to have\r\nentertained the same maxim, of confining the import trade from India to\r\nthe Port of London. They were afterwards led, by a full exposition of\r\nall the various interests which remonstrated against that close\r\nrestriction, to deem it just and expedient to propose (and wise and\r\npolitic for the East India Company to consent), that _such of the\r\nprincipal out-ports as possessed the means whereby smuggling could best\r\nbe guarded against_, should participate with London in the import trade\r\nfrom India; reserving exclusively to London, the whole of the trade\r\nfrom China. This alteration of their original plan was suggested by\r\nthem to the Court of Directors, not as a relaxation of the _existing\r\nprivileges_ of the Company (which was the nature of Mr. Dundas's\r\nproposition in 1800), but as a qualification to take place under _a new\r\nCharter_.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Dundas suggested to the Directors the new principle, of\r\nadmitting Indian-built ships as the vehicle for carrying on the private\r\ntrade, he was not treating with them concerning _the renewal_ of their\r\nCharter; for they had then an _unexpired term of fourteen years_, in the\r\nprivileges conferred upon them by the Act of 1793. His proposition, as\r\nhas been just observed, went to _a relaxation_ of an important part of\r\nthose _subsisting privileges_; for which he sought to gain their\r\nacquiescence; and as his opinion was decided and avowed, \"that the\r\nostensible form of Government for India, with all its consequent detail\r\nof patronage, must remain as it now is, and that the monopoly of that\r\ntrade ought properly to continue in the hands of the East India\r\nCompany;\" it was prudent and seasonable in him to dwell upon that point.\r\n\r\nHave not the Ministers of the present day evinced the same opinion? Have\r\nthey not proposed, to leave the patronage of India, and the exclusive\r\nprofits of the China Trade, with the Company? Does not the China Trade\r\nensure the employment of all the large ships in the service of the\r\nCompany; together with the continued engagement, in that line of\r\nservice, of the Commanders and Officers of those ships; and also, of\r\nevery other description of person now connected with that (_the\r\nlargest_) branch of the Company's concerns? Have not Ministers proposed\r\nto confine the private trade with India to ships of four hundred tons\r\nand upwards; thereby leaving to the owners of such of the smaller ships\r\nnow in the service of the Company, as by possibility may not be required\r\nfor their commerce, the advantage (which establishment in any line of\r\nbusiness must always give) of finding employment from those who, under\r\nthe proposed extension, may engage in that trade? Have not Ministers, in\r\nproposing that the _Government_ of India should continue to be\r\nadministered through the organ of the Company, proposed to them the\r\ncontinuance of the peculiar and great benefit, of carrying on their\r\n_commerce_ by means of _the revenue_ of that Government? Whereas, the\r\nprivate adventurers must trade upon their own capitals, or at an heavy\r\ncharge of interest.\r\n\r\nHow is it, then, that we hear so much of the loss which our Navy must\r\nsustain, from the large ships of the Company being withdrawn from the\r\nEastern Trade; of the distress to which the Commanders and Officers, and\r\nthe numerous classes of artificers and others connected with those\r\nships, are to be exposed? Why are we told, that the East India Docks\r\nwill be left empty, and the Proprietors be reduced to apply to\r\nParliament for an indemnification? Can it possibly happen, that all\r\nthese calamities, so heavily denounced, should arise out of a permission\r\nto be granted to private ships, returning from India, to proceed to\r\n_certain ports to be designated_; more advantageously situated for their\r\ntrade than the Port of London? A permission, which the Directors\r\nthemselves are of opinion will not long be made use of to any great\r\nextent; for they have told us, that the adventurers in those private\r\nships will be disappointed in their speculations; and they have adverted\r\nto the mass of individual loss, which must ensue from the delusion, as\r\nfurnishing a strong argument, why Government ought not to yield to the\r\nimportunity of the Merchants of the out-ports.\r\n\r\nFrom all that has been stated, it would appear, that instead of the\r\nexaggerated picture of distress, which the advocates for a close\r\nmonopoly to the Port of London have represented as the necessary\r\nconsequence of relieving commerce from its present restrictions, we\r\nought to entertain a well-founded expectation; that _every class and\r\ndescription of persons_, who now find employment in the Indian Trade,\r\nwill continue to have their industry called into action in the same line\r\nof employment, and even to a greater extent, in some instances, than is\r\nnow experienced. For, unless the _union of interests_, which has so\r\nrecently taken place between the City of London and the East India\r\nCompany, should have the effect of preventing all competition between\r\nthe Merchants of London (formerly so eager to participate in the trade\r\nwith India), and the Merchants of the out-ports; it cannot fail to\r\nhappen, from the spirit of enterprise which has uniformly distinguished\r\nthe Metropolis, that the Port of London, _to which the whole India Trade\r\nwould be generally open_, will furnish its full proportion of the new\r\nadventurers; and thus amply fill up that void, which the East India\r\nCompany affirm would be created in the Port of London, by diverting so\r\nmuch of the Indian Trade to the out-ports: more especially, as all the\r\nhouses of Indian agency, which have been formed since the Act of 1793,\r\nare established within the Metropolis.\r\n\r\nSince this is the just prospect, which the adoption of the conditions\r\nproposed by Government as the terms for the renewal of the Company's\r\nCharter, opens to our view; since the share which the London Merchants\r\nmay take in the enlargement of the trade, would not fail to supply\r\nemployment for all that industry, which the Court of Directors assert\r\nwill be interrupted and suspended; while, at the same time, the\r\nextension of that advantage will create new sources of industry in\r\nvarious parts of the kingdom, without impairing or diminishing that of\r\nLondon; whose will be the awful responsibility, if, by an obstinate\r\nrejection of terms capable of yielding consequences so extensively\r\nbeneficial to the community, the Charter of the Company should not be\r\nrenewed; and if the disastrous effect should in consequence be produced,\r\nin London and its vicinity, of \"a suspended industry, interrupted\r\nemployment,\" and all the train of sufferings and calamities which has\r\nbeen drawn out? Who will be chargeable, before the country, with \"the\r\nloss and waste of establishments which have cost upwards of a million\r\nsterling--of shipping, to the amount of many millions--of a numerous and\r\nrespectable class of warehouse-keepers, clerks, and superior servants,\r\njoined to three thousand labourers, and their families--of tradesmen of\r\nvarious descriptions, who have incurred a very great expense for the\r\nconduct of their business?\" Who will be chargeable, in fact, with all\r\nthis destruction? Will it be the Government, who desire the East India\r\nCompany _to keep their Indian Empire, and their exclusive China trade_?\r\nOr will it be the Conductors of the East India Company, who shall suffer\r\nthis great machine suddenly to stop its action, _because their limited\r\nexclusive privileges are not made perpetual_?\r\n\r\nGRACCHUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Friday, January 22, 1813._\r\n\r\nGracchus is charged, by some of the champions of the East India Company,\r\nwith error and a want of candour, because he has represented the\r\nDirectors to have maintained, that opening the import trade from India\r\nto the out-ports of the kingdom, involves a question of the last\r\nimportance to the British Empire in India, and to the British\r\nConstitution at home; and those writers affirm, that the Directors do\r\nnot deduce the danger of those great interests from the question of the\r\nout-port trade, but from the question of disturbing the present system\r\nof administering the Government of India.\r\n\r\nYet he can discover, neither error nor want of candour in his statement.\r\nIf those advocates will take the pains to follow the whole argument of\r\nthe Directors, on the present occasion, throughout, they must be\r\nsensible, that his statement cannot be controverted. The Directors,\r\nindeed, avoid expressing their proposition in the fair and distinct form\r\nin which it is here drawn out; yet such is the proposition in effect.\r\nFor, if the whole of it be reduced into a form of syllogism, it is no\r\nother than this:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Whatever shall cause the subversion of the present system of\r\n     Indian Government, will cause danger to the Empire and\r\n     Constitution.\r\n\r\n     \"But, pressing the extension of _an import trade from India to the\r\n     out-ports_, will cause the subversion of the present system of\r\n     Indian Government.\r\n\r\n     \"Therefore, _pressing the extension of an import trade to the\r\n     out-ports, will cause danger to the Empire and Constitution_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we question the _minor_ proposition, and ask, Why, pressing an import\r\ntrade for the out-ports, should necessarily cause the subversion of the\r\nexisting system of Indian Government? the answer of the Directors is\r\nalready given:--Because they _will not_ continue to carry on that\r\nGovernment, if an import trade from India should be granted to the\r\nout-ports. Thus, the original statement is demonstrably established; and\r\nall the logic of the City cannot overturn it.\r\n\r\nThe Directors must permit the words \"_will not_;\" for, with the record\r\nof the East India Company's history before us, it is impossible to say\r\nthey _cannot_. In proof of this assertion, let us take a review of that\r\nhistory, and let us examine, what evil resulted to the Company, _during\r\nthe period that the import trade from India_ WAS ACTUALLY _extended to\r\nthe out-ports of Great Britain_.\r\n\r\nWhen the first, or London East India Company, had incurred the\r\nforfeiture of their Charter in 1693, by the non-payment of a stipulated\r\nsum of money, their privileges were immediately restored to them, and\r\nconfirmed by letters patent, granted by King William III. upon this\r\nexpress ground:--\"Considering how highly it imports the honour and\r\nwelfare of this our kingdom, and our subjects thereof, that a trade and\r\ntraffic to the East Indies should be continued; and being well satisfied\r\nthat the same may be of great and public advantage; and being also\r\ndesirous to render the same, as much as in us lies, _more national,\r\ngeneral, and extensive, than hitherto it hath been_,\" &c.\r\n\r\nThis principle, of promoting a more national, general, and extensive\r\ntrade to India than had subsisted under the then existing Company's\r\nexclusive Charter, gave rise to _a new measure_ in the year 1698, in an\r\nAct passed in the 9th and 10th year of the same king, entitled, _An Act\r\nfor raising a sum not exceeding two millions, &c. and for settling the\r\ntrade to the East Indies_. The parties subscribing towards that loan,\r\nwere formed into a Society, called _The General Society of Merchants,\r\n&c._; and such of them as chose to unite their subscriptions, and to\r\nform a joint-stock, were incorporated under the name of _The English\r\nEast India Company, &c._ The General Society possessed the privilege of\r\nan export and import trade with India, with the power of _bringing their\r\nimport cargoes from India to the_ OUT-PORTS _of the kingdom_, in the\r\nsame manner as is proposed by Government at the present day; with this\r\nonly difference, that the General Society of Merchants were not\r\nrestricted as to the ports at which they should enter, whereas\r\nGovernment have _now_ proposed, that merchants _should be restricted to\r\nsuch ports as can best afford the means of guarding against the\r\ndepredations of smuggling_.\r\n\r\nThe regulations, which were adopted for ships importing from India to\r\nthe out-ports, are to be found in the Act 9 and 10 William III. c. 44.\r\ns. 69. and were as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Provided always, and it is here enacted, that no Company, or\r\n     _particular person or persons_, who shall have a right, in\r\n     pursuance of this Act, to trade to the East Indies, or other parts\r\n     within the limits aforesaid, shall be allowed to trade, until\r\n     _sufficient security_ shall be first given (which the Commissioners\r\n     of the Customs in England, or any three or more of them for the\r\n     time being, are hereby authorized and required to take, in the\r\n     name and to the use of His Majesty, his heirs and successors), that\r\n     such Company, or _particular persons_, shall cause all the goods,\r\n     wares, merchandise, and commodities, which shall at any time or\r\n     times hereafter, during the continuance of this Act, be laden by or\r\n     for them, or _any of them_, or for their, or any of their accounts,\r\n     in _any ship_ or ships whatsoever, bound from the said East Indies,\r\n     or parts within the limits aforesaid, to be brought (without\r\n     breaking bulk), to _some port of England or Wales_, and _there be\r\n     unladen and put to land_, &c. And that all goods and merchandises\r\n     belonging to the Company aforesaid, or _any other traders to the\r\n     East Indies_, and which shall be _imported into England or Wales_,\r\n     as aforesaid, pursuant to this Act, shall by them be sold openly\r\n     and publicly, by inch of candle, _upon their respective accounts_,\r\n     and not otherwise.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon this Act of the 9th and 10th of William III. was built, in the\r\nfollowing year, that famous Charter of the Company, upon which they rest\r\nthe weight of their pretensions; and that very Charter, as is here\r\nrendered incontestable by the Act itself, comprehended the principle,\r\n_of an Import Trade from India to the_ OUT-PORTS _of the kingdom_.\r\n\r\nThe form and condition of the security which was to be given by the\r\nout-port merchants, will be found in the Act, 6th Anne, c. 3. entitled,\r\n\"_An Act for better securing the duties on East India goods_.\" By that\r\nAct, the security to be given was fixed \"at the rate of 2500l. sterling\r\nfor every hundred ton their ships or vessels shall be respectively let\r\nfor;\" and the _only_ restriction imposed upon the import trade from\r\nIndia was, that it should be brought \"_to some port in Great Britain_.\"\r\n\r\nThus, then, any man who looks but a little beyond the objects which lie\r\naccidentally before his eyes, may see, that the measure now suggested by\r\nGovernment, instead of being a wild and airy speculation, a theoretical\r\ninnovation, a _new_, untried, and dangerous experiment, on which we have\r\nno ground to reason from experience (as it has been ignorantly and\r\nfalsely asserted), is nothing more than reverting to an _ancient_\r\nprinciple, involved in the Company's applauded Charter of the 10th of\r\nWilliam the Third, and to the practice of our forefathers in the\r\nbrightest period of our domestic history; a period, in which the British\r\nConstitution received its last perfection, and from which the present\r\npower and greatness of the British Empire, in the East and in the West,\r\ndates its origin.\r\n\r\nHaving sufficiently proved and established this _great fact_, let us\r\nnext inquire, what history reveals to us, of _the consequences_ of that\r\nimport trade to the out-ports, that can tend, in any degree, to justify,\r\nor give support to, the Company, in determining to resort to an\r\nalternative which, they acknowledge, will subvert the system of Indian\r\nGovernment (and thereby shake the Constitution at home), rather than\r\n_renew the measure_ of a regulated trade to the out-ports.\r\n\r\nWe have not to deduce these consequences from _abstract hypothesis_, but\r\nfrom _historical testimony_; let us, then, observe what that testimony\r\nunfolds. No evil, of any kind whatever, resulted to the incorporated, or\r\nJoint Stock Company, from the privilege enjoyed by the out ports. On the\r\ncontrary, that _Joint Stock Company_, issuing out of the General Society\r\nof Merchants (which, as has been above stated, soon became the English\r\nEast India Company), rose above all their competitors, notwithstanding\r\nthe power of importing, without limitation, to _any of the ports of the\r\nkingdom_; and such was the rapidity of their progress, that they\r\novercame the former, or London Company; they obtained a surrender of all\r\ntheir rights to St. Helena, Bombay, and all their other islands and\r\nsettlements in India; they at length received that ancient Company into\r\ntheir own body; and finally became the United East India Company of the\r\npresent day. And so little did the competition and free import of the\r\ngeneral merchants tend to obstruct the growth of the United Company,\r\neven in the age of its _infancy_; and so \"superior were the advantages\r\nthey derived from trading with a joint-stock (to use the words of one of\r\nthe Company's most strenuous champions), that at the time of the union\r\nof the two Companies, out of the whole loan of two millions, only\r\n7000l. then remained the property of the _separate traders of the\r\nGeneral Society_; and this sum also was soon absorbed in the United\r\nCompany[4].\" If then the Company, starting originally with only a joint\r\nstock, against a competition in the out-ports of the kingdom, with a\r\npower to import to those out-ports, outstripped and overcame all their\r\ncompetitors; what can they seriously apprehend from a renewal of the\r\nsame experiment, in the present momentum of their power, and when they\r\nare able to unite with their joint-stock, the whole of the revenues of\r\ntheir present empire in the East?\r\n\r\nBut it may be asked, if no better success is likely to attend the\r\ncommercial speculations of the out-ports, why is so strong an effort\r\nmade, to admit them to a share in the India trade? The answer is\r\nobvious. When Mr. Dundas, in the year 1800, so forcibly expressed his\r\nopinion against any such admission, he did not ground that opinion upon\r\na question of _ports_, but of _commercial capital_. He considered the\r\ncapital of the Company as sufficient for all the advantage which the\r\nPublic, in the aggregate, could derive from the India Trade; and he\r\nmaintained, that the aggregate interest of the Public would suffer from\r\nany measure, tending \"to divert any larger proportion of the commercial\r\ncapital of the country from a more advantageous and more profitable\r\nuse.\" But the circumstances of the world are become materially altered,\r\nsince the period of 1800. The commercial capital, of which Mr. Dundas\r\nthen reasoned, is deprived of that advantageous and profitable\r\nemployment which his argument supposed, and is therefore without\r\napplication or direction; from whence it has resulted, that the\r\noperation of commerce is interrupted, and its activity suspended. The\r\nallowing that capital to be partially directed to the markets of India,\r\nwould therefore, under present circumstances, have the great national\r\nadvantage, of recovering the activity and spirit of commerce, and of\r\nencouraging an extensive public interest which is at present\r\ndisappointed, if not dormant; and, whenever a more prosperous state of\r\nthings should return, the capital so engaged for a time, would, from the\r\nnature of commerce, unquestionably recall itself, and seek again a more\r\nprofitable market, if any such should open. In the mean time, the East\r\nIndia Company, adding to their joint-stock all the revenues of India,\r\nneed hardly know, because they could not _feel_, that they had any\r\ncompetitors in the markets of India. And, as the Executive Government\r\nwas able to guard the out-ports against smuggling in the period of _the\r\ninfancy_ of the Company, they might and ought to feel a perfect\r\nconfidence, that the same authority can guard them equally now, in the\r\npresent period of _their maturity_.\r\n\r\nThus, since history renders it indisputable, that an import trade from\r\nIndia to the out-ports of the kingdom has been heretofore exercised\r\nunder Acts of Parliament, and that it may be perfectly compatible with\r\nthe highest prosperity of the East India Company; since the Executive\r\nGovernment can guard it against smuggling at the present day, as well as\r\nin the reigns of King William and Queen Anne; and since a great and\r\nurgent national interest reasonably demands it, both from Parliament and\r\nthe Company; the present moment furnishes a most fit occasion for the\r\nCompany to consider, Mr. Dundas's solemn call upon \"their wisdom,\r\npolicy, and liberality,\" made by him to them in the year 1800; and also,\r\nhis weighty admonition, that \"_if any thing can endanger their monopoly,\r\nit is_ AN UNNECESSARY ADHERENCE TO POINTS NOT ESSENTIAL TO THEIR\r\nEXISTENCE.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been called _illiberal_, to question the motives of the\r\nDirectors, in refusing their consent to an import trade to the\r\nout-ports. But, with the facts of history, which have been here\r\nproduced, staring us and them in the face, it would be impossible not to\r\nquestion those motives. No man can entertain a higher respect for the\r\nEast India Company, as a body politic and corporate, or contemplate with\r\nhigher admiration the distinguished career which it has run, than\r\nGracchus; but, at the same time, no one is better persuaded of the\r\noperation of _policy_, in a body circumstanced as they are. And it is\r\nmore especially necessary to watch that policy, and to be free to\r\ninterpret _political motives_, at the present crisis, because, at the\r\neve of the expiration of the Company's _last_ Charter, in 1793, certain\r\nrights were anxiously alleged on their behalf, in a work entitled, \"_A\r\nShort History of the East India Company_, &c.\" rights absolutely\r\nunmaintainable, and utterly incompatible with the sovereignty of the\r\nEmpire, and the freedom of the Constitution; and the allegations then\r\nmade, appear now to assume the form of _a practical assertion_. To those\r\nalleged rights, therefore, it will be advisable early to call the\r\nattention of Parliament and of the nation.\r\n\r\nGRACCHUS.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[4] A Short History of the East India Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, Jan. 27, 1813._\r\n\r\nThere is an irritability manifested at the present moment, by those who\r\nare intimately united in interest with the East India Company, which\r\nappears strongly indicative of an unhealthy case. It is well known, that\r\nthe revenues of the Company, far from being able to contribute to the\r\nrevenues of the State that augmentation which was made the condition of\r\nthe Company's present Charter, have, from causes which the Directors\r\ncould not control, been so deficient, that they have been obliged, at\r\ndifferent times, to apply to Parliament for pecuniary aid; that they are\r\nburdened with a debt of not less than forty-two millions; and that they\r\nare _now_ unable to discharge their engagements, without again coming to\r\nParliament to obtain the means. Yet, \"AN OLD PROPRIETOR\" feels no\r\nuneasiness from this state of the Company's affairs; and this, we must\r\nsuppose, proceeds from an opinion, that the dividend he now receives is\r\n_secured to him for the time to come_.\r\n\r\nBut Parliament has never, directly nor indirectly, made itself a\r\n_collateral security_ to the Proprietors, for the payment of a dividend\r\nof 10½ percent. The aids, at different times granted by Parliament,\r\nhave proceeded from a mixed principle, of _equity_ and of _liberal\r\nsupport_. Of _equity_, in so far as the embarrassments of the Company\r\nhave been occasioned by political events; of _liberal support_, in so\r\nfar as those embarrassments may have been caused by disappointment in\r\ntrade. If the Proprietors should not discriminate between these two\r\nprinciples which have actuated Parliament, but claim the whole of the\r\nsuccours afforded, upon a ground of _positive right_, they might impose\r\nupon Parliament the necessity of requiring the East India Company to\r\nbring their affairs to a final settlement; in order that it may be\r\naccurately determined, how far the Public are equitably pledged to the\r\nProprietors, and how far the Proprietors must be left to settle their\r\nown accounts with the Company alone. And it is possible, that the result\r\nmight not afford that confidence of a well-secured dividend of ten and a\r\nhalf per cent., which an OLD PROPRIETOR considers it an attack upon\r\nprivate property even to question.\r\n\r\nSuch an issue, however, does not appear to be very likely to occur,\r\nunless the Managers of the East India Company's concerns, from any\r\nill-advised determination in their counsels, should take some steps, by\r\nwhich their affairs should be abruptly brought to a settlement: in which\r\nevent, any disappointment or loss sustained by the Proprietors will be\r\nchargeable upon those Managers, who thus desert their duty to their\r\nConstituents; and not on the Public, or the Government. The Managers of\r\nthe East India Company, having so clear and responsible a duty binding\r\nupon them, ought to be most scrupulous of failing in that duty, through\r\nany capricious or speculative \"_adherence to points not essential to\r\ntheir existence_;\" for, if they should sacrifice the interest of the\r\nProprietors by now attempting to convert their _temporary grants_ into a\r\n_perpetual right_; although the disappointed Proprietors may arraign the\r\nPublic, yet the Public at large will, with justice, impeach the Managers\r\nof the East India Company.\r\n\r\nIn order to open the eyes of the Proprietors to the simple fact of their\r\nactual position, their attention was called by Gracchus, on the 13th\r\ninst. to the consideration, whether the Company, loaded with a debt of\r\n42,000,000l. and being unable to discharge the sum of four millions\r\nbecoming due, could reasonably expect, that if Parliament should now\r\ncome to their immediate relief, it would engage itself, _in all future\r\ntime_, for the payment of a dividend of ten and a half per cent.;\r\nespecially, if, upon any contingent winding up of the Company's affairs,\r\ncalled for by their own pertinacity, their remaining resources should be\r\nfound inadequate to secure that dividend to the Proprietors? And the\r\npossible case was suggested, of some guardian of the public purse\r\ndeeming it equitable, that in the event of Parliament being disposed to\r\ncome to the relief of the Proprietors, under such circumstances, the\r\nlatter should be called upon, on their part, to submit to some condition\r\nof accommodation.\r\n\r\n\"An OLD PROPRIETOR\" discovers in this argument of caution, only _a\r\ndirect menace_ from the Executive Government to the purses of the\r\nProprietors;--a plain and intelligible _threat_, that payment of their\r\njust claims shall be withheld; and he \"thanks God, that he lives in a\r\ncountry, where such language will be treated with merited scorn.\" This\r\nOLD PROPRIETOR should have known, that Government has never declined to\r\nsettle any accounts with the East India Company, which had been properly\r\nauthenticated: under present circumstances, it is not to be expected,\r\nthat Government should incur the responsibility of applying the public\r\nmoney to discharge claims which have not been sufficiently investigated.\r\nSo far, however, is Government from having evinced any disposition to\r\nthrow unnecessary difficulties in the way of the Company's pecuniary\r\narrangements, that, in the midst of the present contest with the\r\nDirectors, it has granted to the Company a suspension of the payment of\r\nbetween 8 and 900,000l. of tea duties, which the Company had actually\r\nreceived from the buyers of the tea. It is perhaps not generally known,\r\nthat the Company formerly paid the duties upon tea upon its being\r\nimported and landed; by which means the amount of duties was immediately\r\ndrawn into the Exchequer. To accommodate the Company, a change of\r\npractice was allowed by Government, and the Company have been permitted\r\nto sell their teas, in the first instance, without the interference of\r\nthe Officers of the Customs, upon condition of the Company afterwards\r\nremitting the gross amount of duties to the Board of Revenue. Thus they\r\nactually make their own profits upon the tea, and receive into their own\r\nhands the Government duties, before they are called upon to pay them.\r\nThe duties actually so received by the Company, amount to the sum above\r\nstated; and the _Old Proprietor_ will probably deem it no slight proof\r\nof a wish on the part of Government to render an accommodation to the\r\nCompany, that, during the pending discussion, it has made arrangements\r\nfor allowing the Company an extended period, for transferring the very\r\nconsiderable sum of which they have actually received the beneficial\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nIt should be always remembered, by the Company, and by the Public, as\r\nparties in a great compact, that the privilege of an exclusive trade to\r\nIndia and China has never been granted to the Company without reserve;\r\nor, as if their possession of that exclusive benefit was, _in itself_,\r\nthe most advantageous arrangement for the public interest. The grant has\r\nalways proceeded upon a principle, of bargain and covenant; and on the\r\nconsideration of a pecuniary, advance, to be made by the Company to the\r\nPublic, as the condition for the renewal of _the lease of the public\r\nrights in the India trade_. Upon this principle alone, has the exclusive\r\ntrade ever been conceded to the East India Company; either under its\r\npresent form, or under any of its former denominations.\r\n\r\nTo shorten the discussion, however, let the Proprietors and the Company\r\ntake the following compressed view, of the probable consequences which\r\nwould severally result, from a _compliance with_, or _rejection of_, the\r\nproposition made by Government, as the basis of a new Charter; and let\r\nthem consider, in _which of the two_ they foresee the greatest security\r\nfor their own future interests.\r\n\r\nIf, upon maturely weighing the case before them, the Company should\r\naccede to the proposition of Government; and if an arrangement, founded\r\nupon that proposition, should receive the sanction of Parliament;\r\n\r\n1. The Company will preserve _the entire China trade_; and this\r\nprincipal sphere of their commercial profit, will remain undisturbed.\r\n\r\n2. They will possess advantages for continuing to carry on the India\r\ntrade, so far superior to those of all private competitors, from _their\r\nterritorial and commercial revenues_, that, with a moderate exertion of\r\ntheir activity, they may preserve almost the whole of that trade.\r\n\r\n3. They will possess _the regulation and control of the India trade_, so\r\nfar as depends upon the Indian Governments; and as those Governments\r\nwill continue in the exercise of the executive power, all the private\r\nMerchants, who may repair to the ports and harbours within the extensive\r\nlimits of their jurisdiction, will of course _be subject to the\r\nauthority of their Government_.\r\n\r\n4. They will retain the whole patronage and expenditure of a revenue of\r\nupwards of _Fifteen Millions_ sterling per annum in India, together with\r\nvery extensive establishments at home, depending upon that revenue.\r\n\r\n5. The accounts between the Public and the Company, being brought to no\r\nsudden and violent crisis of settlement, may be amicably and leisurely\r\nadjusted, with a view to mutual convenience.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, should the Company incautiously drop the _substance_\r\nto pursue the _shadow_, and refuse the proposition of Government; and\r\nshould Parliament, upon a full and deliberate consideration of the\r\nactual circumstances of the Company, deem it more advisable to bring\r\ntheir accounts with the Public to a thorough investigation and final\r\nsettlement, than to admit the Company's new pretensions to _a perpetual\r\nmonopoly_;\r\n\r\n1. The Company will lose as much of the China trade as may fall into the\r\nhands of the private merchants, who _think_ they shall be able to sell\r\ntea 85 per cent. cheaper than the Company.\r\n\r\n2. They will lose the control of the India commerce, _and will carry on\r\ntheir traffic in India as subjects_, in common with the private British\r\nmerchants.\r\n\r\n3. By that loss, voluntarily incurred, they may throw the greatest part\r\nof the trade into the hands of the private traders.\r\n\r\n4. They will _lose the patronage of India, and the establishments\r\ndepending upon it_; which they will thus compel Parliament, contrary to\r\nthe disposition of Government, to place under different arrangements.\r\n\r\n5. The accounts between the Public and the Company must be referred for\r\ninvestigation to Commissioners of Inquiry, to be finally settled and\r\nadjusted.\r\n\r\nIt is now for the Proprietors, after well considering these two\r\nalternatives, to determine, under _which of the two_ their dividend will\r\nbe _most secure_.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Constitutional objections against taking the Government\r\nof India out of the hands of the Company (upon which objection their\r\nconfidence in their present pretensions chiefly reposes), it is\r\ndifficult to conceive that the wisdom of Parliament, after the\r\nexperience of so many years, is unequal to the task of devising a system\r\nas good as that of the Company, without incurring the evil which those\r\nConstitutional objections suppose. The Company's Government, it must be\r\nrecollected, has been a production of chance, and has grown by the\r\nprogress of accidental events. It has, indeed, answered far better in\r\npractice than could have been expected, if we consider its origin; and\r\ntherefore, it is not desirable that it should be materially altered;\r\nneither is it likely that any such alteration of the system should be\r\ncontemplated, unless the indiscretion of the Company should impose upon\r\nParliament the necessity of resorting to that measure. But it certainly\r\ndoes not seem to be a measure insuperably difficult, to preserve\r\nwhatever is really good in the present system, and even to remedy some\r\nof its defects, without departing from the path of experience, and\r\nresorting to improvements of theory and experiment.\r\n\r\nThere is one point of view, however, in which such a system would\r\nacquire an evident advantage over that which has hitherto obtained: viz.\r\nthat it would, in every Session, be liable to the revision of\r\nParliament, and to the immediate correction of every error which might\r\nbe observed, and to such further continual improvements as experience\r\nmight direct; _not being embarrassed by the compact of a Charter_.\r\n\r\nGRACCHUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, February 17, 1813._\r\n\r\nIt is very observable, that the objections which have been made by the\r\nEast India Company to the admission of ships, returning from India, to\r\nimport and dispose of their cargoes at any other place than the Port of\r\nLondon, are not founded so much upon any statement of the injury which\r\nthe trade of the Company would sustain by admitting them, as upon a\r\nprovident regard for the adventurers themselves, and a caution held out\r\nto them not to entertain an expectation of benefiting by any commercial\r\nspeculation in India; since the long experience of the Company has\r\nenabled them to show, that it must be ultimately ruinous to the\r\nspeculator. The sum of the experience, alleged by those who have come\r\nforward to defend this point, is, \"_That it is not practicable to extend\r\nthe consumption of European manufactures generally in India_;\" and the\r\nfacts which they have asserted in support of this experimental argument,\r\nand upon which they rest its strength, are these four following:\r\n\r\n1. That the natives of India entertain a strong characteristic aversion,\r\nto engage in commercial transactions with foreigners.\r\n\r\n2. That their religious prejudices, customs, habits, and tastes, render\r\nit impossible that they should ever become consumers of our\r\nmanufactures, to any extent.\r\n\r\n3. That their poverty opposes an insuperable bar to such consumption.\r\n\r\n4. That these facts and their consequences are demonstrated in the\r\nexamples of the Portuguese and the Dutch, who were not able to carry\r\ntheir export commerce with India to any considerable extent.\r\n\r\nLet us take these several propositions in their order; and examine, how\r\nfar they possess that force of truth, which the Company has supposed to\r\nbelong to them.\r\n\r\n1. In the infancy of the European intercourse with India, the sole\r\nobject of those who engaged in its commerce was, to procure the produce\r\nand commodities of the East. In this pursuit, so far were the natives\r\nfrom opposing any obstacles to their endeavours, that they were found\r\ndisposed to afford every facility to a traffic, which brought them\r\n_specie_ in exchange for their manufactures, and for the productions of\r\ntheir soil. This fact, which is established by every writer who treated\r\nupon the subject of the India commerce during that period, would of\r\nitself constitute a complete answer to those who advance the\r\nproposition, that the natives of India are averse, through an\r\nestablished prejudice, to engage in commercial transactions with\r\nforeigners.\r\n\r\nWhen the ingenuity of the French and German artists enabled the\r\nspeculators in this traffic to introduce _works of fancy_, we learn from\r\nTavernier, who made six several journeys, between the years 1645 and\r\n1670, from France to India, by various routes, that the Rajahs of\r\nHindostan and of the Deccan, as well as the Mahomedan princes of those\r\ncountries, admitted him into their states; that the articles of\r\nmanufacture which he introduced were received and purchased with an\r\navidity which encouraged him to continue, for so many years, the pursuit\r\nof that commerce; that he found the natives of India, spread over the\r\nwhole range of country from the Indus to the Caspian Sea, engaged in the\r\nactive prosecution of foreign traffic; and that the number of _Banyans_\r\n(the chief commercial cast of Hindoos) at that time established at\r\nIspahan, were not less than ten thousand. Forster, who, in a more recent\r\nperiod, followed Tavernier in one of the routes which he had traversed,\r\ninforms us, that, in the year 1783, he found Banyans established at\r\nAstrachan, within the Russian empire. And we further learn from Bruce,\r\nthat the principal agents of commerce at Mocha and Jedda, in the Red\r\nSea, were Banyans; and that they had even extended themselves into\r\nAbyssinia. No stronger evidence, therefore, can be required to make it\r\nmanifest, that foreign as well as internal trade has been in all ages,\r\nand still continues to be at the present day, a common practice, and a\r\nfavourite pursuit of the Hindoos.\r\n\r\n2. With regard to the restrictive operation of the religious prejudices\r\nand customs of the Hindoos, against the adoption of foreign articles of\r\nmanufacture; Mr. Colebrooke, lately a Member of the Supreme Council, and\r\nan eminent Oriental scholar, has furnished us with information upon this\r\nsubject, equally important and decisive. In an unpublished work, on the\r\nAgriculture and Commerce of Bengal, cited in _The Edinburgh Review_, for\r\nNovember 1812, that gentleman observes, that, according to the\r\nsentiments of the Hindoos, \"All things come _undefiled_ from _the\r\nshop_;\" or, in the words of Menu, \"The hands of an artist employed in\r\nhis art are always pure; and so is every vendible commodity when exposed\r\nto sale: that woollens are purified by a single exposure to air, while\r\nwater is necessary to purify other clothes.\" Proceeding with these\r\nprinciples, he further informs us, \"That the rainy season and winter of\r\nIndia afford real occasion for the use of woollens; that the fabrics of\r\nEurope are always preferred; and, if the articles were adapted in the\r\nmanufacture to the Indian use, and the price reduced, the consumption\r\nwould descend from the middle even to the more numerous classes. That\r\nthe natives of India do not want a taste for porcelaine, and other\r\nelegant wares; that they require vast quantities of metallic vessels,\r\nand of hardware; that, considering the greatness of the population, and\r\nthe disposition of the natives to use European manufactures, it cannot\r\nbe doubted, that a great vend might be found, and that the demand will\r\nincrease with the restoration of wealth.\"\r\n\r\nThe authority of Mr. Colebrooke on this subject would be conclusive,\r\neven if it stood alone: but it may be supported by a reference to the\r\nopinion of many persons, who have been resident in the great cities of\r\nIndia. Those persons would be found to testify, that at Delhi, at\r\nLucknow, at Hydrabad, Mysore, and Tanjore, in all the capitals, whether\r\nHindoo or Mahomedan, a taste prevails amongst the natives for a variety\r\nof articles of European manufacture. The late Nabob of Oude, was known\r\nto have affected the European dress; as may be seen by the costume of\r\nhis picture, in the possession of the Marquis Wellesley.\r\n\r\nA large assortment of cut glass lustres has been provided by order, for\r\nthe Soubahdar of the Deccan; and a person is now proceeding to India,\r\nwith the license of the Company, for the express purpose of arranging\r\nthem, when they shall have reached his palace of Hydrabad.\r\n\r\nThe Rajah of Mysore (and, in the same manner, many of the Serdars of\r\nthat state), is frequently clothed in scarlet cloth; his servants are\r\ngenerally dressed in woollen of that colour; and he often travels in an\r\nEnglish carriage, driven by postillions, who are habited in the English\r\ncostume. The Rajah of Tanjore exhibits in his palace a colossal marble\r\nstatue of himself, wrought by the hand of Flaxman; and the monument of\r\nhis revered Mentor, the late celebrated missionary Swartz, sculptured by\r\nthe same eminent artist, was executed and sent to Tanjore, at the\r\nexpress and urgent desire of that enlightened Prince.\r\n\r\nWe must further observe, that so far are the religious and civil habits\r\nof the Hindoos from obstructing the intercourse of trade, that their\r\npolicy has connected trade with religion; and the great festivals of\r\ntheir worship, are at the same time the appointed periods and scenes of\r\ntheir most active commerce. Jaggernaut, Ramisseram, Tripetty, are the\r\nmost celebrated places of Hindoo devotion within the British dominions;\r\nand every one who has resided in India must know, that _fairs_ are held\r\nat those places at the periods, when the greatest concourse of pilgrims\r\nis drawn to them by the celebration of their religious rites and\r\nceremonies. In further illustration of the disposition of the natives to\r\ntraffic, in every way by which profit can be derived, the following fact\r\nmay be stated; which can be attested by every officer who served with\r\nthe army under Sir Arthur Wellesley (now Marquis of Wellington), against\r\nthe Mahrattas, in 1803. The distant and severe service in which that\r\narmy had been engaged, had exhausted the store of European necessaries\r\nwith which it had advanced against the enemy; and the officers arrived\r\nat Poonah, almost destitute of those comforts and accommodations. But\r\nthey found the native merchants of that capital provided with the most\r\nessential of those several articles, and they were soon supplied,\r\nthrough the agency of those merchants, with every thing for which they\r\nhad occasion. Poonah is the capital of a Brahmin government; and,\r\ntherefore, this single fact would serve to furnish a complete answer to\r\nevery thing that has been asserted, against the practicability of\r\nintroducing and extending the manufactures of Europe into every part of\r\nHindostan.\r\n\r\n3. That the poverty of a large majority of the native subjects of our\r\nIndian Empire is such, as to disable them from acquiring our\r\nmanufactures, is certainly true; but it is no less true, that a very\r\nconsiderable portion of that population possess the means of indulging\r\nin every article of convenience and luxury, both native and European. It\r\nhas been very generally stated, that there are only _two_ classes of\r\npeople in India, the very rich and the very poor. But a minute\r\ninvestigation into the society of India, would discover the error of\r\nthis statement, and would show, that there exists a third and _middle_\r\nclass, far removed from the condition of either of the others; greatly\r\nexceeding in number the former of these, and falling far short of the\r\nlatter. This class, as they certainly possess the means, would, if\r\nproper steps were taken, materially contribute to the demand and\r\nconsumption of many of our home manufactures.\r\n\r\n4. With respect to the evidence, attempted to be drawn from the ill\r\nsuccess of the Portuguese and Dutch traders, we are to observe, that the\r\nsituation of the Portuguese and the Dutch, during the period when they\r\nwere in possession of the European trade with India, was so exceedingly\r\ndifferent from that of the British nation at the present moment, that it\r\nis scarcely possible to draw a sound comparison between them. The native\r\nGovernments were at that time powerful; and the establishments of the\r\nPortuguese, and afterwards of the Dutch, extended but a short distance\r\nfrom the sea-coast; the manufactures of Europe were, in a manner, in\r\ntheir infancy; and neither Portugal nor Holland were manufacturing\r\ncountries. Whereas, the British empire is now established over the\r\nrichest and most populous regions of India, and its influence is\r\nextended even further than its dominion; the manufactures of the United\r\nKingdom have attained a degree of perfection, which never has been\r\nequalled; they can be fashioned to the tastes, the wants, and the\r\ncaprices of every nation and climate; and certainly, the interests of\r\nthe country call for the cultivation of every channel, which can be\r\nopened for the enlargement of our commerce.\r\n\r\nWe cannot better conclude these observations, than by applying the\r\ncircumstantial evidence which they afford, to Mr. Dundas's letter of the\r\n2d April 1800; in which that Minister admitted the fact, of a\r\n_progressively increasing_ consumption; but, at the same time,\r\nconceived, that the _customs of the natives_ would prescribe _limits_ to\r\nits extension. \"I do not mean to say,\" says he, \"that the exports from\r\nthis country to India have not been _very considerably increased of late\r\nyears_; and I make no doubt that, from recent circumstances, _they may\r\nbe still considerably increased_. But the prospect, _from the causes I\r\nhave already referred to_, must always be a limited one.\" What these\r\ncauses are he thus explains:--\"The export trade to India can never be\r\nextended to any degree, proportionate to the wealth and population of\r\nthe Indian Empire; neither can the returns upon it be very profitable to\r\nindividuals. Those who attend to _the manners_, _the manufactures_,\r\n_the food_, _the raiment_, _the moral and religious prejudices of that\r\ncountry_, can be at no loss to trace _the causes_ why this proposition\r\nmust be _a true one_.\"\r\n\r\nThe evidence which has been produced demonstrates, that neither the\r\nmanners, raiments, nor prejudices of Hindostan, are of a nature to\r\nimpede the introduction of articles of European manufacture; and it thus\r\nproves, that _the causes_ assigned for the limitation of our export\r\ntrade, are not calculated to impose any such limitation. What, then, it\r\nmay be asked, are the causes, why the consumption of the manufactures of\r\nEurope in India has in no degree kept pace with the extension of our\r\nterritories, and of their population? The examination of this branch of\r\nour subject would carry us to too great a length on the present\r\noccasion, and will therefore best be reserved for a separate\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nGRACCHUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Saturday, March 20, 1813._\r\n\r\nIn searching for the _causes_, which have prevented an extensive\r\nintroduction of the British manufactures into the countries subject to\r\nthe dominion or influence of the British Crown in India, it naturally\r\noccurs; that no measure appears ever to have been concerted, for the\r\ngeneral purpose of alluring the attention of the natives of India to the\r\narticles of European importation. This neglect, has evidently arisen\r\nfrom the opinions which have been so erroneously entertained, concerning\r\nthe civil and religious prejudices of the Hindoos.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of Mr. Colebrooke has been adduced, to prove that those\r\nopinions are wholly unfounded; the following extracts from the Travels\r\nof Forster, in the years 1782-3, will further evince, that the Hindoos,\r\nfar from entertaining any indisposition to engage in commercial dealings\r\nwith strangers, have widely extended themselves in different foreign\r\ncountries for that express purpose.\r\n\r\nHERAT.--\"At Herat, I found in two Karavanseras about one hundred Hindoo\r\nmerchants, who, by the maintenance of a brisk commerce, and by\r\nextending a long chain of credit, have become valuable subjects to the\r\nGovernment. When the Hindoos cross the Attock, they usually put on the\r\ndress of a northern Asiatic, being seldom seen without a long cloth\r\ncoat, and a high cap[5].\"\r\n\r\nTURSHISH.--\"About one hundred Hindoo families, from Moultan and\r\nJessilmere, are established in this town, which is the extreme limit of\r\ntheir emigration on this side of Persia. They occupy a quarter in which\r\nno Mahomedan is permitted to reside; and I was not a little surprised to\r\nsee those of the Bramin sect distinguished by the appellation of\r\n_Peerzadah_, a title which the Mahomedans usually bestow on the\r\ndescendants of their Prophet. Small companies of Hindoos are also\r\nsettled at Meschid, Yezd, Kachin, Casbin, and some parts of the Caspian\r\nshore; and more extensive societies are established in the different\r\nparts of the Persian Gulf, where they maintain a navigable commerce with\r\nthe western coast of India[6].\"\r\n\r\nBAKU.--\"A society of Moultan Hindoos, which has long been established at\r\nBaku, contributes largely to the circulation of its commerce; and, with\r\nthe Armenians, they may be accounted the principal merchants of\r\nShirwan. The Hindoos of this quarter usually embark at Tatta, a large\r\ninsular town in the lower tract of the Indus; whence they proceed to\r\nBassorah, and thence accompany the caravans, which are frequently\r\npassing into Persia: some also travel inland to the Caspian Sea, by the\r\nroad of Candahar and Herat. I must here mention, that we brought from\r\nBaku five Hindoos; two of them were merchants of Moultan, and three were\r\nmendicants, a father, his son, and a Sunyassee (the name of a religious\r\nsect of Hindoos, chiefly of the Brahmin tribe). The Hindoos had supplied\r\nthe little wants of the latter, and recommended him _to their agents in\r\nRussia_, whence, he said, he should like to proceed with me to England.\r\nThe Moultanee Hindoos were going to Astrachan, merely on a commercial\r\nadventure[7].\"\r\n\r\nASTRACHAN.--\"The Hindoos also enjoy at Astrachan every fair indulgence.\r\nThey are not stationary residents, nor do they keep any of their females\r\nin this city; but, after accumulating a certain property, they return to\r\nIndia, and are succeeded by other adventurers. Being a mercantile sect\r\nof their nation, and occupied in a desultory species of traffic, they\r\nhave neglected to preserve any record of their first settlement, and\r\nsubsequent progress, in this quarter of Russia; nor is the fact\r\nascertained, with any accuracy, by the natives of Astrachan[8].\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus seen, that the natives of India are in no respect averse to\r\nengage in commercial dealings with strangers, and that no prejudices\r\nexist among them of a nature to prevent them from using our\r\nmanufactures; we cannot but be forcibly struck with the reflection, that\r\nno systematic plan has ever been adopted by the East India Company, to\r\nattract the attention of the Hindoos to the various articles of our home\r\nmanufacture, or to stimulate their speculation in the traffic of them.\r\nWhereas, in Europe, the Company have always found it necessary, for the\r\ndisposal of their Indian Imports, to take active measures for drawing\r\nthe attention of the nations of the European Continent to their sales in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nThe Directors, in their letter to Lord Buckinghamshire, under date of\r\nthe 15th of April, 1812, (adverting to their sales in Europe,) observe,\r\n\"That the Foreign Buyers repose confidence in the regularity and\r\npublicity with which the Company's sales are conducted; that the\r\nparticulars of their cargoes are published immediately on the arrival\r\nof the ships, and distributed all over the Continent. That notices of\r\nthe quantities to be sold, and periods of sale, are also published for\r\ngeneral distribution; and that the sales of each description of goods\r\nare made at stated periods, twice in the year.\"\r\n\r\n_No measure of this nature has ever been projected for India_; and yet,\r\nthe predilection of the natives of India, both Hindoo and Mahomedan, for\r\npublic shows, scenes of general resort, and exhibitions of every kind,\r\nis so well known, that we may confidently affirm, that nothing could\r\nhave a surer tendency to draw them together, than a display, at\r\nperiodical fairs, of our various manufactures. Fairs of this kind, for\r\nthe sale of their home manufactures, have been held from time\r\nimmemorial, in every part of India. The Company, therefore, needed only\r\nto engraft, upon an established usage of the Hindoos, a regular plan of\r\nperiodical fairs; and, by thus adopting in India a course analogous to\r\nthat which they have found it necessary to employ in Europe, they might\r\ngenerally have arrived at giving to Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay,\r\nattractions of curiosity and mercantile interest, which would most\r\nprobably have drawn to those settlements the wealthy natives from every\r\npart of the East; and have rendered the capital cities of British India,\r\nwhat Amsterdam, Frankfort, and Leipsic have long been in Europe, the\r\nresorts of all descriptions of people, and the repositories of every\r\nEuropean article of use and luxury. From these different centres of\r\ncommerce, the markets of the interior of India, and especially those\r\nheld at the scenes of religious assembly, might be furnished with\r\nsupplies; and, under the fostering encouragement of a wise and provident\r\nGovernment, the intelligence and enterprise of the natives of India\r\nmight be called into action, and be stimulated, by a powerful motive, to\r\nexert in their own country those commercial talents that have obtained\r\nfor them the encouragements, which, upon the unimpeachable testimony of\r\nMr. Forster, they have long received in Persia, and in parts of Russia.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of collecting together, at stated periods and in\r\nestablished points, the productions of human industry and ingenuity, has\r\nbeen so universally felt by all nations; that there is scarcely a\r\ncountry, advanced to any degree of civilization, in which the practice\r\nhas not prevailed. To effect this object, with a view to the extension\r\nof our export trade in India, _active encouragement_ is alone requisite;\r\nbut, in order to give it stability, _native agency_ must be called forth\r\ninto action. The supplies which (as was mentioned on a former occasion)\r\nwere found at Poonah, were obtained from that source alone. The Parsee\r\nmerchants at Bombay, are the principal agents of the Commanders and\r\nOfficers of the Company's ships; such parts of their investments as are\r\nnot disposed of among the European population, are purchased, and\r\ncirculated in the interior, by the Parsees. The small supplies of\r\nEuropean manufactures which find their way into the principal cities of\r\nthe Deccan, proceed from this source: but there is reason to believe,\r\nthat the articles which arrive at those places are too frequently of an\r\ninferior sort, or such as have sustained damage in the transit from\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nTo give perfection to the great object here sketched out, it will be\r\nindispensably necessary that the local authorities in India should\r\ndirect their most serious attention to this subject. As _our Indian\r\nempire is our only security for our Indian trade_, so our Indian trade\r\nmust be rendered an object of vigilant concern to those who administer\r\nthe Government of that empire. From the multiplicity and importance of\r\ntheir other avocations, that trade has not hitherto received all the\r\nconsideration to which its high value is entitled; but, whenever an\r\nadequate regard shall be paid to it, it will become a duty of the\r\nGovernments to take active and effectual steps, for _drawing the\r\nattention of the natives to our exported commodities_, and for\r\n_promoting the dispersion of those commodities_, within the sphere of\r\ntheir influence or power.\r\n\r\nWe now discern _one operative cause_ of the comparatively small demand\r\nfor, and consumption of, our European articles, in the Indian empire; a\r\ncause, however, which it is within our capacity to control, or to\r\nremove. And, after what has been summarily exposed, in this and in the\r\npreceding communication, it can be no difficult point to determine,\r\nwhether _this cause_, or the alleged _prejudices of the Hindoos_, have\r\nmost contributed to limit the extent of our Export Trade to India.\r\n\r\nGRACCHUS.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] Forster's Travels, p. 135-6.\r\n\r\n[6] P. 166.\r\n\r\n[7] Forster's Travels, p. 228.\r\n\r\n[8] Forster's Travels, p. 259.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHTS AND PRETENSIONS OF THE EAST INDIA COMPANY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Monday, March 8, 1813._\r\n\r\nIt is now become a matter of the most solemn importance, that the public\r\nattention should be called to a clear and deliberate survey of THE\r\nRIGHTS and PRETENSIONS of the East India Company; and that the judgment\r\nof Parliament should be directed to, and its sense declared upon, the\r\nsubject of those pretensions, which have generated A NEW CONSTITUTIONAL\r\nQUESTION, and are now carried to an height to affect the supreme\r\nSovereignty of the State. To discuss those Rights and Pretensions at\r\nlarge, would demand a far more extended space than the present occasion\r\ncan supply; but it would be altogether unnecessary to enter into a more\r\nenlarged discussion; because, in order to obtain the end here proposed,\r\nof drawing and fixing the attention of Parliament and the Public upon\r\nthe subject, little more is required, than to bring those several Rights\r\nand Pretensions into one compressed and distinct point of view; and to\r\nleave it to the legislative wisdom to determine finally upon their\r\nvalidity.\r\n\r\nThe rights of the East India Company, are usually distinguished into\r\ntheir _temporary_ rights, and their _perpetual_ or _permanent_ rights.\r\n\r\nI. The temporary rights of the Company are:\r\n\r\n1. _A right to the exclusive trade with all the countries lying eastward\r\nfrom the Cape of Good Hope to the Straits of Magellan._ This right is _a\r\nlease_ of all the _public right_ to the trade of those parts of the\r\nworld; which lease has been renewed to the Company, from time to time,\r\nin consideration of a varying premium to be paid by them to the Public.\r\n\r\n2. _A right to administer the government and revenue of all the\r\nterritories in India acquired by them during their term in the\r\nexclusive trade._ This is a right delegated from the Crown, with the\r\nassent of Parliament; and which can be possessed by the Company no\r\nlonger, than the authority from which it emanates has, or shall\r\nprescribe.\r\n\r\nUpon the expiration of these temporary rights, which determine, as the\r\nlaw at present stands, in the ensuing year, 1814, the East India Company\r\nwill remain in possession of whatever _permanent_ rights shall be found\r\nto pertain to them.\r\n\r\nII. The _perpetual_, or more properly, the _permanent_ rights of the\r\nCompany, must be considered under two distinct heads, viz. _admitted_\r\nand _alleged_.\r\n\r\n§ 1. The _admitted_ permanent rights are,\r\n\r\n1. _To be a Body Politic and Corporate, with perpetual\r\nsuccession._--This right has been confirmed by various succeeding\r\nCharters and Statutes. But there are some observations, which it is\r\nimportant to make upon this subject. The first Charter, granted by Queen\r\nElizabeth, in 1601, to the first or London East India Company, created\r\n_both its corporate capacity and its exclusive privilege, to continue\r\nfor a term of fifteen years_; but it provided, that, in case it should\r\nnot prove beneficial to the Public, the _whole of the grant_ might at\r\nany time be determined, upon two years notice given to the Company. The\r\nsucceeding Charters of James I. Charles II. James II. and William and\r\nMary, conferred, in the same manner, both the corporate capacity and the\r\nexclusive privilege; and though they did not, like the former, fix a\r\nterm for their duration, yet they rendered the _whole grant_\r\ndeterminable upon three years notice. No provision is introduced into\r\nany of these Charters, to make the corporate capacity outlast the\r\nexclusive trade. When the principle of \"_a more national, general and\r\nextensive trade to India_,\" declared in the Charter of the 5th of\r\nWilliam and Mary, had been followed by the measure of creating a General\r\nSociety of Merchants, and of erecting _a New Company_, the advocates for\r\nthat measure took particular care to show, \"That the Old Company, in\r\nreciting their Charters, had _forgot_ to mention the _provisos_ therein,\r\nviz. that the respective Kings of England, who granted them, reserved a\r\ndiscretionary power to _make them void_ on three years warning[9].\" This\r\nobservation did not apply to their exclusive privilege only, but\r\nextended equally to their corporate capacity; both being determinable by\r\nthe same warning, because both were derived from the same grant, the\r\nwhole of which grant was made liable to that determination,\r\nnotwithstanding their corporate capacity was to enjoy \"_perpetual\r\nsuccession_.\" Hence it is manifest, that the perpetuity conferred by the\r\nCharter was not perpetuity of exclusive trade, or political power, but\r\nof _corporate succession_. But perpetual succession in a body corporate,\r\ndoes not imply perpetuity of duration, but merely _uninterrupted_\r\nsuccession of the individuals who compose it; which every corporate body\r\nmust possess, whatever may be the term of its duration, in order that it\r\nmay become, and may be able to perform the acts of, _a legal person_.\r\n\r\nThe Statute of 9 and 10, and the Charter of 10 William III. which\r\ncreated _both the corporate capacity and the exclusive privilege_ of the\r\n_New_, or English Company, followed the example of the former Charter,\r\ngranted to the _Old_ Company, and rendered the _whole grant_\r\ndeterminable by the same process. But, in the 10th year of Queen Anne,\r\nafter the two Companies had become _United_, they represented the great\r\nhazard they should encounter, by engaging in any considerable expenses\r\nfor securing _the Pepper Trade_, under the limitation of that clause; in\r\nconsequence of which representation the clause was repealed, and the\r\nlimitation was _left open_. The Company from thence inferred, that they\r\nhad acquired a perpetuity of duration, both for their corporate capacity\r\nand their exclusive privilege; the continuance of _both_ of which had\r\never been subjected to the same rule of determination. They soon,\r\nhowever, became sensible that such could not be the true intention of\r\nthe Act, and they \"submitted themselves to Parliament[10]\" on the\r\nsubject; in consequence of which a limited term of exclusive trade was\r\nassigned them, without any limitation being imposed upon the _negative_\r\nperpetuity of duration, which they had acquired for their Corporation by\r\nthe repeal of the determining clause. But it was not till the year 1730,\r\nthe third year of the late King, that the Company obtained a true and\r\n_positive_ perpetuity of duration for their Body Corporate; at which\r\ntime an Act was passed, empowering them to continue to trade to the East\r\nIndies, as a Company of Merchants, although their exclusive right to the\r\ntrade, and their power of administering the government and revenues of\r\nIndia, should be determined by Parliament. From that time only, the\r\nIncorporation and the Exclusive Privilege become distinguished. The\r\ndistinctions here made will be found of material importance, in another\r\npart of this statement.\r\n\r\n2. _A right to acquire and possess lands, tenements, and property of\r\nevery kind; and to dispose of the same, under a Common Seal._--This\r\nright was conferred by the Charter of the 10th of King William; but by\r\nStat. 3 G. 2. c. 14. § 14. the Company's estates _in Great Britain_ were\r\nlimited to the value of 10,000l. per annum. In virtue of this right, the\r\nEast India Company were empowered to settle \"_factories and\r\nplantations_,\" within the limits of their exclusive trade. The Charter\r\nof William, indeed, adds also \"_forts_,\" with the power of \"_ruling,\r\nordering, and governing them_;\" but that this privilege cannot attach\r\nupon their corporate and _permanent_ capacity, will presently be made to\r\nappear. Fortresses and fortifications cannot, from their nature and use,\r\nbecome absolute private property; being part of the public defences of\r\nthe Empire, they are (to speak with Lord Hale) \"_affected with a public\r\ninterest_, and therefore _cease to be juris privati only_[11].\" The\r\nbuilding a fort is an act done, in its nature, by virtue of a sovereign\r\nauthority, and is therefore the dereliction of the private right of\r\nproperty for a public and general purpose. In asserting for the Company\r\na _private_ right to forts and fortifications, the Company's advocates\r\nhave therefore fallen into an extreme error, from not discriminating\r\nbetween the rights which necessarily belong to their _delegated\r\nsovereignty_, and those which can alone be annexed to their _commercial\r\ncorporation_. And this brings us to the consideration of\r\n\r\n§ 2. The _alleged_ permanent rights of the Company, which require to be\r\nconsidered under _two_ descriptions, viz. rights _alleged for them_ at\r\nthe expiration of their last exclusive Charter, and rights _alleged by\r\nthem_ at the present moment, with a view to the renewal of their present\r\nCharter. _These_ are the rights, or more properly the pretensions, which\r\nhave been pronounced by GRACCHUS, \"absolutely unmaintainable, and\r\nincompatible with the freedom of British subjects;\" and not their true\r\nlegitimate rights, as the writer of a letter under the signature of\r\nPROBUS has chosen to assume.\r\n\r\nThe rights _alleged for them_ were these:--\r\n\r\n1. _A right to possess in perpetuity certain extensive territories and\r\nseaports in India, after their right to the exclusive trade with those\r\nplaces shall cease._ In consequence of different ancient Charters,\r\ngranting to the Company an exclusive trade, together with certain powers\r\nof Government, they have acquired, and actually possess, various\r\nislands, seaports, forts, factories, settlements, districts, and\r\nterritories in India, together with the island of St. Helena; either by\r\ngrants from the Crown, by conquest, purchase, or by grants from the\r\nnative powers in India. The nature and extent of their property in these\r\nseveral possessions, is an important public question. By grants from the\r\nCrown to the original or London Company, and by conveyance from that\r\nCompany, they possess St. Helena and Bombay. By purchase, conquest, or\r\nby Indian grants, they possess Calcutta and Fort William, Madras, and\r\nFort St. George, and various other important seats of trade; of all of\r\nwhich, for a long course of time; they have enjoyed the exclusive\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the first of these; it is evident, that the Old Company\r\ncould only convey the places which they held of the Crown as they\r\nthemselves held them, and subject to the same principles of policy and\r\nstate under which they themselves had received them. The Grants of\r\nCharles II., which conceded Bombay and St. Helena to the first Company,\r\nrefer to the Charter of the 13th of the same reign, which Charter refers\r\nto, and confirms the preceding Charters of Elizabeth and James I.,\r\nmaking them _the ground_ of the Grants. The Charter of Elizabeth\r\ndeclares its principle to be, \"the tendering the honour of the nation,\r\nthe wealth of the people, the increase of navigation, the advancement of\r\nlawful traffic, and the benefit of the Commonwealth.\" The principle\r\ndeclared in the Charter of James I. is, \"that it will be a very great\r\nhonour, and in many respects profitable, to THE CROWN and THE\r\nCOMMONWEALTH.\" By a reference to, and confirmation of, these several\r\nCharters, in the Charter of Charles II., and in the grants of St. Helena\r\nand Bombay, these principles are virtually adopted; the _end and\r\npurpose of the Grants_ is declared; and their ground is proclaimed to\r\nbe, the honour of the British Crown, and the welfare of the British\r\nNation. It was those great _public interests_, and not the _separate\r\ninterests_ of the Company, that the Crown had in view, in conceding the\r\nproperty of those distant dependencies.\r\n\r\nBy grants from the native powers, the Company are in actual possession\r\nof many extensive and valuable territories. The doctrine of the law of\r\nEngland, in regard to the operation of these Grants, was distinctly and\r\nofficially declared in the Report of the Attorney-General Mr. Pratt, and\r\nSolicitor-General Mr. Charles Yorke, in the year 1757, viz. That the\r\nmoment the _right of property_ vested in the Company by the Indian\r\nGrants, the _right of sovereignty_ vested necessarily in the Crown of\r\nEngland. \"The property of the soil (said those eminent lawyers) vested\r\nin the Company by the Indian Grants, _subject only_ to Your Majesty's\r\nright of sovereignty over the settlements, and over the inhabitants as\r\nBritish subjects; who carry with them Your Majesty's laws, wherever they\r\nform colonies, and receive Your Majesty's protection by virtue of your\r\nRoyal Charters[12].\" In considering this head of right, the case of\r\n_the five Northern Circars_, to which the Company lay claim in their\r\nPetition, demands a particular attention; because, the advocates of the\r\nCompany's pretensions are under a manifest error, with respect to their\r\ntenure of those territories. They maintain, that the Circars are held by\r\nthe Company in perpetuity, under _a military service_, as tributaries to\r\nthe Indian Power or Powers by which they were originally ceded; and that\r\nthe Crown of England has no title to interfere, between them and their\r\nsupposed Indian Chief. This pretension renders it absolutely necessary,\r\nto take a general view of the situation of the Company with respect to\r\nthe Circars.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1753, the French were in the confirmed possession of the\r\nfive Circars, together with the adjoining fort and dependencies of\r\nMasulipatam; of all of which they declared themselves to have obtained\r\n\"_the complete sovereignty for ever_,\" by a grant from the Subah of the\r\nDeccan, a Prince nominally dependent on the Imperial Crown of the Mogul.\r\n\"So that these territories (says Mr. Orme), rendered the French masters\r\nof the greatest dominion, both in extent and value, that had ever been\r\npossessed in Indostan by Europeans, not excepting the Portuguese when at\r\nthe height of their prosperity[13].\" The establishment of the French\r\npower in these important provinces, during the war between England and\r\nFrance, excited the most serious alarm in the Company, by threatening\r\ntheir settlements and possessions in Bengal; and called forth the\r\nvigorous and splendid exertions of Lord Clive, who, in the year 1759,\r\nsent a military force against Conflans, the French Commander, under the\r\ncommand of Colonel Forde. That gallant Officer succeeded in defeating\r\nthe enemy in a pitched battle at Peddipore; and, pursuing him from one\r\nextremity of the Circars to the other, terminated the campaign by the\r\ncapture of Masulipatam: and thus, by obliging the French to abandon the\r\nCircars, the right of conquest was made good against the French. For it\r\nis not necessary that every part of a conquered country should be\r\nacquired by a separate victory, if the enemy is compelled to evacuate\r\nhis territory in consequence of any decisive operation; and the\r\nretention of Masulipatam, was the evidence of the triumph of the British\r\narms over the French. That this was _the object_ of the campaign, is\r\ndistinctly shown in the declaration made by Lord Clive before the Select\r\nCommittee of the House of Commons, in the year 1772. Lord Clive stated\r\nto the House, \"That soon after his appointment of President of the\r\nCompany's affairs in Bengal, in 1758, he took into his most serious\r\nconsideration the situation of affairs upon the coast of Coromandel.\r\nMonsieur Lally was arrived with such a force, as threatened not only\r\nthe destruction of all the settlements there, but of all the East India\r\nCompany's possessions. That he thought it was his duty to contribute his\r\nmite towards the destruction of the French, and therefore projected _the\r\nscheme of depriving the French of the Northern Circars_, contrary to the\r\ninclination of his whole Council. That _this expedition succeeded\r\ncompletely, for the French were totally driven out by_ Col. Forde, _with\r\nthe Company's troops_, whose conduct and gallantry upon that occasion\r\nwas equal, if not superior, to any thing that had happened during the\r\nwhole course of the war[14].\" This evidence of Lord Clive proves, that\r\nthe scheme was _entirely military_, and that the success was _the\r\nsuccess of arms_. By the Treaty of Peace concluded at Paris in 1763,\r\n(Art. 11,) \"the Crown of France renounced all pretensions to those\r\nterritories,\" which thus devolved, by an indisputable right of conquest,\r\nto the Crown of England. The Company, indeed, in the same year obtained\r\na grant of Masulipatam from the Subah of the Deccan, which they now set\r\nforth in their Petition to Parliament: but yet, their most strenuous\r\nadvocates admit, that Masulipatam belongs to the Crown of England, _by\r\nright of conquest over the French_[15]. And the same argument, that\r\nproves a right of conquest to Masulipatam, proves also a similar right\r\nto the Northern Circars.\r\n\r\nIn 1765, however, the Company being desirous of acquiring _the form of\r\nan Indian title_ to the Circars, against the Subah, who might reclaim\r\nthem, negotiated for a grant of those provinces at Delhi, over the head\r\nof the Subah; which grant they obtained. But the pretensions of the\r\nSubah, who was close at hand, might disturb them in their attempts to\r\noccupy the provinces; they therefore thought it _expedient_, to\r\ntemporize with the Subah, and to enter into a separate negotiation with\r\nhim, to induce him to surrender them; and they agreed to hold the\r\nprovinces of him also, under an engagement to supply him with a\r\ncontingent aid of _military force_, when called upon; and moreover, to\r\npay him annually a tribute in money. By thus confusing their titles\r\n(which, instead of confirming, mutually defeated each other), they fully\r\ndemonstrated the inefficacy and impotency of the Mogul's grant, in the\r\npresent fallen state of that Empire. But the Company could only engage\r\nthemselves for _military service_, so far as they possessed the ability;\r\nand their ability, is limited by the extent of their _military power_;\r\nwhich, being a part of their _sovereign power_, must necessarily\r\ndetermine with their sovereign capacity: as will be shown in the next\r\narticle. Whenever that capacity ceases, they will be unable to furnish a\r\nsingle soldier, because they will be unable to raise a single soldier\r\nfor the defence of the provinces. In that event, the Crown must of\r\nnecessity interfere, to maintain and defend the territories; and then,\r\n_the original cause_ which led to the acquirement of the Circars,\r\nnamely, the expulsion of the French _by force of arms_, and their\r\nexclusion by _the influence of the same arms_ in the Treaty of 1763,\r\nwill be the true ground on which to rest _the question of right_: a\r\nright in _the Crown of England_, which had existence, prior to _the\r\nform_ of the Mogul's grant, and prior also to _the expedient_ of the\r\ngrant from the Subah. And here we must keep in mind, that all\r\nterritories possessed by the Company in India, by whatever means they\r\nhave been acquired, are necessarily incorporated into the British\r\nEmpire, and become subject to its Imperial Crown; conformably to the\r\nresolution of the House of Commons, in the year 1773: \"_That all\r\nacquisitions made under the influence of a military force, or by treaty\r\nwith foreign Princes, do of right belong to the State._\" And as the\r\nwhole fabric of BRITISH INDIA grew out of a principle of advancing _the\r\npublic welfare_, and was not an edifice raised merely for the separate\r\nwelfare of _the Company_, every private interest comprehended in that\r\nfabric is, by every acknowledged maxim of State, public right, and\r\nconsistency, subordinate; and must be determined by the security of the\r\npublic good.\r\n\r\n2. _A right to retain in perpetuity certain essential rights of\r\nsovereignty, after the present delegated sovereignty of the Company\r\nshall have reverted to the Crown._--Although this pretension is a\r\ncontradiction in terms, yet the assertors of it entertained no doubts of\r\nits reality. They claimed for the Company, in their permanent capacity\r\nof a trading body corporate, a right \"_to appoint governors, to build\r\nand maintain forts, to muster forces by sea and land, to coin money, and\r\nto erect Courts of Judicature_[16],\" even after they shall have lost\r\ntheir power of administering the Government of India; and this claim is\r\nrenewed for the Company at the present day[17]. There is in this\r\npretension so radical an ignorance of _the nature of sovereignty_, that\r\nit is inconceivable how it could have been entertained by any one, who\r\nhad ever given a thought to the subject of law or government. The powers\r\nhere enumerated, are essential prerogatives of sovereignty; which may\r\nindeed be delegated for a time by authority of Parliament, but can never\r\nbe granted in full property by the Crown. In order to appoint governors,\r\nit is first necessary to be invested with the power of government. The\r\nsame power is manifestly necessary, in order to be able _legally to\r\nraise or muster any force by sea or land_, either for defence, or for\r\nany other military service. And it is acknowledged, that _the power of\r\ngovernment_ has never been granted to the East India Company, _but with\r\nlimitation_. In the grants of Bombay and St. Helena, the Company is\r\ncertainly empowered to erect forts, and to raise and employ forces; but\r\nby the same grants they are invested with the powers of Captain General\r\nin order to that end; virtually in the first, and _expressly_ in the\r\nsecond. Will it be imagined, that they are to retain the authority of\r\n_Captain General_, after their powers of _government_ shall cease? And\r\nif not, it must be evident, that their authority over forts, and all\r\ntheir military power, must determine, whenever their delegated power of\r\nCaptain General shall determine. It would be an insult to any reader,\r\nwho has ever cast his eye even on the elementary Commentaries of Sir\r\nWilliam Blackstone, to insist upon a truth so obvious and simple. With\r\nregard to the _erecting of Courts_, no such power is given in any of the\r\nCharters produced in evidence. The Crown erects the Court, and the power\r\ngranted to the Company is, and necessarily must be, limited and\r\nsubordinate. The _true cause_ of that extraordinary error, is plainly\r\nthis: the Charters of King William and Queen Anne, upon which they rest\r\nthese pretensions, conferred at one and the same time (as has been\r\nalready observed), both their corporate capacity and their exclusive\r\nprivilege. The assertors of those _permanent sovereign rights_, not\r\ndiscriminating, by the principles of things, between the several powers\r\nconferred in those Charters, have confused the provisions; and have\r\nconstrued all the powers above enumerated, which by their nature could\r\nonly appertain to them as _delegated Sovereigns_, to belong to their\r\ncapacity of an _incorporated Company_. And, under this illusion, they\r\nhave imagined, that those powers are annexed to that perpetuity of their\r\ncorporate body which was first enacted in 1730, and confirmed in the 33d\r\nyear of the present reign; and that they do not constitute a part of\r\nthose powers of government, which have been conferred upon them, from\r\ntime to time, by their exclusive Charters. As this construction is\r\nentirely arbitrary on the part of the Company, and as it is unsupported\r\nby the principles either of law or sound reason, it will be best refuted\r\nby the authority of Parliament.\r\n\r\n3. _A right to exclude all British subjects from the Company's Indian\r\nports, after their own exclusive privilege shall be expired._--This\r\nright has been claimed in the following words:--\"Although their\r\nexclusive right to the trade, and their power of administering the\r\ngovernment and revenues of India, were to be determined, they would\r\nstill remain an incorporated Company _in perpetuity_, with the\r\n_exclusive_ property and _possession_ of Calcutta and Fort William,\r\nMadras and Fort St. George, Bombay, Bencoolen, and St. Helena, and\r\nvarious other estates and settlements in India. Whether, in the event of\r\nthe sole trade being determined, individuals would be able to carry on a\r\nsuccessful trade to India, _if the Company were to debar them the use of\r\ntheir ports and factories_, may require a serious consideration[18].\"\r\n\r\nThis is a claim, not only to a _practical_ exclusive trade, after the\r\nright to exclusive trade _expressly granted_ by Parliament shall cease\r\nand determine, but involves also claims of perpetual sovereignty. It is\r\nincomprehensible, how it could be alleged by a writer who, in the\r\npreceding page, had pointedly excepted from their powers, that of\r\nconverting the trade into \"a _mischievous_ monopoly[19];\" for, what more\r\n_mischievous_ form could monopoly, or an hostile sovereignty, assume,\r\nthan that of excluding all British individuals from the chief ports and\r\nseats of trade in India? By this alleged right, the grants of Charters\r\nand the provisions of Parliament would be reduced to an absurdity. But\r\nas this is a claim of _private right_ to cause a _public wrong_, it\r\ncannot fail particularly to engage the consideration of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe rights _alleged by the Company_ at the present day, are these:--\r\n\r\n1. _A right to all the ports and territories in India, possessed by the\r\nCompany, of the same kind and extent as the right by which they hold\r\ntheir freeholds in London._--This right has been solemnly asserted for\r\nthe Company, by the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Court of\r\nDirectors, in these words:--\"The Company are AS MUCH owners of THE CHIEF\r\nSEATS of European trade in the Indian Empire, as they are of THEIR\r\nFREEHOLDS IN LONDON[20].\" This is an open and unreserved declaration of\r\nthe East India Company, renewing and asserting the preceding allegations\r\nmade on their behalf at the expiration of their last exclusive Charter;\r\nand the same allegation is now repeated in their Petition to Parliament,\r\nthough in terms somewhat more qualified than those which they addressed\r\nto the Government; viz. \"that _no person_ can have a right, except with\r\nthe consent of the proprietors of India stock, _to use the seats of\r\ntrade_ which the stockholders _have acquired_.\" But they must bring an\r\noblivion over all the reasons of state and policy by which _they exist\r\nat all_, before they can carry in the face of the nation the proud\r\nassertion, that they stand equally circumstanced, in regard of _private\r\nright_, with respect to \"_the chief seats of European commerce in the\r\nIndian Empire_,\" and with respect to \"_their freeholds in London_.\" They\r\nwill assuredly be told by Parliament, that they _may not_ exercise the\r\nsame arbitrary authority over the chief seats of Indian commerce, which\r\nthey may over their freeholds in London. With regard to their freeholds\r\nin London, they may exclude all persons from entering them, they may\r\ndesert them themselves, or they may let them fall to ruin. But it is NOT\r\nSO with regard to the chief seats of Indian commerce; they will find,\r\nthat they cannot arbitrarily exclude British subjects from those seats,\r\nbeyond a limited time; that they cannot _debar_ the nation the\r\nbeneficial use of them; and that they will not be suffered to render\r\nthem unavailable, or unprofitable. As soon as the India Trade shall be\r\nthrown open, the ports of India will necessarily become open; and, if\r\nthe Company should then search for _their private right to close them_,\r\nthey will find, that it is merged in _the public right to use them_; or,\r\nto use the words of Lord Hale, that \"their _jus privatum_ is clothed and\r\nsuperinduced with a _jus publicum_[21].\"\r\n\r\n2. The last right _alleged by the Company_ at the present crisis, which\r\nforms the CLIMAX of their pretensions, and is the _key_ to all their\r\nlate proceedings, is that of a _perpetual union and incorporation with\r\nthe Supreme Government of the Indian Empire_; so that the Indian trade\r\nand government must ever continue to be united _in them_, and cannot now\r\nbe separated, without endangering \"_the British Empire in India, and the\r\nBritish Constitution at home_.\" This pretension renders the question of\r\na _temporary_ exclusive trade entirely nugatory, because it is the\r\nunqualified assertion of a _perpetual_ one; not to be received any more\r\nas _a grant_ from Parliament, as hitherto it has been, but to be\r\nextorted from Parliament through fear of the subversion of Parliament.\r\nThis pretension is founded upon the Company's interpretation of an\r\nobservation, made by a late eminent Minister to the Managers of the\r\nCompany's affairs, in the year 1800; viz. that \"_the Government and the\r\ntrade of India are now so interwoven together_,\" as to establish an\r\nindissoluble \"_connexion of government and trade_.\" This _dictum_, is\r\nassumed by the Company for an incontestable maxim of State, _as\r\napplicable to their own Corporation_; and for an eternal principle,\r\nconnecting that Body Corporate with all future Indian Government. This\r\nthey denominate, \"THE SYSTEM, _by which the relations between Great\r\nBritain and the East Indies are now regulated_;\" and, in their sanguine\r\nhopes of gaining _perpetuity_ for their _system_, they already\r\ncongratulate themselves upon their Incorporation into the Sovereignty,\r\nas a NEW, and FOURTH ESTATE of the Empire.\r\n\r\nIt is that maxim, evidently embraced for this construction at the\r\npresent crisis, that has emboldened the conductors of the Company's\r\nconcerns to assume so lofty a demeanour towards the King's servants; and\r\nto venture to represent the cautious proceedings of Government in a\r\ngreat political question (in which it appears only as _a moderator_\r\nbetween two conflicting interests), to be an aggression against their\r\nindisputable rights. It has been asked in the Court of Proprietors,\r\n\"whether the Ministers of the present day are become so far exalted\r\nabove their predecessors, or the Company so newly fallen, that adequate\r\ncommunications should not be made to the latter, of the plans and\r\nintentions of the former?\" It is neither the one nor the other; but it\r\nis, that _the Company_ are become so elated and intoxicated by the\r\nambitious expectation of being incorporated as a perpetual Member of the\r\nSupreme Government, that they conceive they have no longer any measures\r\nto keep with the Ministers of the Crown.\r\n\r\nAnd can the British people _now_ fail to open their eyes, and to discern\r\nthe strait to which the ancient crown and realm of England would be\r\nreduced, by submitting to acknowledge this _new estate_ in the Empire?\r\nGreatly as it would be to be lamented that any thing should disturb the\r\npresent internal tranquillity of our political system, yet, if such\r\nshould be the necessary result of a resistance to the ambitious views of\r\nthe East India Company, it ought to be manfully and cheerfully\r\nencountered; rather than admit, by a temporizing concession, a claim\r\nwhich shall bend PARLIAMENT to the will of, and degrade THE CROWN to an\r\nalliance with, a Company of its own subjects; which owes its recent\r\nexistence to the charters of the Crown, and the enactments of\r\nParliament, and yet aspires to seat itself for ever, side by side, by\r\nits own supreme Government.\r\n\r\nThe Company have carried too far their confidence in the _constitutional\r\ndefence_ by which they hoped to ride in triumph over the Executive\r\nGovernment. Their exorbitant pretensions have bred a _new constitutional\r\nquestion_, to which the public mind is now turning. In their solicitude\r\nto fortify themselves with _constitutional jealousies_, they have\r\nconstructed a formidable fortress, which threatens to embarrass the\r\nCitadel of the State, and must therefore of necessity awaken its\r\njealousy. A change in the Administration of the Indian Government\r\n(should the Company finally provoke such a change), _need not\r\nnecessarily_ throw the patronage of India into the hands of the Crown;\r\nmeans are to be found, by which that political and constitutional evil\r\nmay be effectually guarded against. But if, through a precipitate\r\nassumption, that no such adequate substitute can be provided for the\r\npresent system, Parliament should, at this critical moment, unguardedly\r\nyield to the demands of the Company, and give its sanction to their\r\nclaims to a _perpetuity_ of those privileges which they have hitherto\r\nbeen contented to receive _with limitation_, what difficulties would it\r\nnot entail upon its own future proceedings? If the _corporate\r\nsovereignty_ of the Company is once absolutely _engrafted_ upon _the\r\nSovereignty of the State_, it cannot be extracted without lacerating the\r\nancient stock, and convulsing the general system.\r\n\r\nThe Company would have done wisely, if, instead of resting their case\r\nupon pretensions erroneous in fact, inadmissible in law, and derogatory\r\nof the authority addressed, they had rested it wholly upon their own\r\nendeavours to promote the original purpose of their incorporation:\r\nnamely, _the honour of the Crown_, and _the advantage of the\r\ncommonwealth_. Upon that ground the Company might have stood strong; and\r\nall that would then have remained for the consideration of Parliament,\r\nwould have been a question, how those great interests could, under\r\nexisting circumstances, be best advanced; either by continuing the\r\npresent arrangement without alteration, or by modifying it in such\r\nparticulars, as Parliament in its wisdom might judge to be necessary.\r\nBut instead of this, they have taken ground upon high pretensions of\r\nRIGHT, which must necessarily provoke investigation; and we have\r\ndiscovered, in the foregoing inquiry, how far those pretensions are\r\nsupported.\r\n\r\nThe determination of this great question, however, is now reserved for\r\nParliament; and, upon the wisdom of Parliament, the Country may with\r\nconfidence rely, for a full consideration of all the public rights,\r\ncommercial as well as political; and likewise, for the final adoption of\r\nsuch an arrangement for the government and trade of India, as shall\r\nappear to be the best calculated to advance the real interests, and to\r\npromote the general prosperity of the Empire, both in the East and West.\r\n\r\nGRACCHUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] Anderson's Hist. of Commerce (1698), vol. ii. p. 221, fol.\r\n\r\n[10] A Short Hist. of the East India Company, p. 6.\r\n\r\n[11] De Portibus Maris, p. 2. c. 6. p. 77.\r\n\r\n[12] Short Hist. of East India Company, p. 11.\r\n\r\n[13] History of Indostan, vol. i. p. 335.\r\n\r\n[14] Journals of the House of Commons, vol. xxxiii. p. 811.\r\n\r\n[15] Short Hist. of the East India Company.\r\n\r\n[16] Short Hist. of the East India Company, p. 56.\r\n\r\n[17] Morning Post, Jan. 15, 1813, Letter, signed Probus.\r\n\r\n[18] Short History of the East India Company, p. 38.\r\n\r\n[19] Ibid. p. 37.\r\n\r\n[20] Letter to Lord Buckinghamshire, Dec. 30, 1812.\r\n\r\n[21] De Portibus Maris, p. 2. c. 7. p. 84.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.
