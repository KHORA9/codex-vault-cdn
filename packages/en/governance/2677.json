The\r\nfifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take\r\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\r\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\r\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\r\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\r\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text\r\nfiles per month, or 384 more Etexts in 1998 for a total of 1500+\r\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\r\ntotal should reach over 150 billion Etexts given away.\r\n\r\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\r\nFiles by the December 31, 2001.

Frank Durham, edited by\r\nDouglas Hay\r\n\r\nAndrew Durham was a Hoosier attorney and state senator during the\r\ntwenties, Often covered in the papers, he was one of Indiana's\r\nleading denmocratic politicians who served as minority leader in\r\nthe Indiana Senate in 1927. During 1925 he was instigator of the\r\nfamous \"Runaway Democrats\" episode in the Senate. Later, in the\r\nthirties and forties, he continued his political career as a\r\nlobbyist for the railroad industry. Most of all, he was a\r\nfascinating and sought-after speaker and raconteur--a man both\r\nnewspapers and appreciative listeners to his speeches called \"The\r\nWill Rogers of Indiana\" for his wit and incisive commentaries on\r\nthe passing scene. Durham left over five hundred letters which\r\nreflect this interesting wit and commentary. \"Pap's\" son, Frank,\r\ncompiled them and they are presented here as a tribute to the\r\nman--and an era which encouraged the writing of literate,\r\nmeaningful letters.\r\n\r\nDEDICATION\r\n\r\nTo \"Munny\"--Aura May Sawyer--and \"Pap\"--Andrew Everett Durham--\r\nsmall-time lawyer, farmer, Hoosier politician and father\r\nextraordinaire of son J. Frank and daughters Mary Joanna, Sarah\r\nJane, Margaret, Ann Drew and Aura May.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe writer of these letters, Andrew Everett Durham (1882-1954),\r\nwas a well-known figure in his day--an Indiana State Legislator,\r\nrailroad lobbyist, small town lawyer and banker, part-time farmer\r\nand livestock-raiser, public orator, occasional newspaper\r\ncorrespondent--and prolific writer of letters.\r\n\r\nAndrew's son, J. Frank, still lives in Greencastle, Indiana, the\r\nplace where Andrew made his mark. For years Frank had wanted to\r\n\"do something with Pap's letters\" in the way of publication, but,\r\nas a practicing attorney and busy man in his own right, felt he\r\nneeded some help. He tried to enlist his sister, Joanna, once an\r\nAssociated Press feature writer, New York Bureau, who now resides\r\nin Milford, Pennsylvania. She was one of my columnists when I was\r\neditor of the weekly Pike County Dispatch, in Milford. However,\r\nJoanna felt she could not take time from her own obligations to\r\nassist on Frank's project, and asked me to help.\r\n\r\nFrankly, I wondered at first whether Andrew E. Durham's letters\r\nwould arouse much interest in these days of globalization, the\r\nInternet and a pop culture centered around sensational\r\naudio/video special effects, but I agreed to at least look at a\r\nfew. Soon an Express Mail packet arrived with the first of\r\nhundreds of pages of yellowed onion-skin copies of typewritten\r\ncorrespondence, most of it dating from 1913 through 1954.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't long before I cracked my first smile over a clever turn\r\nof phrase used to describe a domestic scene. The first good laugh\r\nfollowed not long after that, upon reading how a former governor\r\ncolluded with a livestock speculator to run up the price of\r\nbreeding bulls. An account of a disastrous summer theater\r\nproduction was downright hilarious. Then I found myself nodding\r\nsoberly in agreement over witty but forceful arguments about the\r\nneed to balance the budget and restore fiscal responsibility to\r\ngovernment an argument that could have keen made yesterday,\r\nexcept that the deficits quoted were only in the millions, not\r\nthe billions. Finally, there was a story about an ill-fated love\r\naffair of an old bachelor brother that produced a lump in my\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\nI quickly discovered that Andrew Durham had a great wit, an\r\nirrepressible sense of humor and untiring interest in his\r\nsurroundings--the people, the politics, the commerce of everyday\r\nlife--all of it studied thoroughly and recounted energetically\r\nwith a homespun irony akin to that of other humorists of his era,\r\nsuch as George Ade, Mark Twain and Will Rogers.\r\n\r\nIn his day, Andrew was much in demand as a public speaker. A\r\nbrittle newspaper clipping included with the letters revealed\r\nthat at a reunion of his college fraternity, in 1929, he shared\r\nthe podium with legendary baseball manager Branch Rickey and\r\nprominent Chicago attorney Roy O. West.\r\n\r\nAs demonstrated by his letters, Andrew was an irrepressible\r\nstoryteller who could not resist a jest even when ordering parts\r\nfor a stove. When writing in pursuit of a payment on an overdue\r\nnote at the bank, he would ease the bite by asking the debtor's\r\n\"help\" in paying for a daughter's wedding. Andrew wrote\r\nincessantly. I suppose everyone wrote more back then, when\r\ntelephone connections were often poor and always expensive, but\r\nstamps cost only 2 cents. Letters were also a form of\r\nentertainment in those pre-TV days.\r\n\r\nMuch of his correspondence was business-related, and Andrew was\r\nevidently a very busy man. But he could still find time to type\r\nout a five-page, single-spaced letter of advice to the son of an\r\nold friend who had landed in jail. He had never even met the\r\nyoung miscreant. In that and other instances, Andrew's prose took\r\non new energy, stressing the therapeutic value of character and\r\nprinciples, as well as a good laugh.\r\n\r\nLong before I stopped reading that first day, I was hooked. This\r\nstuff is priceless. Some of it might appear exotic or dated,\r\nparticularly to nonagrarian folks who do not know what it is like\r\nto live off the land or reside in small towns where everybody\r\nknows everybody else--but even satisfied urbanites may be\r\ninterested in reading about a different way of life. And they\r\nsurely will see similarities to their own situations in the many\r\nstories about eccentric relatives, surly waitresses, guileful\r\npoliticians, child-rearing and money woes. Far from being\r\noutdated, I decided, much of Andrew's material has a timeless\r\nquality--it addresses standards and values, family and community\r\nfoibles, human dignity and folly--universal themes that still\r\nexist, even in our electronic age.\r\n\r\nEditing the letters was the easy part. Frank and I never did\r\ndecide how to organize them for publication. His \"Pap\" had\r\ncorresponded with hundreds of people about a multitude of\r\npersonal and professional topics; several diverse activities and\r\ninterests would often be recounted in the same letter, sometimes\r\nas they occurred but often in retrospect several years later. We\r\nfinally decided to present the correspondence in chronological\r\norder, so as to best reflect the flow of Pap's life, including\r\nhis memories as well as his latest observations. I found it great\r\nreading, and hope you do also.\r\n\r\nDouglas N. Hay\r\nMill Rift, PA\r\nApril 22, 1997\r\n\r\nSOME BACKGROUND ON 'PAP'\r\n\r\n\"Pap\"--Andrew Everett Durham--was born May 3, 1882, the youngest\r\nson of James V. Durham and Sarah A. (Black) Durham, of\r\nRussellville, Indiana. His paternal grandfather, Jacob, had\r\nemigrated from Kentucky to become one of the early settlers of\r\nRussell Township--a farmer, store-keeper, state legislator and\r\nmover and shaker in his own right, as described in one of Pap's\r\npapers.\r\n\r\nPap's father was also active in local affairs, and supplemented\r\nhis farm income by starting a private bank in Russellville along\r\nwith Pap's older brother, Ernest. The Russellville Bank stayed in\r\nfamily hands for about 70 years. Pap was fond of recounting how,\r\nas a youth, he got his start in business there--as janitor, for\r\n$2 a week. He eventually worked his way up to chairman of the\r\nboard. The bank survived the Depression in fine order and\r\ndeclined to join the FDIC, which Pap publicly denounced as a sham\r\ndesigned to subsidize poorly-run banks at the expense of well-run\r\nones, with the public footing the bill.\r\n\r\nWhile maintaining their Russellville interests, Pap's parents\r\nmoved to nearby Greencastle in his youth. After graduating from\r\nhigh school, he was sent to Western Military Academy, Alton,\r\nIllinois, to \"straighten out\" after his strict Kentucky-bred\r\nmother discovered that he had been hanging around the local pool\r\nparlor. He graduated from the academy in 1899 with high honors,\r\nand continued his education graduating from Indiana University in\r\n1903 and from Indiana School of Law in 1906.\r\n\r\nOn Thanksgiving Day, 1910, he married Aura May Sawyer, of\r\nMuscatine, Iowa. The wedding took place at the retirement home of\r\nthe bride's parents, in Milford, Pennsylvania. The union\r\neventually produced five daughters and one son.\r\n\r\nPap began his political career with election to the Indiana House\r\nof Representatives in 1913, following in the footsteps of his\r\ngrandfather. His politics emphasized conservatism, low taxes and\r\nself-reliance. He was re-elected to the House in 1915, and then\r\nelected to the State Senate in 1917 and 1923. It is noteworthy\r\nthat all of his victories came as a Democrat, although most of\r\nhis constituents were registered Republican.\r\n\r\nPap was not only good at wooing Republican voters. He was also\r\ngenerally effective in gaining bipartisan support for his\r\nlegislative undertakings. But he was not loath to take resolute\r\naction, if required. When it appeared that a Republican\r\ngerrymandering bill would succeed, Pap, as Minority Leader, had\r\nhis Democratic delegation go into \"hiding\" across the state line,\r\npreventing action on the reapportionment bill by removing a\r\nquorum. It also froze all other legislative activities. The\r\nRepublicans finally agreed to withdraw the objectionable bill,\r\nand the \"runaway\" Democrats returned.\r\n\r\nHis growing family necessitated a larger income and after a\r\ngubernatorial run failed to materialize, Pap retired from the\r\nSenate, in 1929. He devoted more time to his law practice and\r\nbecame a lobbyist for the Indiana Railroad Lobby Assn. In such\r\ncapacity, he continued to monitor his former peers, and had the\r\nreputation of having attended every Legislative Session from 1913\r\nto 1951.\r\n\r\nThroughout his life, Russellville was a continuing source of\r\ngratification to Pap, and also provided a wealth of material for\r\nanecdotes of small-town life, which were incorporated into his\r\npublic-speaking and his voluminous correspondence.\r\n\r\nThe family farm just outside the village was also a valued source\r\nof income, as well as sustenance, and Pap took a personal hand in\r\nits operation, spending more and more time there as he grew\r\nolder.\r\n\r\nAndrew E. Durham passed away at home in Greencastle, July 23,\r\n1954.\r\n\r\nGLOSSARY\r\n\r\nPap was an inveterate inventor of nicknames, applied mostly to\r\nhis family. Some of the letters in the collection contain the\r\nfollowing references:\r\n\r\n\"Annabelle Lee\" (Mrs. Ralph Weinrichter of Menlo Park,\r\nCalifornia) has a daughter, Kathryn, and a son, Ralph Weinrichter\r\nII, also of Menlo Park.\r\n\r\nDeceased daughter Sarah Jane (Mrs. Robert Anderson) had five\r\nchildren: Heather (deceased) Scott, Roderick, Jennifer (now Mrs.\r\nWilliam Amon of Fairfax, Virginia) and Cathy (Mrs. Richard\r\nSandler, also of Fairfax.)\r\n\r\nJoan's four include William McGaughey, Jr., and Andrew D. of\r\nMinneapolis, Minnesota, David P. of Rochester, New York and\r\nMargaret Durham McGaughey Isaacson of Brunswick, Maine.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the two sons mentioned by Frank (George and\r\nAndrew) he has two daughters, Stephanie (Mrs. Stephanie D.\r\nBurton, of Winter Haven, Florida) and Madeleine (Mrs. Keith\r\nThomas of Shelbyville, Indiana.)\r\n\r\nAunt Margaret -- sister, Margaret D. (married name, Bridges)\r\n\r\nFranklin Pierce, a.k.a. Frankfurter -- son J. Frank\r\n\r\nFrancisco -- daughter-in-law Frances (nee Haberkorn)\r\n\r\nIra -- Ira Flauer, hired hand on the family's Russellville farm\r\n\r\nJane -- daughter Sarah Jane (married name, Anderson, now\r\ndeceased)\r\n\r\nJoan, a.k.a. Jonie Bonie -- daughter Mary Joanna (married name,\r\nMcGaughey)\r\n\r\nMargaretta -- daughter Margaret (deceased)\r\n\r\nMunny, a.k.a. Munny-Bun -- wife Aura May (nee Sawyer)\r\n\r\nThe Old Brakeman -- Walter J. Behmer, retired Gen. Supt., The\r\nPennsylvania Railroad\r\n\r\n\"Red\" Purnell -- Fred Purnell, Congressman from Indiana\r\n\r\nSugar Foot, a.k.a. Footser -- daughter Aura May\r\n\r\nUncle Ernest -- brother J. Ernest Durham\r\n\r\nABOUT THE CO-AUTHOR\r\n\r\nJ. Frank Durham, who compiled this anthology of his father's\r\nletters, was born in Greencastle, Indiana, October 3, 1915. He\r\nwent to work early, as a newsboy carrying the Indianapolis News\r\nand local paper, and then began his education at the legendary\r\nDan Beard's Boy Scout Camp, in Pike County, Pennsylvania. He was\r\nsubsequently a member of the Phillips Exeter Academy Class of\r\n1934, obtained an AB degree from hometown DePauw University in\r\n1937 and LLB from Indiana University in 1941.\r\n\r\nFrank's budding law practice was interrupted by World War Two. He\r\nenlisted in the U.S. Naval Reserve, graduating from bomb disposal\r\nschool and serving on Guadalcanal, where he received a field\r\npromotion to the rank of ensign. After being released from active\r\nduty, Frank chaired a committee that secured the only captured\r\nGerman V-1 Rocket ever put on public display in the United\r\nStates. A unique war memorial, this \"Buzz Bomb\" rests atop a\r\nsolid limestone V-shaped base at the southwest corner of the\r\nPutnam County Courthouse, in Greencastle.\r\n\r\nIn 1944, Frank married Frances M. Haberkorn of Detroit, Michigan.\r\nThey had four children, Andrew H., George B., Stephanie and\r\nMadeleine. During a 1975 tour of the Pacific, Frances suffered a\r\nfatal aneurysm. In 1979, Frank married Elaine Eide Moe, of\r\nSacramento, California, who is not only a gourmet cook but an\r\nactive jazz band pianist.\r\n\r\nAlthough he never developed his father's intense interest in\r\npolitics, there are similarities. Frank was elected Prosecuting\r\nAttorney of the 64th Judicial Circuit for two terms, and then\r\nGreencastle City Judge for two more terms. He still practices\r\nprobate law; was a trust officer of the Russellville Bank for 25\r\nyears, and a former bank vice president.\r\n\r\nFor recreation, Frank runs a bulldozer and backhoe on the family\r\nfarm near Russellville, continuing to actively participate in its\r\nmanagement, like his \"Pap\" before him. The farm also has the\r\nhangar and airstrip for Frank's Cessna, which he enjoys flying\r\nwhen not engaged in his law practice or farming. He first soloed\r\nin 1935. In 1971, he was a guest of the Canadian Government,\r\nhelping celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Northwest\r\nTerritory by flying with a small group down the Mackenzie River.\r\nHe has flown a small plane to Alaska and back seven times, and\r\nwas a guest writer in a published book by Loren McDonald, \"A Very\r\nPrivate Pilot.\" On another occasion, Frank and a friend took his\r\nyoung sons on a float trip down Alaska's Porcupine River, using\r\nkayaks they built themselves from kits in an Eskimo village.\r\n\r\nAt age 82, J. Frank Durham is a worthy scion of his very active\r\nlineage.\r\n\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments and thanks are long overdue to Elaine, my lovely\r\nspouse, who is largely responsible for the success of our\r\nmarriage; my sister Aura May Durham, for all the proof-reading\r\nand telephone-answering; my sister Ann (Mrs. Ralph Weinrichter of\r\nMenlo Park, CA), for her research and help; my sister Joan (Mrs.\r\nWilliam McGaughey of Milford, PA), for her editorial assistance\r\nand continued interest in this book; Indiana University\r\nChancellor Herman B.

Without his sure\r\nand steady hand, they would probably have been permanently\r\nentombed in trunks and boxes in Pennsylvania, Indiana and\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nJ. Frank Durham\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I: EARLY YEARS--1899-1911\r\n\r\nAs a boy of 17, Pap was considered somewhat wayward by his strict\r\nKentucky-bred mother, after being caught hanging around the local\r\npool parlor. He was also out of favor with his father for daring\r\nto criticize the latter's rather conservative attire. So to help\r\nhim \"straighten out\" and prepare to become a useful citizen, he\r\nwas sent to Western Military Academy, Upper Alton, Illinois, in\r\n1899. He graduated from that institution with high grades, but\r\nthe endeavor to reform him was nevertheless only partly\r\nsuccessful. Enrolling at \"Old Asbury\" (DePauw University,\r\nGreencastle), he promptly got in trouble with the Methodist\r\nadministration for organizing a dance at \"The Delts,\" his\r\nfraternity house. About to be suspended, he beat the\r\nadministration to the punch by transferring to Indiana\r\nUniversity, where he went on to undergraduate and law degrees.\r\n\r\nPap subsequently met and fell in love with Aura May Sawyer\r\n(better known as \"Munny\" to the family). The couple eventually\r\nmarried and Grandfather Sawyer gave them a generous start in life\r\nby financing a house in Greencastle, but not before being\r\nsatisfied with Pap's credit-worthiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST TASTE OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD\r\n\r\n(Pap's earliest surviving letters were written at Western\r\nMilitary Academy, Upper Alton, Illinois, the first to Mitch\r\nTaylor, a Civil War veteran, the other to his mother.)\r\n\r\nUpper Alton, Ill.\r\nMarch 9, 1899\r\n\r\nDear Uncle Mitch,\r\nI am over here in Illinois going to the Military Academy. This is\r\nthe damndest place I ever got into. They are terrible strict.\r\nThey make me get up at a certain time in the morning (6:30) and\r\nhave the meals at a certain time. They make us go to bed at 9:00\r\nand have the lights out at a quarter after nine. If we do\r\nanything wrong we have to carry guns and walk. For smoking the\r\npenalty is five hours hard walking. If we wear a dirty collar we\r\nhave to walk an hour. They make us have our rooms unlocked so\r\nthat they can come in at any time. They require us to make our\r\nown beds and if they are not just right they report us and that\r\nmeans two hours walking. This is a damn sight harder than ground-\r\nhog hunting. How I wish I was back. . .\r\n\r\nDon't forget our spree down the creek next summer. While I was\r\nwriting just now I heard the whistle of the steamboat on the\r\nMississippi. We hear several every morning. . . From what I know\r\nnow I shall be home about June 7 or 8 and we will get right to\r\nwork on the boats.\r\nYours Truly,\r\nAndrew E. Durham\r\n\r\n\r\nUpper Alton, Ill.\r\nApril 6, 1899\r\n\r\nDear Mother,\r\nAfter going to so much trouble to get a declamation it is not\r\ngoing to do me any good. Instead of having a preliminary contest\r\nin which we all could speak and then having some good\r\nelocutionist decide those who were the best speakers, the\r\nteachers here allowed each fellow to vote for anyone he pleased\r\nand the three boys getting the highest number of votes were\r\nelected to speak. . . And I cannot even get to try. . . There was\r\nnothing fair about the thing at all. . . You see, all the\r\nofficers here work for each other. . . They just got up and\r\nnominated each other and that was all there was to it. It is very\r\nhard on me coming in at the middle of the year and have just\r\nbarely gotten acquainted. Nearly all of the Senior Class are\r\nofficers and I am a private, and being as there are so many\r\nofficers it is nearly impossible for a private to get anything.\r\n\r\nBut there is one thing that I didn't get left in and that was\r\nScholarship. They have here what they call the Upper Ten. That is\r\nthe ten students who have the highest grades in the whole school.\r\nThese ten get their names put in the school publication. I was\r\nfourth on the list of ten out of 84 scholars, and first in the\r\nsenior class . . . My general average was 95 percent.\r\n\r\nAre you taking care of my shotgun? Have you had it cleaned out?\r\nWhere is it? . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nHELP THE KIDS START OUT BUT DON'T HURRY THEM\r\n\r\n(Andrew and Aura May Sawyer had a prolonged engagement. The\r\nreason becomes clearer upon reading this letter, written\r\nsurreptitiously by Pap's future father-in-law, F. P. Sawyer, of\r\nMuscatine, Iowa, to Pap's father, James V. Durham, in\r\nGreencastle. This is not one of Pap's own letters, but is\r\ninteresting nevertheless for what it says about family values).\r\n\r\nMuscatine, Iowa\r\nFebruary 17, 1909\r\nJ.V. Durham\r\nGreencastle, Ind.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\nI suppose as is quite natural, you are giving some thought to the\r\napproaching happiness of Andrew, as we are to that of Aura May;\r\nso you will understand my motive in writing you direct, and\r\nwithout the knowledge of either Aura May or Andrew. . .\r\n\r\nI think you probably know our suggestion as to building a\r\nmoderate house to rent to them, but as we have never boiled it\r\ndown to exact conditions (only the general idea), you may not\r\nunderstand just what we contemplate.\r\n\r\nYou are unquestionably as mindful of what your son does, as we\r\nare as to ours; but the boys are expected to \"look out for\r\nthemselves\" more than the girls; yet had it not been for my\r\nfather's help, both as to judgment and moderately financially in\r\nthe way of a gift at majority and loans to help me start (which I\r\nlater repaid) I would not have been able to succeed or don't\r\nthink I would--as I have. And the gift of $500 after the wedding\r\nfrom my father-in-law was not without big appreciation on my\r\npart. A few years later, when I was building a moderate home on a\r\nlot bought with part of the $500, which my wife had not invested\r\nin special furniture, and some I had saved, he gave us $2,000\r\nmore to help build the home. I certainly appreciated it, and put\r\nthe home all in her name. Later, after we moved and it was sold,\r\nI returned the money to her and she still has it.\r\n\r\nMy own experience and observation convinces me that the best time\r\nto help young people who show qualities . . . is when it will do\r\nthem the most good, which I think is when they are starting out,\r\nand not after they have slaved along and shown their ability to\r\ntake care of themselves (though it does often bring out their\r\nbest qualities quicker, but they don't need the help so much\r\nthen). I don't mean that one should go so far as to lessen their\r\nrealization that they must \"support themselves\", but the first\r\nthree or four years are hard for young people who have to make it\r\nall without some help.\r\n\r\nBut I don't believe in hurrying such a move. First, they should\r\nwait to see if their love for each other promises to be what\r\nshould exist to insure the desired future, and secondly, 'til\r\nthey can feel fairly assured that they can be self-supporting or\r\nare willing to live as the husband can reasonably afford.\r\n\r\nIn this generation, what were luxuries to us in younger days are\r\nto a degree necessities to those who have been brought up with\r\nthem, so that the problem is not exactly as it was in the pioneer\r\ndays, when good health, no debts, a job at $1.25 per day, three\r\neconomically furnished rooms and enough to pay the preacher were\r\nall that were required. . .\r\n\r\nI explained to both Aura and Andrew a couple of conditions I\r\nthought advisable before I could approve their setting the day.\r\nFirst, satisfaction that they had not, or were not apt to change\r\ntheir minds as to each other, and secondly, that he should have\r\ndemonstrated his ability to earn or have in sight an income of\r\n$1,000 per year. I did not think this high, but wanted them to\r\nknow they must expect to live economically, and that I expected\r\nthem to depend on their own resources. The limitation I named was\r\nmore theoretical than arbitrary, though they both think I still\r\nhold to that; but it depends on where they are to live whether\r\nthis is above or below what they would need for the first year or\r\nso. They are becoming restless, and I don't blame them, and to\r\ncarry out my plans as to a house requires some little time if\r\nthey want it ready for their first home--as I would like to\r\narrange it if advisable.\r\n\r\nThis has led me to write you, feeling that you and Mrs. Durham\r\nshould be consulted, and know just what Mrs. Sawyer and I\r\ncontemplated, and to have your approval; also that you think they\r\nare not taking an unwise step, from your point of view, as you\r\nknow much better what Greencastle presents as a permanent home\r\nfor them, and Andrew's present situation, and what he can\r\nreasonably expect in the near future. Aura May has various pieces\r\nof furniture which have been given her from time to time, and her\r\nfirst piano, which she thinks will be all she needs for awhile.\r\n. . so that it is not the original outlay that need perplex them.\r\nAs to the house, I will try and briefly explain.\r\n\r\nI contemplate putting up a seven-room house, with . . . living\r\nroom.. . . dining room and kitchen for first floor; three bed\r\nrooms and bathroom for second and one room finished in attic.\r\nThey would not furnish the smallest bedroom, but use it for\r\nsewing room. . . I don't want to exceed $6,000, including ground,\r\nas they don't want to carry a load, and I don't feel that I can\r\ntap my estate too heavily when out of business and depending on\r\nincome only. . . I propose to rent this to them at the rate of\r\n$200 for first year, payable monthly if they can do so, and 'til\r\nthey can from their income increase the rent to bring me equal to\r\n3% per year and taxes and insurance, for a period of five years.\r\n. . At the end of five years I would expect they would be able to\r\nmake it more if I or my estate needed it, or that they would buy\r\nit at just what it had actually cost me.\r\n\r\nIf my estate will permit me to do so at that time, or any earlier\r\ntime if they wish to buy it, I would expect to give Aura May at\r\nleast $2,000 of the value. . . In case of my death I would so\r\narrange that the whole investment would go to Aura, as part of\r\nher share in any of my estate. . .\r\n\r\nI do not expect any guarantee beyond their own ability to do it.\r\nSo I am not referring the matter to you for any part in it; but\r\nso that you may let me know if you feel the plan would be beyond\r\nexpectations from what you know of matters there, or probability\r\nthat his position is not calculated to develop so as to be able\r\nto keep up his end or remain in Greencastle. I do not know how\r\nmuch he is making now, or if you expect to aid him in any way,\r\nand feel that such matters are, and should be, just as a father\r\nmay be willing, or can afford; and I always feel that parents\r\nmust first consider each other and the needs for advancing age,\r\nno matter how kindly they feel toward their children. . .\r\n\r\nBut it occurred to me that it was certainly due you that if I\r\ncalculated on doing anything which might look as if it would\r\ndirectly or indirectly put a burden on Andrew and overload him,\r\nyou should have an opportunity to judge. . .\r\n\r\nAlso that you should know what was intended before you might\r\napprove such a step and possibly have in mind some plan for them\r\nof your own, with which mine might conflict.\r\n\r\nOr that perhaps you would advise something different, in which I\r\ncould cooperate with you. . .\r\n\r\nThere has been a little hope on their part that there could be a\r\nJune wedding; but I know they wish to be governed by your and my\r\napproval. At least from Aura May's remarks from time to time, I\r\nfeel that they are perplexed as to whether they would be\r\nconsidered rash or unwise to even set the time at all,\r\nparticularly as it appears they have not come up to my second\r\nstipulation as to his income. I used it about 18 months ago, when\r\nhe asked for my consent to their engagement, and I have not been\r\nasked to change, so I guess they placed more stress on it than I\r\nintended; but before I modify it, if that is the greatest\r\nbarrier, I concluded to write you, as to your approval of my\r\nplans, and your judgment.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, we all know that what it costs a young\r\ncouple to live all depends on their health and their\r\ninclinations. Aura May is exceptionally practical, and with no\r\nheavier expense for rent than my plan contemplates I think if\r\nAndrew has the prospects of moderate living expenses, it is\r\nputting them to rather hard lines if they are waiting to meet my\r\nearly stipulations.\r\n\r\nBut I don't want to do anything to hurry them if you feel with\r\nyour knowledge of conditions there that my plan or their marriage\r\nthis summer sometime (perhaps as soon as a lot can be secured and\r\nhouse built and ready for them) is not wise. . .\r\n\r\nI have read the above to Mrs. Sawyer and she approves my sending\r\nit and joins me in good wishes . . .\r\nVery Sincerely,\r\nF. P. Sawyer\r\n\r\n(The reply made by Pap's father is not known, but the house was\r\nnot built that summer, and the wedding did not take place for\r\nalmost another two years)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II: THE WILL ROGERS OF HOOSIER POLITICS--1913-1930\r\n\r\nPap was developing a successful law practice, but this was not\r\nenough to satisfy his extrovert nature. He decided to go into\r\npolitics. And it became a long-term commitment. Between 1913 and\r\n1951, Pap attended every session of the Indiana Legislature,\r\neither as a member or a lobbyist. He was elected to the House in\r\n1913 and 1915, following with two six-year terms in the Senate.\r\nIn 1927, he was Minority Floor Speaker for the Senate. He was\r\nnever defeated in any of his races for the Legislature, which\r\nspoke well for a Democrat running in a predominantly Republican\r\ndistrict. Pap's bipartisan equanimity as well as his developing\r\nsense of humor was reflected in a letter of recommendation on\r\nbehalf of a young Republican who had the good sense to vote\r\nDemocratic.\r\n\r\nPublic speaking goes with politicking, and Pap developed a flair\r\nfor this too. He was much in demand as a speaker before service\r\nclubs and other organizations, and his light-hearted, homespun\r\npopulist style was even compared to that of the great Will\r\nRogers. Anecdotes of life in small-town Russellville figured\r\nlarge in his material. The letter titled, \"Hazards of Trying a\r\nComeback\" is an example--this lengthy epistle was by way of an\r\napology for not being able to appear in person before a group,\r\nbut a version of it was undoubtedly spun from a podium or two on\r\nother occasions.\r\n\r\nPap's sense of humor, generously tinged with irony, found other\r\noutlets as well, including a gibe at a company that was making a\r\nbig deal over a small bill. But he could also be serious, such as\r\nwhen he wrote advice to the jailed son of an old friend.\r\n\r\nAs the years went by, Pap found politics and public speaking more\r\ntime-consuming and less-rewarding, particularly when faced with\r\nthe obligations--financial and otherwise--of raising a growing\r\nfamily. He did not choose to seek re-election upon the expiration\r\nof his second Senatorial term, in 1929.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROOF OF FITNESS\r\n\r\nGreencastle, Indiana\r\nMarch 29, 1915\r\nHonorable John W. Kern\r\nWashington, D.C.\r\n\r\nMy dear Senator Kern:\r\nIn behalf of Joseph R. Lloyd, of this city, who informs me you\r\nsuggested that he get his Representative (among others) to\r\naddress you concerning his desires, I am taking this opportunity\r\nto make a plea that you recommend him for admittance to the U.S.\r\nMilitary School at West Point.\r\n\r\nYou know, Senator Kern, I sometimes wonder if a letter of\r\nrecommendation is a knock or a boost in these days of wholesale\r\nrecommendations, they have become so easy to obtain. . .\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, there arise occasions where it is a real\r\npleasure to recommend deserving young men . . .\r\n\r\nAs proof conclusive he cannot go far wrong after setting himself\r\nright this early in life in the face of adverse precept and\r\nprecedent, I can only say Mr. Lloyd comes from one of the largest\r\nand most influential Republican families in Putnam County, and\r\nyet, last Fall (his first vote), he voted the straight Democratic\r\nticket from top to bottom.\r\n\r\nI am sure you will agree with me: If all the above be true, and\r\nour young friend is unable to meet the full requirements of West\r\nPoint for admission .. . . the Academy should be abolished.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHO'S WASTEFUL NOW?\r\n\r\nAugust 13, 1917\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Sawyer:\r\n. . . I am very much obliged for the invitation out, but I can't\r\nget away. We will have a special Session of the Legislature, it\r\nnow seems almost certain. . . The coal situation is acute in this\r\nState, and it is for relieving that situation the reason is given\r\nfor calling a special session. . . I'll venture a guess, it won't\r\nbe for the purpose of coal legislation, but on the other hand we\r\nwill have to fight out again Governor Goodrich's pet Excise Tax\r\nBill, and for additional appropriations for state institutions.\r\nThe former I'm opposed to; the latter I am not. Only the latter\r\ncomes with ill grace. Goodrich, in his opening campaign speech,\r\nwhich was delivered in Greencastle, charged the Democrats with\r\ncriminal wastefulness of the state's money, especially in the\r\nmaintenance of the state institutions. And he made his whole\r\ncampaign on that one issue--Economy. Now I learn from Dr.\r\nEdenharter, Superintendent of Central Hospital for Insane, that\r\nfor the first time in his experience as Superintendent during a\r\nperiod of 26 years, there is a deficit--and a large one--in his\r\nmaintenance fund for that institution. The real reason is\r\nobvious: things have advanced so in price. I forgot to say too,\r\nthat our appropriation this time for The Central Hospital was\r\nlarger than it ever was. All in all, our General Appropriation\r\nBill was $1,250,000 larger than it was two years ago, and our\r\nSpecific Appropriation was $250,000 larger. I know, because I was\r\non the Ways and Means Committee both years. It all goes to show\r\nthat what a fellow uses to get in on don't always turn out to be\r\njust as he would have you believe. . .\r\n\r\n\r\nSENATORIAL ASPIRANT\r\n\r\nJune 20, 1918\r\nMr. Sam D\r\nWingate, Ind.\r\n\r\nDear Sam:\r\nAlong with a vast concourse of other office seekers, I attended\r\nthe Democratic State Convention at Indianapolis yesterday, and\r\ngot my hide again saturated with Jeffersonian and Jacksonian\r\ndoctrine. . .\r\n\r\nOf course, I called around on the Montgomery County Delegation to\r\nallow them a chance to give the \"once over\" on what they were\r\nreasonably expected to cast their franchises for State Senator\r\nfor this Fall. As I told you some time ago, I'm a candidate for\r\nState Senator from Montgomery and Putnam Counties, and the Lord\r\nknows I want it and need it. Want it even more than Noah T--\r\nwanted to be J.P. at Veedersburg.\r\n\r\nSome time when I'm over in your bailiwick, I want to look you up\r\nand get a little advice if you won't mind giving it to me. Don't\r\nsuppose you'd mind doing that.\r\n\r\nEvery once in a while I make an inquiry about \"Red\" Purnell and\r\nthey all say he's doing fine. He sure is a mighty loyal friend.\r\nHis job never swelled him even so much as a urine ant bite would.\r\nI want to go over to see him one of these times, and see just how\r\nlong it would take me to find the Capitol building.\r\n\r\nHe and I took our first trip to New York City together. We got\r\nthe roofs of our mouths sun burned. . .\r\nAs ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nEMBARRASSING MOMENT\r\n\r\nApril 16, 1921\r\nChicago Tribune\r\nChicago, Illinois\r\n\r\nGentlemen:\r\nIt happened only recently during the warm spell. I was in St.\r\nLouis, and by chance, met an old school friend who I had not seen\r\nsince we were boys in Military School together. With him were the\r\nfemale members of his family, and a large part of their feminine\r\nacquaintances it would seem. After introductions and\r\nfelicitations all around, it so happened another former cadet of\r\nthe same Correctional Institution was passing in an auto when my\r\nfriend hailed him and called my attention to the fact that a\r\nbrother Shriner whom I ought to know was approaching. Imbued with\r\nthe spirit of the Order, I stepped to the curb at the point of\r\nhighest visibility to my pedestrian party, and started a most\r\nelaborate and obsequious salaam--when suddenly and without\r\nwarning, the posterior warp and woof of my trousers gave way into\r\na jagged 14-inch Maltese Cross with the suddenness of the dam at\r\nthe Johnstown Flood.\r\n\r\nIf the remuneration for submitting this is in proportion to the\r\nhumiliation and mental pain and anguish suffered, the Tribune\r\nCorporation will pass its next quarterly dividend.\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE 75 CENT MYSTERY BILL\r\n\r\nMarch 3, 1922\r\nThe W. H. Anderson Co.\r\n524 Main Street\r\nCincinnati, Ohio\r\n\r\nGentlemen:\r\nI am just in receipt from you of a statement for 75 cents\r\nprefixed with \"Balance as per Last Statement\", and underneath and\r\nto one side of the figures is a sort of Odd Fellows hand with\r\nthumb extended parallel to the open fingers, and \"if you please\"\r\ninscribed on the palm thereof.\r\n\r\nFor the life of me I don't know what that balance is for. The\r\nonly thing I can remember having bought from you was away back\r\nthere about the first time Bryan ran, it seems to me. I ordered,\r\nand paid cash at the time of purchase, a set of Watson's Works\r\nPractice and Forms. Part of the set was to be delivered at once\r\n(and it was) and the balance in a short time thereafter. Well,\r\ntime wore on, the horse was supplanted by the automobile,\r\ncongress shoes were relegated to the attic. . . Sometime during\r\nthis time, which we will call the \"Elizabethan Period\" of this\r\ntransaction, to my utter consternation, I received another volume\r\nof this important Work. I was delighted, as the clear and fresh\r\nblue of the volume brightened up the general drab of those other\r\nvolumes that had come to me long before. . .\r\n\r\nAgain, time wore on. Grover Cleveland and his Memorial Day\r\nfishing trips were discussed less and less by adverse\r\npoliticians, . . . telephones came into universal use, Cole\r\nYounger was released from the Stillwater Prison; . . . George\r\nBlake, one of our local inventive geniuses, set in motion in his\r\ndowntown basement his perpetual motion machine, that when once\r\ngot in motion was only stilled when it disintegrated and tore out\r\nhis east brick wall and scattered cogs, wheels and shafts over a\r\nradius of two blocks; . . . when, lo!--another and last volume\r\nmade its appearance, making my set . . . complete. What more\r\ncould I ask, except to fervently regret that they all did not get\r\nhere before mine eyes were dimmed, mine step halting, and my hand\r\npalsied?\r\n\r\nBut, I see I have become reminiscent, as old men will. . .\r\n\r\nWhat I wanted to ask in this letter is for information about what\r\nthis bill is for? If it had been a REMITTANCE OF 75 CENTS, I\r\nwould presume it was accumulated interest at 2 cents per decade\r\non my original investment in the set paid years ago, and that you\r\nhad relented and were quietly paying me off in a depreciated\r\ncurrency, with the hope I would accept it and say nothing.\r\n\r\nBut it is a demand, and I am therefore at complete loss to\r\naccount for it. It might be for the postage on that set extending\r\nthrough all these years. On the other hand I do not believe it is\r\nthat for two reasons: I dimly recall when I bought the set, and\r\npaid cash in advance, that covered all charges; and second, if it\r\nwere for postage, the accumulated interest I would owe you by\r\nlapse of time would be in an amount far in excess of the 75 cents\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\nPlease enlighten me.\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COMMITTEE ON SKY LIGHTS?\r\n\r\nDecember 6, 1922\r\nHonorable Emmett E. Branch\r\nLieutenant Governor\r\nMartinsville, Indiana\r\n\r\nMy dear Governor,\r\nI have your \"epistle to the Corinthians\" of recent date\r\nconcerning committee assignments for the coming session of the\r\nLegislature, and desire to thank you for the opportunity of\r\nsuggesting my preference.\r\n\r\nI had read in the Indianapolis paper where the Messrs. C--, H--\r\nand C-- had met with you for the palpable purpose of putting us\r\ndown-trodden and foot-sore Democrats where we could do a minimum\r\nof harm, and so I went over yesterday--the State Committee was\r\nscheduled to meet--for the purpose of interviewing those\r\ndelectable gentlemen to see if I were not scheduled as the\r\nranking Democrat of the Committee on Sky Lights and Ventilation.\r\n\r\nThe sessions I was a member of the House, I was on the Ways and\r\nMeans, Railroad and Banking Committees. . . My fitness for the\r\nabove committees is striking. The expenditure of money always\r\nappealed to me, as I have had little of my own to expend, and\r\nnaturally those of us in that class like to see the other\r\nfellow's go. As an authority on railroads, I met the 5 o'clock\r\np.m. train at Russellville regularly for years and years; not\r\nthat I expected guests, but it was the custom of the town, so I\r\nhave an intimate knowledge of the stopping and starting of\r\ntrains. I was \"connected\" with the Russellville Bank from the\r\nages of 8 to about 18 (\"Connected\" has a variety of meanings.\r\n\"Red\" Purnell, now in Congress from the 9th District, and I\r\nroomed together during a part of our college careers at I.U. I\r\nheard much of his \"girl\" back at Veedersburg, whose father, Red\r\nfreely confessed, was \"connected\" with the Cloverleaf Railroad.\r\nSome years later, I learned the good man was Section Boss at that\r\npoint). My \"connection\" with Russellville Bank was spent\r\nprincipally in a janitorial capacity, and the balancing of pass\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nAnd so, in the full knowledge there are 33 of you and one of me,\r\nbut that I have truth and justice on my side, and my trust is in\r\nthe Lieutenant Governor, I must stay where you place me and be\r\ncontent, except that I do hope the Committee on Swamp Lands is\r\nfull to overflowing . . .\r\nVery respectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nWAXING POETIC OVER FIRST LOVE\r\n\r\nNovember 24, 1925\r\nIthaca Gun Company\r\nIthica, New York\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nI am sending you by parcel post the barrels of an Ithica\r\nhammerless shot gun, No. 29438, I must have bought 30 years ago\r\nor more when a very small boy. . .\r\n\r\nIt was the pride of my younger life. I have slept with it in\r\nsheer delight, and for fear it would be stolen. For years not a\r\npin point of rust marred its gloriously shining barrels; the\r\nstock shone as does the throne of Allah from being gone over\r\nhundreds of times lovingly and tenderly with silk and wool, oil\r\nand polish. Its shooting prowess--it made the fur fly out of\r\nunsuspecting rabbits before Bryan built his crown of thorns and\r\ncross of gold; it sought the tender spots in ambitious fox\r\nsquirrels when automobiles were as scarce as we Democrats are\r\nnow; it has shot at everything from a beer bottle to a chicken-\r\nthief, and never failed or refused to respond.\r\n\r\nThe number of this gun was burned in my memory so unforgettably\r\nthat today it came to me as doth the lamb the ewe. And while I do\r\nnot know when the Magna Charta was wrung from King John, yet this\r\nnumeral remains with me--yesterday, today and to the ages.\r\n\r\nBut evil days are come. The unrelenting grip of time has forced a\r\nfingerhold. Disintegration shows, for the first time, its hydra-\r\nhead. When it happened, or how, I do not know, but only today, in\r\nremoving it from its case preparatory to a hunt on the morrow, I\r\nfound the rib split at the muzzle--and so, I must forego my\r\nbiennial hunt.\r\n\r\nLook it over and fix it up. You will probably have a bill for\r\nservices. Send it on and if I haven't gone into bankruptcy\r\nkeeping kool with Coolidge during these most damnably hard times,\r\nI'll try to splice enough money together to meet your demands. . .\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nADVICE IN A CUSTODY BATTLE\r\n\r\nMay 19, 1926\r\nMr. J----,\r\nHot Springs, Arkansas\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\nI have given the matter of the custody and control of your boy\r\nsome thought. . . In Indiana the general rule of law is that the\r\nfather of a minor is entitled to the custody of his child or\r\nchildren . . . even as against the child's legal guardian--which\r\nhappens to be the fact in your case. As I understand it, Mr. A--\r\nwas appointed guardian of your boy in this court. Your letter\r\npretty positively asserts that you never at any time, either\r\nverbally or in writing, released such right.\r\n\r\nI find that the courts have pretty generally taken the view that\r\nthe welfare of the child is the paramount matter. If it can be\r\nshown that the father is not a fit or suitable person or not able\r\nfinancially to support such child, then the courts will step in.\r\nAs I understand the situation, neither of these affect you\r\nadversely. . . To me it seems, under the circumstances, most\r\ndeplorable, or rather unfortunate that the A--s have taken such a\r\nfancy to the boy, and are unwilling now to give him up. He is a\r\nvery fine boy, I am told, and will make a fine man. But I cannot\r\nsee their position, and fail to get their angle.\r\n\r\nIn the event that you determine to bring a writ of habeas corpus\r\nproceeding for your boy, you must make good preparations in\r\nadvance. You must be prepared to show the court most forcibly\r\nthat you are a fit person to keep him; that your wife is anxious\r\nto have him, that you are amply able to support and school him;\r\nthat you are not financially cramped, and all that sort of thing.\r\nIt will take witnesses, and good ones. . . As a tip I might say\r\nthat Mr. H-- of this city is somewhere in Hot Springs now, in one\r\nof the hotels or sanitariums, I presume. I would say absolutely\r\nnothing to him about the trouble over the boy, but I would make a\r\nspecial effort to have him out to the house and let it get to him\r\nthat your people are good people and financially able, and that\r\nyou have a good home, and favorable surroundings, etc. Make a\r\nfriend of him, and later we might use him advantageously. The B--\r\ns go down there in Arkansas somewhere. Keep an eye for the\r\nGreencastle people, and if convenient let them all see how you\r\nare fixed. You know what I mean.\r\n\r\nI sympathize with you in your trouble. If such a condition came\r\nto me I would be fighting mad. But we must absolutely refrain\r\nfrom showing any anger. That weakens a man's case.\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nNO CHARGE\r\n\r\nGreencastle, Indiana\r\nMarch 16, 1927\r\nHonorable E. Harold Van Orman\r\nLieutenant Governor of Indiana Evansville, Indiana\r\n\r\nMy dear Van:\r\nI am just in receipt of a copy of your \"epistle\". . .\r\n\r\nI want to move that the latter part of your fifth paragraph be\r\nmade more specific--that part pertaining to the extension of the\r\nhospitality of your hotel. Does that mean with or without\r\nremuneration? And whether or not it means the invitee's family? A\r\nfavorable construction on your part might lead to the culmination\r\nof our going en masse next Summer on a pilgrimage . . .\r\n\r\nFinally, I would advise you that we are safely ensconced at 309\r\nE. Seminary Street, this city, and in your seeking the Primary\r\nsuffrages of the Putnam County and Greencastle constituency for\r\nGubernatorial preferences, we would urgently convey the knowledge\r\nthat our palatial home is in the exact center of the City and a\r\nhouse to house canvass can be most advantageously made, using our\r\nmanse as a radius--with our compliments (Meaning, in the\r\nvernacular, \"no charge\").\r\nAs ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COSTS OF PUBLIC OFFICE\r\n\r\nDecember 21, 1927\r\nMr. James D. Wilson\r\nNew Richmond, Indiana\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Wilson:\r\nI am in receipt of your very considerate letter. . .\r\n\r\nIt is a satisfaction to hear now and then that one has the\r\napproval and support of the people who gave him his job--\r\nespecially in a legislative way. . . It is so much harder to\r\noppose money spending than it is to support it--so much more\r\ndifficult to fight the creation of new boards, commissions and\r\nbureaus than it is to aid in bringing them into existence. And\r\nthe crowd or lobby or whatever you call it who are fostering\r\nthese expenditures always on hand during the Session to make it\r\nhot and unpleasant for anyone who opposes them, while the people\r\nwho have to pay most of the bill are back home so busily engaged\r\nfighting clods, weather and pests, in order to get enough money\r\nahead to pay these additional taxes, they haven't time to be\r\nloafing around a Legislative Session. . .\r\n\r\nAs to my being a candidate for re-election again, I doubt it,\r\nalthough I most sincerely appreciate your offer of support. That\r\nis what elected me--Republican support. But the truth is, as much\r\nas I like Legislative work .. . . if I continue in politics, I\r\nought to try for an office that pays more money. I am in very\r\nmoderate circumstances, financially; have a family of six\r\nchildren, five of them girls, and the oldest a girl ready for\r\ncollege next year, and you probably know what that means. Some\r\nthink I was grandstanding and getting ready to run again, when I\r\nsent that $292 back to the State. But it wasn't at all. I sent it\r\nback simply because it was absolutely and unqualifiedly un-\r\nConstitutional, regardless of what our State Supreme Court says;\r\nand for the further reasons that I was elected knowing my salary\r\nwould be $6 per day, that I had opposed salary increases during\r\nthe term of office all my legislative career and could see no\r\ngood excuse for exempting myself from that rule, and for the\r\nfurther reason that our agricultural interests were in such a\r\ndeplorable condition they couldn't be asked to stand any salary\r\nincrease--however much I needed, or would have liked to have it\r\nmyself. And I hear that by reason of my having sent the excess\r\nsalary back I have incurred the displeasure of a considerable\r\nnumber of my Democratic colleagues, who expect to try to see to\r\nit that I am not re-elected Dem. Floor Leader next Session. And\r\nso it goes. . .\r\nMost Respectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS OPINIONS CARRY WEIGHT\r\n\r\n(Excerpt from a letter sent by Indiana State Forester R. F.\r\nWilcox to Charles Barnaby, of Greencastle, March 11, 1929)\r\n\r\nThe Senate passed our LaFuze Bill which appropriates $100,000 a\r\nyear to this Department for our nursery program and acquiring\r\nland for state forests. This means great things for the future\r\nlumber industries of the state, and of course all of the citizens\r\nof Indiana. . .\r\n\r\nDuring the discussion, when the boys were getting away off the\r\ntrack, pro and con, Senator Durham demanded the floor and made a\r\nstatement which carried more weight than all the other arguments\r\nput together. He said that Charlie Barnaby had been in the lumber\r\nbusiness for 40 years and probably knew more about hardwood trees\r\nthan anyone else in the country. . . He said you wrote him that\r\nthis positively was a good bill and they had better take your\r\nadvice and pass it. Senator Durham discriminates very closely, I\r\nhave noticed, in the matter of legislation. . . and I have\r\nnoticed that the other members of the Senate give his opinions\r\nserious consideration. You are to be congratulated on having such\r\na splendid man to represent you.\r\n\r\n\r\nAS GOOD AS WILL ROGERS\r\n\r\n(Excerpt from the Service Club Grenade, newsletter of the Service\r\nClub of Indianapolis, Feb. 16, 1929)\r\n\r\nWe confess our inability to make even a pretense of reporting the\r\ntalk given the club last Monday by Senator Durham. It was\r\nunderstood that the senator hailed from Greencastle, but this was\r\nan error. His home is in Russellville, where according to his own\r\nadmission, there \"ain't a golf ball or a pair of pajamas in the\r\nwhole damn town.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Durham is one of \"God's Chosen Minority,\" as he himself\r\nadmits. Invitations to speak before this club and that led him to\r\nbelieve for a while that he was an orator, but he finally came to\r\nthe conclusion that demands for his public appearance were made\r\nbecause, as a Democrat, he was quite a curiosity.\r\n\r\nGive Senator Durham a wad of gum and a rope, and he would be as\r\ngood as his fellow Democrat, Will Rogers. He entertained the\r\nclub, had everybody in an uproar, for a full half hour with his\r\ntales about the characters in his home town.\r\n\r\nThose who stayed away Monday missed one of the most enjoyable\r\nmeetings we have had in a long time, even if the Lincoln Hotel\r\nlost no money on the lunch.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HAZARDS OF TRYING A COME-BACK\r\n\r\nGreencastle, Indiana\r\nJuly 2, 1930\r\nMr. Claud E. Fix\r\nShelbyville, Indiana\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Fix:\r\nI received your very kind letter of May 30th, relative to a\r\nproposed oratorical \"come back\" on my part before a Shelbyville\r\naudience. I say \"come back\" because I was the alleged speaker of\r\nthe evening with the Shelbyville Rotary Club in May of this year.\r\nIt may happen you have heard of that disaster, and are charitably\r\ngiving me an opportunity to redeem myself in the eyes of\r\nShelbyville people. Your surname indicates such. . .\r\n\r\nExperience has taught me a repetition is generally more dangerous\r\neven than a first offense. It is in law, and it generally is in\r\nother things. Let me illustrate from my own experience.\r\n\r\nYears ago, my home town, Russellville, Indiana, had a home talent\r\ncompany. In fact, we have had many of them. The town and\r\ncommunity was surfeited with them. The epidemic would break out,\r\ndie down, and then break out afresh. Warner Kinkead was the cause\r\nof most of it. Warner was our self-imposed \"leading man\" on all\r\nand every occasion. For one thing, he was a bit older, but his\r\nprincipal claim to \"stardom\" was due to the fact he had spent two\r\nyears away from Russellville, and was therefore more\r\nsophisticated and worldly-wise. The rest of us had ventured no\r\nfarther than an annual pilgrimage to Crawfordsville for the\r\nCounty Fair. . .\r\n\r\nWarner's parents had emigrated to Kansas. The second year the\r\ngrasshoppers \"took them,\" with the result they all came back to\r\nRussellville, and along with Warner came a \"make-up\" box which he\r\nhad in some manner acquired, together with a yearning for a\r\ntheatrical career. Therefore, he was an actor, none could\r\nsuccessfully dispute. He had the evidence. Warner put on many\r\nhome talents, advertised under the auspices of the Rathbon's\r\nSisters, the Mt. Pisgah Aid Society or other neighborhood\r\norganizations.\r\n\r\nFrom a comparatively modest beginning, we aspired to greater\r\nthings--harder plays and more cast. Warner soon learned the more\r\nthere were in the cast, the more doting fathers and mothers,\r\naunts and uncles, would turn out in the audience to see and\r\nadmire his uncanny histrionic abilities.\r\n\r\nEventually, we assayed a tragedy--an unavailing struggle against\r\nfate. \"Sea Drift\" was the name of our first--and last--tragedy.\r\nThe climax was to come in the 8th or 9th Scene of the 10th or\r\n12th Act, when in point of actual time it would be after midnight\r\nand our remaining audience (those who, of necessity, had to stay\r\nto take 95% of the cast home in time to help with breakfast or\r\nthe milking) either somnolent or clear \"gone.\"\r\n\r\nThe script went like this: The heroine is stranded on a bit of\r\ndriftwood far out on the storm-tossed sea. From the lighthouse\r\nthe startling cry rings out: \"A fair maiden in dire peril in the\r\nsea beyond the breakers! Oh, Oh! Who will save her?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will save her, or lose my life!\" responds the hero (Warner),\r\nwho thereupon hurls himself into the angry waves from a beetling\r\ncliff. A fearful struggle ensues between man and watery elements\r\n(ably aided and abetted by several bucketsful of real water from\r\nthe wings). The maiden is rescued and brought to shore, but for\r\nsome reason known only to the author the effort is too much for\r\nthe hero. With a choked and exhausted murmur, \"Call her Sea\r\nDrift. She is God's gift from the sea,\" he then and there expires\r\nfrom overexertion and exposure.\r\n\r\nThis called for an ocean scene--a considerable of an ocean scene--\r\nand none of us had ever seen it. But we had read geographies and\r\nseen pictures, and Uncle Bud Nichols had several stereopticon\r\nviews of the ocean at its worst. The Clodfelter girls sewed long\r\nstrips of sheeting together and Jess Carrington, our local barn\r\npainter, painted the result of their labors to look like what he,\r\nin his artistic mind, thought the sea ought to look like. We\r\nborrowed two hand-power blacksmith's bellows from Fred Fink's\r\nblacksmith shop to put at either wing, and under the loosely-laid\r\nsheeting. The bellows pumped air underneath, thus causing\r\nundulation after undulation, making what we though was a most\r\nrealistic semblance of the ocean in active operation. My\r\nparticular part, among others, in this theatrical venture, was to\r\noperate one of these bellows, and operate it like \"hell,\" as\r\nWarner said, at the proper time.\r\n\r\nA few of our props and effects are worthy of mention: the\r\nlighthouse was built from four round old time banana shipping\r\ncrates fastened end to end, with a lantern from the livery stable\r\nhanging cheerily in the top. . . David Henry Burton, local\r\ninventor, hooked up immense quantities of old baling wire to some\r\nsort of wooden structure representing the driftwood the heroine\r\nwas to cling to so perilously, in such a way that when Jude\r\nGlover, concealed beneath the ocean, turned the handle of a lop\r\nsided grindstone, the \"driftwood\" and beautiful maiden clinging\r\nthereon would bob up and down. A hand cornsheller shelling corn\r\ninto a tin bucket emitted most of the noises we thought an ocean\r\nwould make on an occasion like that.\r\n\r\nShep Wilson, who could bark like a dog, and who, it was said, did\r\ngo with a show one whole summer in that capacity, and who,\r\nconcealed in the corn field out alongside Hebron School House,\r\ndid scare the little girls almost into hysterics one afternoon,\r\nlent us generously of his caninal talents.\r\n\r\nEventually, we eventuated into the Big Scene--the maiden was\r\nadrift, the cry of alarm rang out.\r\n\r\n\"I will save her or lose my life,\" quoth Warner, in a voice that\r\nsounded like an auctioneer at a farm sale. Jerking off his coat,\r\nhe plunged into the raging sea. Buffeted by the angry waves, he\r\ncrawled to the fair maiden. He grasped her tenderly and started\r\nfor the shore. Midst the noise of the corn-sheller, the barking\r\nof the dog, the efforts of the bucketeers and bellowsmen, and\r\nencouraging cries from on shore, his foot caught in a seam of the\r\nsheeting, ripping up about two yards of the ocean. The air we had\r\nso industriously pumped in, rushed out at the rent. The sea\r\ncollapsed. The corn-sheller ceased shelling. The barking dog and\r\nfrenzied shore cries were hushed. A dead silence fell until some\r\nsacrilegious individual in the audience whispered loudly, \"It's a\r\nmiracle boys; he's walking on the sea.\" . . . Some good Samaritan\r\nfinally got the curtain down.\r\n\r\nBut what I started out to illustrate was the mistake we made--I\r\nmean the big mistake. We had advertised \"Sea Drift\" for two\r\nnights, thereby giving our second night's audience an opportunity\r\nto get ready for us--which they did in due and ancient form, as\r\nwill be quickly sensed. A shame, since as a whole, the show\r\nprobably progressed more smoothly the second night--up to the Big\r\nScene--which was never finished.\r\n\r\nLater on, the male part of the cast met on the bench in front of\r\nSam Brown's meat market to talk it over, and inquire of Warner\r\nhow he was getting along. His talk was short and much to the\r\npoint: \"Boys, we're not appreciated, and they needn't never ask\r\nme to put on a play in this town again. . . I didn't mind the\r\ntomatoes, or the potatoes much--or even the eggs--could see 'em\r\ncoming and dodge 'em. But I would like to know the SOB who threw\r\nthat china door knob.\"\r\n\r\nI presume you see my point by this time concerning a second\r\neffort in Shelbyville--oratorically.\r\n\r\nSeriously, I . . . shall have to refuse your very kind offer. My\r\nfather-in-law has been very low for months. He lives in\r\nPennsylvania. My wife was called to Pennsylvania by the family,\r\nwho thought the end was about come. . .and I shall have to hold\r\nmyself in readiness to go at any time.\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nSWAMPED\r\n\r\nGreencastle, Indiana\r\nOct. 2, 1929\r\nMr. D. Ray Higgins\r\n937 Illinois Building\r\nIndianapolis, Indiana\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\nI have your very kind letter inviting me to make the talk before\r\nthe Shrine Club. . . I should be delighted to make whatever talk\r\nI could, but the truth is I am sort of swamped in a small way\r\nwith things of that nature. I am having some important cases\r\ntried this month, and I just must get ready for them. . . There\r\nmust be an epidemic of Masonic meetings, or rather dinners, just\r\nat this time. I had a call yesterday from Terre Haute for a\r\nsimilar purpose, and last Saturday one from Logansport.\r\n\r\nNow the truth is, and I told the other parties this same thing, I\r\nam more than rusty on Masonry. . . What talks I make are nearly\r\nalways directed toward the Legislature, or some sort of politics,\r\nand are more in the nature of fun along those lines than serious\r\nstuff.\r\n\r\nMr. Cooper, whom you know, has very kindly put me on the program\r\nat a National Meeting of Insurance Men for the 10th, and the Lord\r\nknows I don't know anything about insurance, except to pay the\r\npremiums when I can get the money scraped together.\r\n\r\nAnd so if you will kindly excuse me for the present, and then,\r\nafter consulting . . . on my real inability to make an\r\ninteresting Shrine talk, if you all still want me, perhaps we can\r\nget together at some other time.\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nADVICE TO A YOUNG PRISONER\r\n\r\nGreencastle, Indiana\r\nOct. 1, 1929\r\nMr. Harold M--, #6347\r\nWashington State Reformatory\r\nMonroe, Washington\r\n\r\nMy dear Harold,\r\nThe writer of this letter may be unknown to you, although the\r\nchances are you know, or have heard of me. Anyway, your mother\r\nand I grew up together, girl and boy. I knew your grandfather and\r\ngrandmother--fine, fine, old pioneer folks. . .\r\n\r\nI am not only the boyhood friend of your mother, but have also\r\nprobably done all her legal work here. And so, in view of all of\r\nthis, and for other reasons, I am quite naturally interested in\r\nyou and your welfare. . . I have tried to find out the facts in\r\nyour case, and probably have them fairly straight. . .\r\n\r\nNow, Harold, of course we both realize you have done wrong--very\r\nwrong in fact--and you are paying the penalty to society for that\r\nwrong doing. But do it like a good sport--like a good loser--and\r\nnot be a whiner or welcher. . . Do not imagine that I am a\r\nmaudlin and mouldy old lawyer, or that I am magnifying the error\r\nyou made, because such is not the case. I come in contact with\r\nthis sort of condition all the time. I realize that what you did\r\nwill be done again and again in the future by others. What I\r\ninsist is that it shall never again happen to you. I know there\r\nare those associated with you now who are fools enough to\r\nmaintain an air of bravado about them, and pretend they have been\r\nwronged by society . . . and they go about here and there telling\r\nwhat they are going to do when they get out, and how they're\r\nnever going to get caught again. That type is hopeless and\r\nutterly worthless, but their greatest trouble is that they lack\r\nbrains. They prate about this and that rich man breaking the law\r\nand getting by with it; or this and that bootlegger or what not,\r\nhas a pull, or has the authorities bought and paid for, or is too\r\nsmooth to get caught. All of which is 90% bosh. Confirmed crooks\r\nare never smart. They invariably . . . get caught. Why? Because\r\nthere are smarter and shrewder men after them than they are, and\r\nso, the smarter man wins.\r\n\r\nAnd all the time, the crook is a restless and furtive fugitive,\r\nnever feeling safe and secure . . . and never knowing what the\r\nnext hour will bring; never having any peace of mind; and never\r\nhaving any respect for himself.\r\n\r\nI am not talking about the boy who, due to youth and\r\ninexperience, or stress of circumstances, or in a spirit of half\r\nexcitement, picks a pocket, or sells some hooch, or steals a\r\nwatch. . . You come of the right stock. The big thing for you, or\r\nanyone else who has made a mistake, is to get the right mental\r\nattitude toward that mistake. When a fellow finds he is wrong,\r\nreverse then and there. Don't wait and don't try to \"bull it\r\nthrough\". . . and make friends, not enemies, of the reformatory\r\nauthorities. You will be surprised, yes, amazed, to learn how\r\nbadly they want to be friendly with you. . . Show by your actions\r\nand attitude that you realize your mistake, study hard to fit\r\nyourself for life after you get out, don't whine or complain,\r\ndon't sulk or slight your work. Brighten and cheer up. And for\r\nGod's sake, prove you're a man and not a coward, because all\r\nconfirmed criminals are cowards, without exception. . .\r\n\r\nFor your information, and to play square with you, I think within\r\nthe year I shall write your warden or someone, asking how you are\r\ngetting along and what sort of young fellow you are, because he\r\nwill know, and I hope and trust my good opinion of you will be\r\nverified.\r\n\r\nAnd so, why is it, Harold, that I am taking my time away from my\r\nbusiness, and writing you this long and rather rambling letter?\r\nSurely, I can have no motive of personal profit in it. No, it is\r\nto let you know that not only me but thousands of people all over\r\nthis big, free country are interested in you and anxious for you\r\nand those others of you who have made a slip, all of us hoping\r\nand trusting and many praying for your welfare. So don't think\r\nyou are friendless or forgotten, or ostracized. And each day and\r\nevery hour and conscious moment, never lose sight of the fact\r\nthat your coming away from there with the right attitude, the\r\ncorrect vision, and firm determination of rectitude of future\r\nconduct, depends solely on you.\r\n\r\nWrite me sometime.\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nA LONG WAY FROM HOME\r\n\r\nJuly 17, 1930\r\nHon. Harry N. Quigley, General Counsel\r\nC.C.C. & St. L. Railway Co.\r\n230 E. 9th St.\r\nCincinnati, Ohio\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\nI was in Houston, Texas, about two months ago on some business\r\nwith the Humble Oil Co. An old Chicago lawyer named Hait or Haut\r\nor something like that had business with the same company. . . It\r\nwas the time Houston was celebrating the fact they had come to be\r\nthe second city in size in the South--a gain of over 100% in ten\r\nyears. Parades. Newspaper head lines. Everybody talking \"Houston,\r\nHouston.\" We outsiders got a bit tired and bored with all the\r\ntalk. One of the vice presidents of the company took us riding\r\nand to see his country home, all the way out talking up Houston,\r\nand occasionally giving the old man a little peck about Chicago\r\nlawlessness, racketeers and gunmen.\r\n\r\nWe saw the house and flower gardens and then went to see his bird\r\ncollection. Our host took us to a big cage and pointed out a\r\nlong-necked bird of brilliant plumage, and said: \"That is a Bird\r\nof Paradise. What do you think of him?\"\r\n\r\nThe old lawyer replied: \"Well, I think he's a hell of a long ways\r\nfrom home.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a knockout.\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEMOCRATIC 'STRIKE' OF 1925\r\n\r\nOne of the most colorful escapades in the political history of\r\nthe Hoosier State took place in 1925. Pap, who represented Putnam\r\nand Montgomery Counties in the Indiana State Senate, was an\r\nenthusiastic and imaginative participant.\r\n\r\nThe spark was the proposed \"Penrod Bill\" (named for the Senator\r\nwho introduced it) which, not unlike legislation offered from\r\ntime to time even today, contained a hidden provision.\r\n\r\nThe bill (S.B. 300) proposed the transfer of a central Indiana\r\ncounty (Lawrence) from the Third U.S. Congressional District to\r\nthe Second. The invention was to make sure there would be\r\nsufficient Republicans in that district--Senator Penrod's--to\r\ninsure his election to Congress. Naturally, his good fortune\r\nwould have come at the expense of the Democrats.\r\n\r\nThe Indiana State Senate in 1925 was almost totally controlled by\r\nthe Republicans, but there was one small hitch. Unless a quorum\r\nwas present, no votes could be taken and no legislation could be\r\npassed--not just the offending Penrod bill, but any business at\r\nall. And there were just enough Democrats to threaten such a\r\n\"political blockade.\" As expected, the Republicans presented the\r\nPenrod Bill of Feb. 25.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats were prepared. Hastily, all fifteen of them who\r\nwere present (two others were ill and absent) \"bolted\" their\r\nlegal confines and took refuge in the neighboring state of Ohio.\r\nMost of the \"bolters\" made the trip in a bus rented ahead of\r\ntime. They wound up in Dayton, where they took up residence in a\r\nhotel owned, curiously, by Hoosier Lieut. Gov. Van Orman, a\r\nRepublican. In a \"spirit of bipartisanship,\" the latter\r\ntelegraphed the runaways to \"be my guest.\"\r\n\r\nAnother Democrat, Senator Harrison, left the next day secluded in\r\nan Overland Moving Van. Pap's transit was courtesy of his\r\nrailroad pass. The train deposited him in Cincinnati, and he went\r\non to Dayton from there.\r\n\r\nThe Minority Leader, Senator Joseph M. Cravens of Madison,\r\nIndiana, halted the escape bus briefly on its way to Ohio to\r\norder a barrel of apples to be forwarded to the Indiana Senate,\r\naccompanied by a note--\"Compliments of the Minority Members.\" The\r\nerudite Senator Cravens (known informally as \"Uncle Joe\") was the\r\nbachelor scion of perhaps the most distinguished and aristocratic\r\nfamilies in Indiana at that time.\r\n\r\nThe Indianapolis Star and other newspapers had a field day\r\ncovering the Democratic \"bolt,\" which brought official\r\nundertakings to a complete halt. Photos of all the \"strikers\"\r\nwere printed side by side almost as if they were fugitives in a\r\nrogues' gallery.\r\n\r\nA poignant victim of the escapade was the official \"Doorkeeper\"\r\nof the Senate, one Jerome K. Brown, who was ordered by the Senate\r\nleadership to go to Ohio and serve warrants for the arrest and\r\nreturn of the vagrants. Poor Doorkeeper Brown protested against\r\ngoing it alone, but to no avail. He arrived in Dayton 11:45 PM on\r\nthe 25th and served his warrants on the \"bolters\" in their rooms\r\nat the Gibbons Hotel. The warrants were ignored, but Brown was\r\ninvited to join a poker game in progress.\r\n\r\nThe Ohio governor and attorney-general pronounced that Indiana\r\narrest warrants were without official standing in Ohio (which\r\ncoincidentally was under a Democrat administration at the time.)\r\nThe governor furthermore invited the Hoosier \"strikers\" to stay\r\non in Ohio \"without being molested\" as long as they wished.\r\n\r\nSenator Cravens accepted the invitation \"with great pleasure--\r\nuntil the Penrod Bill is withdrawn.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Penrod countered firmly that nothing of that sort would\r\ntake place.\r\n\r\nThereafter the shenanigans increased as the plot thickened.\r\n\r\nThe Republican Majority in the Indiana Senate set about trying to\r\nfind a hale and hearty Democrat on Hoosier soil who could be\r\nlegally compelled to resume his seat. Pap's eldest daughter was\r\naccosted on her way home from school in Greencastle by a friendly\r\npair of men she had never seen before. She thought it a bit\r\nstrange, but all Hoosiers were unrestrictedly friendlier those\r\ndays. They got around to inquiring of Pap's whereabouts. When the\r\nfifteen-year-old reported the conversation later at home, her\r\nmother explained that Pap was \"just hiding out somewhere with his\r\nDemocratic friends.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Cravens' adroit public comments expressed regret for the\r\nlegislative drought, but noted, \"The Democratic Minority in the\r\nSenate has from the beginning done its best to aid in the passage\r\nof every constructive and economic measure brought before that\r\nbody. . . in the hope of benefitting the overburdened taxpayers\r\nof the state. Our only regret is that there have not been more\r\nmeasures of economic and constructive character to vote for. . .\"\r\nHe took the opportunity to expound on party grievances.\r\n\r\nThe Republicans threatened to call out the state militia and\r\nplace the matter before the Marion County Grand Jury, which they\r\nsaid might fine the runaways $1,000 and imprison them. Such\r\nthreats and the clumsy attempts to serve warrants or \"kidnap\" a\r\nDemocrat backfired, however, and became targets of public\r\nhilarity.\r\n\r\nThe papers made light of the fact that the Marion County Horse\r\nThief Detective Association was sworn in \"to watch for Senators\r\nwho might attempt to sneak back home to Indiana without being\r\ndetected.\"\r\n\r\nFaced with becoming a legislative laughing stock, the Republican\r\nMajority capitulated to the Democratic Minority, making a prophet\r\nout of Pap, who had predicated in a letter home that a \"truce\"\r\nwould be arranged in a day or two.\r\n\r\nThe Indianapolis Times carried the banner headline: D.C.\r\nSTEPHENSON BEHIND MOVE WHICH BROUGHT 15 ABSENT SENATORS BACK;\r\nREPUBLICAN POLITICAL BOSS ASSURES DEMOCRATIC FUGITIVES MEASURE\r\nTHEY ARE OPPOSED TO WILL BE DROPPED.\r\n\r\nThe runaways were also given promises of immunity from arrest and\r\nthe quashing of any indictments against them. Thus, having\r\nthoroughly enjoyed their rest and recreation, they cheerfully\r\nreturned to their seats on the afternoon of Feb 27.\r\n\r\nThe saga of the \"Democrats who bolted\" in order to make their\r\npolitical point perfectly clear (and effective) became an oft-\r\ntold tale in Hoosier political circles.\r\n\r\nAnd Pap received his just political reward.\r\n\r\nShortly thereafter, he was chosen as successor to \"Uncle Joe\"\r\nCravens as Minority Leader in the Indiana State Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III: FAMILY YEARS, BULL BREEDING AND GOOD\r\nCREDIT--1930-1940\r\n\r\nWhile continuing to attend legislative sessions, Pap did so in\r\nanother capacity. He put his considerable oratorical and literary\r\nskills to work lobbying his former peers and Congressional\r\nrepresentatives on behalf of some lucrative new clients--the\r\nrailroads. The improved income situation also allowed him to\r\ndevote more time to his growing family, and to write about the\r\ncomedy and crises of domestic life: A relative's eccentric\r\nshipping practices, a daughter's distress at being blackballed by\r\na sorority. As the decade progressed, the older children were\r\nflying the nest, going on to higher education and finding mates\r\nof their own.\r\n\r\nAside from domestic duties, his law practice and lobbyist\r\nactivities, Pap became more involved running the family farm and\r\nin other agrarian pursuits, including the purchase of Hereford\r\nbulls. The livestock provided grist for his pen on more than one\r\noccasion, including a memorable account of some thoroughbred\r\nprice-fixing. Pap even started thinking like a bull (or as he\r\nimagined one of his prize studs would feel after the animal was\r\nstruck by a train).\r\n\r\nHe also found time to champion small and solvent independent\r\nbanks like the family-owned Russellville institution against\r\nonerous government \"reform\" regulations during the Depression; to\r\npromote his old alma mater, Western Military Academy; and suggest\r\na hospital tighten up its security after he fell victim to\r\nthievery.\r\n\r\nPap wrote some family history--a poignant account of a chair that\r\nwas an heirloom, and a satirical account of his grandfather's\r\nattempt to create a new county with Russellville as its seat of\r\ngovernment. That effort may have failed, but Russellville still\r\nwound up with good credit at the Waldorf-Astoria during daughter\r\nJoan's wedding.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTRAGED OVER SORORITY POWER\r\n\r\nExcerpt from a letter Pap wrote to his mother-in-law, Mrs.\r\nSawyer, sometime in 1930.\r\n\r\n. . . Joan has triumphed overwhelmingly and unequivocally.\r\n\r\nA college sorority in my way of looking at it is a very small\r\nmatter. In college circles, it is a thing of momentous magnitude.\r\nIt is ridiculous--utterly ridiculous--that sororities should have\r\nthe hold they have and should wield the power they do . . . and\r\nthe heartbreaks they cause or bring about. . . This letter is to\r\nbe read by you and by no one else. And then it is to be\r\ndestroyed, and its contents divulged to no one. Because I am\r\nactually ashamed that my daughter could be so influenced so\r\npermanently by so small a thing as anybody's college sorority. . .\r\n\r\nIt happened at the time Joan entered college. As is customary, at\r\nhigh school graduating time, the sororities look over the girl\r\ngraduates with a view to bidding them admission to the several\r\nsororities. Joan was invited to a great many--among them Kappa\r\nAlpha Theta. Kappa Alpha Theta was founded at DePauw probably 50\r\nyears ago. It was among the first of all sororities. I had a\r\ncousin, now long since dead, who was one of the founders. In\r\nfact, I think she was probably the most active of all of those\r\nfounders. All of my people, except Sister Margaret D. Bridges and\r\none cousin, were naturally Thetas. Mrs. Bridges did not go to\r\nDepauw, but went to a girls school, Oxford, where they did not\r\nhave sororities, so that let her out. . .\r\n\r\nJoan asked me which was the best of all. . . I told her that\r\nTheta was best, and I felt sure she would get a proposition from\r\nthem, . . . that if I were she, I would belong to Theta or\r\nnothing. And of course I meant it, and for that matter mean it\r\nnow. Well, that sort of talk fortified her to refuse others, and\r\ntherefore I was to blame indirectly for what happened afterwards,\r\nbecause I am inclined to think if I had said nothing that she\r\nwould have joined another. . . And I did not know what\r\nheartbreaks were in store for her. The Thetas invited her to\r\ntheir \"rushee\" party, and things looked well. Then something\r\nhappened. I do not know what it was, but she was dropped and\r\nnever bidden into Theta . . . and so she became a barb--that is a\r\nnon-sorority girl. She was ignored so far as parties were\r\nconcerned. She did not get into the social life of the college\r\nscarcely at all. The fraternity to which I had belonged invited\r\nher to two or three things, and then sort of dropped her because\r\nshe had no sorority to reciprocate with. . .\r\n\r\nIn spite of this social handicap she began in a small way to make\r\nherself felt in college circles. It became noised about by the\r\nfaculty what a fine scholar and girl generally she was. It came\r\nto me from a thousand sources--or almost a thousand. Some of the\r\nother and lesser sororities came to her and asked if she would\r\nconsider a proposition. By that time, she had her back up, and\r\nshe declined universally. But many is the night during these two\r\nyears when she was studying in the dining room that she would say\r\nthat this one and that sorority or fraternity were having a big\r\ndance, or something along social lines. Blue, of course she was\r\nblue. And discouraged and humiliated. But she is a thoroughbred.\r\nShe never disclosed it away from home. Just went about her daily\r\ncollege business. Kept her scholarship and head up, however she\r\nmight be hurting inside. . .\r\n\r\nLast Tuesday the lightning hit. The Thetas called the house . . .\r\nand they asked her to come to the Theta House for supper. And\r\nafter supper, they asked her to join. And she did. And that night\r\ncame home with the colors on. She is a happy, happy girl. Things\r\nhave changed overnight. The leading college man, or at least one\r\nof them, called the Thetas and openly congratulated them on\r\ngetting her. Hundreds have congratulated her, and all this makes\r\nher very happy.\r\n\r\nI have told you all this to sort of try to explain what she had\r\nundergone. It makes me hot under the collar to write it, and to\r\neven think about it. To think that a thing of that character\r\ncould so get hold of a college and of college students to make\r\nthem or break them at the whim of this or that fraternity or\r\nsorority is an outrage. But it is a fact nevertheless. And so I\r\nam glad for her eventual triumph. But at the same time, I am\r\nhumiliated to think that such things exist in a free country. And\r\nthe more so because membership in any organization of that\r\ncharacter is not based on ability or scholarship but is based, on\r\na large measure, on the whim of the individuals who happen to\r\nbelong in the organization at the time the individual is\r\nproposed.\r\n\r\nI must stop, or you will not get this all read.\r\n\r\nPLEASE DESTROY IT AT ONCE. . .\r\nAs Ever,\r\nAndrew\r\n\r\n\r\nDAUGHTERS ADORNED LIKE UNTO CLEOPATRA\r\n\r\nGreencastle, Indiana\r\nNov. 17, 1930\r\n\r\nDear Sister Margaret:\r\nJoan and Sarah Jane went to the Theta big party last Saturday\r\nnight, and I'll tell you they both looked mighty pretty, at least\r\nthey did to me. \"Not because they are my daughters,\" as Charlie\r\nMcWethy says, and all that sort of thing. But I'll say this, they\r\nlooked mighty pretty to me. Sarah Jane had her hair waived and\r\nscrewed on some ear rings that hung on small chains about six\r\ninches long, and I'll be dad burned if she didn't look like the\r\nadvertisements you see for perfumes and things of that sort in\r\nthe Ladies Home Journal. She was so highly colored by reason of\r\nthe excitement she didn't need any artificial color. Her necklace\r\nI think was Joan's, maybe one that Grandma Sawyer gave Joan--\r\nlooks something like an old fashioned hammock in shape, made of\r\nbrilliants or imitation diamonds set in black, and she walked out\r\nlooking like Mrs. Stuyvesant Fish's favorite daughter. And Joan\r\nlooked just as well, all trigged up for the occasion. Her\r\ngreeting to the boys when they came was that of a young woman\r\nperfectly confident in herself. No stammering or anything of that\r\nsort. Sarah Jane was not so free in her conversation, but she'll\r\nget over that. She is a great deal like Ma, only she has more\r\nnerve in speaking out. . . Both of them had their hands and nails\r\nsmoothed up and shined up and tapered down like unto Cleopatra\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nThat night they got home shortly after midnight. The boys just\r\nbrought them to the front door and about a minute after the door\r\nclosed I heard the shoes flying here and there. I heard both of\r\nthem say their feet and legs ached so bad they were numb. They\r\ntalked it all over and I went to sleep.\r\nAndrew\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS CHAOS AND AMAZING FREIGHT\r\n\r\nGreencastle, Indiana\r\nDec. 26, 1930\r\n\r\nDear Sister Margaret:\r\nYesterday was Christmas Day. Of course we had far too much of\r\neverything: two big crocks of oysters, about 150 biscuits, a 24-\r\npound turkey, and so on--you know how Aura does thing--so we will\r\nhave a hard time getting things eaten before they get too old and\r\ndry.\r\n\r\nWe spent the day mostly at home. The children all got a good many\r\npresents. Grandma Sawyer has been sending things for the past\r\nmonth or two. She has the world beat. She actually sent about a\r\npeck of apples all rolled up in a mattress, or feather tick.\r\nFirst we get a head and foot board of a bed; then she finds out\r\nshe forgot the rails, and they come separately; then in a few\r\ndays the slats come on independent; then we find they are the\r\nwrong slats, and also that one of the rails sent belongs to\r\nanother bed back there. . . She sent a sort of tea wagon--that is\r\nshe first sent the frame part with the glass imbedded in it--it\r\nwas one she had in one of the houses and one fine morning decided\r\nthat Aura should have a tea wagon. That came through in enough\r\ncrating to make kindling for two or three months. In about two\r\nweeks, here came another crate with the greater part of the\r\nbalance of said tea wagon. But on careful investigation and\r\nsplicing, we found one wheel gone and also one handle. She had\r\nretained the one wheel to get it fixed, so in due time, it came.\r\nLater the missing handle was located and sent. And all the time,\r\nthese various parts and pieces come by parcel post, freight and\r\nexpress, as the spirit moves her. By some strange coincidence the\r\nfreight invariably comes over different railroads. We will get\r\nthe main parts, say via Big 4, the slats via Monon and the rails\r\nby way of the Pennsylvania; then a \"cunning\" little dinky that\r\nGrandma saw in a shop in Middletown and figured would match the\r\nwheels of the tea wagon so nicely, will come by parcel post, and\r\nso it goes. The freight men at the various depots have come to\r\nlook on me and my consignments of freight in amazement. . .\r\n\r\nWe had a terrible time getting to sleep last night. Since Frank\r\nhas been home, things have been going along pretty smoothly. The\r\ngirls were glad to see him, and he to see the girls. But it\r\ncouldn't last. I saw Jane and Joan getting their heads together a\r\ngood deal yesterday afternoon, and finally Schweet Babe got in\r\nit. Frank and I were playing casino. The girls were upstairs,\r\nthen went out to a picture show or something. Frank was a little\r\nnervous. Finally he went upstairs and came back after a long\r\nabsence and said that Joan had put soap chips all through his\r\nbed. He had cleaned it out, and had filled Joan's bed full of nut\r\nshells. Then she came home looking suspiciously, eased upstairs\r\nevidently to learn if Frank had found out what had happened to\r\nhis bed. She found hers and had to take everything off and shake\r\nthe covers, and then it started. No great noise, but much\r\nshutting of doors, running here and there, low whispering,\r\ngiggling--and everything except going to bed. I stayed out of it,\r\nand in the wee small hours of the night, the house settled down\r\nand everybody this morning was too sleepy to get up for\r\nbreakfast. So that is the way it goes.\r\nAndrew\r\n\r\n\r\nNAME CHANGE NEEDED\r\n\r\nGreencastle, Indiana\r\nJuly 13, 1931\r\n\r\nMr. J.P. Austin\r\n1005 White Bldg.\r\nSeattle, Washington\r\n\r\nMy dear Pony,\r\nI needs must forego your wonderful party. . .There is nowhere on\r\nEarth I'd rather be--not even in Hoover's shoes. . . Not long\r\nsince, I was in Russellville, my old home town northwest of here--\r\nthe town where all the good folks come from, and a town I have\r\nconsistently and persistently advertised in the local legislature\r\nfor the past 15 years. We were reading where Hoover had, among\r\nother places, visited the Virgin Islands. George Potter, our\r\nlocal wit, was listening to the account. Finally George commented\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n\"If Hoover did to them islands what he's been doing to us people\r\nout around here, they'll have to change the name of the islands\r\nto something else\" . . .\r\nAs ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nTAKING CHANCES\r\n\r\nGreencastle, Indiana\r\nDec. 14, 1931\r\nMr. R. W. Buckworth,\r\nCrawfordsville, Indiana\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Buckworth:\r\nSeveral days ago I received a very kind and thoughtful letter\r\nfrom you concerning a proposed forensic effort on my part to be\r\nattempted before the Crawfordsville Rotary Club. . . I realize\r\nthe Stock Market is undergoing a terrific upheaval and people are\r\ntaking chances who otherwise and under other conditions, wouldn't\r\nthink of such a thing, but for you to take a chance on me\r\nappearing satisfactorily before your Rotary Club is the wildest\r\ngamble I have heard of to date. Nothing more hazardous comes to\r\nme just now, except, perhaps for the public to take a chance on\r\nDemocratic Party next year. Then, anything can happen.\r\n\r\nAnd so, in half-keeping only with Senator Watson's classic on his\r\n\"sugar\" speculations--in explaining his having given his note for\r\nthe stock, he dismissed the whole subject with: \"The stock is no\r\ngood, neither is my note. Therefore the whole transaction is now\r\neven\"--I therefore here and now accept your invitation before you\r\nhave to rescind it--and may God give you all strength to hear me\r\nout.\r\nVery Respectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nPLIGHT OF THE RAILROADS\r\n\r\nMarch 11, 1932\r\nMr. Courtland C. Gillen\r\nMember of Congress\r\nWashington, D.C.\r\n\r\nHonored Congressman:\r\nI was just about to preface this, my first epistle to you, with\r\n\"Honored Congressmen,\" because, for what reason I know not, an\r\nall-wise, beneficent and just Providence has seen fit to inflict\r\nme with not one, but two, Congressmen--you and Red Purnell--thus\r\ncausing me to bear a double cross. Please catch the awful\r\npotentiality of those last two words, \"govern yourself\r\naccordingly and look to the southwest\" as Thomas Taggart of\r\nhallowed memory would say. . .\r\n\r\nI want to call your attention to the railroad situation. As you\r\nhave long known, I am what might in a spirit of braggadocio be\r\ncalled \"of counsel for the Big Four,\" carrying with it a pass to\r\nIndianapolis and return, and elsewhere about the lodge as the\r\nworshipful train-master may direct. You also know I was in\r\nseveral sessions of the Indiana Legislature--now also of hallowed\r\nmemory. I have seen railroads kicked and cuffed by legislative\r\nbodies, and I have seen their securities descend from the highest\r\npoint in the way of safe, sound investments to about the lowest.\r\n. . Railroads are in a hell of a fix. And it is not the fault of\r\nthe railroads by a long shot. Among the principal reasons for\r\ntheir present condition is the unfair competition in interstate\r\nhauling being indulged in by busses and trucks. There are bills\r\nnow pending in Congress designed to regulate this unfair bus and\r\ntruck competition, and I think Senator Couzens of Michigan has\r\none. . .\r\n\r\nRailroads, being of a public character, should be regulated\r\nreasonably, but it seems to me they are just about regulated to\r\ndeath. That probably accounts in part for their present\r\ncondition. Did you know the B&O couldn't run an excursion from\r\nChrisman to the Russellville Horse Show without the permission of\r\nthe Interstate Commerce Commission, at a round trip fare to be\r\nfixed or approved by the Commission, and not until after giving\r\nnotice? . . .\r\n\r\nAbove in this letter I have used the words \"unfair competition\"\r\nwhen speaking about busses and trucks. Let me illustrate.\r\nConsiderably over a year ago a contract was let in Chicago for\r\nadditions to the Field Museum, I think it was. The contract\r\ncalled for the use of Indiana Limestone running into over 100\r\ncars. Mr. Curry was instrumental in getting the contract for a\r\ncontractor friend. No sooner had the contract been let than an\r\nindependent hauler living in Chicago approached this contractor\r\nand offered to deliver the stone from the Bloomington and Bedford\r\ndistricts on the job as it was needed, for exactly the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission's fixed railroad freight rates from the\r\nvarious sources along the Monon to the Chicago terminal--thus\r\nsaving the contractor the haul bill from the terminal to the job,\r\na sum running into a considerable figure. It was all that\r\neverybody concerned from the Monon's view point could do to keep\r\nthat contractor from accepting the independent hauler's offer.\r\n\r\nNow let's suppose that contractor had accepted the offer. What\r\nwould have happened? That independent hauler would have manned\r\nhis fleet of Illinois trucks with Illinois drivers; they would\r\nhave had their trucks overhauled by Illinois mechanics before\r\nstarting; they would have filled their enormous tanks with\r\nIllinois gas so as to have made the round-trip without having to\r\nstop for gas; the drivers would have taken their Illinois-filled\r\ndinner buckets; and down concrete State Road No. 41 they would\r\nhave probably come. Turning east on No. 36 at Rockville, they\r\nwould have intercepted a barred rock hen and 11 chickens in front\r\nof Ab Shalley's at Bellmore to the utter annihilation of the\r\ninterceptees. In an unguarded moment some driver would have\r\nremoved Zephus Burkett's mail box and distributed it and its\r\ncontents consisting of a Kitselman Brothers Fence Catalog, the\r\nFarm and Fireside, and a pamphlet telling how to make hens lay\r\nbetween there and Hanna's Crossroads, where they would or would\r\nnot have made the turn safely down No. 43. Frank Hathaway's\r\nthoroughbred calf would have been \"out\" at his place and heard of\r\nno more; Paul Tucker's bay mare been soon describing a parabola\r\nwith a radius of three miles. And the left hind wheel and end\r\ngate of Professor Ogg's spring wagon would have been removed\r\nquickly and efficiently directly in front of your house at\r\nBloomington and Walnut.\r\n\r\nOn to Stinesville, Bloomington or Bedford they would have trekked\r\ntheir stately way, probably taking more than a good half of the\r\nhighway. Loaded up, they would have made the return over Indiana\r\npaid-for concrete highways in impressive massed procession, just\r\nfast enough to keep Indiana taxpayers from passing them. . .\r\n\r\nWhat would Indiana or Indiana people have got out of this all-\r\nsummer cavalcade for the use of its highways, or for the\r\nsustenance of its citizens? Unless there had been a breakdown too\r\nserious for roadside repairs, or a truck had accidentally run out\r\nof oil or gas, or some driver had seen fit to buy a Babe Ruth for\r\nhis sweet tooth, Indiana and Indiana people would not have\r\nreceived a damn cent for the use of their $60,000 per mile\r\nconcrete highways.\r\n\r\nNow what would the Monon--the largest purely Indiana Railroad\r\nhave received, or paid, or how would it have fared in the deal?\r\nIt would not have received the job of hauling that stone because\r\nits rate was fixed by law and it couldn't hack prices; it would\r\nhave continued paying its men, upkeep, expenses and taxes just\r\nthe same. . . It owns and maintains its own right of way; also\r\nall rolling stock and equipment of all kinds and character, and\r\npays taxes on same--regularly. It stands there ready and anxious\r\nto receive all business it can get, not only for today but for\r\ntomorrow, next month and next year. It can't crank up, call the\r\ndog and leave jurisdiction and unpaid debts at 3:01 a.m. on any\r\ngiven day. It does not ask a monopoly. It only asks fair\r\ntreatment, and that bus and truck competitors be put on a\r\ncompetitive basis by being required to pay a fair return for the\r\nuse of the public highways, or else buy, build, and maintain\r\nthose of their own; that they shall maintain regular scheduled\r\nroutes, rates, and service in winter and summer, sunshine and\r\nrain, fog and clear weather; and otherwise submit and qualify for\r\nregular continuing business, just as railroads are now required\r\nto submit and qualify.\r\n\r\nNow, in return for this splendid thesis, I want to ask my\r\nCongressman some favors. Will you please look into bills now\r\npending before you on this subject, and tell me wherein you favor\r\nor disfavor them--and why? Perhaps I am wrong in the attitude I\r\ntake. If I am, I want to get right, and I know of no one better\r\nable, or more willing, to inform me than my own Congressman.\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nWET, DRY OR MOIST?\r\n\r\nGreencastle, Indiana\r\nApril 11, 1932\r\nMr. James G. Smith\r\nAlamo, Indiana\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Smith:\r\nI have your inquiry about Court Gillen, and I shall answer to the\r\nbest of my ability . . . . He is a man of ability, a lawyer, a\r\ndecent man and surely is entitled to another chance in Congress.\r\n. . I do not know that he is particularly dry. I do not know that\r\nhe is particularly wet. . . He may be a trifle moist, and he may\r\nnot be. He has never been known as a radical on anything, within\r\nmy knowledge. I have heard some criticism against him on his\r\nso-called dry vote, but I have also heard that anyone with any\r\nsense, under the same circumstance, would have voted exactly as\r\nhe did.\r\n\r\nFor that matter, he will not be beaten by the \"lady candidate\".\r\nIf my information is correct, she got into this race simply and\r\nsolely on account of the one vote Gillen made on the Prohibition\r\nquestion. . . Now, if that is the case, she might be\r\ncharacterized as a radical \"wet\", obsessed on that one question,\r\nand forgetful and more or less incompetent on everything else.\r\nAnd I am saying to you right here and now that there are other\r\nimportant questions pending except \"wet\" and \"dry\". . .\r\n\r\nYou know, it is a very easy thing to sit or stand around and\r\n\"cuss\" those in a legislative body for what they did or did not\r\ndo. . . If everybody had all the information, and had given a\r\nquestion the same study and attention as the one who did the\r\nvoting, there would be less criticism than there is. . .\r\n\r\nLet me illustrate how these things go. I was nominated as\r\nRepresentative from Putnam County in 1912. I was young and\r\ninexperienced. A day or two after my nomination, Colonel Matson,\r\nwho had been in Congress for years, and was a lawyer here at the\r\ntime and almost retired, gave me some advice: \"Find out where the\r\ncoat racks are, where your seat is, and when the Legislature\r\nassembles take your seat and keep still. There will be times when\r\nyou will think that you have the exact solution for whatever is\r\nbeing debated. When you feel this coming on you, get up and get\r\nyour hat and walk around the State House, then come back and sit\r\ndown and keep still. If you will do that, they will not find out\r\nhow ignorant you are. . . I don't want to hear of you taking any\r\npart in the debates your whole first term, I don't want you to\r\nintroduce any bills. I just want you to be on the job every day\r\nand every hour, and attend your Committees, and above all else,\r\nkeep still.\"\r\n\r\nI followed that advice, I think absolutely, or nearly so.\r\n\r\nBut there was another side to the matter. . . After the Session\r\nwas over, I met a farmer friend who had worked hard for me, and I\r\nasked him if he were pleased with the way I had conducted myself.\r\nHe was not. He said: \"I thought if we sent a mouthy young lawyer\r\nto the Legislature, he would get some laws through, and we would\r\nhear from him, and he'd be up there doing something. I never saw\r\nwhere you even made a speech.\"\r\n\r\nTime went on. I served in 1915. Then I went to the Senate in 1917\r\nfrom Montgomery and Putnam, and again in 1923. Some time shortly\r\nafter either the 1925 or 1927 Session, I met this man on the\r\nstreets here in Greencastle. He came up to me beaming, and said:\r\n\"I'll take it all back. You are the best Senator we ever had. . .\r\nI can't pick up the papers without seeing your name strung all\r\nover it. . .\"\r\n\r\nPeople jump at conclusions, and sometimes they jump wrong unless\r\nthey know all the circumstances. . .\r\nCordially,\r\n\r\n\r\nA DAMAGED BULL STORY\r\n\r\nThe following exchange of correspondence occurred after a prize\r\nbull on the Durham farm near Russellville was struck by a\r\nrailroad train.\r\n\r\nMay 31, 1933\r\nMr. Andrew E. Durham,\r\nGreencastle, Indiana\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Durham,\r\nOur mutual friend, Mr. Byers, has sent me your most touching\r\nletter of May 27th, relating to the unfortunate usurpation of the\r\nB&O right of way by your pet bull. Fortunately, however, the\r\nincident does not--at least so I assume--extinguish your \"line\".\r\nNaturally, the distinguished bull was a thoroughbred, and in this\r\nrespect he has nothing on our train, as it is also a\r\nthoroughbred, and when thoroughbred meets thoroughbred something\r\nmust happen. . .\r\n\r\nIt may be necessary to have our representative call upon you and\r\nthe bull to ascertain your respective incapacities as a result of\r\nthe collision. I regret, however, that under the laws of the\r\ngreat State of Indiana, your own mental pain and anguish is not\r\nan element of damage and, so far as I know, there is no way of\r\nproving that of the bull other than by hearsay, which of course\r\nis incompetent.\r\nVery truly,\r\nFrank J. Goebel\r\nAssistant General Solicitor\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REPLY OF \"THE BULL.\"\r\n\r\nJune 3, 1933\r\nHonorable Frank J. Goebel,\r\nAsst. Gen. Solicitor\r\nBaltimore & Ohio Railroad Company\r\nCincinnati, Ohio\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\nI am told I am a Hereford bull. . .I was supreme on the Durham\r\nfarm, and lord of all I surveyed--that is, until recently. . .\r\n\r\nFor years I had noticed some sort of animal or monster wend its\r\nway shrieking and rumbling across our land, always going along\r\nthe same trail without variation. In daytime its head emitted\r\nblack smoke and a terrific noise with its rattling body trailing\r\nback, slender and long like a snake. At night it had an\r\nenormously bright eye in the center of its mammoth head, and\r\nbelched forth fire sometimes. . . We got used to it, and finding\r\nit to be totally unsociable, we adopted the wise policy of\r\nignoring it--that is, until recently. . .\r\n\r\nI was grazing along what my owner says Ring Lardner would\r\nlaughingly call a fence, and just stepped through, or on, or\r\nover, it to where the grass looked greener. And then I went on\r\nand up to where there was less grass and more gravel, and some\r\nties and rails. . . Then something happened, and I went winding\r\ndown and down. Oh, the pain!\r\n\r\nMy owner . . . has said more nice things about me and my good\r\nqualities and worth since I got hurt than he ever said in all the\r\nyears gone before. . . He said to some men who came out to see me\r\nafter I was damn near killed: \"Did you ever in your life see so\r\ngood an individual bull, any where, any time? Look at that head.\r\nImagine what it looked like before he got hit. . . I wouldn't\r\nhave taken a thousand dollars for him before he was hurt. No. I\r\nwouldn't have taken two thousand dollars, nor there isn't a man\r\namong you who would have taken five thousand for him if he had\r\nbeen yours\". . . Then my owner said: \"It's confidential, of\r\ncourse, and I know you men well enough to know you'll keep it to\r\nyourselves. Ex-Governor Warren McCray had a man down here\r\nsecretly to buy him at $10,000--to head his herd.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" my owner says, \"what would you appraise him at? I want to\r\nbe fair with the railroad. . . You and I are farmers, and\r\neverybody knows a farmer has a hard time, and all farmers should\r\nstand together, but at the same time be fair, of course, to the\r\nrailroads. Naturally we all know that railroads are not fair, and\r\nare big rich corporations, paying great high salaries to\r\npresidents and lawyers, especially lawyers, for sitting around in\r\nswivel chairs, milking the public, fixing mythical valuations to\r\nbase freight rates on, and then eternally asking for rate\r\nincreases when they are so high now nobody can ship anything over\r\nthem . . . . .\r\n\r\n\"Still, I want you men to be absolutely fair with the railroad . .\r\n. . .\"\r\n\r\nI don't know what happened after that because they moved off\r\ntoward the house. . . They say the chances are that I will live,\r\nbut I wish I were dead. . . Pain, pain, ever since. My head is\r\nswollen to double, my sight in one eye may be gone. I still bleed\r\nat the nose. . .My mental anguish is unbearable. I know that\r\nwhich I had in abundance and have ample living proof of is gone\r\nfrom me, never to return. I have lost my social standing in the\r\ncommunity in which I reside and my wimmen folks are laughing at\r\nme and at this time of the year. . . Oh, grave, where is thy\r\nsting. . .\r\n\r\nIf you care to apologize for your hasty remarks about bull mental\r\npain and anguish, you may address me as:\r\nRespectfully,\r\nThe Bull\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAMP OUT SMALL BANKS?\r\n\r\nJune 3, 1933\r\nHonorable Virginia Jenckes\r\nMember of Congress\r\nWashington, D.C.\r\n\r\nMy dear Madam:\r\nI should appreciate your sending me a copy of H.B. #5661, (the\r\nSteagell Bill) as re-written by the Senate. I am informed the\r\nSenate struck everything out of this bill after the enacting\r\nclause, and substituted a bill of their own--probably the Glass\r\nBill, with some amendments.\r\n\r\nIf the bill as passed by the Senate reads as I am informed it\r\ndoes, I am very much opposed. . . It would drive all small\r\ncountry banks out of business at least for the one reason that it\r\nrequires a capital of not less than $50,000. Small country banks\r\ncannot stand a capitalization of $50,000 and pay dividends on any\r\nsuch amount. Small banks have small ways, limited deposits,\r\nlimited territory--and consequently limited earning powers. . .\r\n\r\nI desire to say I have been connected in one way or another with\r\na small country bank, the Russellville Bank, of Russellville,\r\nPutnam County, Indiana, since childhood. I was sort of raised in\r\nthat bank. I own the majority stock in it. I worked in it for\r\nyears. It represents the life work of an older brother, now dead.\r\nIt has a capital of $15,000 and a surplus of $47,500. . .\r\n\r\nIn times like these, all proposed bank legislation should be\r\ncarefully considered--to say the least. There are not so many of\r\nus left, and those that remain deserve some consideration for\r\nhaving weathered what we have.\r\n\r\nI am cognizant of the fact that something serious ails, or has\r\nailed, the banking business. . . I am also aware that banking,\r\nwith its attending care, custody and handling of other people's\r\nmoney, takes on a public nature that some other businesses do not\r\nhave. . . And please do not form the opinion that I, in the\r\nslightest degree, desire to block sound, reasonable, safe and\r\nsane banking legislation. Absolutely the contrary. But . . . I\r\ninsist that a small community is entitled to a small bank for its\r\nsmall business in the same arithmetical ratio that a large or\r\npopulous community is entitled to a large bank. . . Viewed from\r\nthe angle the Senate seems to have, I should think it would be\r\nbetter to fix a minimum of capital and surplus combined (for as\r\nfar as security to depositors is concerned, there is no\r\ndifference between capital and surplus) for a maximum of\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\nSuffice to say, I am utterly and unqualifiedly opposed to an\r\narbitrary fixed minimum capitalization of $50,000 for small\r\nbanks. . . To me it means mighty, mighty few banks in towns of\r\nless than 2,000 people.\r\n\r\nIf that is the intention, then the bill is perfect--in that\r\nrespect.\r\nVery Respectfully\r\n\r\n\r\nA FAN OF THE OLD SCHOOL\r\n\r\nJuly 8, 1933\r\nMr. Lee Tracy\r\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios\r\nHollywood, California\r\n\r\nMy dear fellow Cadet:\r\nThis is not a \"fan\" letter. . . I probably recognize ten or\r\nfifteen actors and actresses at sight. Yesterday I saw a movie\r\nmagazine. You were telling about yourself. I saw the name\r\n\"Western Military Academy\" in print and that galvanized me. I\r\nread the article from start to finish. I was tremendously pleased\r\nat the kindly treatment you gave \"Western.\" Hence, this\r\nletter--the first I ever wrote an actor or actress. My God!\r\nMother taught me a theater was the Devil's work-shop.\r\n\r\nI graduated Western in 1899. . . I had arrived at the age where I\r\nwas reluctantly permitting the \"old folks\" to reside in our home.\r\nThe local high school eventually granted me a diploma in order to\r\nmake room for students. \"Western\" was father's answer. . .\r\n\r\nEverybody has a hobby. Some good, some not. After about 30 years\r\nof worldly experience, \"Western\" and its welfare is probably\r\nmine. There was where I first learned a small town banker's son\r\nmight later on in life meet some noticeable competition. . .\r\n\r\n\"Western\" needs favorable advertising and plenty of it. I\r\ncheerfully do what I can, but of course my field is tremendously\r\nlimited. Just what you said in your magazine article about\r\nyourself is what \"Western\" needs. Only more of it. Last evening\r\nand today I learn you are one of the best known men of your\r\nprofession. You evidently have thousands of admirers. Some time,\r\nsome where, some how, some of them will have a boy here and there\r\nof the proper school age. And the fact those parents hold you as\r\nthey do, if they can only know you went to Western, will be the\r\ndeciding factor where those boys will go to school. Get me?\r\n\r\nI am not a sentimentalist. I don't ask any one, and especially a\r\nstranger, to spend either time or money on me and my hobby for me\r\nalone. Honestly I don't. I'm pretty tight myself. Maybe I have to\r\nbe, and I'm that way by nature anyway. But without any expense of\r\ncourse to you, if you would drop the hint to the Metro folks that\r\nyou have an idea a newsreel of an up-to-the-minute Military\r\nschool, at say, Commencement time, would have an appeal to the\r\npublic, and especially to the younger feminine public, and that\r\n\"Western\" is the school to \"shoot\", or whatever it is you call\r\nit, and Metro would agree, then we might get somewhere with\r\npublicity for Western. . .\r\n\r\nI do not ask or expect a reply. I think I know what you are up\r\nagainst in the way of correspondence. I was in the Legislature\r\nfor 16 years. We have Legislative \"cranks\" here, just like you\r\nhave movie \"fans\" there--only not so much so. Now I'm a railroad\r\nlobbyist whenever the Session meets. Furthermore I'm a Democrat.\r\nAs a waggish local constituent puts it, I've \"gone from bad to\r\nHell.\"\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, if sometime I should learn a newsreel was\r\nshowing W.M.A. in all its glory of flags, pennants, brass\r\nbuttons, and an inset of Lee Tracy as its most distinguished\r\nalumnus, I can assure you I'll dismiss the help, unbait the trap,\r\nlock the door, call a frightened and bewildered family, and hie\r\nus away to Indianapolis, or wherever it may be showing, there to\r\ncarefully explain to disgusted adjacent seat holders, that I--I\r\nthe erstwhile conservative country lawyer--am also an alumnus of\r\nthat greatest of the great boys schools, and thus get a bit of\r\nreflected glory. . .\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPS. To whoever reads this. Please give me a break and show this\r\nletter to Mr. Tracy. I've never bothered him or you before, and I\r\npromise I'll never bother again.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE\r\n\r\nJanuary 22, 1934\r\nIn re: Estate of Charles A. D--\r\nHon. Isaac Kane Parks\r\nInheritance Tax Administrator\r\n231 State House\r\nIndianapolis, Indiana\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\nI have your letter of direction concerning the above inheritance\r\ntax matter. . .\r\n\r\nI am a trifle confused . . . on whether you want an exact copy of\r\nthe federal estate tax return as we filed it, or whether you\r\ndesire a copy of the return as was finally accepted by the\r\ngovernment. . .\r\n\r\n\"There was considerable difference.\"\r\n\r\nThe above quotation happened years ago at Russellville (my home\r\ntown) when Bill Goodwin was section boss on the I.D.&W, and Milt\r\nKinder, a pretty good old man--but terrifically profane--worked\r\non the section under Bill. The crew was laying rails down west of\r\ntown near Brumfield's trestle. Milt was driving spikes and missed\r\none and hit his foot and the air was blue, and it looked like\r\nIndian Summer down that way. They rushed Milt to a doctor and\r\npatched him up.\r\n\r\nIn due course, a long four-page questionnaire came to Bill from\r\nthe main office in Cincinnati: \"Full name of injured employee?\r\nAge? Years of service? How did the accident happen? When? Where?\r\nWho saw the accident?\" etc. etc. And on the last page, about two\r\nthirds of the way down, was this one word. \"Remarks?\", the rest\r\nof the page left blank.\r\n\r\nBill, the section boss, sat up about all night making it out--\r\npainfully and laboriously. At last he came to the \"Remarks\". He\r\nwas puzzled and confused (something like I am about the return\r\nyou ask for).\r\n\r\nFinally, under that heading he wrote the following: \"Now about\r\nthem 'remarks'. Do you mean Milt's, or do you mean mine? There\r\nwas considerable difference.\"\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBIA NO PLACE TO GO TO SCHOOL\r\n\r\nJune 8, 1934\r\nHon. Frank L. Littleton, Atty.\r\nBig Four Building\r\nIndianapolis, Indiana\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\nI have just returned from New York and Joan's graduation in\r\nColumbia. . . My Gosh, but that is a big school! On Tuesday they\r\ngave out between 4,000 and 5,000 diplomas. Had the exercises\r\noutdoors in front of the library. Must have been 15,000 or 20,000\r\nor more people there. The crowd looked a bit like the Speedway\r\nraces. . . Between my seat on some bleachers and where the\r\ndiplomas were given out were numerous flights of steps, a sort of\r\nsunken garden, some four or five tennis courts, a wide\r\nblocked-off street, and a football field the short way. And\r\nbetween were the graduates and visitors, in camp chairs and on\r\nbleachers as thick as they could be packed. They had loud\r\nspeakers, but not enough of them for me to hear from the seat I\r\noccupied. It took over an hour for the graduates and faculty to\r\nmarch in from four entrances. There surely must be over a\r\nthousand in the faculty. Anyway, I made up my mind then and there\r\nthat Columbia was no place for an undergraduate to go to school.\r\nIt is too big. The students have practically no campus life. A\r\ngreat part of them are from the City of New York and surrounding\r\ncities, and they room all the way from the Battery to the Bronx.\r\nEndless numbers of them never see or know one another. . .\r\nAs Ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARD FAIRFAX--A BULL STORY WITHOUT PEER\r\n\r\nJuly 20, 1936\r\nMr. B.C. Byers\r\nMacatawa, Mich.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Byers:\r\nI haven't been in Indianapolis since I started the two little\r\ngirls up into Maine to a girls camp, so unless I succeed in\r\ncooking up something, this letter will be a fizzle for news.\r\n\r\nIn May I bought a 16-months old Hereford bull, Hugh Fairfax by\r\nname, at the McCray Sale at Kentland. Since that time I bought a\r\nMcCray-bred Fairfax Hereford bull from a Mr. Dillman at Waveland,\r\nand also traded an old Woodford Hereford bull to the Indiana\r\nState Farm for another McCray-bred Fairfax Hereford. So you see I\r\nam slightly in the bull business.\r\n\r\nFor your information, you knowing nothing about anything except\r\nrailroading and good looking women, Mr. Warren T. McCray got his\r\nbig start in Herefords after he acquired Perfection Fairfax, a\r\nHereford bull that afterwards won the International Championship,\r\nand was acknowledged generally to be the greatest sire of his\r\nday. He started the \"Fairfax\" fashion.\r\n\r\nIn getting the pedigrees of these last two bulls straightened\r\nout, I made four trips to Kentland. The trip prior to the last\r\none found the ex-Governor in a petulant frame of mind. He called\r\nme \"Senator\" very formally, was easily irritated and gave this\r\nand that as an excuse for the delay. The truth is, I think, that\r\nhis herd books have been kept in about the same condition as Joe\r\nC-- kept his desk in the Senate Chamber.\r\n\r\nBut my last trip was different. When I got there the old boy was\r\nin his office selling a Hereford to some young fellow from the\r\nnorth part of the state--I hope Lake County, because anybody from\r\nLake County needs a trimming. I stayed outside and eventually\r\nthey came out.\r\n\r\n\"Why, hello, Mr. Andy,\" said Warren T. \"How are you this fine\r\nday?\"\r\n\r\nIt was hotter than Tom B-- ever got in a poker game.\r\n\r\nI knew the old fellow had had a good breakfast, and that he had\r\nno doubt spliced me up a pair of pedigrees of some sort or other.\r\nI just sort of imagine that when a herd book gets slightly mixed\r\nup, or time has elapsed and a given bull's heredity sort of lost\r\nin the hazy past, that those fellows quietly sit down and whittle\r\nout a pedigree that sounds about right. . .\r\n\r\nLet me tell you a bull story about as he related it to me last\r\nFriday. This is Warren T. speaking:\r\n\r\n\"About 1902 or 1903, I wanted to branch out bigger, buy more land\r\nand become a Hereford leader for sure. . . Mr. -- was showing\r\nHerefords in Indianapolis. He had by far the best bull I had seen\r\nor heard of. His name was Perfection Fairfax, and he had a\r\npedigree that read like the Lees of Virginia. . . The only way\r\nhis owner would part with him would be to sell his whole herd of\r\n37 cows too--for $17,000 cash. I brought him home to Kentland. He\r\nwon the International Championship and we both became famous in\r\nthe Hereford world. The Fairfax strain took the country by storm.\r\nHis sons and daughters were sensations. He lived until he was\r\npast 17 years old, and was a virile breeder to the day of his\r\ndeath.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look up yonder on the knoll past the machine shop and the big\r\nbarn. See that cement column up there? The boys here at the farm\r\nerected that monument, and old Perfection Fairfax lies right\r\nunder it. He died in 1918. Old Perfection made breeders millions\r\nof dollars. Look up there on the wall to my right. See that oil\r\npainting? That is Perfection Fairfax. I had a famous artist paint\r\nthat. See that long picture over there on the wall east of old\r\nPerfection? That is a picture of 32 of his sons I sold at one\r\ntime to one breeder down in the Argentine. We had that picture\r\ntaken the day they left the farm. They made me some money.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the highest price, Governor, that you ever got for a\r\nbull?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"The highest price I ever got was $25,000.\"\r\n\r\n\"Holy Nellie,\" said I. \"Isn't that the highest price anybody ever\r\ngot?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said. \"Do you want me to tell you about that? . . .It's\r\na pretty long story but interesting. Along about 1915 Perfection\r\nFairfax was getting old, and I decided I'd go out again and buy\r\nthe best young Hereford bull on Earth. As I traveled and asked, I\r\nkept hearing about a Richard Fairfax, one of old Perfection's\r\ncalves--a calf I had raised, and still owned his mother. He had\r\nbeen sold at one of my sales and wound up in Dakota--and it was\r\nalways the same tale that he was not for sale at any price,\r\nwhatsoever. Absolutely.\"\r\n\r\n\"I made up my mind I'd just take his owner off his feet the first\r\nshot. I'd paralyze him with an offer he'd not refuse. I didn't\r\nwant to take a long wild goose chase for nothing away up there in\r\nDakota. If he wasn't for sale at any price I'd soon know it. So I\r\nwrote a short letter to his owner. I wrote, 'I know there is no\r\nuse sending bird shot after big game. If I come up and look at\r\nRichard Fairfax and like him, and find him to be everything I've\r\nheard about him, will you take $25,000 cash for him?' I figured\r\nthat would bring him to his milk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very much to my surprise a prompt letter informed me that my\r\noffer did not interest his owner in the least. Richard Fairfax\r\nwas not for sale at any price.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I looked elsewhere and forgot Richard. That was along, say in\r\nNovember. The following February, Johnny --, from Minnesota, came\r\ndown to see me. He was a young breeder who had great faith in me\r\nand my judgment of Herefords, and had bought quite a bit of my\r\nstuff. Johnny was to stay all night and go home next morning on\r\nthe 7 o'clock train. I noticed Johnny was listless as he looked\r\nover my herd, and I knew something was wrong--he wasn't there to\r\nbuy.\"\r\n\r\n\"After supper we went into the library and talked Herefords and\r\neverything else from the weather to politics. Finally I looked at\r\nmy watch and said: 'Johnny, I'm getting sleepy. You leave in the\r\nmorning at 7, and it's 1 o'clock now. Let's go to bed.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Warren,\" he said. \"I've got something pretty big on my mind. I\r\nwant your advice. It's Richard Fairfax. I know all about your\r\noffer. I know the whole story. But I'm about to pay $50,000 cash\r\nfor him, and what I want to know is if you think I am crazy\r\ntrying to buy him at $50,000?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Johnny! You're the greatest Hereford booster I ever heard\r\nof. You sure are! I don't want to discourage you, and God knows I\r\ndon't want to throw cold water on the Hereford business, but now\r\nthat you've asked me, all I can say is that I quit at $25,000.\r\nThat's a terrible risk. Why, the bull might lie down and die\r\ntomorrow. $50,000 is a pile of money in Government Bonds, but\r\nit's an ocean full of money tied up in a Hereford bull.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't throw up your hands until I get through, Warren.\r\nI've been thinking about this thing for a long time and been\r\ngetting ready for it. I can get him insured for a maximum of\r\n$25,000--everybody says Richard is the best young bull in the\r\ncountry, and remember he's out of your grand old Perfection. I've\r\nbeen quietly buying up all his sons and daughters I can lay my\r\nhands on. I own 65 daughters and 20-odd sons, so I'd be pretty\r\nwell fixed for a June sale of sons and daughters of a $50,000\r\nbull. I figure that the advertising a $50,000 buy would give is a\r\nbig thing. The more I think, the bigger it gets: the highest price\r\nthe world has ever known for a bull. No other price has even\r\napproached that figure. Every big newspaper from New York on west\r\nwill carry it on the front page, and a picture of Richard and me\r\nalong with the story. I'll get more free advertising out of that\r\nthan I would with 50 years of paid advertisements in all the Live\r\nStock Journals published. And I'll see to it that 'Bred by Warren\r\nT. McCray, Kentland, Indiana' goes under Richard's picture. You\r\nare going to have a sale in May. You bred Richard Fairfax. About\r\neverything you own is close kin to him. How would a $50,000 bull\r\nthat you calved help your May sale?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Johnny, I see the enormous possibilities. Still, $50,000\r\nis SOME bull money.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not through yet, my good friend in need,\" Johnny said. \"And\r\nhere is where I have to have your cooperation if the deal goes. I\r\nonly have $20,000 cash to put in Richard now. I figure that in an\r\nordinarily good sale of Richard's sons and daughters, they would\r\nprobably average $500 apiece. If I pay $50,000 for their sire and\r\nget the advertising I think I'll get, the 80-odd head really\r\nought to double that amount--I'm trying to be conservative--But I\r\ncan't go to my bankers and say, 'Gentlemen, I'm paying $50,000\r\ncash for a bull, I have $20,000 and want to borrow the balance\r\nfrom you.' They would say I was plumb crazy, try to get a\r\nguardian for me and collect all I owe them, right now. You know\r\nbankers. There is no place in the wide world I can borrow that\r\nsort of money, except from you. You know that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Johnny, let's go to bed. I'll let you have an answer before the\r\ntrain goes.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McCray said he thought until 6 o'clock, then got up and got a\r\nhurried breakfast into Johnny and took him to the station. When\r\nthe train got within about two miles of town, he said, \"Johnny,\r\ngo to Dakota and look Richard over. Examine him as you never\r\nexamined a bull before. Find all about him--whether he has been\r\nexposed to any diseases; have three vets go over him piece by\r\npiece--Then go off and think for 24 hours. If you decide to buy,\r\nsend me a telegram saying, 'The Republicans will win easily next\r\nelection.' Buy him, get the $25,000 insurance, render up a short\r\nprayer and draw on me for $30,000--and the draft will be\r\nhonored.\"\r\n\r\nWithin a week or 10 days, McCray told me, he got the prearranged\r\ntelegram, then advertised his May sale as he never had before. He\r\nplayed up the $50,000 Richard Fairfax sale to the limit. The free\r\nadvertising the sale got was far beyond his wildest thoughts.\r\nVirtually all the big papers carried it both here and abroad.\r\nMiss Busch, his secretary when he was Governor, and who was in\r\nParis at the time, sent him a front page of one of the large\r\nParis papers carrying the picture of Richard and Johnny.\r\n\r\nMcCray sold 120 head in his May sale. They averaged $3,636--the\r\nworld's record for sales. He sold a full brother of Richard for\r\n$23,000 and a half-brother for $7,500. He figured the brother and\r\nhalf-brother didn't stand him out over $500, so if Johnny never\r\nwas able to pay a cent of the $30,000 loan, he was still even, to\r\nsay nothing of the additional prices the remaining 118 head\r\nbrought.\r\n\r\nLet the old ex-Governor close:\r\n\r\n\"In June, I went to Johnny's sale. Instead of $1,000, they\r\naveraged $1,750. Next day I came back with a $30,000 draft, plus\r\ninterest.\"\r\n\r\nHow is that for a bull story?\r\nGood luck to you,\r\n\"Bull\" Durham\r\n\r\nTHE PLAIN WOODEN CHAIR\r\n\r\n\"Old Settlers Day\" address delivered at an annual celebration,\r\nundated.\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman, Revered Old Settlers and Visitors:\r\n\r\n. . . Primitive man lived in trees, where he rushed to safety at\r\nthe approach of danger. Directly, he learned to use a club and\r\nclimbed down from the trees and fought his way to caves for\r\nshelter. From these caves he would sally forth . . . Eventually,\r\nmen began to congregate and to band together, first as a family,\r\nthen a tribe or clan and later as a nation, and in so doing they\r\nput in practice that great fundamental truth on which is based\r\nall progress: \"In Union there is strength,\" exemplified in modern\r\ntimes by the bundle of sticks, so well known to some of us. . .\r\n\r\nOur early Pioneers in Putnam County followed the rules of conduct\r\nprescribed by their predecessors in frontier life in Kentucky,\r\nVirginia and Ohio, and followed the lines of least travel\r\nresistance, generally along watercourses--by way of Eel River, up\r\nBig Walnut and Deer Creeks--and thus throughout the County. Once\r\nlocated, and having few and distant neighbors, and with\r\ncommunication more or less difficult, a barn-raising, log-\r\nrolling, quilting bee or spelling match was an event of some\r\nmoment and not of such common experience as to be ignored.\r\n\r\nAs time wore on, roads were established; settlements became\r\nthicker; mercantile trade followed barter, and money began to\r\ncirculate and to be offered and accepted in payment; wagons and\r\nbuggies replaced saddles and saddle bags; railroads were built;\r\nnewspapers and postal service became more numerous and easier;\r\nthe telegraph and later the telephone annihilated distance;\r\nchurches and school houses sprung up; the regular preacher took\r\nthe place of the circuit rider; factory-made shoes drove out the\r\n\"pair of fine boots\"; power looms and hole-proof socks (in name\r\nonly) routed knitting needles; and so on, until now Sears-Roebuck\r\nis trying to rout everybody and everything.\r\n\r\nAll these and many, many, more advances have been inaugurated\r\nwithin the memories of many of you here today. Those among the\r\noldest of you have had the extreme good fortune of living within\r\nthe period of the last 75 years or more, when greater progress\r\nalong scientific lines has been made than was achieved in the\r\n4,000 years preceding your time. Think of it my friends! . . .\r\nWhat great good fortune has been yours!\r\n\r\nWhat progress the future has in store I cannot know. Time only\r\ncan tell, and time goes on, while you and I dwell here for\r\ncomparatively only a day. And yet, if I were required to hazard\r\nmy judgment, I should be compelled to admit I firmly believe you\r\nhave seen more beneficial progress than will fall to the lot of\r\nany individual to be born in the future. . .\r\n\r\nTo you Old Settlers this day has been set apart by the folks of\r\nthis community for your enjoyment and retrospection, and for our\r\neducation and benefit. . . And when those of us here on the\r\nprogramme have finished, we want to hear you, by word of mouth,\r\nrecall those early experiences that will forever be lost unless\r\nyou impart them, that we, in turn, may hand them down to the\r\ngenerations yet to come. They will soon be most valued\r\ntraditions. Books, paper, diaries and records have a most useful\r\nplace, but some of the things of greatest human interest are not\r\nset down in the books or records--those little touches of color\r\nand everyday heart interest, those daily privations and\r\nabstinences--they never break into chronicle, and yet furnish a\r\nlarge part of our romantic history.\r\n\r\nI have at home a chair--a plain, hand-made wooden chair with a\r\nwooden seat, with rectangular and cross red stripes, and on one\r\npanel in the back is a hand-painted bouquet of flowers in colors--\r\nall showing the hand of a careful, neat and skilled workman.\r\nUnderneath the seat is a faded and torn paper label on which is\r\nprinted \"Black and Sons, Chair Makers, Philadelphia,\r\nPennsylvania.\"\r\n\r\nJust a plain straightback wooden chair. A more elaborate one\r\ncould probably be bought now for $2. And yet, my grandfather\r\nbrought that chair to my grandmother for her parlor on horseback\r\nfrom Philadelphia to Russellville, in this County, some 80-odd\r\nyears ago, piled high on top of a big horseback load of goods.\r\nThink of the effort it took! Think of the space it took away from\r\nprofitable calico! Think of the many, many times on that\r\nthousand-mile horseback ride that grandfather looked back and\r\nfelt to see if it were coming along with the balance of the load.\r\nThink of the many times it slipped to one side or the other and\r\nhad to be retied. Think of the many nights it had to be unloaded,\r\nand the many mornings it had to be tied back on again. And\r\nlastly, my good folks, think of the joy it gave that little old\r\nwoman up at Russellville--how she showed it to the neighbors; the\r\ncare that was subsequently given it; the wonderful pleasure it\r\ngave her; and the proud feeling it secretly gave him. . . It was\r\nshe who told their children the story of that little chair.\r\n\r\nThat, my friends, is the kind of heart throb we are gradually\r\nlearning to ignore in these days of financial struggles. There\r\nare those among you, who by denying yourselves, have given your\r\nwives, sons and daughters saddle horses, pianos, automobiles and\r\neven farms--and at great sacrifice--and there are also those\r\namong you who have given your families their first iron stove, a\r\ncandle mold, calico dresses, and perhaps a little straightback\r\nwooden chair.\r\n\r\nTherefore, today let us go back. Let us forget the things to\r\nwhich we have applied ourselves too assiduously, the things that\r\nmodern conditions have forced us to adopt and strive for. For the\r\nday, at least, let us turn back to the days when you were young\r\nand this community was young: To the days when you courted and\r\nwere courted in the chinked log house before the stone fireplace;\r\nback to the time when catnip, tansy and peppers hung from the\r\nrafters; back to the days of the smoke-house with its pungent\r\ntang of hickory bark and corn cobs; when tomatoes were grown for\r\nornament and thought to be poisonous. Let us again go down to the\r\nspring house and get a bucket of water to set under the gourd on\r\nthe kitchen table. Let's stir up the fire in the fireplace, hang\r\nthe pot on the crane or test the heat in the Dutch oven; carry\r\nthe ashes out and put them in the hopper. Let's you and I and all\r\nof us go up and see how the dried apples are holding out, and\r\nthen look the hams over to see if they have any worms in them.\r\nLet us hie back to the days when all debts fell due at Christmas\r\ntime; when mortgages were useless and practically unknown, and\r\nwhen every man's word was his bond. Let's eat a dinner of bacon,\r\ncorn bread, milk and honey, and other wholesome things of those\r\ndays, on the back porch or in the summer kitchen, while the\r\nyounger girls shoo the flies off the table and the chickens off\r\nthe porch. And then tonight, after supper, let's gather around\r\nthe candle on the table, with Mother in the little chair knitting\r\nand mending with her hands, and rocking the cradle with her foot,\r\nwhile Father takes down the family Bible and piously reads a\r\nverse. Then, on our knees, and with heads bowed, let us hear that\r\nhallowed voice of Father, from whose nerveless grasp have long\r\nsince dropped the working tools of life, rise in fervent prayer\r\nto Almighty God to protect us and keep us all safe from harm.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRANDPAP'S BOURBON COUNTY BILL\r\nBy Everett A. Mahrug\r\n\r\nPap took a pen name--his own rearranged in a \"sort-of backwards\"\r\nfashion--to tell a story based on an ill-fated attempt by his\r\ngrandfather, Jacob Durham, to form a new county, with\r\nRussellville as the county seat. According to family lore, Jacob\r\nintended to place the court house on a parcel of land he owned in\r\nthe center of town, surrounded by other property he owned,\r\nincluding a store. Years later, Frank Durham gained sole title to\r\nthe \"courthouse\" property and deeded it to the town.\r\n\r\nGrandpap, Jacob Mahrug, had come from Kentucky in an \"early day\",\r\nand located his new domicile equidistant from four surrounding\r\ncounty-seat towns. He laid out a new town and named it \"Mahrug.\"\r\n\r\nIn the center of his town plat he carelessly left a large\r\n\"Square.\"\r\n\r\nAs a boy back in Kentucky, Grandpap learned the blacksmith's\r\ntrade, and followed that vocation for a while. . . At his new\r\nplace of residence he started a general store, the first store in\r\nMahrug. Both he and it prospered. He sold lots in this coming\r\ntown. The town grew. He bought and cleared, and sold and rebought\r\nfarm lands roundabout. He became a \"Squire,\" and administered\r\njustice without fear, but probably with some favor. He journeyed\r\non horseback to Cincinnati and Philadelphia to buy goods,\r\ntransporting them overland by wagon from the closest navigable\r\npoint in the chain of rivers. His store came to be the trading\r\npoint and social center for miles around. He extended \"store\r\ncredit\" anywhere and everywhere, and it was universally\r\nunderstood that Christmas Day was pay day. . .\r\n\r\nIn this environment, Grandpap started his family of four boys and\r\none girl. . . He had the first carriage and the first piano in\r\nthe county, even though Darter was the county seat and center of\r\nculture and population.\r\n\r\nHis mother back in Kentucky signifying her desire to visit him in\r\nhis new home, he sent the carriage, the two older boys and three\r\n\"hands\" back to bring her to Mahrug in State. The trip took over\r\ntwo months, and she had to wait until the next summer to find\r\nweather and roads suitable to make the return home. Back in\r\nKentucky, she advertised him and the new country so extensively\r\nthat two of her neighbors bought enough land of Grandpap that\r\nFall to make back to him all the expenses of her pilgrimage, and\r\nthen some.\r\n\r\nIn somewhat less than due time, considering his status as an\r\nimmigrant from another State, Grandpap got elected as a\r\nDemocratic member of the House, in the State Legislature. Early\r\nin the first Session, he introduced a bill to substantially\r\nincrease the Governor's salary. . . By a mere coincidence, it was\r\nreferred to the Fees and Salary Committee, of which Grandpap was\r\na member. It was unanimously reported favorably to the House by\r\nthe Committee at its first meeting after introduction. Passing\r\nthe House and Senate intact, it was reluctantly signed by the\r\nGovernor, and became law.\r\n\r\nAt the next roll call, Grandpap introduced another bill which\r\ncame to be known as the \"Bourbon County Bill.\" Its purpose was\r\naimed to accommodate the people around Mahrug with a nearer court\r\nhouse and closer county seat. Without trace of partiality, it\r\nwould simply carve a new county out of the four existing\r\ncontiguous counties to Mahrug, make Mahrug the county seat\r\nthereof, and give the new county the name of \"Bourbon\", (a name\r\nmost likely suggested by scenes from Grandpap's nativity). True,\r\nit did provide for the bonding of the territory comprising the\r\nnew county to procure funds to acquire land for and construct the\r\ncourt house, jail and other county buildings, and \"other\r\nnecessary expenses,\" but these things were naturally incident to\r\nthe formation of any new county.\r\n\r\nThrough another coincidence, the Bourbon County Bill was referred\r\nto the County and Township Business Committee, of which Grandpap\r\nwas Chairman. It was promptly reported favorably to the House by\r\nthe Committee. After some delay and a little explaining, it\r\npassed the House by a very substantial majority and went to the\r\nSenate for its action thereon. . . The Senate's County and\r\nTownship Business Committee in turn named a subcommittee to\r\n\"examine thoroughly into its merits\" The subcommittee was\r\ncomposed of two experienced and dependable members of the\r\nMajority party and a Whig member who had a bill pending for a\r\nseparate judicial court for one of his counties. . .\r\n\r\nWithin the next two or three days, Grandpap's Bourbon County\r\nBill, in some mysterious way began to take on the ear marks of an\r\n\"Administration measure.\" Therefore, it was not lightly to be\r\ncast aside. The subcommittee, in their earnest desire that\r\njustice and fairness be done, sought first hand and unbiased\r\ninformation and facts, wherever they could be found. . . and was\r\nsoon ready to report. However to make assurance doubly sure, it\r\nwas deemed advisable to finish its labors by interviewing the\r\nGovernor. . .\r\n\r\nThe Executive Chamber's heavily-upholstered, plush furniture and\r\ncushions were done in deep red. The windows were heavily\r\ncurtained in the same color. Prismatic glass pendants featured\r\nthe oilburning lamp chandelier, with three circles of 8, 16 and\r\n24-lamp capacity, the whole suspended from a liberally-adorned\r\nceiling ornament by a gilt rod of considerable tensile strength.\r\nThe walls were patriotically hung with pictures of former Chief\r\nExecutives in immense velvet-lined gilt frames of a uniform\r\ncharacter, arranged chronologically. The majority portrayed a\r\npioneer soul of stern and earnest demeanor. Some had struck a\r\nDaniel Webster pose, thus straining and disguising themselves.\r\nOthers had cherubic countenances, and were men such as slept\r\no'nights. All wore magnificent whiskers. . .\r\n\r\nThe Governor's Secretary announced the Senate County and Township\r\nBusiness Subcommittee, and discreetly retired from the Chamber.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency, that stalwart adherent to Jeffersonian\r\nprinciples, slowly arose from his desk and greeted the\r\nsubcommittee with outstretched hands. Following the usual\r\nformalities, they got down to business, and the subcommittee\r\nchairman asked the Governor his opinion on the Bourbon County\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\"Uh--m! Well, first let us see what your investigation disclosed.\r\nWhat have you found out?\"\r\n\r\n\"We find they're pretty much for it. I've talked to a good many,\r\nand so have these other gentlemen here, and about all we talk to,\r\nor see, want it. . .\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know! But is it geographically sound?\" the Governor\r\nqueried.\r\n\r\n\"Why-y, yes! They've never had an earthquake anywhere's around\r\nthere that I . . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"No. No!\", interrupted His Excellency. \"I mean do you find the\r\ncountry around there needing a court house at that particular\r\nplace? Geographically speaking?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh--h, that way! Yes, I think it does. Mahrug is over 20 miles\r\nfrom the nearest court house. And as luck would have it, there's\r\na 'Square' already laid out there in town, ready and waiting . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"And what do you learn, Senator?\" The Governor turned to the\r\nother Majority member of the subcommittee.\r\n\r\n\"I find they're all for it down there. Mahrug is over 20 miles\r\nfrom Darter, the county seat. Three big creeks separate them from\r\nit. You can't ford them in high water. And one or the other of\r\nthem is nearly always high. They're all mud roads and hard enough\r\nto get over in dry weather, and when it's wet or raining you have\r\nto take to the sides. Nine months in the year you can't get over\r\nthem, only on a horse.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused. The Governor was leaning forward in his chair, beaming\r\nat him.\r\n\r\n\"Go on, Senator!\" the Governor urged. \"You are stating some very\r\nsalient and important facts. Those are what I want to hear if I\r\nam to be of any assistance. Facts that go to the very heart of\r\nthe question! Go right ahead!\"\r\n\r\nThe Senator was both pleased and encouraged. He wanted the\r\nGovernor's good opinion. He desired to \"stand in\" with him. He\r\nhad a little bill up himself that his County Chairman was\r\ninterested in getting passed. And if it got past the Senate and\r\nHouse he wanted the Governor's signature without any quibbling.\r\nGovernors sometimes vetoed bills. He had heard it said if you\r\nknew a Governor rather intimately, there wasn't so much danger of\r\na veto. Governors were that way.\r\n\r\nHe cleared his throat and proceeded. \"There is considerable\r\nlitigation over around Mahrug, from what they say, from horse\r\nstealing on down. An apple jack still house down on Muskrat Creek\r\ncauses considerable trouble. Most of it is only hand and club\r\nfighting amongst the boys and men there in the neighborhood, but\r\nthere's coming to be more cutting and shooting lately. The\r\nauthorities down at Darter are so far away they don't pay much\r\nattention to it, or just don't care.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are coming in from Kentucky and other places, and land\r\ntrading is pretty brisk and on the boom, and every time they make\r\na trade they've got to go to the county seat to get the deeds\r\nmade. . . My investigation shows me the people down there want a\r\ncourt house, they need it, they ought to have it, and I say give\r\nit to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was a . . . most enlightening and instructive dissertation\r\non the very meat of the question,\" said the Governor. \"And you\r\nSenator?\" He swung around a trifle to face the Minority member.\r\n\"Well,\" he began in a hesitating way, \"Some say they need it and\r\nsome say they don't. . . Some of the boys on our side say there's\r\npolitics . . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"We can't help what some of them say,\" interrupted the Governor\r\nwith a slight frown of annoyance. \"What do you say.\"\r\n\r\n\". . .As I started to say, our Floor Leader is dead set against\r\nit. The counties they're cutting this new county out of are\r\nkicking like bay steers,\" (He noticed the Governor learning\r\nforward) \"but the people in the new county want it, no doubt\r\nabout that a-tall . . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"There you are!\" triumphantly exclaimed the Governor. \"That's it\r\nexactly! The people in the new county want it just like the\r\npeople in one of your counties want a separate court. And the\r\npeople in the counties it is being taken away from don't want it,\r\njust like the people of your other counties, from which this new\r\ncourt district would be carved, don't want your one county to\r\nhave it. Don't you see these two bills are alike? One is about\r\none thing and the other is about another, but the principle is\r\nthe same in both?\"\r\n\r\nA dawning sense of the similarity of the two bills swept the\r\notherwise expressionless face of the Minority member. The whole\r\nthing unrolled like a scroll. He resumed, \"As I was saying, the\r\npeople, down there want it. The community needs to be developed,\r\nand those people want a court house of their own. They need it.\r\nThat's why I made up my mind so strong when we first started out\r\nto help them get it. We're not up here for politics. The people\r\ndon't send us here for that. They sent us here to do the right\r\nthing by them. I'm for the bill! Don't forget that! I'm strong\r\nfor the bill. I've done a lot of talking over on our side. They\r\ncan't bring politics in this thing while I'm around . . . .\"\r\n\r\nHis Excellency arose majestically. He fondled his beard, adjusted\r\nhis waistcoat, cleared his throat and began, . . . \"This\r\nconference has been a mental stimulus for me. Your unerring logic\r\nhas been a revelation. Your arguments have convinced me beyond\r\nthe shadow of a doubt of the absolute merits of the bill. . . I\r\nglory in your decision to push, er, I mean pass, this bill. It\r\nmust pass. You and I shall see to it. . . I am particularly\r\npleased with the fearless and unwavering stand on the bill your\r\nMinority member has taken. As he has so well said, we are here\r\nnot as partisans, but solely as the representatives of the\r\npeople. God forbid that politics should ever enter Legislative\r\nHalls, or the Executive Chambers during my Administration! . . .\"\r\n\r\nHis Excellency excused himself momentarily, and returned with a\r\ndecanter and four ample glasses. Filling them generously, he\r\nhanded one to each of the conferees, raised his own and said,\r\n\"Let us drink in the old bourbon to the success of the new\r\nBourbon.\"\r\n\r\nThe toast was enthusiastically drunk without the aid of water or\r\nother pollutive non-essential. . .\r\n\r\nFollowing the findings and advice of the subcommittee, a general\r\nCommittee Report recommending passage soon followed, and was\r\nadopted by the full Senate, over a very scattered chorus of \"No\"\r\nvotes from the Whigs.\r\n\r\nThe bill had successfully hurdled its first major Senate hazard.\r\nThere still remained plenty of time for trouble. Second reading\r\nwas in the offing. It was then that bills were open for\r\namendments, which could, in one minute, absolutely undo almost a\r\nwhole Session's hard thought and planning. Just such an amendment\r\nas the dour Minority Floor Leader had prepared. . .\r\n\r\nThe Bourbon County Bill was put in the direct and personal charge\r\nof Senator Winker. . . He was a \"steering committee\" of one. . .\r\nHe thought and planned. He cogitated and mused. The Majority Whip\r\nwas a promising young fellow, a good mixer, and the Minority\r\nFloor Leader had taken a liking to him for some reason. The two\r\nhad a habit of disappearing somewhere about the Spencer Tavern at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nSenator Winker was cognizant of his Whip's ability, and somewhat\r\nfamiliar with his habits and associates. He sought him out and\r\nhad words with him. . . The Senator, having laid his plans and\r\nfortified himself accordingly, determined to hazard the Bourbon\r\nCounty Bill for second reading the next time that order of\r\nbusiness came around.\r\n\r\nAccording to rules, the members called various House Bills\r\nassigned to them during an alphabetical roll call of the\r\nmembership. . .\r\n\r\nWith his ear to the roll call, then approaching the S's, the\r\nMajority Whip strolled casually past the Minority Floor Leader's\r\ndesk, and with a knowing wink, whispered to him, \"Come out in the\r\ncorridor a minute. Four of your friends from over in the House\r\nwant to see you.\"\r\n\r\nThe Minority Floor Leader knew instinctively who they were and\r\nwhat they wanted. He followed his young Judas into the long\r\ncorridor to face the four gentlemen he had expected to see. The\r\nconference was merely to pledge a mutual presence at, and arrange\r\nthe minor details incident to, a friendly poker game in Room 232\r\nof the Spencer Tavern at 8 o'clock that evening.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing took less than ten minutes, but the timing, with\r\nreference to the specific thing to be accomplished, was perfect.\r\nWhen the two gamesters returned to the Senate Chamber, the\r\nBourbon County Bill had passed second reading without amendment,\r\nor offer of amendment, and the Senate was on another order of\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThus, was the second major leg of the Bourbon County Bill's\r\nflight negotiated safely. . .\r\n\r\nThe bill had been posted for third reading for more than two\r\nweeks. The Session was nearing its close. Senator Winker had\r\npurposely passed several calls wherein he could have had the bill\r\nhanded down for passage. The times had appeared inopportune. He\r\nwanted to give the Governor and Administration authorities ample\r\ntime to work on the recalcitrants. The bill was known to have\r\nstubborn opposition, and the Democrats a bare working majority.\r\nSpeaking generally, the Senate had shown itself in a surly mood\r\nlately. Several sharp clashes among the Majority members had\r\naccentuated that mood. They were not functioning smoothly. A wild\r\nidea to license the sale of intoxicants had just been fought out\r\n--and strange to relate, passed--leaving some serious political\r\nscars in its wake. There was no personal liberty left any more.\r\nThe mere thought of a fool legislature trying to legislate what a\r\nSovereign People could eat and drink was showing what the State\r\nwas coming to. Many spoke of the \"Oregon Country,\" where they\r\nstill had a little liberty left. And as always happens under such\r\ncircumstances, the Minority were all the closer knit and serene.\r\n\r\nIt was not their fight. They were not in the saddle. As a result\r\nof all this, several near-Administration measures had been killed\r\nsummarily, and apparently for no particularly good reason. Just\r\nanother quirk the legislature had about it.\r\n\r\nEventually there were signs of a change. The Legislative\r\natmosphere cleared. The Solons became more tractable. . . The\r\ntime was ripe.\r\n\r\nThe bill was called. The roll began. Something was wrong!\r\nSenators here and there, who had been counted on to vote\r\naffirmatively were voting \"no.\" The Minority member with the\r\nseparate court bill voted, \"Aye.\" The rest of the Minority seemed\r\nto be voting \"no\" solidly. Senator Winker glanced at the Minority\r\nFloor Leader. He wore an inscrutable look. No, on second glance,\r\nit was--sinister. Why? The Senator looked roundabout for the\r\nanswer. It slowly dawned there were several Democratic seats\r\nvacant.\r\n\r\nHe rushed the Whip out to find and bring in the absentee\r\nbrethren. Some came. Others could not be found. They might be in\r\nhiding. A tally was showing a considerably greater number of \"no\"\r\nvotes than \"ayes\". . .\r\n\r\nA motion to \"excuse the absentees\" prevailed. . .\r\n\r\nGrandpap's Bourbon County Bill was killed, by one vote. . .\r\nSenator Winker plumbed the depths. Back of it all, he could not\r\nforget the fact, he had nine good Majority votes unaccounted-for\r\nin the tabulation--somewhere in the Legislative wilderness. . .\r\n\r\nNext day the separate court bill met a similar fate--only more\r\ndirectly. The Minority helped do that.\r\n\r\nThe death of the Bourbon County Bill was a crushing blow to\r\nMahrug's future and Grandpap's dream. But it did one thing. It\r\nfixed, once and for all, his and our family politics, if by any\r\nchance our politics needed any stabilization. It is true that\r\nUncle Ben turned to be a Republican during the Civil War. But\r\nthat was to preserve the Union, and incidentally a considerable\r\namount of U.S. Bonds he had acquired at most attractive\r\ndiscounts. Thereafter Pap and Uncle Ben studiously avoided all\r\nmention of politics until the first Cleveland campaign. By that\r\ntime all of Uncle Ben's evidences of Federal indebtedness had\r\nbeen retired at par and accrued interest, and he was free to\r\nreturn to his first political love. . .\r\n\r\n\r\nSTICK WITH THE ARTICLES\r\n\r\nSeptember 8, 1936\r\nCurtis Publishing Company\r\nIndependence Square\r\nPhiladelphia, Penna.\r\n\r\nGentlemen:\r\nPlease let me congratulate you on this week's Post--what reading\r\nthe Sharkey, the Harding and the Dizzy Dean stories made!\r\n\r\nI realize love stories must always have the big pull, but\r\nspeaking for one who has reasonably recovered from that phase of\r\nlife, surely there must be hundreds of thousands of your other\r\nreaders who sort of skip love stories for the ARTICLES.\r\n\r\nAs a staid country lawyer, I actually stayed at home Tuesday,\r\nSeptember 1st, until after the Post had come to the house in\r\norder to finish the \"The Way I Beat Joe Louis\" story--and I've\r\nnever seen, or expect to see, a prize fight either. I liked the\r\nunusual subject and the style of the telling of the tale.\r\n\r\nTherefore: as a member of the probable great and unwashed\r\nminority, I trust you will increase the ARTICLES, although I'll\r\nbe glad when the Election is over, and Mrs. Republican and Mrs.\r\nDemocrat can stop, and political stuff generally, although the\r\nrecent Allen (or White) story on Landon was a masterpiece of\r\nshrewd political propaganda--and I'm no Republican, or\r\nProgressive, or Coughlinite, or Landonite, or much of a New Deal\r\nDemocrat, by a hell of a sight.\r\nVery Respectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE WILD WEST\r\n\r\nMay 1, 1937\r\nMr. Henry H. Miller, Atty.\r\nTitle & Trust Building\r\nPhoenix, Arizona\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. and Mrs. Miller:\r\nBack home again in Indiana, after a considerable of a sojourn for\r\na Hoosier. The unsuspecting Public, viewing me as I flow up and\r\ndown the main thoroughfare of Greencastle, little suspects that\r\nonly lately have I reveled in orange blossoms, irrigated yards,\r\ncamel-back mountains, Pima Indians, featherweight grapefruit,\r\nrattlesnake Pioneers and OVER-STUFFED lemonades. Said Public is\r\nnot cognizant I have dined (and wined) at the Arizona Club with\r\nthe flower of Phoenix Society, made a complete and minute survey\r\nof the entire northeast section of Phoenix and contended with a\r\nwestern sirloin at the Sip and Bite grand piano table,\r\nsemisurrounded with nasal singers and aesthetic dancers who would\r\nfind their acts uncomfortably chilly on an open air platform in\r\nthe environs of, say, Duluth. And further, it does not know I\r\nhave met the Great and Only S--, and been permitted in his\r\noffice, from whence emanates 80% of the Arizona corporations,\r\nabout all of which have probably lost money for the gullible\r\ninvestors.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Phoenix, my first stop was Los Angeles. Thence to\r\nSan Francisco via \"The Daylight,\" a beautifully-appointed train\r\nbut woefully short in the extreme speed. Thence to Grant's Pass,\r\nOregon, and two days with my erstwhile Putnam County political\r\nadvisor, Dr. W A. Moser--his son, Dr. C. J. Moser and wife and\r\nthree boys, about 7, 9 and 11, go to Tahiti for deep sea fishing\r\nin June; the young Doc showed me his fishing outfit, with reels\r\nabout the size of the reel on my John Deere corn planter--Thence\r\nto Portland. Then Seattle, where my old \"frater\" at Indiana 32\r\nyears ago, Adam Beeler, has just gone off the Supreme bench of\r\nWashington (thanks to the Democratic uprising)--Adam drives a '37\r\nPackard (which petered out on us about 30 miles from town), his\r\nwife sings all over the Northwest (exclusive of Democratic\r\nConventions), his daughter is divorced, and none of them seems to\r\nbe on relief--Thence to Spokane, to Wallace, Idaho, etcs., etcs,\r\nhome. . .\r\nVery Respectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nAND SHE'S GOOD LOOKING TOO\r\n\r\nJune 5, 1937\r\nTo Tri Kappa State Scholarship Committee\r\nSubject: Betty Broadstreet\r\n\r\nMembers of the Committee:\r\nCareless politicians and businessmen of easy integrity have\r\ntended to bring the present-day letter of recommendation into the\r\nclass of questionable literature, but at rare intervals each of\r\nus has an opportunity to make a recommendation whole-heartedly,\r\nand without the slightest mental reservation. Such is the subject\r\nof this letter, and I am happy to recommend Betty Broadstreet of\r\nGreencastle, Indiana, for the Tri Kappa State Scholarship. I do\r\nthis freely and with the knowledge that I can forever remain at\r\npeace with my own conscience.\r\n\r\nYour Committee wants facts. Upon investigation, I find from\r\nauthoritative sources that Betty led her Class all the time she\r\nwas in High School. This school year she had sufficient credits\r\nfor graduation at, or about, Christmas. Much to her credit she\r\ndropped out and got a job, to help continue her education in\r\nCollege. Last Friday night she graduated here.\r\n\r\nI have known this splendid young woman since early childhood. She\r\nhas about all the qualifications any young American girl can have\r\n--honesty, health, ambition, modesty, neatness, gentility,\r\nindustry and a mind that absolutely qualifies her to take a\r\nCollege education. All these are pretty hard to find combined in\r\none person, but Betty, in addition, is positively a stunningly\r\nbeautiful girl.\r\n\r\nAnd so, in my opinion, she is exactly the type and character any\r\nfather would be proud to say of her, \"She is my daughter, that\r\nred-headed one over there with the blue eyes.\"\r\n\r\nI therefore recommend her most earnestly for your serious\r\nconsideration.\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nMISTAKEN FOR DILLINGER\r\n\r\nGreencastle, Indiana\r\nAugust 27, 1937\r\nMr. George E. Pitts\r\nUnited Paperboard Company\r\n171 Madison Avenue\r\nNew York, NY\r\n\r\nMy dear Judge:\r\n\r\nThe writer is the fellow who was in your office about three weeks\r\nago consulting you concerning the transfer of some Paperboard\r\nstock, and for whom you so kindly and generously prepared an\r\naffidavit for the surviving widow to execute.\r\n\r\nI thought you might be interested in the trials and tribulations\r\nof a hill-billy clean out of his environment, trying to make his\r\nway about town with a minimum of errors.\r\n\r\nAfter inquiring of about every policeman in New York where 171\r\nMadison Avenue was, my trusty grip and I eventually came to your\r\ndoor. . . And say! You folks aren't wasting the stockholders'\r\nmoney on any elaborate waiting-room. There she was, 6 by 12,\r\nthree chairs, one settee, one high-up electric fan doing a noble\r\njob stirring up that hot 7th floor atmosphere, three Sawmill\r\njournals and a 2 x 2 peep-hole, like the ticket window of the B&O\r\nR.R. here at Russellville, my old home town. The grip and I both\r\ngot in, but every place I tried to set it down it looked like it\r\nwould take up the space for a second customer if he happened to\r\ncome in just then.\r\n\r\nA girl looked through the ticket window at us--especially the\r\ngrip--and I realized my mistake. I had the knowledge that John\r\nDillinger was raised about 30 miles southeast of here, and that\r\nhe had sometimes carried grips, and that maybe she had gotten us\r\nconfused. She asked what I wanted. I told her I wanted to\r\ntransfer some stock and wanted to see the head of the Legal\r\nDepartment. She told me she could take care of the stock\r\ntransfer. I started to explain, and she started to explain, so we\r\nboth explained. Finally, either due to the altitude or the heat,\r\nor something, I was supplementing the fan with the new $7.50\r\npanama I had just bought at Macy's in order to get a New York\r\nlabel to show my admiring friends when I got home, and I begged\r\nher to just let me see some official of the Company. She\r\nrelented, and a first class fellow came forth, not to the peep-\r\nhole, but right to where the grip and I were. I started to\r\nexplain, and he started to explain, so we both explained. By that\r\ntime I had the hat synchronized with the fan. Eventually, he got\r\nmy idea--but the President was out, the Vice-Presidents were on\r\nvacation, and the attorney might get in around 3:30 p.m. or he\r\nmight not, and would I wait or go out and come back later. If so,\r\nhe would do his best to get a conference for me. I told him if I\r\ngot out, I'd never find my way back, and that I would wait.\r\n\r\nBy that time my curiosity was at a maximum and I was wild to get\r\non the other side of that ticket window, because I knew the place\r\nhad to be lousy with red leather chairs, air-conditioning, ice\r\nwater bottles, Chinese rugs and baled-up currency.\r\n\r\nAll things must come to an end. In due course I passed the\r\nforbidding door and was ushered into your office--after first\r\nhaving my grip taken away from me and deposited at the peep-hole\r\ngirl's desk. And that grip is an inoffensive grip. In fact, it\r\nwas given me by the members of the Legislature one time when I\r\nwas the alleged Floor-Leader of what was then God's Chosen\r\nMinority--the Senate Democrats. Since I left, they--the\r\nDemocrats--have perked-up and now have a big majority themselves.\r\n\r\nBut, to be serious, I want to thank you for the way you handled\r\nmy case. You certainly know how to size up a situation quickly. I\r\nrealize big Corporations must use all reasonable precautions when\r\nit comes to transferring stock, etcs., but there's reason in all\r\nthings. You have been almost more than fair in your demands. You\r\nare not our conception of what a New Yorker is, and especially a\r\nNew York attorney. Why, my-God, man! We've always been taught to\r\nfirst come to a full stop before going up the ramp at Grand\r\nCentral Station, and sew our modest currency rolls on the inside\r\nof our underwear.\r\n\r\nI hereby extend you an invitation to come out and rabbit hunt\r\nwith me this Fall, with the reservation that you furnish your own\r\nblister medicine and liniment. I'll furnish all board, bed, guns,\r\ndogs and ammunition.\r\nAgain, I thank you.\r\nVery Respectfully\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOSPITAL NEEDS A CHECK-UP.\r\n\r\nThe following two letters relate to Pap's experience at losing\r\nmore money than he had counted on during a visit to the hospital.\r\n\r\nAugust 10, 1939\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. & Mrs. Cunningham:\r\nYou are probably slightly interested in knowing how I came out in\r\nmy run-in with the Methodist Hospital over my hospital bill and\r\nsome money I lost. I am therefore enclosing Benson's letter to me\r\nand a copy of one I just mailed him.\r\n\r\nGeorge, I want to thank you for being willing to say just what\r\nyou knew and saw about my having any money on me at the time of\r\nthe accident, because by reason of what you saw and knew, I just\r\nhad to have two $1 bills and some other money in a bill or bills.\r\nThose facts helped write the enclosed letter to Benson. Then too,\r\nyou know how a jury goes in a hotel run-in with somebody who\r\nisn't worth much, or anything. You don't have a chance. Same way\r\nwith a hospital or a railroad. It's too bad it is that way, but\r\nit is.\r\n\r\nAnd now Mrs. Cunningham.. . . I don't know what was the matter\r\nwith my mental processes last Tuesday noon when I was in the\r\nhotel and called you. I knew I was going straight in to eat with\r\nIke--I'd much rather have eaten with you--but I never thought of\r\nasking you to come along and break bread with me. And now listen\r\nhow I thereby missed an opportunity to advance my social\r\nstanding. When I got in, there was our Labor-loving Democratic\r\nState Chairman feeding his brother and some other \"loyal\r\nDemocratic worker\" off of our famous 2% Club money, over on one\r\nside, and John Frenzel over in the corner feeding himself off of\r\nusurious interest money he had wrangled out of some unfortunate\r\nborrower. We'll cut out the Organized Labor-loving State Chairman\r\nand get to Frenzel, who is somebody--as a man and every other way\r\nincluding a whale of a good Banker with a whale of a good Bank.\r\nNow just suppose I had been escorting you into the dining\r\nroom--you and your stately and dignified walk and manner, and\r\nFrenzel had looked up through a cigarette smoke fog. He wouldn't\r\nhave believed his eyes. He'd have said to himself: \"My G--, that\r\ncan't be her with Andy Durham from that little jerk water bank\r\ndown in Russellville. Yes it is, sure as I'm of German\r\nextraction! W-e-l-l, next time he comes in my place I'll not have\r\nthe police lead him out like I wanted to do last time he was in.\r\nI'll bring him right back behind the rail to my desk and get\r\nbetter acquainted with him. He just has to be somebody--although\r\nhe sure doesn't look it, and I'd never have guessed it.\"\r\n\r\nSee what an opportunity I missed if I could have had you along\r\nI'll never do it again, even if I have to pay for a rum sour or\r\nwhatever it is you get to go with your meals.\r\nAs ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust 10, 1939\r\nJohn C. Benson, Superintendent\r\nMethodist Episcopal Hospital\r\nIndianapolis, Indiana\r\n\r\nMy dear John:\r\n. . . Your adjustment offer on my hospital bill, under the\r\ncircumstances, would seem fair to any disinterested person. You\r\noffered to reduce the bill by $24.35, and I insisted my loss was\r\neither $27 or $32, not knowing which myself--which looks rather\r\nbad on its face, for me.\r\n\r\nBut John, as sure as Meharry Hall is in the middle campus, and\r\nthe Democrats are God's chosen, some low fellow (I'd ordinarily\r\nuse a four-word combination we use and thoroughly understand over\r\nat Russellville to characterize certain men folks) there at your\r\nhospital rifled my clothes--and got either $27 or $32 in bills.\r\nThe last thing I did before leaving Mooresville the night of the\r\naccident was to pull out my modest roll and give Doc White a $5\r\nbill, and he gave me back two $1 bills, that I folded with the\r\nothers and then put in my little watch, or ticket pocket, in the\r\nupper front part of my britches. Mr. George Cunningham, manager\r\nof the Claypool Hotel, saw that, and so did Doc White of\r\nMooresville, I think. Then Mr. Cunningham and his wife and I got\r\nin his car, Mr. Cunningham in the front seat driving, and Mrs.\r\nCunningham and I in back, and went direct to your place. Mr.\r\nCunningham couldn't have robbed me, and wouldn't have if he could\r\n(there's some wording for you); it would be heresy to think Mrs.\r\nC. would (if you know her); anybody would have to be a hell of a\r\nsight worse off than I was to go broadcasting $1 bills enroute to\r\na place like yours, knowing full well if he had any sense at all\r\nthat if he stayed there a week he'd have to mortgage the back 40\r\nto get paid out. So that last theory is plumb out. And all that\r\nremains is the aforesaid \"low fellow.\"\r\n\r\nThe weak spot in my whole story is expecting the other fellow to\r\nbelieve me, and me alone as to just how much I had in money. I\r\ndon't like to be in that position. I wouldn't want the other\r\nfellow to expect me to take his word for what he had. That's\r\nsomething like our railroad troubles. I've been attorney here for\r\nthe New York Central since about 1916. In all that time we've\r\nnever killed any live stock that wasn't a thoroughbred. All\r\nrailroad attorneys get used to that and expect it. So four or\r\nfive years ago the Springfield, Ill., Division of the B & O that\r\nruns through my farm at Russellville (and whose trains on that\r\nparticular division run more by the compass than on the rails)\r\nkilled my registered Hereford bull with one of its passenger\r\ntrains. I knew their General Attorney at Cincinnati quite well,\r\nso I wrote him the facts and ended by saying, \"and as is usual in\r\nrailroad cases, he was a thoroughbred.\" Right back came his\r\nanswer: \"Your thoroughbred bull has nothing on us. We want you to\r\ndistinctly understand ours is a thoroughbred train\". But he paid\r\nme on a thoroughbred basis.\r\n\r\nAs the man on the farm says when he starts to give me advice:\r\n\"Now, I don't want to tell you how to run your business, but I'd\r\ndo so and so\", so now in like manner I want to urgently request\r\nthat you check up on everybody who handled my clothes from the\r\ntime they took them from me in the X-ray room, or whatever it\r\nwas, until the clothes got back in my room, and keep a watch on\r\nhim or them. . . Whoever did it to me will try it again.\r\n\r\nAnd now, I do have a request to make, and it's for my own\r\nbenefit. Please call Mr. Cunningham at the Claypool and see if my\r\nstory about the money is in fact true insofar as he knows. Then\r\nquestion Doc White next time he comes in. . . Anybody who is\r\nanybody would want to furnish as much outside proof as he might\r\nbe able to get. Now John, don't come back at me by saying you\r\ndon't have to ask Mr. Cunningham and Doc White because you\r\nbelieve everything I say, like Mr. Hess did over the telephone.\r\nSomehow that sort of nettled me. Mr. Hess doesn't know me from Al\r\nCapone. I'm serious in what I ask, and I'm going to check-up on\r\nyou, old timer . . .\r\nRespectfully,\r\nAndrew Durham\r\n\r\n\r\nASKING HELP WITH MONEY\r\n\r\nSeptember 25, 1939\r\nMr. Wilbur O. C--,\r\nLebanon, Indiana\r\n\r\nMy Dear Wib:\r\nI was in Lebanon the other day and called you, but your good wife\r\nsaid you were in Lafayette.\r\n\r\nWib, here is what I wanted to see you about. Frank is in Law\r\nSchool and needs new clothes. I am in need of some money badly,\r\nand want you to help me out all you can. I am enclosing a copy of\r\nyour note, with all the credits on the back. I am also enclosing\r\na blank note. I had Ward Mayhall, down at Central National Bank\r\nfigure out the balance of principal and interest as of Sept. 21,\r\n1939--$157.55 on that date. So please send me a check for all you\r\npossibly can, and if you can't pay all, then please date the\r\nblank note, make it payable in thirty days like the old one, and\r\nfor such sum as is the difference between what your check amounts\r\nto and the sum of $157.55; sign and send to me along with the\r\ncheck, and I will be greatly obliged. The old note is simply\r\ncovered with Intangible Stamps, with no room to put on any more\r\ncredits. . .\r\nCordially,\r\n\r\n\r\nOctober 30, 1939\r\nMr. Wilbur O. C.\r\nRochester, Indiana\r\nCare of Barrett Hotel\r\n\r\nMy Dear Wib:\r\nI am enclosing the note dated October 1, 1939 which you sent me\r\nsome weeks ago, for the reason it does not seem to be drawn\r\nproperly. The figures show the amount to be $160, but the writing\r\nshows an even $100. The former seems to be right.\r\n\r\nI have been getting ready for Joan's wedding in New York next\r\nmonth, and have not had time to make this explanation and get a\r\nletter off to you until now. And anyway, it has been a month now\r\nand perhaps you can send me a check for something at the same\r\ntime you execute the enclosed new note and send it back to me.\r\nThe Lord knows I am in need of cash at this time--in fact I have\r\nbeen needing cash about all my life it would appear. . .\r\n\r\nWhen I get the new note back in the correct amount, I will cancel\r\nthe old one that is all gummed-up with Intangibles.\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nIT'S NO PICNIC\r\n\r\nNovember 15, 1939\r\n\r\nMy dear Miss Robbins:\r\nAbout the time you are perusing this tender missive, we and our\r\noversized family will be on the \"Southwestern\" en route New York\r\nCity and Joan's wedding, which latter will occur at St.\r\nBartholomew's at 4 p.m. on the afternoon of the eve of Lord's Day\r\nnext.\r\n\r\nLet me tell you about another trip on the same Southwestern that\r\nhappened about 14 years ago. Joan was 13 and Sugar Foot still\r\ngetting regular eye doses of boric acid, and Ann Drew just out of\r\nthe boric acid period, and so on up the line, when the Fair\r\nCalantha, as was her custom from time immemorial, started on\r\nsafari via New York to Milford, Penna. She had passes--but what\r\npasses! Not good on Number this, and not good on No. that. In\r\ndesperation I went to the General Superintendent, good old B.C.\r\nByers, told him my troubles, and asked if he would make them good\r\non the Knickerbocker. He looked at the passes, then at me, and\r\nsaid: \"Why, you've only got walking passes.\" He thought a minute,\r\nthen: \"A woman with six little children has no business getting\r\ninto New York City at 3 or 4 p.m.--then across town and the ferry\r\nto Jersey City, then by Erie to Port Jervis, N.Y., and then by\r\nauto into the mountains. Give me those passes. I'll make them\r\ngood on No. 12. I'll make your reservations, and I'll have No. 12\r\nstop at Greencastle and pick them up.\" All the which he did.\r\n\r\nThe train stopped, and old man Keith happened to be the\r\nconductor. He was in a huff about having to stop his long heavy\r\ntrain at any town like Greencastle. He stood to one side and the\r\npatrons started climbing up the steps: Mother, nurse, kids,\r\nboxes, suit cases, bird cages, more kids, grips, violin cases,\r\ndolls, milk, kids, a kitten, lunch boxes and more kids. He turned\r\nto me and asked, \"Is this a picnic or a family?\"\r\n\r\nI said: \"It's a family--and they're no picnic by a d-- sight.\"\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n\r\nAUNT MARGARET'S SPLASH IN JOURNALISM\r\n\r\nDecember 3, 1939\r\n\r\nMy dear Julia and Anna:\r\nI saw a couple of \"features\" written by Joan and published in\r\ntoday's Indianapolis Sunday Star, so I clipped them, and here\r\nthey are. One uses her own by-line, and the other \"Betty Clarke.\"\r\nIf I get the story right, some Betty Clarke wrote for the\r\nAssociated Press on cosmetics, etc. Her successors have used that\r\nsame name in turn. When Joan writes on foods, she uses a by-line\r\nof a \"Mrs.\" somebody--I don't know the name--because a younger\r\nunmarried woman now-a-days knows practically nothing about foods\r\nand wouldn't be believed, or taken seriously. . .\r\n\r\nWell, as you know, Joan was married in St. Bartholomew's Church\r\n(Episcopal) in New York City Nov. 18 last. She married a William\r\nH. (Taft) McGaughey, as you may already know if you read Walter\r\nWinchell's column of Nov. 5th, I think it was. \"Bill\" is a former\r\nDePauw boy, a Phi Gam., graduated here about 1932. Was a reporter\r\nfor the Indianapolis News after leaving school, then to the New\r\nYork Herald-Tribune, I think it was; then on the Wall Street\r\nJournal, and now is Editor of the American Automobile\r\nManufacturers Association Magazine, or some such name. Heretofore\r\nit has been edited in New York, but after January 1st next, they\r\nmove him and the magazine, and Joan, etc., to Detroit, Mich.,\r\nwhere the magazine will continue to be published. Therefore, if I\r\nunderstand it right, Joan will lose her job with A.P, and become\r\na housewife--Good Gosh A'mighty!!--Giving up a job like that to\r\nbecome anybody's housewife--I don't care who, or where he comes\r\nfrom--and just when she had struck her stride. Understand I'm not\r\nkicking--he's a fine young fellow and alright in every\r\nparticular, so far as I know and can learn. I'm just thinking out\r\nloud. . .\r\n\r\nWe were all at the wedding--the whole family, including Aunt\r\nMargaret, Sarah Jane and her husband. We stayed at the Waldorf-\r\nAstoria, just across the street from St. Bartholomew's . . . and\r\notherwise disported ourselves as Russellville blue-bloods. And\r\nthat reminds me of Aunt Margaret's splurge in the realm of\r\njournalism (Aunt Margaret lives at Russellville). Well, when Aunt\r\nM. learned Joan was to be married, she wrote Joan a real homey\r\nletter about it, including therein a recital of what she did in\r\npreparation for her own wedding years and years ago; that she\r\nbegan preparations a year ahead, made towels, spreads, dish\r\ncloths, muslin garments (I don't know what she meant by that)\r\netc., saying she had some of them yet and about as good as new.\r\nYou know the secret, if it was that--Aunt M. tried to \"learn\" the\r\ngirls to be economical. . . She went on to say she hoped Joan and\r\nher husband would be well and happy, and would try to make home\r\ntheir chief object in life. And so on, in that sort of vein.\r\n\r\nWhat do you suppose Joan did with that letter? She turned it over\r\nto another A.P Feature writer, and he sent it out over the whole\r\nworld about as follows: \"A very charming young woman I know here\r\nin New York is about to be married. Her old-fashioned aunt out in\r\nRussellville, Indiana, wrote her a letter about marriage, which\r\nin view of the present day stress and strain and disregard of\r\nmarriage vows, we think deserves a wider publicity. Here it is.\"\r\nThen he quoted the letter. The Greencastle paper got hold of the\r\nrelease and printed it. Aunt Margaret got hold of the Greencastle\r\npaper and almost swooned. When she got to New York for the\r\nwedding, she found she was a famous writer and almost swooned\r\nagain. Then she got sort of tickled and concluded it might make\r\nsome of these young persons think, and eventually do some good. I\r\nhave no copy, or I would send it. At the time, I was so busy\r\nrigging up my own treasseau, or however you spell it, I didn't\r\ntake time to save any copy.\r\n\r\nI think I should tell you about my wedding-clothes troubles.\r\nJoan's was my third wedding. When Sarah Jane married two years\r\nago she wanted an evening wedding at Gobin Memorial Church here.\r\nThat called for a dress suit for the old man. Mine was of the\r\n1910 vintage. I thought that wasn't so terrible bad, but when I\r\ngot it separated from the moth balls and camphor, I found that\r\none or the other of them, or both, had tended to shrink it\r\ntremendously. Whatever it was seemed to have centered the attack\r\non the waist band of the pants. Then too, some \"low comedian\"\r\nhere at the house said the lapels looked like those of an \"end\r\nman\" in a Russellville home talent minstrel, and another said the\r\ntails were too short and seemed blunt and worn off, like an old\r\nfeather duster. Now that couldn't be, because practically the\r\nlast time I wore it was at my own wedding. I had put a telegram\r\nin an inside pocket--and there it was: \"Veedersburg, Indiana,\r\nNovember 24, 1910. Sorry we can't be there but we're with you to\r\na man. Congratulations. Fred S. Purnell.\" Well, we wound up in a\r\none-sided compromise--a new dress suit from Bro. McMurray, 201\r\nBoard of Trade Bldg., Indpls, Ind.\r\n\r\nAlong came Joan wanting a 4 p.m. St. Bartholomew's wedding. That\r\ncalled for a \"cut-away.\" So again I went to interview Bro.\r\nMcMurray. He was delighted and thoroughly in favor. When I went\r\nup for a try-on, while Bro. McMurray was chalk-marking here and\r\nthere, I took a hurried look in the glass, and Holy Nellie! What\r\nI saw took me back instantly to \"Old Prince\" at Russellville. Old\r\nPrince is a 26-year-old faded-out black work horse I own,\r\nspavined, two splints and stiff as Mrs. Stuyvesant Fish. In that\r\ncutaway, I looked like Old Prince in a set of track harness.\r\n\r\nI hope Margaret marries before the Japanese take the country, and\r\nthat Ann doesn't decide on a grass dress.\r\n\r\nSomehow, somewhere, sometime, this family will have to go into a\r\nhuddle on these wedding signals, or I'm going to find myself with\r\na lot of uniforms--and no clothes.\r\nYours for more clothes and fewer costumes,\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSELLVILLE HAS GOOD CREDIT AT THE WALDORF\r\n\r\nMarch 17, 1940\r\nMr. B. C. Byers\r\n1150 Oakwood Ave.\r\nDayton, Ohio\r\n\r\nMy dear B.C.:\r\nWell! Well! Well! I'm threatening to do a thing I've been\r\nthreatening for about a year--write you a letter. . .\r\n\r\nJoan was married Nov. 18th, 1939 in St. Bartholomew's Church\r\n(Episcopal), corner 51st and Park Avenue, New York City, across\r\nthe street from the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Her parental father\r\nand his family retinue, large and small, married and unmarried,\r\nwere hosteled on the 12th floor of the Waldorf. And you can\r\nimagine what a stir among the employees we simple country folks\r\nmade. They had seen nothing like us in that place since its\r\ncorner stone was laid, and they haven't since. . .\r\n\r\nDr. Oxnam's (now Bishop Oxnam, stationed at Boston) wife and\r\ndaughter were to be our guests at the Hotel in our suite of rooms\r\ncount them, 8 of them. The Bishop was to have been present to\r\ngive a prayer--Joan had graduated at De Pauw when he was\r\nPresident there--but old St. Bartholomew said: \"No. No Methodist,\r\nor other cult, can pray at an Episcopal Church wedding. We run\r\nthe Church, and incidentally the wedding, and what praying is\r\ndone, we'll do.\" So the Bishop got sort of miffed and went on to\r\nArizona ahead of time.\r\n\r\nThe wedding was at 4 p.m., the reception immediately following.\r\nJoan was a feature writer on the Associated Press in New York\r\nCity--a splendid job. Naturally her associates were newspaper\r\nfolks and writers, mostly men, who knew Kentucky Tavern from\r\nCoca-Cola. The wedding reception was to be held in the New York\r\nNewspaper Women's Club in the Midston House (hotel near\r\nRockefeller Center). It had a bar, and Joan somehow got the silly\r\nidea it was the duty of the bride's father, for this occasion, to\r\nstock that bar with tools having an alcoholic content. . . So we\r\nbrought along the main feature of the reception refreshments: 8\r\nquarts in my grips, 8 in Frank's, 4 in Munny's, 4 in Margaret's,\r\nand Sir Walter Scott Behmer brought 3.\r\n\r\nMrs. Oxnam was to know nothing about it. She didn't--until she\r\nstepped into the Club rooms. Then anyone would know it, unless he\r\nhad spent a lifetime refereeing skunk-squirting contests.\r\n\r\nOld man Thomas, I think his name is, formerly Editor of the New\r\nYork Times, now a sort of newspaperman head of the Pulitzer\r\nSchool of Journalism, and who had Joan in his classes when she\r\nwent to that school, got tight and went all around telling the\r\nguests his great grandpappy was half Indian. His good old wife\r\nstayed sober, and as a result sprained an ankle on the scuffed-up\r\nrug. The woman Editor of Vogue, or else one of its principal\r\nwriters, kissed me because she said I looked like her cousin who\r\nhad his leg shot off in the Spanish-American War. In the\r\nexcitement I kissed Mary Beth Plummer--top woman writer on the\r\nAssociated Press and incidentally about the best looking--just to\r\nshow my good taste.\r\n\r\nEarly in the game, Munny saw what was coming. So she shepherded\r\nMrs. Oxnam and daughter away early. They put the daughter to bed.\r\nThen went out on their own, and in some unaccountable manner got\r\ninto the bar of the Hotel, saw what they had done--and ordered\r\nlemonade. All Munny needed to complete the picture was a basket\r\nof eggs on one arm and a fresh dressed chicken under the other.\r\n\r\nMy Gosh! But we had a time.\r\n\r\nWhat with buying extra booze, taxi-cabbing everybody all over\r\nHell's Half Acre, eating in the \"Cert Room,\" which was named for\r\nsome famous Spanish painter, or paperhanger, and tipping hundreds\r\n(it seemed), I thought I might run low in cash. So I slipped\r\nquietly around to a room labeled \"Credit Manager,\" walked in and\r\nsaw this woman sitting in the big chair. She saw the surprise on\r\nmy face, smiled and said: \"I am the Credit Manager. Are you\r\nlooking for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is Durham. I live in Indiana, and they're taking it away\r\nfrom me around here faster than they do back home on Thursdays at\r\nthe main gate of our County Fair. I may run out of money, and I\r\nwant to know how I'd go about getting a draft cashed, if I had\r\nto.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I see the draft?\"\r\n\r\nI pulled out the bill fold, fetched out a $50 draft, and sure\r\nenough there it was in big letters, RUSSELLVILLE BANK, payable to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nShe looked at it, then at me quizzically, and said: \"Are you the\r\nfather of Joan Durham, the Feature Writer who was married\r\nyesterday over at St. Bartholomew's. I read her AP features.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes mam,\" I said proudly, \"I'm her Pap.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you any sort of identification card, letter, driver's\r\nlicense, or something to identify you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, mam. I have a bad note on Peter M-- back at Russellville\r\nfor $20 I wish somebody would collect, a membership card in the\r\nPutnam County Farm Bureau and a New York Central pass\"--\r\ncautiously saving the best for the last.\r\n\r\n\"The pass will be sufficient.\" She looked at it and then at me\r\nand said: \"We will cash the draft any time you want it cashed--\r\nnow, if you want it.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said, \"but if that won't run me, is there any way to cash\r\nchecks?\"\r\n\r\nWe talked quite a bit--about Russellville (which she never heard\r\nof), the wedding, the Hotel, farming, cattle and hogs, etc.\r\n\r\nEventually she said: \"We'll cash checks for you up to $1,000, Mr.\r\nDurham.\"\r\n\r\nWell. By that time she was far, far ahead of me, so I tried to\r\ncatch up. \"Miss\", I said, \"how long have you been Credit Manager\r\nhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"About six years\", she said. \"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because you won't be Credit Manager very much longer, giving out\r\ncredit that way.\"\r\n\r\nThen she did throw the witty bombshell. She said:\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Durham, no one from Russellville ever gave this hotel\r\na bad check yet.\"\r\n\r\nAnd after a little more talk, in which she bragged, for my\r\nbenefit, how she could tell people who wouldn't give bad checks,\r\nI left and went upstairs and bragged to Munny how Morgan, Loeb\r\nand I could cash checks at the Waldorf--just like that. . .\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n\r\nHAVEN'T YOU EVER HEARD A RADIO?\r\n\r\nMarch 19, 1940\r\n\r\nMy dear Mrs. Cunningham:\r\nAfter the very kind and considerate treatment received from you,\r\nHarlan and his wife during my rather short stay in Miami, you\r\nmust be thinking I am an ingrate for not writing sooner, but the\r\nfact is, I've blamed near been sick all the time since leaving\r\nthere. Coming home I was a trifle dizzy for a day or so, but I\r\nattribute all that to those two singers who broadcasted from your\r\nmusic room that Sunday night. Good old Walter sized up my trouble\r\nin his efficient way, and knowing my background, realized those\r\ngirls coupled with Miami's metropolitan hours and night life\r\nwould make any native of Russellville dizzy. And so, he drove\r\npractically all the way home. . .\r\n\r\nPassing through Jonesville, a town about like Waverly, Walter saw\r\na sign, \"Home Cooking.\" Of course we stopped and went in. A\r\nhill-billying radio in the kitchen made the dining room hideous\r\nwith its squawking. The Old Brakeman asked for grits, fish and\r\nsea food. He got boiled side-pork, boiled cabbage, boiled beans\r\nand corn bread. And later he was to get what was advertised as\r\npie, but looked like unto no pie I had seen in my 58 years of\r\nactive pie viewing.\r\n\r\nI asked the waitress: \"Where is that terrible noise coming from?\"\r\nWith a puzzled expression, she answered: \"Why that's the radio.\"\r\nThen something dawned, her face lighted and she asked: \"Haven't\r\nyou ever heard a radio before?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it a bird or an animal,\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Neither one,\" said she. \"It's a little box you turn on and the\r\nmusic comes out. Ain't you ever seen one? We turn it on of a\r\nmornin' and it plays all day.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. But if we came this way again and brought company, would you\r\nturn it off while we're eating?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shore will,\" she said--and she meant it.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing was among the lesser highlights of our trip\r\nstraight home. . .\r\n\r\nWas in Detroit last week. Saw Joannie, husband and apartment. The\r\nhusband is as big as the apartment is small. It's an up and\r\ndownstairs affair. Little stairway from living room upstairs. The\r\nwhole thing is about the size of a smallish hen-house, the upper\r\nfloor representing the roosts.\r\nAs ever,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV: THE WAR YEARS--1942-1945\r\n\r\nPap was way too old for active involvement in World War Two. He\r\nhad to be content watching his children play their parts (Frank\r\nand Margaret both joined the Armed Service, although the latter\r\nhad to be consoled after being initially turned down for a\r\ncommission). Pap's sideline role did not deter him from making\r\nwry observations about professed patriotism on the part of the\r\nlegislature (\"political hooey\") and the effects of war on the\r\nhome front (shortages, black market activity, travel restrictions\r\nand inflation).\r\n\r\nHe also kept in touch through the mail with his scattered\r\nchildren and his wife. Despite the difficulties of wartime\r\ntransportation, \"Munny\" insisted upon making her annual summer\r\nexcursions to Milford, Pennsylvania, to attend to property\r\ninherited from her parents. This caused Pap a bit of anxiety, as\r\nhe feared for her comfort but did not wish to take undue\r\nadvantage of his railroad pass perquisites. He also felt lonely\r\nat home alone, as his youngest daughter, Aura May, left for\r\ncollege. In some of his strongest letters, he expressed concern,\r\nusually with humor but sometimes quite poignantly, that family\r\nmembers should not interfere with each other's pending marital\r\nplans.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, Pap tended to the farm, his lobbyist duties, and wrote\r\na newspaper ad celebrating the 50th anniversary of the\r\nRussellville Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOT TRYING IS WORSE\r\n\r\nAdvice to a daughter turned down for a naval commission.\r\n\r\nSept. 3, 1942\r\n\r\nDear Margaret:\r\nI was sorry to hear you hadn't made the grade and didn't get what\r\nyou want, but I would have been much sorrier if you hadn't tried.\r\nThat's what gets me--this not trying. And while you may be quite\r\na bit disappointed, you tried all the same, and that is the thing\r\nthat counts much, much more.\r\n\r\nOf all things, I never thought I would have a daughter in the\r\nArmy or Navy, but now that things have happened as they have, and\r\nwomen are going into the War, why, I'm getting used to most\r\nanything. . .\r\n\r\nI'm not saying that you should be in the Navy, not at all, but if\r\nI were you and I wanted in, I'd keep pecking away until I got in.\r\n. . . You said something about them wanting you to try for\r\nsomething like a job as a \"private\" in the Army. I am rather\r\ninclined to think you did right in not accepting that offer. You\r\nhave an education, and better still, you have an ability that\r\nshould rate you better than that of a private. It is true all of\r\nus can't be \"Generals,\" but with your ability, your common sense\r\nand a world of other good qualities, you, if you want to, and\r\nwill stick with it, will be able to get in WAVE, or whatever it\r\nis, from some other State--Indiana, for instance. There is a lot\r\nof bologna in this War, like all others, and I am told on good\r\nauthority that it takes a political set-up to get the best. . .\r\nHonestly, when I heard you were trying Pennsylvania, I rather\r\nthought you would not be in the running. It just don't make sense\r\nfor an Indiana girl to get a job like you wanted in the face of\r\nwomen (natives) in the second most populous State in the Union. .\r\n. Now above all things, don't repeat what I have said, and by no\r\nmeans give such as an excuse for missing the boat at\r\nPhiladelphia, just keep mum, keep your own counsel, profit by\r\nyour experience and keep on trying in every way you can. If I get\r\na chance I'll get to Indianapolis and try to learn what WAVE is\r\ndoing in Indiana, if anything. I have been so busy, I haven't had\r\ntime to go any place or do anything except keep the farms going,\r\nwhich is a big job.\r\nLet me hear from you.\r\nPap\r\n\r\n\r\nHELPING THE WAR EFFORT\r\n\r\nAug. 2, 1942\r\n\r\nDear Frank:\r\nThere is not much news to tell you. We are more than busy at the\r\nfarm. . .\r\n\r\nI should tell you about an experience I had yesterday. The rain\r\nstopped us combining oats on No. 43 shortly after dinner. I came\r\nhome early in the afternoon. Stopped in the Post Office to see if\r\nthere was any mail. Doc. Sigler the Veterinarian was in there.\r\nMaybe you know him. If not, then you should. He is windy, used to\r\nrun a saloon here years and years ago, and therefore is an\r\nauthority as he thinks on all things alcoholic. Doc was in a\r\ntalkative mood. \"Have you tried the new beer, Durm?\" he asked. I\r\nsaid I had not, and what was it. Then he proceeded to tell me. It\r\nis really old time keg beer put up in bottles--half gallon\r\nbottles. It is unpasteurized, and it saves caps and thus helps\r\nwin the War. He was insistent that I try just one bottle. It was\r\nto be had at Robert Hoffman's storage plant--this unpasteurized\r\nbeer has to be kept cold.\r\n\r\nNaturally I wanted to help win the War, so I went outside, got in\r\nthe Mercury and headed for Hoffman's storage plant on North\r\nIndiana Street. There was Robert and his helper, Jim Allen. . . I\r\nasked their opinion, and they both agreed it was the Wonder of\r\nthe Age.\r\n\r\nIf one bottle was good, then more would be better, so I bought\r\nthree. Then, as a sort of hedge, and to be on the safe side, and\r\nbeing that I was already there, I bought a case of Cook pints, as\r\nI knew what they were, and came home, put the case on the kitchen\r\nradiator and the three half gallon bottles of Doc\r\nSigler-recommended, unpasteurized Champagne-Velvet beer in the\r\nice box and awaited developments.\r\n\r\nLater I went to the Lincoln for supper, then tarried downtown a\r\nbit and started home. Pearl O'Hair was on her front porch and\r\ncalled to me. I went down and courted her until after dark, then\r\nthought of my Champagne-Velvet Doc. Sigler-recommended\r\nunpasteurized beer in half gallon bottles that help win the War,\r\nand came home. I reached in where we used to keep milk, pulled\r\none out and it looked bigger than a blockbusting bomb. I got the\r\nbiggest glass in the house and poured it full. It tasted rather\r\nalright, so I took another sample. Then others. The bottle stood\r\nthe drain unusually well. Then I found a rubber stopper, inserted\r\nit, put the bottle back in the ice box and came in the front room\r\nto read the News. Then back to the half gallon bottle of\r\nunpasteurized amber fluid. That bottle \"gave down\" like a six-\r\nyear-old Holstein with a new calf. . . Another round or so and we\r\ncalled \"recess\" for me to go out on the front porch for air. But\r\nduty called me back to the bottle. By that time I could see I was\r\ngaining slightly, and would eventually win if I kept up my\r\nmorale. But it was a horse race with bets about even. Then back\r\nto the front porch for more air, then back to the half gallon\r\nbottle of unpasteurized that helps win the War. On one of these\r\ntrips to the front porch I noticed the Electric Light people had\r\ninserted a bigger light bulb while I had been gone. But my\r\npatriotic duty called me back to the pantry and the\r\nrubber-stoppered half gallon bottle. In desperation I again went\r\nto the front porch to bring in help, any kind of help, but the\r\nstreets were empty. Then back to the kitchen, and then to the\r\nfront porch where I was seized with a desire to go calling,\r\nanywhere, and anybody who could talk, or rather listen, because\r\nat this time the gods were unfolding to me a quick and brilliant\r\nscheme in which I was to outshine MacArthur and tip the balance\r\nto win the war--just like that. The plan was simple and should\r\nhave been thought of before now. It was to furnish all enemy\r\nsoldiers with half gallon bottles of Doc Sigler-recommended\r\nunpasteurized Champagne-Velvet beer, make them drink it and thus\r\ncause internal drowning. Simple, isn't it? But suddenly it became\r\nunnecessary, because back at the bottle and just as I was\r\ndraining the last drop, there came through the ether, the short\r\nwave fuzzy joint and unconditional surrender of Hitler, Sitting\r\nBull and the Pennsylvania Whiskey Rebellion.\r\nAs Ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nAVOIDING A STATE OF NATURE\r\n\r\nAug. 4, 1942\r\n\r\nMy dear Aura May: (then visiting in Worcester, MA)\r\n. . . I took time off today to go to Reiner's at Indianapolis to\r\ntest out fur coat prices. They are high, but nonetheless, my\r\noffer stands provided you want one at this time. Your letter\r\nrather indicated you would as soon wait a year or so. That is\r\nsensible and also thoughtful, and it might be a year in College\r\nand an opportunity to look around and sort of study fur coats\r\nmight be better than to jump in and buy one hastily. . .\r\n\r\nSarah Jane has her sights raised too high, I think. She says\r\n$419, exclusive of fur coat, undergear, socks and I don't\r\nremember what else she excepted. . . You are fine looking, well\r\nmade and therefore can wear grass dresses, sarongs and Russian\r\nSable with equal grace. In other words, clothes don't have to\r\nmake you. And thank God they don't have to pinchhit for your\r\nscholarship. Still, you should have good clothes, and you are\r\ngoing to get them. Sarah Jane must have smuggled you into\r\nWorcester after dark, because, according to one of her letters,\r\nyou were naked, or practically so, when she took you to Canada. I\r\nhope your ears were clean.\r\n\r\nHowever and nevertheless, Sarah Jane is doing her level best to\r\nhelp us all out in these, your clothes troubles. She is taking\r\nher time and effort, and all for the good of the cause, so let's\r\nall be appreciative. She thinks we are losing time, back tracking\r\nand creating a state of confusion--which we are. . .\r\n\r\nI am therefore enclosing a draft for $300 and telling you you are\r\nfree to do as you please in the selection of your clothes. After\r\nall, you will have to wear them, you are 18, an exceptional\r\nscholar, and you should be pleased and satisfied. This is not all\r\nthe money you are to get for clothes, etc., this year, but God\r\nknows I think it is enough for you to start out on this Fall and\r\nWinter. If not, then we'll sell some shoats . . . and rustle up\r\nsome more.\r\n\r\nAnn has to have a few duds, you know. Margaret is in a state of\r\nnature as to clothes, and . . . Munny surely needs a new bustle\r\nand pair of arch-supporter shoes by now . . . .What I'll be\r\nneeding is a pair of new corrugated rubber-soled shoes and plenty\r\nof cinders .. . .\r\n\r\n\"Pap\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCROSSING THE RAILROADS\r\n\r\nMarch 17, 1943\r\n\r\nDear Chilluns:\r\nBack from the Legislative Wars, pretty well battered but\r\ngradually recovering. We took one bad licking. Under present law,\r\ngenerally speaking, municipalities and county commissioners may\r\n. . . \"order in\" grade crossing warning devices or watchmen . . .\r\nwhether the railroads think them necessary or not . . . all at\r\nthe cost of the railroads. . . We tried to change the law so the\r\nunit so ordering them in would have to pay 50% of installation,\r\nrepair and maintenance. . . But the Senate voted us down 26 to\r\nabout 18. The mayors got in their work.\r\n\r\nThere was absolutely nothing unfair about the bill in my opinion.\r\nIt just would have stopped a lot of grafting mayors and city\r\ncouncils. For instance, a councilman in Anderson last summer\r\nintroduced an ordinance requiring 44 crossing lights in Anderson.\r\nThe ordinance was so worded . . . that only one manufacturer\r\ncould fill the specifications. A brother-in-law of the\r\nintroducing councilman was the agent for that factory. It was so\r\nraw the ordinance failed to pass, but it took a lot of lawyers\r\nand time and expense to run all that down. Just such things as\r\nthat happen all the time. Some \"worthy party workers\" start a\r\nmanufacturing plant up in Lake County on a shoe string. Maybe\r\nthey can't get a site on the right-of-way. But they start. Then\r\ncome to the railroads and want a switch put in to the factory. . .\r\nThe railroad investigates--the set-up doesn't look permanent--\r\nand declines to extend a switch. Then, the \"workers\" go to the\r\nmayor and council with the tale the railroad is stifling business\r\nin that town, and so on. A big howl goes up. . . The railroad\r\nmakes another check and refuses. Then the mayor sends word they\r\nwill be wanting some more crossing devices in that town, to\r\n\"protect the children,\" and there you are again. Those crossing\r\ndevices cost an average of $2,500 per set. Maintenance averages\r\n$50 per year. These are only two of a hundred rackets worked on\r\nrailroads. . .\r\n\r\n\r\nNOT IN THE FDIC AND PROUD OF IT\r\n\r\nOn the 50th anniversary of the Russellville Bank, in 1943, Pap,\r\nas Chairman of the Board, took out a sizable advertisement in the\r\nJuly 30 edition of The Daily Banner (motto: \"It Waves For All\")\r\nof Greencastle. The ad proclaimed in large bold type that the\r\nvenerable Russellville institution was \"A Private Bank, not a\r\nmember of F.D.I.C.\" The \"Old Bank\", as it was referred to, had\r\nbeen started in 1893 by some 30 citizens of Russellville,\r\nincluding Pap's father, James, and older brother, J. Ernest\r\nDurham, and had grown to have capital stock of $15,000 and a\r\nsurplus of $50,000, according to the ad. Excerpts follow.\r\n\r\nTYPE OF BANK\r\n\r\nRussellville Bank is a Private Bank. It is UN-incorporated.\r\nTherefore the individual liability of its stockholders for its\r\ndebts (and your deposits are its principal liability) is not\r\nlimited merely to the extent of the value of the stock owned in\r\nthe bank--whatever that value may be--as is the case in Banks\r\nincorporated under Indiana law. Incorporation, among other\r\nthings, means limitation of liability for debts. . .\r\n\r\nDEPOSIT GUARANTY\r\n\r\nWe are NOT a Member of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\r\n(F.D.I.C.). We were invited to join. We declined, and, being an\r\n\"A\" Bank, were not compelled to join. We have been asked why we\r\ndeclined. Here is the answer: Many of you have been told the\r\nFederal Government guarantees all deposits up to $5,000 made in\r\nBanks belonging to F.D.I.C. If that were the case, we would\r\nprobably have our application in for membership in the morning.\r\nBut nothing is farther from the truth. The Federal Government\r\ndoes NOT guarantee one cent of anybody's deposit in ANY bank--\r\nNational, State or Private, anywhere, anytime--whether a member\r\nof F D.I.C. or not. But it does require ALL Banks belonging to\r\nF.D.I.C. to guarantee one another's depositors' deposits up to\r\n$5,000 for each depositor--A SORT OF MUTUAL INSURANCE. We are a\r\nsmall Bank, but mighty for our inches in a financial way. And we\r\nwant to put all the force of all of our resources solely back of\r\nthe deposits of our own depositors. Therefore, we thought then,\r\nand still think, it would be unfair to our depositors for\r\nRussellville Bank, with its comparatively overwhelmingly superior\r\nresources, to join-up and guarantee the depositors of a bank in\r\nthe Rockies, about which it knows nothing and over whose\r\nmanagement it has no control. So, excluding all other Private\r\nBanks, we assert we have proportionately more resources for the\r\npayment of every dollar of our deposits and other liabilities\r\nthan any F.D.I.C. Bank in the State of Indiana has in proportion\r\nto its deposits and other liabilities. This is no idle boast. We\r\nmean just what we say.\r\n\r\nCONSERVATISM\r\n\r\nIn our 50 years of banking we have bought millions of dollars\r\nworth of securities for ourselves and our customers without loss\r\nof a single penny of Principal or Interest. However, during and\r\nfollowing the \"Bank Holidays\", in a few issues--three we think,\r\n\"to keep the record straight\"--some bonds and some coupons were\r\nnot paid promptly at maturity, although eventually all were paid.\r\n\r\nOUR CUSTOMERS\r\n\r\nOur customers are the salt of the Earth. Some have been with us\r\nduring all, or practically all, of our existence (In that time we\r\nhave, to be sure, lost some good customers, and we sincerely\r\nregret those losses.) During the April, 1943, drive for the sale\r\nof 2nd War Loan Bonds, the patriotism of our customers was\r\nimmediately evident. The amount of approximately $29,000 was sold\r\nin and credited to Russell Township (our township), and of this\r\nthe amount of $23,218.75 was subscribed by our customers and paid\r\nfor with funds in Russellville Bank. We are proud of our\r\ncustomers in their War efforts. If peace should be dictated by\r\nthe Axis Powers, it might conceivably happen our 50 years of\r\ncareful, conscientious banking would all go for naught and that\r\nRussellville Bank, in spite of its enormous resources considering\r\nits size, might not be worth the price of this advertisement. It\r\npays to be patriotic.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDERING STOVE PARTS\r\n\r\nApril 2, 1943\r\nCribben & Sexton Company\r\n700 N. Sacramento Blvd.\r\nChicago, Illinois\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\nI am herewith enclosing check for $2.75 for two oven door\r\nsprings, two pastry door springs, three black door handles, two\r\nsimmer buttons and ttmx (whatever the devil that is), all as per\r\nenclosed card.\r\n\r\nMrs. Durham has gone to Pennsylvania, and the children inform me\r\nshe eventually was able to find the \"number\" of our gas stove so\r\nthe above repairs could be identified by you. Where she found\r\nthat number or identification on our stove is still a profound\r\nmystery to me. She had looked, I had peered, the children had\r\nsearched, gas men and plumbers had examined and thumped, and\r\noutside the \"Strand Universal\" toward the lower right hand\r\ncorner, the job was as smooth as an undertaker's conversation\r\nwhen showing caskets and gently murmuring prices therefor to the\r\nbereaved family. Incidentally, your modest demand for the above\r\ngadgets is as \"chicken feed\" to theirs. You must be an honest and\r\nupright firm, for Chicago. Congratulations.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, let it be known no Nazi spy will ever be able to\r\nreport back to whoever he reports to the elusive number on our\r\ntrusty gas stove.\r\nVery respectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nLAND AWAY FROM HOME\r\n\r\nOctober 23, 1943\r\n\r\nMr. Eugene M. Anderson\r\n20061 Hull\r\nDetroit, Michigan\r\n\r\nMy dear Eugene:\r\nEnclosed find Russellville Bank draft. . . for $550 . . . in full\r\npayment of the balance owed by Ared Shaw and wife to you for the\r\n27 acres plus north of the N.Y. Central station here in Putnam\r\nCounty. I am also enclosing a receipt for $1 from Central\r\nNational Bank, which . . . charged each of you the sum for\r\nholding the papers.\r\n\r\nI tried to peddle your contract but the chiselers had this excuse\r\nand that for wanting you to discount it. This is no time for\r\ndiscounting, and everybody knows it. Banks are glad to get good\r\nloans at straight 6% mighty glad. I took it up with Russellville\r\nBank and they wanted it. So they got it. . .\r\n\r\nI expect you are glad to get the matter off your hands. It is no\r\nfun to own land a long ways from home. I have tried it--in fact I\r\nam trying it all the time--have land in Kansas and Texas I can't\r\nget rid of, and it's a nuisance. The southwest Kansas land is 160\r\nacres, flat as a pancake--you could make baseball diamonds all\r\nover it--and never had a plow in it. Father traded a horse and\r\nbuggy for it in 1893 or 94. Never saw it. It is in dry country.\r\nWe have just paid taxes (very small) all these years until about\r\nfive years ago I leased it for oil to the Standard Co. at $1 per\r\nacre. They have never drilled a well, but keep it for\r\nspeculation, and each year pay $160. So, if that keeps up, we'll\r\nhave our money back come 20 years more, or more or less. . .\r\nVery respectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nLET THE BRIDE CALL THE TUNE\r\n\r\nAdvice to an only son who has become a prospective groom. Note:\r\nThe future bride's name was Frances Haberkorn, but Pap, who\r\nnicknamed everyone, called her \"Francisco.\" (Undated)\r\n\r\nMy dear Frank,\r\nFrom your letter, matters matrimonial in our family seem on a\r\nmost decided up-swing. I didn't realize you had gone so far, but\r\nright now, once and for always, you can rest assured the \"old\r\nman\" is with you 200%. Wife and husband choosing is for the\r\nindividuals themselves. Outsiders should look on, keep out, keep\r\nmum--and worry to themselves all they want to. I did a mighty\r\ngood job of picking, and I'm perfectly willing to accord the rest\r\nof you the same privilege.\r\n\r\nYour letter said Francisco would be down to have a final say in\r\nthe matter--or words to that effect. That's right. That is the\r\nway it should be. You'll find a groom is the most unnecessary\r\nnecessity modern society ever inveigled an unsuspecting public\r\ninto. He bears about the same relation to a first class wedding\r\nthat a dust cap does to a 12-cylindered, leather upholstered\r\nPackard.\r\n\r\nPerhaps by now you know more about when and where. Naturally, the\r\nbalance of us would like to know something about that\r\ntoo--especially if any are expected to be \"among those present\".\r\n. . . If I am expected to be present, I'll have to arrange for\r\nsomebody to do the milking, and get my shirt to, and back from,\r\nthe laundry--both of which take varying times. But whenever,\r\nwherever and however, you can count on Munny for an absolute\r\ncertainty, even if you can't count positively on a bride. Munny\r\nwould be there to forestall any substitutions. If it is to be in\r\nAlaska, you can count on Munny trying on parkas tomorrow, and\r\npracticing blubber her next meal.\r\nAs ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nPap summoned up the following allegory in advising family members\r\nnot to interfere with the wishes of the prospective bride for her\r\nown wedding.\r\n\r\nTo All and Sundry of the Clan of Durham of Putnam County,\r\nIndiana,\r\n\r\nGreetings:\r\n\r\nLegend hath it when the daughter of Simonides of Iulis was about\r\nto wed, a controversy arose between her and the prospective\r\ngroom's kinswomen and some of his kinsmen as to what wines were\r\nto be served at the wedding feast. She contended for a wine whose\r\ngrapes were grown on the east side of a mountain and facing the\r\nmorning sun. His kindred strove for a less palatable but more\r\npotent wine whose grapes were grown on the south side of a\r\nneighboring mountain.\r\n\r\nThe controversy arose to political and diplomatic importance.\r\nForsooth, she, having all the best of it in comeliness, charm,\r\npersonal interest and common justice, prevailed--as all brides-\r\nto-be should, concerning their nuptial arrangements.\r\n\r\nAt the wedding feast his people were served with hemlock--thus\r\nforever ending the \"in-law\" question for her, and thereby\r\nreaffirming an almost unbroken precedent that in the days of your\r\nGrandfather Durham was summed-up in these cryptic words: \"He who\r\npays the fiddler shall call the tune.\"\r\n\r\nMoral. It were better a volunteer of bridal suggestions to a\r\nbride-to-be were buried in the sands of the sea at low water mark\r\nwhere the tide ebbs and flows twice in twenty-four hours, than\r\nintimate anything, anytime to HER, and thereby court a return of\r\nthe Iulisian custom.\r\n\r\n(The foregoing went by mail, postage prepaid, to all members of\r\nsaid Clan whose addresses were known this May 21, 1944)\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME SIMILARITY\r\n\r\nFrances' father was Henry Haberkorn, a vice president and trust\r\nofficer of the largest bank in Detroit. Pap was chairman of the\r\nboard of one of the smallest banks in Indiana. He made the\r\nfollowing observations regarding this \"similarity.\"\r\n\r\n(Undated)\r\n\r\nMy dear Frank,\r\nI wrote one letter to Francisco, and one jointly to her father\r\nand mother. This week I received replies. Frances wrote a nice,\r\nsensible, fine letter. Your pappy Haberkorn did the honors for\r\nhimself and wife. The letterhead disclosed he is one of the Vice\r\nPresidents of the National Bank of Detroit. He facetiously\r\nreferred to the fact we had another thing in common--we both were\r\nconnected with the banking business.\r\n\r\nWhich reminded me of Charlie Buchanan, who appeared before the\r\nRailroad Committee of the House in 1917 with a bill to allow the\r\nLouisville, New Albany & Corydon Railroad to charge more than 2\r\ncents per mile on passenger trains on his Road. Charlie was\r\nPresident of said R.R. and it was a separate railroad corporation\r\nin truth and in fact. He was also Auditor, Treasurer, Gen.\r\nFreight and Passenger Agent--and Conductor on their one and only\r\ntrain. His Road ran from Corydon and connected with the Southern\r\nat Corydon Junction some 8 miles of main track. He told us the\r\nfollowing tale:\r\n\r\nAs do all R.R. Presidents, he went to their convention in\r\nChicago, and there struck up Pres. Williams of the New York\r\nCentral for an exchange of courtesies of passes--he to give\r\nWilliams a pass on the L.N.A. & C. Railroad, and in return,\r\nWilliams to give him a pass on the N.Y.C. Williams seemed to have\r\nnot heard of Charlie's Road and asked him where it was. Charlie\r\ntold him. Williams still was puzzled and asked how long the Road\r\nwas. Charlie answered it was a little over 8 miles long.\r\n\r\nWilliams said, \"Don't you think you have a hell of a lot of gall\r\nwhen you have an 8-mile Road and we have over 16,000 miles?\"\r\n\r\nCharlie answered, \"I know that Mr. Williams, but yours ain't a\r\ndamn bit wider.\"\r\n\r\nHe got the pass.\r\n\r\nAnd also our Committee recommended his bill unanimously. . .\r\n\r\nAnd so, as between the L.N.A. & C. and the N.Y.C., and the\r\nNational Bank of Detroit and Russellville Bank, I can't just put\r\nmy finger on it, but hazily, there is some similarity, of some\r\nkind or other.\r\nAs ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTRAINED ROMANCE OF UNCLE ERNEST\r\n\r\nPap's conviction that family members should not meddle in affairs\r\nof the heart was on his mind, and showed again in the following\r\nletter. It was written long after the death of his older brother,\r\nJ. Ernest Durham, generally referred to as \"Uncle Ernest,\" but\r\nthe memory of a romance impeded by an overzealous family was\r\nstill vivid.\r\n\r\nApril 25, 1944\r\n\r\nDear Frank:\r\n. . . Long, long ago I wanted a diamond like you want a bride. And\r\nso, I bought and sold calves, colts and horses; hauled campers to\r\nand from Eel River Falls; graded the old ball park at DePauw;\r\netc., etc., and worked in staid, dependable, conservative, old\r\nRussellville Bank at $2 per week & board and clothes (I'll say it\r\nwas conservative--Uncle Ernest started it in 1893 and had his\r\nfirst note loss in 1907. . . ). I spliced my money, went to\r\nWalk's (the old tune jeweler at Indianapolis) and bought myself\r\none. They said it would be a good investment. They were only half\r\nright. It was an investment . . . Then the ring and I went on to\r\ncollege, and time went on.\r\n\r\nUncle Ernest liked the looks of said diamond--but not the price--\r\nand from time to time would borrow it. He had smaller fingers and\r\nwould wrap white grocer's twine around the base until the ring\r\nabout fit; then go to the Bankers' State Convention at\r\nIndianapolis, where, in trying to be a good fellow, he would eat\r\na lot of cheese, pickles, blind robins, drink maybe a couple\r\nbottles of beer, and come home with an upset stomach and a hell\r\nof a headache. Thence to Billy Gardner's drug store for a new box\r\nof acetanilide.\r\n\r\nEventually, Frank Kennedy's girl went to some woman's college in\r\nIllinois to take music. Her teacher was a spinster of\r\nquestionable age, named Colgate, from New York, New York. It was\r\nclaimed, either by her or Frank's wife, she was a kinswoman to\r\nthe dental cream and dirt-removing family of that name who have\r\nthe big clock in Jersey across from New York City. Mother and\r\nAunt Margaret were inclined to doubt it. Anyway, the teacher came\r\nhome with her pupil at the end of the year for a visit. Uncle\r\nErnest was invited down for supper next night.\r\n\r\nThat took a good deal of preparation. He spent most of the day\r\naway from the Bank getting ready. Frank Kennedy, the pupil's\r\nfather, and host of the evening, was our leading barber. He cut\r\nUncle Ernest's hair and shaved him. Uncle Ernest filled the\r\ngalvanized wash tub extra full and took a thorough bath behind\r\nthe kitchen stove. That took off about everything except the ink\r\nstains on his fingers. Mrs. Forgey, who with her husband, Jim\r\nForgey, kept house for Uncle Ernest, recommended lemon juice, or\r\nmaybe it was green tomato juice, for finger ink stains, but said\r\nshe couldn't do anything about the ink stains on his best suit\r\nwhich she was cleaning and pressing. Uncle Ernest had won a\r\nbottle of cologne or Florida Water in some sort of a shooting\r\ngallery attached to Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show at the Chicago\r\nWorld's Fair in '93. He hadn't used much of it, so he doused a\r\nlittle of that here and there. . . All told they did a pretty\r\nfair job of grooming. The evening was a success and much praise\r\nwas given Mrs. Kennedy's salt-rising bread and culinary art.\r\n\r\nUncle Ernest had a Model T of several years back. He had used it\r\nhard, and one day, trying to head-off a calf in the barn lot out\r\nat the old home farm east of town, had run through the gate with\r\nthe door open. The door hit the gate post and was torn off. He\r\nhad to tie it shut with baling wire. That meant he had to keep it\r\nshut and get in from the other side all the time. Most of the\r\nfenders held their respective places by virtue of more baling\r\nwire. He had also misjudged the height of some limbs on a tree up\r\nin the north pasture, and torn a hole in the rubberized textile\r\ntop that leaked when it rained anything above a heavy dew. The\r\nback end of the coupe was loaded with an assortment of axes,\r\ngrubbing hoes, pitch forks, spades, post hole diggers and so\r\nforth. Besides that, it had the mud of three counties plastered\r\ninside and out, and the upholstery showed sizable patches of\r\ncotton wadding. The car in general looked bad enough, and\r\nentirely too tough for social usage, but the thing that\r\ndisqualified it absolutely for his impending purpose was that he\r\nhad parked it overnight under a blackbird roost, and anybody who\r\nhad done that in mulberry and cherry time knows what I mean.\r\n\r\nUncle Ernest had anticipated the visit by swapping his Ford for\r\nmy new chummy little Saxon roadster--35 miles to the gallon--and\r\nwherein, a woman companion couldn't keep very far away from you.\r\n\r\nTheir first trip was decorous and above suspicion. They went to\r\nthe Rockville Chautauqua to hear William Jennings Bryan, and Cole\r\nYounger the famous outlaw and bank robber, lecture on \"Crime\r\ndoesn't pay.\" They got in by 9 p.m.\r\n\r\nTheir next foray was a bit more questionable. I think they went\r\nto a box supper over toward Montezuma. In order that there be no\r\nconfusion and Uncle Ernest bid-in the wrong box, she pasted a\r\npicture of that women's college on the outside of her box. Uncle\r\nErnest bid-in the right box and got to eat supper with her. They\r\ngot in just after midnight, according to Frank Kennedy's wife's\r\ntimetable.\r\n\r\nHowever, any necessary atonement was made next day, Lord's Day,\r\nwhen they went to Crawfordsville and heard Dr. McIntosh,\r\nPresident of Wabash College, read his \"Shakespeare, the Apollo\r\nBelvidere of English Letters.\"\r\n\r\nThings gradually went from late to later, until one night they\r\ndidn't get in at all--not until after sun-up. They had succeeded\r\nin running my Saxon off the road, sprung an axle and busted a\r\nlight and fender, in a suspiciously out-of-the-way place between\r\nDeer's Mill and the Shades of Death. They said they got lost, and\r\nconfused going downhill. I agree on the latter. Anyway, they\r\nhadn't crossed the state line.\r\n\r\nRussellville opinion of the accident differed. It would. Suffice\r\nto say, no run was attempted on the trusty old Private\r\nInstitution; the next reconnaissance by State Examiners showed\r\nsaid Bank to be in its usual sound condition; and a scrutiny of\r\nUncle Ernest's balance sheet showed no unusual strain on his\r\nnormal account.\r\n\r\nThe scene shifts to Greencastle: Uncle Ernest was bringing his\r\n\"fair Calantha\" to call on Mother and Aunt Margaret in the parlor\r\nof the old brick, where a solid line of Paris Green fringed the\r\nred carpet, unsullied these many months by human feet. The horse-\r\nhair upholstered furniture stood where I last saw it five years\r\nbefore. Aunt Margaret's painting masterpiece of 1884 still hung\r\non the west wall, showing castle, moat and drawbridge (and the\r\nfair lady in green riding habit riding the horse down from the\r\ncastle to the drawbridge hadn't made any mileage since then). On\r\nthe east wall hung Aunt Margaret's effort of 1885 in paint on red\r\nvelvet. It was intended to delineate our National Bird--the\r\nAmerican Eagle--however, something had happened to her\r\nmeasurements at the time, or the noble bird had developed a\r\npronounced goiter meantime.\r\n\r\nAunt Jennie Black, she of the piercing black eyes, who looked\r\nwith suspicion on any thing or happening outside the confines and\r\nregulations of the Presbyterian Church, had been called by Mother\r\nto sit in--a job she was never known to flee from when it was her\r\nduty, which it always was.\r\n\r\nUncle Ernest had asked me to be on hand, probably for moral\r\nsupport in the event our womenfolk got out of hand.\r\n\r\nThe inquest got off to a good start. Pleasantries were passed all\r\naround until I was hoping against my better judgment. But alas,\r\nin her enthusiasm and heightened conversation, our fair caller,\r\nin an unguarded moment, dropped the fact she was a Red Cross\r\nworker in World War I, and had passed out cigarettes to the\r\nsoldiers in France. Great God! I saw Mother's bosom swell, Aunt\r\nMargaret's lip twitch like it does just before she evades an\r\nunpleasant question or is getting ready to give a lecture on\r\nmorality and church attendance; and Aunt Jennie's spinster chest\r\nflatten out flatter than usual, and I knew from now on the\r\nmeeting was to be an inquisition in the real medieval meaning of\r\nthat word.\r\n\r\nEventually conversation lagged, good-byes were said, the guests\r\ndeparted. The trio went into a caucus before I could get out of\r\nthe room, and I heard Mother pronounce sentence: \"We don't need\r\nany female cigarette distributors in this family.\" How times have\r\nchanged!\r\n\r\nThat Fall, our Red Cross worker taught in Buffalo. Uncle Ernest\r\ngot off for a short trip to San Antonio, but caught the wrong\r\ntrain and landed in Buffalo. Next Spring she taught in Cleveland.\r\nAgain, Uncle Ernest headed for San Antonio, got the wrong train,\r\nbut this time found out his error in time to get off at\r\nCleveland.\r\n\r\nLast Chapter: Uncle Ernest died in 1931. As Executor, I went\r\nthrough all his effects. Away back behind everything, I found a\r\ndusty Indiana National Bank canvas sack once used to express\r\nsilver dollars and fractional silver coins. It was full of\r\nenvelopes about the size of a two-thirds grown postal card, all\r\naddressed in the same handwriting, and all tied up in packages\r\nwith grocer's soft white twine. I didn't know the handwriting,\r\nbut eventually caught the full signature. I hadn't tried to read\r\nthe letters--just sifted through them to make sure the envelopes\r\ncontained only letters. Shortly, I came to one, the opening\r\nsentence of which caught my eye: \"I am terribly lonesome tonight,\r\nDear.\"\r\n\r\nI quit reading. They weren't intended for Executors. I took off\r\nmy glasses and sifted all the remaining letters one by one into a\r\nhandy banana hamper. Some had snapshots in them. I took\r\neverything out and burned it. Somehow, I felt pretty bad. . .\r\nAs ever,\r\n\"Pap\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HAY AND FEED RACKET\r\n\r\nApril 19, 1944\r\n\r\nDear Sarah Jane:\r\n. . . While we're on the \"racket\" subject, I think I have\r\npartially solved the \"hay and feed racket\" at the Indianapolis\r\nStock Yards. We trucked the heifers to Indpls. Sunday afternoon.\r\nThe buyers (a commission firm) insisted they get there the\r\nevening before--\"to rest, get a good fill and good weight next\r\nmorning, and be ready to be re-loaded alive in stock cars to go\r\nto New York.\" I've been skeptical about ever coming out even on a\r\nfeed and hay bill. . . I had too bad a cold to go up Sunday\r\nafternoon in one of the trucks and stay overnight, so I got up\r\nMonday morning at 4 a.m., and got to the Yards. I found the\r\ncattle and just about stayed with them until it was all over.\r\nEventually the hay wagon came along. They threw out two bales for\r\nour cattle and then distributed them in the hay racks. I watched\r\nthe cattle. They weren't eating any of the hay, just none at all.\r\nIt was timothy. They were used to alfalfa. . . The bell rang and\r\ntrading started. Buyers came and went. Our heifers were better\r\nthan any I saw. Kingan's (Indpls. local packer) man bought them.\r\nHe had been out to the farm to see them two weeks before. I got\r\nmore than he offered me out there. I marched along to the scales,\r\ncounted, and saw them weighed. My bill, among other things, read:\r\n\"400 lb. Hay@ 1.45 = $5.80\". The two bales they threw out for us\r\nwould total not more than 120 to 130 lb. Timothy hay delivered in\r\nIndpls. would not run over $20 per ton. They figured ours at $29\r\nper ton, as shown above. The heifers didn't eat a quarter's worth\r\nall told.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are worlds of straight people. Witness Ira, for\r\ninstance; the Hazlett Brothers, who started with a boot and shoe\r\nand now can get about any amount they want at staid, old,\r\nconservative, dependable Russellville Bank, the bank that only\r\nguarantees its own depositors; Mr. Whitaker at the filling\r\nstation here; and thousands of others, who, like kitchen utensils\r\nat farm sales, are too numerous to mention. . .\r\n\"Pap\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPATRIOTS DEBATE--THE BALLOT OR THE BOTTLE?\r\n\r\nApril 19, 1944\r\n\r\nMy dear Margaret:\r\nMunny is on one of her many pilgrimages to Milford under disguise\r\nof most urgent business. I had seen it coming on, and the final\r\nbreak was made when I was called to Indianapolis by the railroads\r\nfor the Special Session. She left the day after I did. This time\r\nshe thought she would go by coach, paying her own fare, because\r\nin this emergency I have refused to ask for passes. The day I\r\nleft she told me her intentions, and knowing how trains are\r\ncrowded, next day I went to the station at Indianapolis to see\r\nhow she was faring. I found her standing, and she had been\r\nstanding all the way to Indianapolis and was bedraggled already,\r\nand with only about one-twenty-fifth of her journey completed. . .\r\nWe got back to the Pullman conductor, stated our troubles, and\r\nhe made the usual reply: \"I have just one lower to New York, and\r\nshe can have that\". . . The coaches and aisles were crowded with\r\nsoldiers, sailors, baggage, dirty newspapers, pop bottles, paper\r\ncups, lunch boxes and kids . . . and the last I saw of that day's\r\nfirst section of No. 12, the conductor was shepherding her back\r\nthrough the Pullmans . . . .\r\n\r\nThe Special Session brought out a holocaust of patriotism--if I\r\nam using the right term. The purpose was to make it possible for\r\nthe members of \"our armed forces\" to vote next Fall. Each member\r\ntried to out-do the others. The two chambers and the corridors\r\nrang with zealousness in the interest of \"our armed forces\"\r\ngetting the ballot. Those not running this Fall and the hold-over\r\nSenators were less voluble, but in the House, where everybody had\r\nto run this Fall, or else stay out, the rafters went off center\r\nfrom 7 to 9 inches. I haven't seen such valiant patriotism in a\r\nlegislative body since the last war, when I was in it and up for\r\nre-election. I don't remember my conduct, but I expect it was\r\npretty patriotic. I do remember I introduced a resolution in the\r\nHouse commending Wilson and the Congress for breaking off\r\nrelations with Germany, so I evidently had my lightning rod up\r\npretty high. . .\r\n\r\nPeople generally had a fear about this Special Session, and were\r\nafraid it would hang and hang on amidst fervent patriotic\r\nspeeches and many, many glowing accounts of the heroism of \"our\r\narmed forces,\" and not adjourn sine die, maybe for the full 40\r\ndays. . .\r\n\r\nThe Session was remarkably free of drunkenness and wild parties--\r\nsome of course, but not the usual amount. . . Thursday evening we\r\nhad a private dinner in the \"English Room\" of the Claypool for\r\nquite a number of railroad executives who were in the city,\r\npartly on account of the Session. It started a drab and serious\r\naffair. The war was on and restraint was in the air. Railroad\r\nexecutives are like all other people--busy, serious and worried.\r\nThe railroads are carrying an enormous load. Equipment is over-\r\nused and the replacements are just not to be had under the\r\ncircumstances. And so, the dinner lagged. The talk ran to the\r\nSpecial Session, and each speaker praised the Legislature for\r\nsetting in motion the plan to allow \"our armed forces\" to vote,\r\nand there was gentle inquiry as to how long the Session would\r\nlast. Naturally, their patriotism would want it to be short, with\r\nnothing done against the carriers. Eventually they got to me, and\r\nfor my opinion.\r\n\r\nI told them I had sensed the restraint of the dinner, but as I\r\nhad no further political ambitions, and was standing no stud\r\nhorses, and had no past due notes in the Bank, I was more or less\r\nof a free agent, and would try to speak the truth; that it was my\r\nhonest opinion the average soldier didn't give a damn whether he\r\nvoted or not out there wherever he was; that not one out of four\r\nof our armed forces out there in the trenches would try to vote\r\nunless it was more or less compulsory, amazingly easy and did not\r\ninterfere with whatever he or she was interested in at the time;\r\nthat not one out of four of the ballots of those who did vote\r\noutside the U.S. would get back in time to be counted in the\r\nproper precinct for State and County offices; that I'd bet 3 to 1\r\nthat three out of four of said \"armed forces\", if given the\r\nchoice between a ballot and a bottle of beer, would select the\r\nbeer; and that over 90% of all this tremendous anxiety about the\r\nsoldiers getting to vote was political hooey pure and simple.\r\nAlso that no adverse legislation against the railroads would be\r\noffered, much less passed; that the Session should close by the\r\nend of the week; that the Republicans were already starting to\r\ntake credit for this early adjournment by attributing it to a\r\nstrong new leadership and a united militant front--which also\r\ncontained a good percentage of hooey--and that early adjournment,\r\nif it did come, could actually be credited to two big factors: a\r\nworld of back Spring plowing and the acute whiskey shortage--\r\nespecially the latter.\r\n\r\nYou could just see them softening up and relaxing in their chairs\r\naround the table. They all agreed and from then on the dinner\r\nparty went along like a good dinner party should go. The Session\r\nadjourned Friday night.\r\n\r\nNow Margaret, if I were you, I don't believe I would show this\r\nletter to anybody. She won't know Pap and she might get the\r\nimpression I was making light of the soldiers and the War. The\r\nLord knows that is not my intention. Far, far be it from me to\r\nwant to deprive soldiers or any other qualified person from\r\nvoting. What gets me is all this fan-fare about setting up the\r\nmachinery to allow a person to do what he has always had the\r\nright to do. That doesn't take any patriotism. That is simple\r\njustice. . . Those of us at home can show our patriotism by\r\nstaying at home and off trains and away from crowded cities and\r\nhotels unless it is necessary; by raising more livestock, grain,\r\ngrub of all kinds and fewer orchids and \"rackets\" of all kinds;\r\nand above all else, by cracking down on these strikers and\r\ndamnable labor racketeers and stopping this criticism of the\r\npowers that happen to be Churchill, Stalin and Brother Roosevelt.\r\n. . . I'd like to carry the rosin bag for those boys. They are the\r\nones who have kept most of the Russellville Bank stock in my\r\nname, and old Fred and Nellie and the work harness in the old log\r\nbarn. I'm fer 'em.\r\n\r\nKeep a stiff upper lip, and your hat on straight.\r\n\"Pap\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA PATRIOTIC CANCELLATION\r\n\r\n(Undated)\r\n. . . All our Indiana Railroad Lobby set-up except me are\r\nRepublicans. The State is Republican. Most of the Indiana Public\r\nService Commission are Republicans. They got the idea of a\r\nNational Public Service Commission Convention at French Lick this\r\nAugust. So two of our set-up went to Washington D.C. to see\r\nBrother Johnson, who is the head of the War Transportation\r\noutfit, and arrange for cars . . . They had their story ready,\r\nand particularly \"the importance of the meeting.\"\r\n\r\nBrother Johnson listened attentively until they finished. Then he\r\nuncrossed his legs and spoke about as follows: \"There will be no\r\nconvention at French Lick this summer. I wouldn't allow you one\r\nseat in one bus for the whole damned convention. We are going to\r\nmove an additional 1,000,000 men and equipment in August, and\r\n1,500,000 in September. We don't know how we are going to do it\r\nwith what equipment we have left, but I know one way we are going\r\nto help--we are going to set off every god damned railroad\r\nexecutive and near-railroad executive we can find wherever we\r\nfind him. That will help considerably. You go back to Indiana and\r\ntell those Hoosiers there's a War on in case they don't know it,\r\nand the thing for them to do is to stay home where they belong\r\nand not be cluttering up these trains.\"\r\n\r\nThat combination, \"near-railroad executive,\" is what cooked our\r\ncrowd. None of us is as high as a section boss.\r\n\r\nThe National Public Service Commission Convention for this summer\r\nat French Lick has been called-off by unanimous consent. \"After\r\nstudying the matter carefully, we have decided it might possibly\r\ninterfere with the War Effort in some unforeseen way, and the\r\npatriotic thing to do is to take no possible chance in that\r\nregard\".\r\nAs Ever,\r\nPap\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO SELL\r\n\r\nMarch 27, 1945\r\n\r\nA letter to all the children away from home.\r\n\r\n. . . But let's get down to more important things. First and above\r\nall else is Ann Drew's impending venture into making matrimony. . .\r\nWhat Annabelle Lee wants in the way of a husband is what I most\r\nsurely want her to have. Besides that, Ralph is a first class\r\nyoung fellow, if I am any judge. Under the circumstances, I'd\r\nlike him if he wore spats and drank tea. . . I do hate to have\r\nher get married away from home, but that is all right under the\r\ncircumstances, if she does decide to make the jump away out there\r\nby herself in California. They tell me a marriage license issued\r\nout there (maybe I should have said a wedding ceremony) is still\r\ngood here in Indiana.\r\n\r\nFrank's young calf, of course, is a more serious problem. I don't\r\nknow how to answer his inquiry about feed for a stray young calf,\r\nexcept to say that cow's milk is the solution. . . Incidentally\r\nFrank, you can get original first hand information, together with\r\nsome startling dialog relating thereto, if you will ask Jim\r\nAnderson's wife at Russellville how she raised \"Old Nellie\"--the\r\nold sorrel mare we now have at the farm--when her mother died\r\nwhen she was born. I can write the details but it takes Stella\r\n(Jim's wife) to give the matter the proper wording. (It is a\r\nstory for men only. Women crimp Stella's style). . .Well, the\r\nfacts are these: There was that tiny hungry little helpless colt.\r\nThey got her dried off and away from her dead mother into a box\r\nstall with plenty of straw. Then the food question arose. Jim\r\ndrove up one of the cows; they milked some milk into a small\r\ncrock; Stella stuck two of her fingers into the colt's mouth and\r\ndown into the milk crock, and eventually Nellie got the idea. And\r\nso, from day to day, they repeated the scene. The leggy ambling\r\ncolt waxed sleek and gained flesh. She got so she could drink,\r\nbut preferred to suck Stella's fingers. One evening Ernest was\r\nthere, and the usual performances were had, and everybody admired\r\nthe colt and thought it very cute . . . when all of a sudden and\r\nall unexpectedly, Nellie backed square behind Stella, got the\r\nexact range and let fly with both feet, hitting Stella squarely\r\non the axis and knocking her about six feet flat on her stomach.\r\nThe air took on a blue tinge as it does in Indian summer, and no\r\nstevedore ever out-stevedored Stella's utterances, which were\r\nboth long and loud. . . They started feeling for broken bones.\r\nEverything appeared to be in perfect alignment, but to be sure\r\nthey started raising and lowering various garments until the bare\r\ntruth unfolded before their anxious eyes. There, 'neath the warm,\r\nshimmering rays of a setting sun, in high relief from a grass\r\nbordered background, were two sizable red lumps soon to turn a\r\ndarker hue--one on either cheek.\r\n\r\n. . . I deposited $5 to Frank's account at staid, dependable, old\r\nRussellville Bank, a Private Bank, with more back of every dollar\r\nof its deposits than any other Bank in Indiana. As of this date,\r\nits capital stock remains at $15,000; we upped the surplus to\r\n$55,000 and upped the undivided profits to about $15,000. The\r\ndeposits now run considerably over half a million. This increase\r\n. . . is not all money we made last year by a whole lot. It\r\nrepresents recoveries on real estate the Banking Dept. ordered us\r\nto sell back there when land was low. We just charged that stuff\r\noff out of earnings and undivided profits as we went along, as\r\nthe Dept. ordered it sold or charged off. One piece the Dept.\r\nrecommended we sell for $1,500 and take our loss we sold last\r\nfall for $3,300. Another they thought should be sold for about\r\n$3,000 brought $6,750 this January, cash in hand. Couldn't loan\r\nthe purchaser a cent. That was bad. We've made money on every\r\npiece we took over, and have sold to date. And every property\r\npaid more than its way as we went along. . .\r\n\r\nI really should tell you about the oldest piece of real estate we\r\nhad on hands--at the extreme northeast edge of Russellville, east\r\nof the Carter house. . . It consisted of five little lots, as\r\nlonesome a five lots as you would want to see. Away back there,\r\n20 or 25 years ago, Uncle Ernest loaned a fellow $300, and as a\r\nprecaution pure and simple took a mortgage on those five lots.\r\nThe fellow paid the loan down to $150 in drabs, got sick, moved\r\naway, and eventually deeded the Bank the lots and called the loan\r\nsquare. Time went on. No one thought much about those lots. Uncle\r\nErnest died. The panic came on, and every once in a while, Mr.\r\nBoyd, our President, would suggest we sell \"those lots up in the\r\neast part of town.\" In the meantime he rented the grass here and\r\nthere. . .\r\n\r\nAbout two years ago, Bill C-- got drunk one day and offered Mr.\r\nBoyd $75 cash for the five . . . to pile junk on. I said \"no\", as\r\nthey were too near the Carter house for one thing, and not enough\r\nmoney for another. Time went on. Finally George joined Mr. Boyd\r\nin wanting them sold, and they pretty near had Mr. Fordice in the\r\nnotion of selling too. . . We were just adjourning when Bob\r\nWhitted walked in the front part of the Bank. I said to my\r\nbrother Directors, \"Let's sell those lots to Bob Whitted. He\r\nlives up in the east part of town.\" They said, \"Let's see you do\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nI tackled Bob. He asked, \"What do you want for all five?\" I said\r\n\"$350,\" just like that, and he didn't wince. He asked, \"How do\r\nyou want me to pay for them?\" I said, \"How do you want to pay for\r\nthem?\" He said, \"By the month, and not more than $10 a month, and\r\nI wouldn't want you to squeeze me if I run behind sometime.\" I\r\nsaid, \"Well, we're selling them to you at half price, so let's\r\nmake the payments at half price--$5 a month, you to pay the taxes\r\nnext Fall and from then on, and get possession today, and the\r\ndeed whenever you make full payment.\"\r\n\r\nHe said, \"How much intrust are you goin' to charge me?\" I said,\r\n\"We've made everything else at half price, so to keep everything\r\nbalanced up, we should make the interest at half price too--3%.\"\r\n\r\nHe jumped up, ran his hand down in his pocket, brought up a $5\r\nbill, and said, \"I'll take you up--here is your $5 for a\r\nstarter.\" The others were up front, but heard a good part of the\r\ntalk. I called George back and we solemnly gave him the data, Bob\r\nstating the terms, and asked him to draw up a real estate sales\r\ncontract. Then followed the shortest, quickest real estate sales\r\ncontract it has been my privilege to view. It would have been\r\nstill shorter except that I insisted George describe the real\r\nestate as \"those lots up in the east part of town,\" not even\r\nmentioning the town's name. Mr. Boyd signed in behalf of the\r\nBank, and Bob signed in behalf of himself and wife, saying he\r\nwanted \"Grace's name somewhere on it.\" Bob went out. We all,\r\nincluding the book-keeper, looked at one another. Mr. Boyd shook\r\nhis head and said Bob would never finish paying. I said, \"It's a\r\nmighty easy thing to sell when you have good stuff to sell AND\r\nKNOW HOW TO SELL\". . .\r\n\r\nSaturday, George told me to get ready with Bob's deed as he was\r\nabout to get paid out, and was asking about his deed already. Bob\r\nhad paid away ahead of himself. Coping on his ownself. Must have\r\nsold his fox pelts. . .\r\n\r\nJoseph N. Fordice once was in a serious quandary preparing a deed\r\nto two lots in Russellville where livestock entered into the\r\nconsideration. He decided it was best to tell the truth. This\r\nresulted: \"That for and in consideration of $300 cash money and\r\ntwo hogs mutually agreed on (etc.)\". . .\r\nAs ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPING ON HIS OWN\r\n\r\nMay 2, 1945\r\n\r\nDear Familee:\r\nI spent the day at home. Yesterday and the day before I went to\r\nthe farm and spent the days, easy like, grubbing and sprouting\r\nthe fence lines inside the field west of the old house at\r\nRussellville. I thought I was going along pretty easy, but\r\nyesterday I must have gone at it too much in earnest because last\r\nnight and this morning I had a very sore right arm, and it made\r\nme think of the pickle I got into last summer when that spell of\r\nrheumatism hit me. It was raining today, so I didn't miss much.\r\nIt is a hard thing to do to go up there and just sit and loaf\r\naround. . .\r\n\r\nTom Walden, the \"dynamite king of Russellville\" is retiring from\r\nthe business after 40 years of active duty. He and old man\r\nFerguson were out near Russellville dynamiting some stumps, or\r\nrather trees, last Friday. They had set two charges and gone away\r\nabout as far as they thought necessary. One charge went off, and\r\nafter a reasonable delay, they went back to see what had happened\r\nto the second charge--and got there just in time. When about 8\r\nfeet away, she let go. Both are here in the local hospital. I\r\nwent to see them Sunday. Tom's eyes were bandaged and at that\r\ntime they did not know whether he would be blind or not.\r\nOtherwise, his face looked unusually free from abrasions or\r\nswelling, or anything in fact. It must be the charge had spent\r\nitself getting through the wrinkles. Old man Ferguson was a total\r\nmess about the face. Terribly swollen, and blue, red and black.\r\nOne of his eyes may be gone. He was so swollen you couldn't see\r\none eye a-tall. .\r\n\r\nMay 6, 1945,\r\n\r\nI got interrupted the other day while writing this letter.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a fine package of cigarettes and chocolate bars\r\ncame from Margaret. I hid them in the left door of the sideboard\r\n--the one that is hard to get open, and every once in a while I\r\nopen the door, take a look and a good sniff, then gently close\r\nthe door after a hasty glance around to see there are no\r\neavesdroppers thereabouts. With one exception, it has been a long\r\ntime since I saw chocolate bars. On the train going to Chicago to\r\nsee about selling the cattle up there some time ago, I ran into a\r\nyoung couple (Army folks) on their way west from Norfolk. In the\r\nconversation I said something about not having seen a Hershey bar\r\nfor a long time. I noticed she went down among their luggage and\r\npretty soon he turned around and offered me a 5 cents Hershey\r\nwith almonds. I didn't want to be mooching off them, but they\r\nwouldn't take no for an answer, so I took it, all the time\r\nfeeling like a sheep-killing dog. The company has streamlined its\r\nproduct. When I got the wrapping off the two almonds stuck out\r\nlike knobs on some of those red oaks up in the east pasture.\r\n\r\nI have also had a letter from Joan. I had sent her the green hide\r\nof Seminole IV, or whatever number he bears, in an open lard can\r\nwith part of the hide sticking out the top, and green hide\r\neffluvium oozing out at the bottom. Joan's description of the\r\npimply-faced delivery boy was vivid. He asked: \"What is this\r\nthing anyway?\" She replied: \"A cow hide, my boy. I make rugs out\r\nof 'em.\" The carcass of Seminole IV is safely ensconced out in\r\nthe lockers awaiting the day when some dentist comes home with a\r\nformula for non-skid false teeth--the ones I have are roller-\r\nbearing--or until some of you pass this way with containers of a\r\nmodest cubicle content. . .\r\n\r\nI and my two bed sheets were well on the way to some sort of a\r\nrecord when Footser stepped in. Munny has been gone to Milford\r\nsomething like approaching two months. The weather has been cool,\r\nand I haven't been working very hard physically, and then too,\r\nhave been taking baths quite regularly, so all in all my sheets\r\nwere holding out splendidly. Naturally, they would wrinkle some,\r\nbut any discoloration, if such there was, was gradual and\r\nuniform, except in one place--about shoulder high and between me\r\nand the radio were some streaks of chocolate running toward the\r\nradio. That happened at the time, or just after, Munny left. Each\r\nnight when I crawled in, those streaks would give me a feeling of\r\ninsecurity until I remembered what they were. Than I could nestle\r\nin amongst them and go to sleep--but every night I had that small\r\nshock. About two weeks ago I noticed I had a big ridge in my back\r\neach morning when I got up. Then one morning it was raining and I\r\nmade an investigation. The pad under the sheet had gotten out of\r\nfocus. That was remedied quickly, and while I was doing that, I\r\nsmoothed out the biggest wrinkles, and felt pretty well set until\r\nthe really hot weather of August would set in.\r\n\r\nMy wool socks give me the most serious tremors. If it doesn't\r\nturn warm pretty soon, I don't know what I will do. I have four\r\npairs. They can't be sent to the laundry. I have rotated them as\r\nscientifically as my ability permits. I have rigged up a chart on\r\nthe marble top of the table whereon the radio sets, and I figure\r\na day spent at the farm sprouting and grubbing bushes, etc., is\r\nequal to from two to two and a half days at the Bank. But I find\r\nthat won't do. I have to make it either two or three days, one or\r\nthe other. It would be silly to sit at the Bank until noon of the\r\nsecond day, come home and change socks, and then go back for the\r\nremainder of that second day .. . .\r\n\r\n\"Little\" Ernest's 80 acres is sold and gone and I have the money\r\nto send him, perhaps tomorrow. He got a rather good price for the\r\nland--$6,000 cash. That is not to be sneezed at. . .\r\n\r\nBoth Tom Walden and Mr. Ferguson are going to be able to see,\r\nalthough both are still in the Hospital of course. I shall try to\r\ngo out tonight to see what they look like now.\r\n\r\nI eat my suppers at Mrs. Bridges'. If it weren't for those meals,\r\nI don't believe I could make it. These restaurants are terrible,\r\nand my teeth are worse than that. . .\r\n\r\nFootser's last year's room mate--the Pulliam girl--is going to\r\nget married some time this month. Her father, who is principal or\r\nsole owner of the Indianapolis Star, gave her some sort of shower\r\nyesterday at Indianapolis. Footser evidently went, as did about\r\nall the girls down at the Theta House. . .\r\n\r\nTime to quit, except to say that, with the European War about\r\nover, in my judgment Japan won't be hard or very long to clean\r\nout, once the Allies get started, so Ralph should be heading this\r\nway in the more or less near future.\r\n\r\n\"Pap\"\r\n\r\nNote: The \"Pulliam girl\", referred to above, later became an aunt\r\nof Dan Quayle, U.S. Senator from Indiana and Vice President under\r\nPresident George Bush.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEAT SCARCE, EVERYTHING UP BUT FARM INCOME\r\n\r\nJune 6, 1945\r\n\r\nMy dear Sarah Jane:\r\n. . . Of late, Ira has had me on the seed wagon, filling up the\r\ndrill for him with seed and commercial fertilizer, while he rides\r\nthe tractor and does the sowing. Between fills I try my hand on\r\nthorn and other sapling stuff, and Tuesday night I came home\r\nalmost a physical wreck. Each year it gets harder and harder\r\nclimbing up and down on wagons. I used to climb the fences but\r\nnow I take to the gates. Ira says I should work in \"gopher hole\r\ncoal mines\" if I really want to know what work is. In one of\r\nthose things is where Ira got his hip busted--the darned thing\r\ncaved-in on him. As a result he is crippled in one leg and can't\r\nrun very fast.\r\n\r\nBut you should see him running to get between young ground hogs\r\nand their holes. Monday we drilled soy beans on what Ira calls\r\nthe \"wind mill field.\" This field has a big tile ditch running\r\nthrough it, and along that ditch is a clump of willows. Ira was\r\ndriving the tractor pulling the drill behind, when all of a\r\nsudden he flew off his tractor and ran to the willows. He had\r\ncaught three young ground hogs up a bush. He ran to the holes and\r\nkicked them full of dirt--and here the young hogs came. Having no\r\nclub he used his feet. His foot batting average was .666, meaning\r\nhe got two of the three. That noon he \"butchered\", and that took\r\nhalf an hour. Skinning ground hogs isn't quite like skinning\r\nrabbits. Ira eats them and says they are fine. I say nothing\r\nbecause long years ago, Lum Alspaugh and I went to Eel River\r\nFalls to run his grandfather's farm while the family attended\r\nMethodist Conference at Greencastle, and we tried eating\r\neverything about in wild life that wears hair or feathers--\r\nrabbits, squirrels, quail, crows, chicken hawks, buzzards, ground\r\nhogs, skunk, domestic chickens, etc. Both did the hunting but Lum\r\nwas head cook--in fact he was sole cook.\r\n\r\nI did the dish washing, if it could be called that. . . I ate\r\nenough of whatever it was to be able to say I had partaken. . .\r\nYoung ground hogs are not bad, but they aren't very good either--\r\ntoo greasy. Ira relishes them. I prefer corn fed beef. . .\r\n\r\nAnd that brings me to your questions about beef. . . The hotels\r\nand restaurants hereabouts have very little meat. Sugar Foot\r\ntells me they have red meat at the Theta House one meal each\r\nweek, so that may be an indication of the general situation. . .\r\nI killed a beef in April. He has been a Godsend for Aunt Margaret\r\nand me. What we haven't eaten and the attendants out at the\r\nLocker Plant haven't stolen is still there. If you or Bob could\r\nhunt around and find a box of the right sort that would hold,\r\nsay, 50 pounds of meat together with 50 pounds of dry ice, and if\r\nshipping meat to children is not contrary to law, I think\r\nsomething could be done to relieve you and the rest of the\r\nchildren in this part of the country. . . I am too busy on all\r\nthis land we have to be finding out all the details and hunting\r\nup all the containers. I get up from 3 to 4 a.m. and get to bed\r\nfrom 9 to 10 p.m.\r\n\r\nNow about your so-called black market. A lot of that is \"old\r\nwives\" and political talk. There are black markets, especially in\r\nthe big centers of population, but Worcester is no big center,\r\nand if the people there are the right sort, then there is no\r\nopening for much of a black market--unless the people themselves\r\nmake it. Whenever you hear of a black market you can rest assured\r\nthe inhabitants themselves are to blame, because if there is no\r\npatronage then there will be no market. I am sorry to hear you\r\nsay you will patronize such a market if you can find it. That is\r\nexactly what causes black markets. Blaming it all on the\r\ngovernment or anything else is not the remedy--it is only a\r\nflimsy excuse. . . We had an embyro black market at Russellville\r\neven. Two men went down to the Hazlett boys and tried to buy a\r\nsteer they were fattening for the Indpls. market. They offered a\r\ngood price--more than the steer would have brought on the\r\nlegitimate market. They said they would butcher it there on the\r\nfarm, then in the evening they would come down and truck it home.\r\nThe Hazlett boys got a bit suspicious and came to me. I told them\r\nnobody could buy a steer and butcher it then and there, farmer or\r\nno farmer. The owner would have to feed it for not less than 30\r\ndays. They refused this sale. I told them to report the\r\nprospective buyers. Don't think they did. If they come to me--\r\nwhich they won't--I'll report them. We don't need that sort of\r\npeople in and around Russellville, or anywhere else. . .\r\n\r\nFootser goes to Mexico City, leaving St. Louis June 20 on the\r\nMissouri Pacific Lines. She has a lower to San Antonio, then\r\nanother lower to Mexico City. . . So she is set for what she\r\nthinks is a nice time in Mexico in school at that University,\r\ntaking Spanish. Just the fare there and back will take a sizable\r\nsteer, at the price we get for our steers, so there is where I\r\ncan put in a howl, good and loud. . . George Spencer told me that\r\nbefore the War he paid $1.39 for shirts at Montgomery Ward's.\r\nToday the same shirt costs him over $5.50 per shirt. And George\r\ndoesn't lie or resort to his imagination. Just the cold fact. At\r\nthe price we pay for shirts, we should be getting $50 for cattle\r\non the hoof. We get $16 to $18. . . Yesterday I bought 5 bananas\r\nat A&P for 23 cents. I think they were the first for two or three\r\nyears. Based on that price, cattle should be bringing between $30\r\nand $35. So if anyone has a kick coming it is the farmer--just\r\nlike it always has been. . . Now the thing for me to do is quit\r\nhowling and get out of the cattle business and into the banana or\r\ntextile business--for both of which I am too old and\r\ninexperienced. But better still, is to wait until this War is\r\nover and go into politics for the farmer, teeth and toe nail--for\r\nwhich I am also too old to do the very best job.\r\n\"Pap\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTROLLING SQUIRRELS IS TOUGH ON THE ROOF\r\n\r\nJune 28, 1945\r\n\r\nDear Frank:\r\n. . . We had a lot of corn in the crib at Ernest's place over in\r\nMontgomery County. The squirrels were eating it at a fearful\r\nrate. I expect they ate about 50 bushels of corn. The whole top\r\nof the corn in the cribs were solid cobs. I didn't know squirrels\r\ncould do so much eating. Ira had been telling me about it . . .\r\nAnyway, we went over one day to bring a couple of loads back to\r\nthe home farm. When we got there, there were four squirrels in\r\nthe crib that we counted. They went out the back end like flying\r\nsquirrels. I had the gun along. The crib had a galvanized roof.\r\nOne squirrel got right up in the apex of the roof . . . I let him\r\nhave it. The shot splattered more than I had thought it would, so\r\nthe roof is like a sieve. Another squirrel was on the \"plate\"\r\njust below the tin roof, outside the crib proper. So I let him\r\nhave it, and that punched about 50 holes in the tin roof outside\r\nthe crib. That was darned poor judgment, but the sight of those\r\ncobs had made me see red. They came to the crib by way of the\r\nwalnut trees and other trees along the west line fence. As Ira\r\nloaded, I watched that string of trees. Didn't take long for them\r\nto start a procession toward the crib. When they got on the last\r\nwalnut tree, closest to the crib, I let go at them. In all, we\r\ngot eight. . .\r\n\r\nThe second day, Ira was discing and I was at the crib alone\r\nloading the wagon we had brought along . . . and throwing out\r\ncobs. During one of my rests, I heard one on the roof. Soon he\r\nappears inside the crib going toward the corn . . . and he jumped\r\non a plate under the board floor right in front of me. I had one\r\nof your skeet loads in the right barrel for just such an\r\noccasion. I thought the wooden floor would protect the roof. So I\r\nlet him have it, and the sky appeared through the tin roof as if\r\nby magic. . .\r\n\"Pap\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V: LAST THINGS--1946-1954\r\n\r\nPap was pleased when his son returned from the war to settle in\r\nGreencastle and join the law practice. In fact, as time went on,\r\nhe turned over most of the cases to Frank, quit his lobbying\r\nposition for the railroads, ceased attending legislative sessions\r\nand devoted more and more of his attention to the farm and his\r\ninvestments.\r\n\r\nPap being Pap, however, he could not resist using this newfound\r\nluxury of time to write scores of letters about numerous subjects\r\nto various parties. It was probably his most productive literary\r\nperiod. With tongue nestled securely in cheek, he wrote:\r\n\r\n-- manufacturers, suggesting new inventions (such as a carving\r\nknife made from razor blades);\r\n\r\n-- corporations, complaining about directors who had less\r\nconfidence (or at least less stock) in their companies than Pap\r\ndid;\r\n\r\n--family and old friends, offering investment advice (don't\r\nspeculate);\r\n\r\n-- Congressmen, opposing pork-barrel spending and advocating a\r\nbalanced budget.\r\n\r\nOn at least one occasion, he even left a note attached to a\r\npackage of dry-iced beef being shipped to a daughter in New\r\nEngland, beseeching the cooperation of railroad cargo handlers in\r\nfacilitating the endeavor.\r\n\r\nPap took some trips with Munny or his grown children, to check up\r\non his property in Kansas or to visit with old friends, and went\r\non one extended journey through Latin America.\r\n\r\nAnd always, he wrote.\r\n\r\nThese were Pap's \"Golden Years,\" and he felt entitled to let his\r\nmind wander a bit, reflecting on his youth and past glories. He\r\nwas not shy about relating these memories, even to total\r\nstrangers, sometimes in an allegorical manner to make a point,\r\nand sometimes just for fun.\r\n\r\nA DOUBLE-EDGED CARVING KNIFE?\r\n\r\nDecember 1, 1946\r\nGillette Safety Razor Company\r\nBoston Mass.\r\n\r\nGentlemen:\r\nDid I see it, hear or read about it--or did I just dream it?\r\nSomehow, somewhere or someway I have the notion a contraption\r\nwas, or is on the market, consisting of a thin metal holder in\r\nwhich, say, three or four used double-edged razor blades can be\r\ninserted in a line, and thus make a carving knife. . . Is there\r\nsuch a tool, is it practical, where can it be bought and what\r\ndoes it cost?\r\n\r\nGentlemen, strange as it may seem to you, I am in dead earnest\r\nabout this seemingly frivolous matter. I don't have the knack for\r\nsharpening carving knives. Scissors grinders are few and far\r\nbetween in a town our size. Since the advent of chain-stores,\r\nbutcher shops are passť, and chain-store managers look on you as\r\na sort of moocher when you ask them to sharpen your knives . . .\r\nThen too, a dulling carving knife slips up on you like a heavy\r\nwine. Sooner or later you come home and there is a fowl to be\r\ncarved, the stores are closed and the knives are dull. Only last\r\nThursday I rassled a turkey all over the dining room. Hence, all\r\nthis is fresh in my mind and I am writing this inquiry before I\r\nagain forget about it--temporarily.\r\n\r\nI am enclosing stamped and addressed envelope for your\r\nconvenience. Please do me the favor. After a fashion . . . you\r\nsort of owe it to me. I bought my first Gillette when in college\r\nsometime between 1900 and 1904. I still have it. I have used no\r\nother kind except trying an electric affair the folks gave me one\r\ntime for Christmas, but I couldn't get the hang of it somehow.\r\nOne of the children commandeered it long ago. So, in truth and in\r\nfact I am a 40-odd-year customer of yours. . . .\r\nYours, for sharper carving knives,\r\n\r\n\r\nNEVER ON A SUNDAY\r\n\r\nJuly 27, 1947\r\n\r\nMy dear Ann Drew:\r\nThe new Buick came a week ago last Thursday. It is some sort of\r\nsupersonic model and the hind end sticks out of Ben Curtis'\r\ngarage. . . Right off the bat Aunt Margaret wanted to drive the\r\nfollowing Saturday to North Manchester to \"see Ida.\" She\r\ntelephoned Ida, who got us reservations at the local hotel for\r\nSaturday night, and up we went. . . to see Ida at the Peabody\r\nHome--an elegant place for a place of that character. Ida now is\r\none of the oldest inhabitants and has a front room. . .After\r\nsupper we drove all over town and a short way into the country\r\nand Ida liked that very, very much. Then back to the home where\r\nthe evening's conversation ran to bad eyesight, constipation and\r\npoor circulation, and Ida was worried about contracting some drug\r\nhabit. Aunt M. suggested whiskey to my utter surprise, and Ida\r\ncountered she would be afraid she would contract the whiskey\r\nhabit. The field narrowed down to fruits and fruit juices. . .\r\n\r\nNext morning, we took Ida for a good long ride in the country.\r\nThen started for home. Things went fine until we got past Wabash\r\non our way to Peru, and Aunt Margaret's conscience began to catch\r\nup with her, and she started quoting: \"The Lord made Heaven and\r\nEarth in six days and on the 7th He rested . . . Six days shall\r\nthou work and . . . remember the Sabbath to keep it holy (etc.)\"\r\n--Really, sometime she had taken a good deal of trouble to learn\r\nall her quotations--they lasted most all the way into the edge of\r\nPeru. Finally, I said: \"If I felt that way about it, I wouldn't\r\ntake any more Sunday trips\"--and she agreed heartily. . .\r\n\r\nSomewhere between Kokomo and Crawfordsville, Aunt Margaret\r\nsuggested that we \"come by Frank's orchard south of Morton and\r\nget some Early Transparents,\" as she wanted to make a little\r\njelly. To do that we would have to go out of our way and over a\r\nlot of loose gravel and through a lot of dust with the new shiny\r\ncar, so, after a proper interval, I said: \"Well, I don't know\r\nwhether you would want to do that on Sunday or not\"--just like a\r\nfirst class undertaker would say it. She thought a moment and\r\nthen said: \"That is right. I forgot. We can let that wait until\r\nsome week day.\"\r\n\r\nBetween Crawfordsville and home she suggested that \"we go out to\r\nArcola next Sunday and see Aunt Laura and George.\" I let that one\r\ngo and it was agreed she would write Aunt Laura that night and\r\ntell her we were coming. . . She wrote, but along about Wednesday\r\nshe asked me if I still wanted to go out to Arcola. I said: \"That\r\nis up to you\". . . Friday evening she called me over and wanted\r\nme to send a telegram to Arcola saying we would not be there\r\nSunday--her conscience had caught up again. I sent the telegram,\r\nand that was that.\r\n\r\nThat morning bright and early, Frank came over and, after the\r\nproper preliminaries and maneuvering, told me several of the VFW\r\nwere going to Lebanon, about 40 miles from here, Saturday to a\r\nDistrict Meeting; that he was to be installed District Provost,\r\nor some such thing; that the back seat of his new Ford was not\r\nvery comfortable; that he was to take five of them along with\r\nhim; that five would make it very crowded and uncomfortable in\r\nthat small a car; that on LONG trips a Ford didn't ride as easily\r\nas a larger car; and that he was just wondering if he might take\r\nthe Buick for a long hard drive like that, etc., etc. Lord! How\r\nmy sympathy for those old veterans--two of whom were over 30\r\nyears of age--welled up in my throat and almost stifled me. Of\r\ncourse they couldn't be asked or expected to submit to the\r\njolting and short wheel base of a brand new Ford on a trip of\r\nthat character. I suggested soft pillows and plenty of wool\r\nblankets, and offered to ask Mrs. Pierce or George McHaffie, who\r\ndrive cars (both octogenarians) to do the driving and see after\r\nthe parking and care of the car on arrival so those foot-sore and\r\nwar-wracked shells of their former selves should be put to a\r\nminimum of pain and inconvenience.\r\n\r\nResult: They went in the Buick. It rained like hell. Frank took\r\nthe Buick home and washed it, then came past Aunt Margaret's and\r\ntold her what a nice ride they had had. Then home to put the car\r\npart of the way in Ben's garage.\r\n\r\nFurther result: Aunt Margaret called me at 1 p.m. today and asked\r\nif I wanted to drive down to Shakamak State Park, about 30 miles\r\nsouth of Terre Haute. I told her it looked like more rain--and it\r\ndid--and then asked if she wanted to drive that far on Sunday.\r\nShe actually laughed out loud, said she had forgotten, and to\r\njust let it go.\r\nTime to quit,\r\nPap\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR CLARITY'S SAKE\r\n\r\nAugust 13, 1947\r\n\r\nDear Footser:\r\nI am trying to make this a round robin letter because since my\r\nlast missive of that character I have heard from all of you\r\nexcept Ann Drew at least once. You will have to show this copy to\r\nMargaret and Munny, and that way everybody will have equal access\r\nto my words of wisdom.\r\n\r\nAs seems to be my custom, according to most of you, I will start\r\nout in a more or less critical vein. Your letters are hard to\r\nread, and you are to be some sort of bilingual secretary to\r\nsomeone having a decidedly foreign name. . . Now, down to\r\nbusiness. You start at $35 per week, which in these days isn't\r\nmuch probably, but at that you have a start of $33 on me--$2 is\r\nthe munificent sum I received as Head Janitor and Assistant\r\nBookkeeper at staid, dependable, conservative, old Russellville\r\nBank. . . Anyway and however, don't let the starting salary get\r\nyou down. Everybody has to start, and those who start on a small\r\nscale sometimes get to be those who end with a big auger, boring\r\na big hole. If the job is what you want, then the thing to do is\r\nto accept, and try it out. As long as you try and apply yourself,\r\nand work at it for the interests of your employers, you can rest\r\nassured I will help you out financially--that seems to be what us\r\nold fellers are here for.\r\n\r\nI have written a pass for you, New York to Greencastle and\r\nreturn. I don't know whether it will come or not--the Roads are\r\ntightening up, especially on children who have reached maturity.\r\n. . . The big roads now have a rule of issuing only so many passes\r\nto each family every year, and they evidently base the number on\r\na normal family, as normal families go these times--so we are\r\nhandicapped right at the start. . .\r\n\r\nSarah Jane asked about beef, and the chance to get some in some\r\nway. That is much easier said than done. It involves a whole lot\r\nof things. I will not be fattening--that is, corn feeding--any\r\ncattle this Winter. I do not have the corn, and the present crop\r\nlooks mighty bad. It is quite probable I could buy a whole\r\ncarcass or half a carcass for her here, but there is no easy way\r\ngetting it to her. It would be very expensive, because it would\r\nhave to be processed here, then shipped to her in dry ice, and\r\ndry ice is hard to get. It has to come from Indpls. and is a\r\nproblem to go get and then pack around the beef back here. Then\r\ntoo, freight handling is questionable and it would be a mighty\r\neasy thing to get side-tracked and thus spoil. Beef out here is\r\nalso very high. . .\r\n\r\nFind out where the roller towels are. The one you and Margaret\r\nleft was a bit dirty when you got away, and now it looks like the\r\none at the old high school building that hung at the side of the\r\nprinting press . . . .\r\nPap\r\n\r\n\r\nTHANKS FOR THE COMPLIMENT ANYWAY\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 1948\r\nThe Honorable Frank M. Martin\r\nSpencer, Indiana\r\n\r\nMy dear Frank:\r\n. . . You have made it hard to refuse your kind and thoughtful\r\noffer to make the after-dinner talk in March. There are many,\r\nmany reasons why I should not, among them being I am totally out\r\nof practice, and my experience with false teeth has been fearful-\r\n-and unexpected.\r\n\r\nFrank, I want you to realize I am sincerely obliged for your\r\nthoughtfulness in asking me down. Invitations of that character\r\nare coming fewer and farther between. As a matter of cold fact,\r\nhowever, I am oratorically about where old Anthony Battle, an ex-\r\nslave, was financially a long time ago when Uncle Bob Black\r\noperated a horse and mule sale barn here. Needing some change, he\r\nturned to Anthony and asked him if he had change for a $10 bill.\r\n\"No suh\", said Uncle Anthony, \"but ah thanks you fo' th'\r\ncompl'ment jes th' same.\"\r\nAs Ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nTICKETS TO THE INDY 500\r\n\r\nMarch 17, 1948\r\nMr. B. Ryall Chant\r\nCare: Chant & Co.\r\nPort Jervis, New York\r\n\r\nMy dear Ryall:\r\nI have your letter of March 10th, concerning tickets for the 500\r\nMile Race and hotel reservations for May 28-31, 1948.\r\n\r\nI have had reservations made for you at the Claypool Hotel. . .\r\nDue to the tremendous demand for rooms all hotels hike their\r\nprices for the Race and all require advance deposits. . . Your\r\nentire room bill will be $53--$45 of which must be paid in\r\nadvance. . . The Claypool is the Royal Baking Powder of\r\nIndianapolis hotels, but the Lincoln is beginning to cut-in. All\r\nRace activities, however, will be centered in and around the\r\nClaypool.\r\n\r\nTickets for the Race are something else again. They begin going\r\nin the Fall prior to the Race. Being a Democrat and therefore in\r\ndisrepute in Indiana these past three years, I had to work\r\nthrough Railroad connections to the Governor's No. 1 man, who is\r\na R.R. associate and who assures me he will get the best tickets\r\navailable, due to the fact the Race people always retain\r\ndesirable seats--just in case. I tried to get you in a box within\r\nhailing distance, at least, of His Honor, but in my judgment, if\r\nyou ever see him there at all, he will appear about the size of a\r\nblue-bottle fly. Remember the track is two and a half miles per\r\nlap and all the grandstand, paddock and other seating is outside\r\nthe track. . . Naturally, I am getting you as near the starting\r\n(and finishing) wire as is humanly possible this late date . . .\r\nI do not know the cost of the tickets, but my guess is $15 to $18\r\neach. . .\r\n\r\nYou will probably see a half-mile of 100 and more massed bands\r\ncoming down the stretch, as one of the preliminaries. All the\r\nFords, Firestones, Chryslers, Buicks, Packards, Goodyears,\r\nNashes, Goodrichs and Perfect Circle Rings will be among those\r\npresent, and you will look over a square mile and better of solid\r\nparked cars. Castor oil fumes will make you think of Ma and Pa\r\nlong years ago. . .\r\nYours, for more paddock seats,\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME GENUINE INDIANA MAPLE 'MOLASSES'\r\n\r\nMarch 24, 1948\r\n\r\nHon. S.C. Murray, General Counsel\r\nNew York Central System\r\nLa Salle Station\r\nChicago, Illinois\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Murray:\r\nI am sending you some maple molasses almost hot from the\r\nevaporator. These molasses are the product of the President of\r\nour small Bank at Russellville, Mr. Harold A. Fordice, who is a\r\nPresbyterian, a Wabash College graduate, a Phi Beta Kappa, a\r\nRepublican--and a bachelor. He is also a most ethical gentleman,\r\nand therefore far, far from adulterating his molasses with\r\nanything whatsoever, as is now pretty much the custom by reason\r\nof the fact maple molasses prices have soared about like I did\r\nthe time I first took the oath as a Member of the General\r\nAssembly at Indianapolis in 1913 . . . adulterated flavor is\r\nalmost forgotten. Children, generally speaking, do not like it.\r\nThey prefer sugar syrups. What you will be receiving is the pure\r\narticle. . . Maple molasses hereabouts are almost a thing of the\r\npast--like wild pigeons and Democratic landslides. The old trees\r\nare dying out, and no new ones coming on. Lately, the new\r\nPresident of Wabash College sent down to Russellville a general\r\norder for 100 gallons. . .\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nP.S. A real old time genuine Hoosier never speaks of the Indiana\r\nbrand as being a \"maple syrup.\"\r\nA.E.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE'S THE BEEF?\r\n\r\nUndated note attached to a package of frozen beef shipped by\r\nrail.\r\n\r\nTo whomsoever reads this:\r\n\r\nThis baggage contains some frozen beef an old Hoosier pappy is\r\ntaking his daughter and grandchildren in Worcester, Mass. It left\r\nGreencastle, Ind., at 12:50 p.m.(?)3-29-49 on N.Y.C. No. 12\r\n(Southwestern). The old pappy and his meat will probably part\r\ncompany at Buffalo, where his car will be transferred to N.Y.C.\r\nNo. 28 (New England States) that evidently does not carry\r\nbaggage. So, where and how his meat will go from Buffalo on, only\r\nyou will know--the old pappy hopes the quickest and most direct\r\nway, and therefore respectfully asks your help, if you can give\r\nany.\r\n\r\nThe meat you are sitting on just didn't happen--like paw paws and\r\nwild black berries. It is out of an 1,800-pound, nearly three-\r\nyear-old Hereford steer, dry-lot and corn-fed for over a year. In\r\ncase you don't know . . . the 1947-48 and 1948-49 winters in\r\nIndiana weren't exactly like Miami Beach of a sunny Sunday\r\nafternoon. . . Rain, snow and sleet. Cold rubber boots in\r\nFebruary mud. Sockless shoes in July dust. All the clothes you\r\ncan pile on in winter, and about all the law allows you to take\r\noff in hot summer. . . The cement water tank has to be kept full\r\nof clean drinking water in summer, and the tank warmer going on\r\nbelow freezing days.\r\n\r\n\"Seminole IV,\" as we called him, to finish out well, had to have\r\na clean place in the barn to eat, to stand in, and to sleep in.\r\nThat called for a pitch fork, a strong back, and a conveniently\r\nplaced manure spreader. Fresh bedding, feed grinder going every\r\nother day, a handy block of salt, a little ground alfalfa hay,\r\nthe gates and corn crib doors kept shut. . . We'll say nothing\r\nabout the 150 odd bushels of ground corn it took to put Seminole\r\nto 1,800 pounds, but it didn't just sift itself into his feed\r\ntrough automatically--from nowhere.\r\n\r\nNo. There was more to Seminole than the well-trimmed sirloin\r\nsteak you see on the kitchen table all ready for the broiler.\r\n\r\nAnd so it may happen after grandpappy is gone and the\r\ngrandchildren are grown-up and in well-worn harness themselves,\r\nthey will say, \"Well, the old fellow was a pretty good sort after\r\nall, but, on the other hand, it does seem that with the War\r\nprices they had in his day, he could have left a little more if\r\nhe had tried a little harder.\"\r\n\r\nJust in the event you want to make some comments and have the\r\ntime and inclination to tell of Seminole's progress and last\r\nwhereabouts, I am enclosing some addressed post cards for your\r\nconvenience. Nothing compulsory--wholly voluntary.\r\nI thank you.\r\nPrayerfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nCUBAN DIVORCE, NOT HORSE DISEASE\r\n\r\nJune 17, 1949\r\nU.S. Senator Homer E. Capehart\r\nWashington, D.C.\r\n\r\nMy dear Senator:\r\n\r\nI am in rather urgent need of learning all the grounds for\r\nDivorce in Cuba. Is that information easily available to you\r\nthere in Washington? If so, I would greatly appreciate such\r\ninformation. The information I am seeking is of considerable\r\nvalue to some interested clients here.\r\n\r\nIn your experience as Senator you have doubtless had some rare\r\nrequests from the \"folks back home.\" This inquiry of mine should\r\nrank rather high. A year ago . . . I could not then visualize my\r\ndivorce practice getting much beyond the confines of the State of\r\nIndiana.\r\n\r\nThis letter reminds me of an experience I had long years ago. . .\r\nI wrote my Congressman, Ralph Moss, asking if he would send me a\r\ncopy of Jefferson's Manual. In due course of mail here came a\r\nrather well-bound copy of \"The Diseases of Horses,\" and a note\r\nsaying he had had considerable difficulty complying with my\r\nrequest as the edition was exhausted. How it happened that way, I\r\nwill never know--nor did Mr. Moss. . .\r\n\r\n\r\nA BETTER USE FOR 'REMOVABLE SEATS'?\r\n\r\nJune 24, 1949\r\nCase & Sons\r\nRobinson, Illinois\r\n\r\nGentlemen:\r\nI'm having a devil of a time with a Case lavatory in the second\r\nfloor bathroom here at home, and to me it seems far rougher than\r\nit should be. The cold water faucet sprung a drip--a most\r\npersistent drip. My friend and plumber, Mr. Lee Reeves, came up\r\nfrom time to time and eventually diagnosed the case (no intended\r\npun on your name) as the water in the cold faucet having cut or\r\nworn a groove across the top of the removable seat for that\r\nfaucet. He had none to fit, so he sort of filed the groove out,\r\nsaid the repair would probably be temporary, and in the meantime\r\nwe'd both begin a quest for Case removable seats that would fit.\r\nI went to Indianapolis to the Central supply Co. They said they\r\nhad none, but if they did they'd have to know the number or size\r\nof the lavatory, as different-sized lavatories had different-\r\nsized removable seats. I came home but could find no number. . .\r\n\r\nI bought that lavatory from you in person, direct, about 1942--or\r\njust about the time the Government stopped your selling to the\r\nproletariat. I was frantic for some bathroom fixtures. The family\r\nhad taken a fancy to yours on account of its alleged quietness.\r\nThe girls were in the University here. It was brooded among my\r\nwomenfolk that every time they had company the \"old man\" started\r\nthe water going in the bathrooms and it sounded like Coulee Dam\r\nafter a hard rain. I got in the car and drove to Robinson. You\r\nfolks finally fixed me up with two lavatories. I brought them\r\nhome in the car. It must have been that at that same time you\r\nordered me a bath tub from Louisville or Cincinnati. . .\r\n\r\nIn due time the old you-know-what started her drip, drip, drip,\r\ngetting worse. . . Yesterday Mr. Reeves came up with an\r\nassortment of removable seats he had collected. He took out the\r\noffending removable seat, and sure enough, the water or pixies or\r\ngremlins had again cut a channel across the top of said removable\r\nseat. He thought he had a removable seat that would fit--it\r\nseemed the same size as the original--but it didn't. In\r\ndesperation he gave up the job. We turned off the cold water\r\nintake at the valve underneath. He took the old offending\r\nremovable seat for further efforts to get a duplicate. We\r\nheartily damned removable seats of all and every kind and\r\ncharacter and wheresoever situated, together with the companies\r\nwho made 'em.\r\n\r\nWoe is me. Evil days have come. The half has not been told\r\nherein. In my troubled sleep I am beset with removable seats. In\r\nmy waking hours I am confounded by removable seats. Time was only\r\nyesteryear when I didn't know, or care, what a removable seat\r\nwas. Within a fortnight or so removable seats have become deadly\r\n--like unto a cobra or black widow. The neighbors are\r\nclandestinely talking about a Guardian . . .\r\n\r\nCan't you do something for us? Can't you find the original\r\ninvoice (somewhere near 1942) or can't you decide from this\r\nenclosed masterpiece of a drawing of mine what kind and size of\r\nremovable seats we are needing, and send me four (two for each\r\nlavatory, just in case)? I need removable seats. I long for\r\nremovable seats. Send them with the compliments of the Company,\r\nor else enclose a bill and I'll gladly pay it--I suppose. I'm not\r\nso sure about the \"gladly\" part. . .\r\n\r\nAnd yet, withal, removable seats of a sort could be a boon. I am\r\nthinking now if they could be available to our womenfolk who have\r\nreached or passed the age of 40 years, say. We live here in the\r\nolder, more conservative part of town--what you might call the\r\nEastern Star and DAR section. I have mentally canvassed our one\r\nblock. If you can devise a practical feminine removable seat, I\r\ncan give you every reasonable assurance you will get from one to\r\ntwo orders in every house and apartment in our block. I\r\npersonally guarantee one order. This being true, then visualize\r\nall the States (particularly the corn belt), and then the entire\r\nknown world, with special stress on Holland, parts of Germany and\r\nall of Italy--to say nothing about the Eskimos and Africans. It\r\nwill stagger you, as your faucet removable seat has staggered,\r\nyea, paralyzed me.\r\n\r\nAnd thus I leave it. Do something, I beseech you.\r\nPrayerfully,\r\nAndrew E. Durham\r\n\r\nIn subsequent correspondence to daughter Margaret, Pap related\r\nthat the above letter had the desired effect, because by return\r\nmail the company sent him four removable seats, at no charge.\r\nHowever, the world is still awaiting action on his suggestion for\r\na broader application of removable seat technology.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF QUESTIONABLE REPUTE\r\n\r\nNovember 5, 1949\r\nHon. Claud Bowers\r\nU.S. Minister to Chile\r\nSantiago, Chile\r\n\r\nMy dear Ambassador:\r\nThis is a voice from the long, long ago. It must have been about\r\n1904 you were a candidate for Congress against old man Holiday. I\r\nwas just out of college. During the campaign you made some very\r\nforceful and logical speeches backed by excellent oratory. I\r\nattended and was fascinated--got the political bug. I am not\r\nquite sure I got in on what we called the \"Week's County Drive\"\r\nof your campaign, where the \"small fry\" in the last cars of the\r\ncavalcade ate miles and miles of gravel and road dust kicked up\r\nby the cars on ahead. If not, then I sure got in on them later.\r\n\r\nMy daughter, Aura May Durham, and I hope to arrive in Santiago,\r\nDecember 20, 1949, during a rather extended trip into South\r\nAmerica. I am enclosing a copy of our alleged itinerary. We are\r\nhaving considerable--very considerable--trouble arranging for\r\nsome six visas, or their equivalents. But we expect to arrive on\r\nschedule if humanly possible, provided I retain my heretofore\r\ngood health and reasonably fair mental facilities. I have been\r\nvaccinated and \"shot\" for about everything except treason, but my\r\nlack of a criminal record is universally questioned south of the\r\nEquator. Our local Chief of Police has, for the past four weeks,\r\nvaliantly signed varying documents denying varying insinuations I\r\nhave a criminal record and . . . our local banker has spent long\r\nnights compiling \"letters of commendations and responsibility\"\r\nthat would tend to meet the requirements. . .\r\n\r\nAll this and much more has gotten me to where I am. It is too\r\nmuch for a small-town Hoosier lawyer to stand--and a Democrat to\r\nboot. And so, if on or about December 20th, you see a rather\r\nsprightly young woman leading a doddering old man in his upper\r\n60's into the lobby of the Carrera Hotel, then charitably\r\nreflect, \"it was not always so with him.\"\r\n\r\nNaturally, I would be immensely pleased to see you.\r\n\r\nYours, for more respect and credibility South of the Border for\r\nsmall-town Hoosier Democrats,\r\nAndrew E. Durham\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECULATION NO, BOARDERS MAYBE\r\n\r\nJuly 17, 1950\r\n\r\nDear Footser,\r\nYour AT&T dividend check just came this morning. The Quaker came\r\nthe latter part of last week. I waited until both were in before\r\nmailing same to you. You evidently have 32 shares of the former\r\nand 10 of the latter--not a bad showing for one of your age--far\r\nmore investment than I had at your age. Looks like, with a little\r\nmore investment, you will be getting something like $1 per day\r\nfrom investments alone. That will be something not exactly to be\r\nsneezed at. . .\r\n\r\nAnnabelle Lee wrote me that someone had advised her to sell her\r\nQuaker and take her profit, lay the money aside and then invest\r\nin something else at a low price. That, to my way of looking, is\r\nbad advice. The money might lay and lay, and then when she did\r\ninvest, she might buy something that would not be so good. Then\r\ntoo she would have to pay income taxes on the profit. . . Good\r\nstocks do not rise or fall rapidly. It's the \"cats and dogs\" that\r\ndo that. And there is where the speculators come in. They are\r\nsupposed to know a good deal about \"cats and dogs\" . . . Two or\r\nthree or four years ago, I bought 100 shares of General Motors\r\nfor about $4,000. It sells for more than double that now. All of\r\nwhich is quite fine, but you bet your boots I am not selling mine\r\nfor the profit. I bought that 100 shares to keep. It is nice to\r\nsee your stocks on the uprise--fine and dandy--but if I sold it\r\nnow, what would I put the money in, with my limited knowledge of\r\nstocks and stock prices, advances and declines? No, the thing for\r\nme to do is to keep it and hope that the company gets stronger\r\nand stronger, and better and better. . .\r\n\r\nTommy Rivers, of Russellville, has finished installing the\r\ndishwasher, two sinks, dispos-all, and cabinets. Together, they\r\ntake the whole south side of the kitchen--a formidable array.\r\nMunny was bent on having two big sinks, and now, by golly, she\r\nhas them. The kitchen looks like a city hotel kitchen, so now,\r\nI've been casting about for boarders. . . We've just got to make\r\nthat outlay back somehow. . .\r\n\r\nP.S. The dandelion count is now 20,130.\r\nPap\r\n\r\n\r\nA SPECIALIST IN FASHION REFORM\r\n\r\nApril 2, 1951\r\nBeymer & Beymer\r\nLakin, Kansas\r\nAttention: Mr. Clyde Beymer Jr.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Beymer:\r\nOn March 23, 1951, I wrote my nephew in California by Air Mail\r\nconcerning the proposed sale of our quarter section in Kearny\r\nCounty.\r\n\r\nI look back. When I was about the right age for such things, my\r\nfather's $12 to $15 suits and 10 cents socks, especially the\r\nlatter, looked pretty common to me. Also a lot of other things\r\nabout him and the family generally. I expressed as much. At first\r\nhe paid no attention. I persisted. He wakened one day with this:\r\n\r\n\"I've been thinking about your case a good deal. You seem to have\r\nthe making of a fine merchant tailor and big city haberdasher.\r\nI've accordingly made arrangements. Next September you are going\r\nto a Military School (in those days considered more or less of a\r\nhigh class reform school) where they all dress alike, and where\r\nyou can do them a lot of good in dress reform. So get ready.\"\r\n\r\nAnd you know, after graduation there in 1899, on coming home, and\r\nthereafter, Pap's 10 cent black socks and unvarying gray suits\r\ngot to looking better and better as the few remaining years went\r\nby. . .\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nSKIP THE 'HEARTS AND HANDS'\r\n\r\nOctober 22, 1951\r\nHemphill, Noyes, Graham, Parsons & Co.\r\n15 Broad Street\r\nNew York 5, N.Y.\r\n\r\nGentlemen:\r\nI am just in receipt of a faded and washed-out 8x12\" sheet of\r\npaper . . . that at first glance would seem to indicate I am now\r\nthe proud owner of 100 shares of the common stock of Dun &\r\nBradstreet, Inc., but subject to enough whereases, to-wits, here\r\ninserts, and/ors, etc., as to make me wonder just what it is I do\r\nhave. . .I say \"faded and washed-out.\" That is a true\r\nChurchillian understatement. I feel rather sure some of the Dun\r\nor Bradstreet children must have thrown my whatever-it-is in the\r\ncreek back of their house where it has laid immersed since Oct.\r\n2, 1951, the date I was supposed to have bought 100 shares of\r\nD&B.\r\n\r\nSaid certificate bears this hopeful imprint near the top--\r\n\"TEMPORARY CERTIFICATE: Exchangeable for Engraved Certificate\r\nwhen ready for delivery.\" That is more or less encouraging but a\r\nbit vague. Who or what is referred to in that statement of\r\nreadiness--the Company, or me, or the Engraved Certificates after\r\nthey get dried-out from being in the creek too?\r\n\r\nThe above reminds me of the marriage license situation in\r\nIndiana. Here, prospective brides and grooms appear together\r\nbefore the Clerks of the various Circuit Courts to make out\r\npreliminary papers and then buy their licenses. The State\r\nfurnishes a plain, printed 8x12 license for $1.50. That one is\r\nauthoritative and originally intended to end the fee then and\r\nthere. But our Clerks of today are away ahead on Court House\r\npsychology. And anybody who has ever been a groom knows grooms\r\nare totally non compes mentis on such occasions. So here is what\r\nhappens to them. . . The affable Clerk says nothing about the\r\n$1.50 license, but with solemn and measured tread goes to the\r\nsafe, which is always in plain view, fumbles with the combination\r\nand, after a bit more fumbling in the dark recesses of the safe,\r\nas solemnly returns with three shiny, crackling parchment rolls\r\nof different lengths--a 10x14 lithographed Sheaf of Wheat with\r\nthe usual recitals in scroll, price $5; a 12x18 Gates-Ajar beauty\r\nwith even more scrollwork, price $10; and a magnificent 16x24\r\nHeart and Hand master License, with a beautiful red heart just\r\nover the clasped hands, and endlessly scrolled, price\r\n$15--something I knew you fine young citizens of our County would\r\nwant the moment I first saw you come in the door,\" etc. . . .\r\n\r\nBut to get back. Would you please enlighten me as to just what I\r\ndo have, and what, if anything, I can expect in the future, and\r\nwhen? If you are on speaking terms with any of the Messrs. Dun &\r\nBradstreet, tell 'em your corn-fed Hoosier customer, while\r\nconsiderably puzzled with what he has, is onto the County Clerk's\r\nracket in Indiana, and he doesn't want any Heart and Hand\r\npermanent D&B Certificate, but just an uninundated one the\r\nCompany furnishes, and he wants it free, including postage both\r\nfor the new Certificate and the return of the water-soaked\r\nvariety--although he doesn't think the latter is worth return\r\npostage. . .\r\n\r\nYours, for readable Certificates--for free,\r\n\r\n\r\nFAST THINKING IN A REVOLVING DOOR\r\n\r\nFebruary 5, 1952\r\nMrs. Cecil Harden\r\nMember, House of Representatives\r\nWashington, D.C.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mrs. Harden:\r\nHaving been a Member of the Indiana Legislature years ago, I know\r\nwhat it is to receive letters, memorials, petitions and\r\nremonstrances from \"the best constituency in the World,\" as your\r\nremote predecessor, \"Red\" Purnell, used to say. I wanted to know\r\nwho they were and what sort of axes they had to grind. Hence,\r\nhere is a short pedigree of your correspondent. I live in\r\nGreencastle; am a farmer, small town banker (Russellville Bank),\r\nmarried, 6 children--5 of them girls, Presbyterian, Notary\r\nPublic, Democrat, can balance diced potatoes on my knife with the\r\nbest of them, and encountered my first revolving door at\r\nTiffany's in New York City in the year 1905.\r\n\r\nThis last was due to the fact \"Red\" and I had gone to New York to\r\nshow the effete East just what sort of young manhood the Mid-west\r\nwas producing, and hoped to impress them accordingly. Vain hope.\r\n\"Red\" was engaged to Elizabeth (his wife). I was to be \"best\r\nman.\" On the train enroute, \"Red\" decided he had to get Elizabeth\r\na silver spoon with the name \"Tiffany\" on it. After riding up 5th\r\nAvenue on one of those busses that had a spiral stairway at the\r\nback leading up to the open air top (it was January and we were\r\nup there alone of course), the better to get the panoramic view,\r\nwe alighted. . . \"Red,\" being the prospective purchaser, led the\r\nway to said door and into it--and came around and right back\r\nagain. At Indiana University I had taken a course in Public\r\nSpeaking with the ultimate object of supplanting Senator\r\nBeveridge and William J. Bryan on the speaker's platform. In this\r\ncourse, Prof. Clapp had stressed \"learning to think with\r\nlightning speed on your feet.\" There I was on my feet and eager\r\nto demonstrate that father had not sold shoat after shoat in\r\nvain, for my educational expenses. With lightning rapidity I\r\ndiagnosed the error and went in and stayed in. \"Red\" made it his\r\nnext try.\r\n\r\nThe above was intended to be short but something led me to think\r\nabout \"Red\", and away I went.\r\n\r\nI want to call your attention to a matter . . .\r\n\r\nWhy don't you come to Greencastle one of these days and come to\r\nsee us? I don't believe we've had a Congressman regularly in the\r\nhouse since \"Red\" Purnell used to infest us. It would advance our\r\nsocial position.\r\n\r\nYours, for social advancement, and a change in the top brackets\r\nthere in Washington next Fall,\r\n\r\n\r\nA PASS\r\n\r\nJune 23, 1952\r\nHonorable George W. Henley\r\nCitizens Trust Building\r\nBloomington, Indiana\r\n\r\nMy dear George:\r\nA Monon Railroad pass? Manna from Bloomington! . . . I am\r\ntremendously pleased and thankful for your kindness and\r\nthoughtfulness in this matter. I don't want to sound egotistical\r\nbut I think I am known as the \"Railroad man\" of these parts, and\r\nas such, I have been asked if I carried passes, among them of\r\ncourse, if I had a Monon pass. Naturally it was none of the\r\nasker's business, but when in telling I had none, it was a trifle\r\nembarrassing and caused a sort of wonderment on the part of the\r\ninquirer, because, among other things, I never failed during the\r\nyears when talking at the University or the various Service Clubs\r\nto get in a thought as to how the Railroads were being imposed\r\nupon and receiving very unfair treatment at the hands of the\r\nLegislature and Public generally. I think it has paid off,\r\nbecause after these long years, our and bordering Senators and\r\nRepresentatives in the Legislature have been inclined very\r\ngenerally to protect the Railroads. Not always, but quite\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\nPlease be assured I do not want any paying employment at the\r\nhands of the Monon. I have virtually retired and turned things\r\nover to my son, who is Prosecutor here. I just handle a bit of\r\nprobate work--old clients. . .\r\nCordially,\r\n\r\n\r\nA MODEST FAMILY ART SHOWING\r\n\r\nJuly 30, 1952\r\nAmerican Telephone and Telegraph Company\r\n195 Broadway\r\nNew York 7, N.Y.\r\n\r\nGentlemen:\r\nUnder date of July 21, 1952, three of my family and I subscribed\r\nfor a total of $5,900 of your 3% debentures. . . On July 26, I\r\nreceived a telephone call from your New York office saying you\r\nhad received the subscription. The woman to whom I talked\r\nanswered in detail all the information I had asked for, clearly,\r\ndistinctly, concisely and to the exact point. She was a whiz.\r\n\r\nA short time ago I found myself a trifle out of place in the\r\nmidst of an enthusiastic discussion of Art, art galleries,\r\nbeautiful paintings, elusive smiles, precious lights and shadows,\r\ninconceivable imagination and some superlatives far, far beyond\r\nmy ken. Suffice to say, in my corn-fed Hoosier simplicity an\r\nengraved Certificate for 100 shares of American Telephone and\r\nTelegraph is about the prettiest picture I have seen.\r\n\r\nTherefore, patiently anticipating a very modest October private\r\nfamily showing of Art at its best, as I see it, I remain\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGING BY THE DAMPNESS\r\n\r\nSeptember 16, 1952\r\nThe First National Bank of Chicago\r\nChicago, Illinois\r\n\r\nDear Sirs,\r\nI am herewith enclosing 3 certificates of the Capital Stock of\r\nStandard Oil Company (New Jersey) as follows . . . It is my\r\nrequest that the above certificates be combined into one . . .\r\n\r\nIt may be I should have sent these certificates to the Transfer\r\nAgent rather than you, but . . . I feel more at home with your\r\nBank, for, let it be known, I am still a part of Russellville\r\nBank in this County. As head janitor of that Institution in the\r\nmid-90's, we opened an account with your good Bank, and it is\r\nstill open. Later I rose to such responsibility therein I was\r\npermitted to write with pen and ink (Arnold's Ink in earthenware\r\nbottles or jugs) Russellville Bank's Letters of Transmittal to\r\nyour Bank. That done, I would carry said letter back behind the\r\nsafe to the \"letter press,\" open the thin sheeted copy book and\r\n. . . lay my letter face up below a clean sheet. I would then pick\r\nup the 3 gallon bucket and go to the town pump down the street\r\ntoward the railroad and get a fresh bucket of water. Next I would\r\nput a rectangular piece of cloth made for the purpose into the\r\nbucket of water and then squeeze it to a proper stage of\r\ndampness. Then spread it over the clean sheet . . . Then close\r\nthe copy book and put it in the press and start revolving the\r\nwheel of said press much like the old time brakeman would \"set\"\r\nthe brake on a box car before the advent of air brakes. The\r\nprocess would give us a copy of said letter of transmittal and at\r\nthe same time a questionable policy of insurance against you big\r\ncity Banker slickers claiming you never received a check of\r\ncorrection from Butler Brothers to our local general store, Inge,\r\nRoss & Co.\r\n\r\nIt is true that success of operation in all of this did depend in\r\na minor way on getting the component parts in proper order--a boy\r\nhad to be alert at all times, as was becoming a future teller and\r\nmoney changer, but the real artistry and measure of\r\nresponsibility lay in getting the proper dampness in the cloth.\r\nIf too wet, the ink of the letter spread to hell and gone. If too\r\ndry, the sturdy dependable Arnold's Ink made no impression on the\r\nclean sheet.\r\n\r\nYou who read this may have become disgusted with all this old\r\ntime stuff long before now and said to yourselves, \"Why all this\r\njunk when the main idea is to get a new Certificate?\" The answer\r\nis I got a bit retrospective as I was writing. I got back to the\r\n$2 a week days when father insisted I save at least 10 cents a\r\nweek out of that.\r\n\r\nBut bear with me just a little longer. The copy book cloth\r\ntechnique I acquired at Russellville Bank was to become a boon\r\nlater, when, as the six children came along, seemingly with too\r\nmuch regularity, I could slip an educated hand under the bottom\r\nof a sleeping infant and measure the dampness thereof to a nicety\r\nand judge to a fraction just when the cloth HAD to be changed.\r\nMaybe those Russellville Bank experiences were later to save me\r\nthe possibility of facing the notoriety incident to an indictment\r\nfor infanticide by drowning.\r\n\r\nYours, for bigger and better posting machines, et. als., and\r\nsharper carbon paper,\r\n\r\n\r\nHITLER'S FAVORITE PICTURE IS SAFE\r\n\r\nSept. 27, 1952\r\n\r\nDear Sugar Foot:\r\nMunny and I returned last evening from a short visit with Mr. and\r\nMrs. Walter J. Behmer at Culver, Indiana, on Lake Maxinkuckee or\r\nhowever it is spelled. Had a fine time. . .\r\n\r\nYesterday, we got an early start home. I wanted to see a little\r\nprivate bank at San Pierre, Ind., away up north of Lafayette on\r\nold No. 43. It used to be a private bank, but I found out they\r\nhad changed to a state bank just this last January. Didn't stay\r\nthere long.\r\n\r\nMunny wanted to see Elizabeth Shoaf Purnell (Red's widow) who\r\nlives at Attica, Ind. . . . (She) was giving a party tonight for\r\nanother old woman friend of ours, and who is her cousin, the\r\nformer Miss Sina Booe; then became Sina B. Songer; then Sina B.\r\nRoss; and now has a new husband, some Frenchman whose name I do\r\nnot remember and am too hurried to look up. They were married\r\nabout the first of this year. She met him at Hot Springs,\r\nArkansas--and is he a honey? He is. (After seeing Elizabeth we\r\ncame home by way of Veedersburg, where Sina and said husband now\r\nlive. Sina's parents struck oil years and years ago, and built a\r\nrather pretentious house in Veedersburg. At the time of the\r\nstriking of oil, Red Purnell said to me that the \"oil would agree\r\nwith Sina,\" and it has). If ever I saw an adventurer for a rich\r\nwidow, he is it. She is about 75 and he is 12 years younger than\r\nshe. Therefore he will outlast her, in all probability. I doubt\r\nif he has ANY business, but says he is a sort of artist; sells\r\npictures or something like that. Says he will be having an\r\nexhibit soon in New Orleans and southern cities. For a wedding\r\npresent he gave her two pictures--God knows what they are. I\r\nthink I probably saw them but am confused with the multitude of\r\nobjects he showed hanging all over HER house. She takes all that\r\nstuff in like a real soldier. I have seen four flushers in my\r\ntime--but he is tops in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThis new husband talks a blue streak and he fails utterly to\r\nspeak illy of himself. To be truthful, I was amazed the way he\r\ntalked. Maybe the highlight--if there could be a highlight in his\r\nconversation--went something like this. On the grand piano\r\n(Sina's) was a small picture in a sort of glass rope frame. We\r\nthink the picture was named \"Blowing Bubbles.\" Anyway, it was one\r\nof Hitler's favorites and Bro. Hitler kept it on his desk. In\r\nsome miraculous way, this new husband of Sina's got hold of it. I\r\nthink he said he stole it, maybe meaning he gave so little for it\r\nthat same was next to stealing, but however he got it, it is now\r\nvalued at $250,000, which I would say was a dam sight too high,\r\nbut sitting there in Veedersburg on Sina's piano, right out in\r\nthe open, I should venture the guess it will soon disappear once\r\nthe Public finds out its value. There is one thing sure--I will\r\nnever break into Sina's house to steal that picture. It is\r\nabsolutely safe so far as I am concerned, much safer than the\r\nweather-beaten tomatoes on Ben's back porch right here next door.\r\n\r\nEventually he asked my business. I told him I was a farmer, and\r\nthen the fireworks did start. Above all things on this Earth he\r\nwanted to be a farmer. That was his life's ambition, and on and\r\non he went. I told him there was much more about farming than\r\nmeets the naked eye.\r\n\r\nSooner or later Munny will give you the address up on 5th Ave.\r\nnear Tiffany's where he is very prominent in some way or other.\r\n\r\nThis will do for today,\r\nPap\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODIST PIONEERS THINK OF PERU\r\n\r\nNovember 16, 1952\r\n\r\nDear Footser:\r\n. . . I have, in a rather small way, suggested to Mutiny and\r\nMargaret that we try to spend from mid-January to about mid-April\r\nin Lima, Peru. . . There was an article in the Nov., 1952,\r\nHoliday telling about Peru and how cheap it was to live there. . .\r\nI realize how much of a handicap we would be under. As time\r\ngoes on, I get a little deafer, and God knows I am too old to try\r\nto learn any Spanish. . . If we could rent a modern furnished\r\nhouse and get reliable servant(s), then I don't know but what I'd\r\ntry it. I just don't like cold weather. At the same time, I don't\r\nwant to get into any particularly tight place. The article in\r\nHoliday was very favorable, as you know it would be. But the real\r\nfacts might be far, far different. If I were 30 years younger,\r\nand without any wife or family, I think now, I'd sure try it just\r\nfor the hell of it, if for nothing else. I wouldn't under those\r\ncircumstances stand back, or even be fearful. But as it is, it is\r\ndifferent. What do you think about it?\r\n\r\nFrank and I had a whale of a time last month going to Kansas,\r\nOkla., Texas, Miss. and Kentucky. You just don't know how high in\r\nMethodist circles us Durhams are. I'll tell you. I found it all\r\nout on this trip Frank and I took. Grandpappy, my grandpappy,\r\nJacob Durham, came to Russellville from Perryville, Ky., in about\r\n1828. About three miles east of Perryville, on the way to\r\nDanville, is what is known even now as the old Durham Farm. A man\r\nnamed Godbey now owns it. Old man. He was there when Mutiny and I\r\nwent camping on that farm about 35 years ago. His mother was a\r\nDurham. Well, since we were there, the Pioneer Mothers or DAR or\r\nMethodists or somebody have erected a granite monument to my\r\ngreat, great grandpappy, one John Durham. He owned the farm, and\r\nin 1783 he organized the first Methodist Church--then called\r\n\"Methodist Society\"--west of the Allegheny Mountains. He built a\r\nlog church on his farm about 300 feet from where the monument now\r\nstands. The marker says that, and the records in the First\r\nMethodist Church of Danville back it up. My great Uncle Milton\r\nDurham in the 1890's, put a stained glass window in said church,\r\nwith a full size picture in colored glass of what they must have\r\nimagined John Durham looked like. But there it is, brass marker\r\nand all. Uncle Milton graduated from Old Asbury in 1844, I think\r\nit was. Grandpa Durham put him through college. I have seen him.\r\nHe carried the cane for a few years prior to his death. He was\r\ntall, and the cane didn't reach the ground. He was the first\r\nComptroller of the Currency the U.S. ever had. Grover Cleveland\r\nappointed him in the '80s.\r\n\r\nNow what do you think of all that? And to think this Methodist\r\nDePauw University some 50 odd years ago broke relations with me,\r\nand the faculty gave me 24 hours to leave--23 of which I still\r\nhave coming to me.\r\nPappy\r\n\r\nPap's final reference above was to the university's intention to\r\nsuspend him for organizing a fraternity dance during his student\r\ndays. He beat them to the punch by switching to Indiana\r\nUniversity to finish out his college years.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INDOMITABLE BETTIE LOCKE\r\n\r\nPap wrote this speech for his daughter Ann to deliver at a\r\nconvention of sorority Kappa Alpha Theta.\r\n\r\nBettie Locke Hamilton--the fabulous Bettie Locke of Greek letter\r\nsorority lore and literature--was no hand for dalliance,\r\namorously or otherwise, in 1868 or any other time thereafter up\r\nto her death in 1939.\r\n\r\nIndiana Asbury University (now DePauw University) located at my\r\nhometown, Greencastle, Indiana, decided to admit female students,\r\nbeginning in the Fall of 1868, after a debate that started on a\r\nhigh level after much prayerful thought and meditation and ended\r\nin a knockdown and drag-out verbal fight that divided the\r\ndignitaries, bisected the Methodist Church temporarily, split the\r\nfaculty into two hostile camps and put the town into a dither--\r\nfrom railroad depot to barber shop and livery barn.\r\n\r\nRumor hath it that promptly at 8 o'clock on the morning of\r\nopening day, Bettie Locke presented herself for admission--the\r\nfirst female registrant of Asbury. Later, four other young ladies\r\nof a more timid disposition presented themselves and begged\r\nregistration. . . Two years later, Kappa Alpha Theta--co-founded\r\nby Bettie Locke Hamilton, Alice Allen Brant, Bettie Tipton\r\nLindsay and Hannah Fitch Shaw--became the first \"Greek letter\r\nfraternity known among women.\" And that too was as Bettie Locke\r\nwould have it.\r\n\r\nIn her girlhood days, Bettie Locke showed a disposition that was\r\nto develop into a Will of Iron . . . Her vocabulary was enormous,\r\nher diction virtually perfect, her stage presence commanding. The\r\nTheta Convention at Estes Park, Colorado, was in the summer of\r\n1930 or '31. My oldest sister, Joan, was a delegate from Alpha\r\nChapter. Bettie Locke Hamilton went along. It was near the last\r\nconvention she attended. Mind you that was within eight or nine\r\nyears of her death, and she must have been well in the 80s at the\r\ntime of her decease. She spoke extemporaneously, and \"brought\r\ndown the house\". . .\r\n\r\nBettie Locke was free in giving both unsolicited advice and\r\ncriticism, as witness the following true story. My father started\r\npracticing law early in this century. Clients were few and far\r\nbetween . . . He was standing in front of the stairs leading to\r\nhis modest office when along came Bettie Locke. She saw both him\r\nand his head piece, a cap he had acquired in college days. She\r\nstrode straight up and said, \"Andrew, a cap is unbecoming a young\r\nman starting the practice of law. Take it off and never let me\r\nsee it again.\" He did--and she never. . .\r\n\r\nBettie Locke had a positive opinion about almost everything. She\r\nloathed lipstick. She abhorred bobbysox, and her opinion of short\r\nhair and short dresses was virtually unprintable. But don't get\r\nme wrong in the inference of those last words. No one, no where,\r\nat no time ever heard Bettie Locke utter one profane, vile or\r\nsmutty word. She was too cultured and had too good a command of\r\nthe English language for that. She used sarcasm couched in such\r\nclassical language that the targets of her shafts only wished she\r\nwould wax profane and vulgar. . .\r\n\r\nOur family home is just off the DePauw campus, and a great many\r\nstudents pass to and fro. Many has been the time Bettie Locke\r\nwould come and sit and talk with my Mother on our front porch.\r\nAnd sooner or later the conversation would turn to the Thetas,\r\nand college girls in general and how they were doing, or drift\r\nback to her days--the 1860s and '70s. But just let a female in\r\nslacks--or shorts--I must mention shorts a second time--heave in\r\nsight and Bettie Locke was off and gone in a blistering\r\nmonologue. And how she could blister.\r\n\r\nBettie Locke staunchly stood up for her rights. She never lost\r\nher voice. . . In her late years her teeth caused considerable\r\ntrouble. She would not hear to having them all pulled and plates\r\nsubstituted, but allowed them to go one by one whenever the pain\r\nbecame unbearable. Among the last was a big molar, that by the\r\ntime she had to come to her dentist had become so infected and\r\nulcerated nothing could be done about it except extract it. The\r\ngood Dr. Overstreet explained all this and then proceeded to\r\nextract it without further ado.\r\n\r\nOn the way home she thought it all over, and the nearer home she\r\ncame the madder she got. . . Neighbors added fuel, and with it\r\nsome \"chimney-corner law,\" as Hoosier lawyers call it. Next\r\nmorning she stormed into the office and went straight to the\r\npoint, as was her custom. \"Doc, I'm going to sue you. Indeed I\r\nam. And you needn't try to talk me out of it. You had no right to\r\npull that tooth without my consent. You had it out before I knew\r\nwhat you were doing. I was not consulted.\" . . . Nothing ever\r\nhappened, but the time never came when Bettie Locke ceased\r\nthreatening him with that suit. . .\r\n\r\nIt was not to be for me to know Bettie Locke in her peaches and\r\ncream days. I was to know her in her poi and soft food days. We\r\nchildren were rather afraid of her. She lived alone. The house\r\nwas dark and rather forbidding. Some . . . who had felt her\r\nverbal barbs sometimes referred to her as the \"witch of Walnut\r\nand Locust Streets.\" In later life she harbored a kitchen and\r\ncellar full of cats. None were aristocrats. They were the alley\r\nvariety and had a pedigree about as long as my Spanish\r\nvocabulary. . .\r\n\r\nI can't afford to lose this chance for getting a little matter\r\nbefore you, because after this forensic effort I may never get\r\nthe chance to talk again in public. It has to do with my Theta\r\npedigree. . . I virtually stem back to one of the Founding\r\nMothers herself. . . Bettie Tipton, the one and only Bettie\r\nTipton so far as we are concerned, and my Grandmother Durham were\r\ncousins--their Mothers were Blacks and they all lived on farms\r\nnear Mt. Sterling, Kentucky. Bettie Tipton was opposite of Bettie\r\nLocke. She came from the blue grass and was as feminine as baby\r\nbreath. . . She too had a hectic experience at Indiana Asbury,\r\ncompared with the sheltered home in the blue grass from whence\r\nshe had come. Maybe I'll tell you that story some time.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER EARLY FEMINIST\r\n\r\nDecember 16, 1952\r\nMr. and Mrs. Garnett Reed Chenault\r\nMt. Sterling, Kentucky\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. and Mrs. Chenault,\r\nI have just received your very kind and thoughtful letter,\r\ntogether with the newspaper enclosure concerning the Tipton\r\nfamily in Montgomery County, Kentucky. You are a most considerate\r\ncouple. On behalf of my sister, Mrs. Margaret D. Bridges, now\r\nabout 90 and almost blind and quite deaf, and myself, I thank\r\nyou. Mrs. Bridges, in the early 1880s, and as a sprightly young\r\nMiss, visited her cousin, Amanda Black Tipton and husband Burwell\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nYou possibly might be interested to know that Burwell's daughter\r\nBettie (who married a Lindsay and after marriage lived in\r\nWinchester, Ky.), through a combination of ability,\r\naggressiveness, chance and fate, came to be a famous woman\r\nnationally. Asbury College (now DePauw University) a staid\r\nMethodist school here in Greencastle, opened its doors to women\r\nstudents in 1870--an unheard-of thing. And here came Bettie,\r\nbringing along her charming southern ways. Females were frowned-\r\non by the young college men as interlopers and undesirables, and\r\nwere subjected to some indignities. Bettie et. als. persisted.\r\nBettie, along with three other young women students, founded the\r\nfirst Greek Letter Sorority in the world, Kappa Alpha Theta. That\r\nbrought another blast. Today Kappa Alpha Theta is the oldest,\r\nlargest and wealthiest of the 35 to 50 others that have followed.\r\nIts assets run into the millions. And Bettie's name is known\r\nthroughout the civilized world wherever a \"Theta,\" as they call\r\nthemselves, lives, because all Thetas are required to memorize\r\nthe names of the founders as a prerequisite to initiation. I\r\nknow. My five daughters are Thetas.\r\n\r\nAnother thing about the fabulous Bettie. When it came time to\r\ngraduate, Bettie and some young man were nip and tuck as to\r\nleadership in scholarship, but Bettie's grades were a shade\r\nhigher. What to do about Class Valedictorian? The College\r\nauthorities approached the formidable Bettie on behalf of the\r\nyoung man. He was to become a famous Methodist minister and would\r\ngo out into the world preaching the Gospel. It would add greatly\r\nto his prestige to go out as having been Valedictorian of his\r\ngraduating class. As for her, she would probably marry, and by\r\ninference, thereby be relegated to the kitchen, nursery--and\r\noblivion.\r\n\r\nOur indomitable Bettie . . . told the good, kindly, God-fearing\r\nfaculty members that her father had sent her all the way from Mt.\r\nSterling, Kentucky, to Greencastle for her education and at\r\nconsiderable expense, and with much trepidation and prayerful\r\ncontemplation. She also told them in no uncertain words that if\r\nshe were entitled to be Valedictorian, then she wanted to be\r\nValedictorian, and that was that.\r\n\r\nShe got it, and the theretofore man-dominated Methodist Asbury\r\ngot an unexpected social shock to its sturdy limestone\r\nfoundations.\r\n\r\nRumor hath it even that one of the old buildings took a decided\r\nlist to the south and had to be shored-up. More shoring was to be\r\nhad as the years passed . . . .\r\nCordially,\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING 'THE BEST PLACE TO EAT' ON THE ROAD\r\n\r\nMarch 15, 1953\r\nMrs. Lacy Stoner\r\nHolly Bluff, Mississippi\r\n\r\nMy dear Mrs. Stoner,\r\nA week ago, just about this time, Frank and I were arriving at\r\nthe Stoner homestead in far-off Holly Bluff--home of pecky\r\ncypress at its best, and Frank was getting a second look at his\r\nbeloved paneling. . . Frank is well-pleased with his lumber\r\npurchases, and with the trip generally. But coming up from your\r\nhome . . . he was like an old mare headed for the barn. . .\r\n\r\nWe made Cairo, Ill., just before dark. As we started into town, I\r\nsaid, \"Let's stop and eat at some good place.\" Frank said, \"All\r\nright. I'll look for a good place as we go through.\" Pretty soon\r\nwe were out of town. It had been raining off and on, and now it\r\nbegan in rather good earnest. In fact, come to think of it, it\r\nrained about all the way.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached Marion, Ill. I said, \"There is a time and place\r\nfor everything. Drive up to that Standard station on the left. I\r\nwant to ask him the best place in town to eat.\" He did, and I\r\ndid. The fellow cited us to \"The Hut.\" Enroute, I said, \"Frank,\r\nI'll bet three to one The Hut is a dump. Whenever they recommend\r\nHuts or Mike's Place or Pat's Place or Joan's and Joe's or any\r\nDinty Moore's, you can just about bet your wad they're dumps.\" I\r\nlooked while he parked. It had eight revolving stools. I said,\r\n\"Let's walk to that filling station yonder. I know this town has\r\na better place. I saw an intelligent first class looking trucker\r\njust outside and asked him, telling him I hadn't eaten anything\r\nexcept segments of big Hershey bars all day long and I wanted\r\ngood food and a table to sit at. He directed us \"around the Court\r\nHouse following the traffic, then north to the place next-door to\r\nthe Adam Shoe Store with the big electric shoe hanging out in\r\nfront--you can't miss it.\" The place looked rather shoddy but it\r\nhad three pine booths and nine revolving stools. A trifle\r\ndesperate, we sat down. A fuzzy fat girl came from behind nowhere\r\nwith one menu. I asked her for a big tall glass, two or three\r\ncubes of ice and an open bottle of Coca Cola. She said they had\r\nno ice. I looked at the menu but it was hard to read on account\r\nof the samples of soup thereon. I said to Frank, \"Let's go.\" And\r\nwe did.\r\n\r\nOutside, I met an old codger. . . I asked the old question. He\r\nsent us up the street \"thataway, the best place in town, anything\r\nfrom soup to nuts.\" I asked, \"Does it have tables?\" He said, \"Why\r\nhell, yes--and pepper and salt too.\" I felt we were on the right\r\ntrack. And indeed, compared with the others it was the \"Empire\r\nRoom\" in the Waldorf-Astoria. Quite nice waitress, and I got my\r\ntall glass, etc. . .\r\n\r\nArrived home at 12:45 a.m. A trifle short of 650 miles. Thus\r\nendeth our pecky cypress safari. . .\r\nCordially,\r\n\r\n\r\nFINANCIAL ADVICE TO A WORLD TRAVELER\r\n\r\nMarch 16, 1953\r\nMrs. Ruth Ross Herrman\r\n121 Devon Drive\r\nFalls Church, Virginia\r\n\r\nDear Ruth:\r\nHoly Nellie! You ARE going places, aren't you? I am told that\r\nmany adventurous persons in New York are already engaging initial\r\npassage to the moon, so perhaps you should write for a\r\nreservation there before all the space is taken. I thought I had\r\ngone hog wild going to South America three years ago with Sugar\r\nFoot for the winter, even if we did have direct connection with,\r\nand were practically under the constant supervision and tutelage\r\nof General Motors, International Harvester, most all the U.S.\r\nBranch Banks down there, and others, but we were 4th rate pikers\r\ncompared with you.\r\n\r\nYour letter does not say how long you will be on safari . . . but\r\nrather indicates more than a year at the least. . .\r\n\r\nKnowing more about U.S. finances than going around the world,\r\nI'll talk a little about that. You must own a house in Alabama\r\nand two in Virginia. That's too many houses by three to go off\r\nand leave--especially if you don't know when you are coming back.\r\n. . . If you can make a little profit now, or break even, or even\r\ntake a little loss, you'd better sell your houses. Rental\r\nproperties are no investment for women at any time, especially\r\nnow. Pay no attention to anyone who tells you to the contrary.\r\nThe odds are overwhelming. I think you have considerable U.S.\r\nbonds. Bonds are rather poor property these days . . . because\r\nthe buying power of money is now depreciating far more rapidly\r\nthan the bond interest is bringing in--or more. Of course\r\neverybody should diversify--I mean everybody whose working days\r\nand moneymaking days are about over. Those out of business. . .\r\nTime was when careful investors had about 40 to 50% bonds, 10 to\r\n20% in cash, and say 40% in high grade stocks, common and\r\npreferred. All that has changed. Bonds and cash on hand are\r\nlosers from an investment point, but not so much so from the view\r\nof diversity and security. Careful investors now go as high as\r\n80% or even higher in common stocks (good ones of high standing\r\nand long regular dividend experience, not cats and dogs and\r\nspeculatives). . . The common stocks of AT&T, Standard of New\r\nJersey or Indiana, International Business Machines, Eastman Kodak\r\nand dozens of others are safer and easier for you than probably\r\nany house rental on God's green earth. Now is not only the time\r\nfor all good men to come to the aid, etc., but also the time for\r\nall good women to get out of the clutches of carpenters,\r\nelectricians, repairmen, repairs and replacements. You may wonder\r\nhow come all this free and voluntary advice. If I recall\r\ncorrectly, you and Helen used to consult with me about finances\r\noccasionally. And so, I just sort of got started and jumped the\r\ngun, so to speak. What I say is not compulsory, so take it or\r\nleave it. I'm not infallible or I long since would have taken the\r\nplaces of Morgan and Rockefeller. . .\r\n\r\nWhen you get over there in Borneo and Java, and have the time and\r\ninclination, and the ink isn't at the boiling point, write and\r\ntell us what things are like.\r\n\r\nAnd may your trains always be on time--which they will not.\r\nAs Ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nPAYING OUR OWN WAY\r\n\r\nApril 3, 1953\r\nMrs. Cecil Harden\r\nMember, House of Representatives\r\nWashington, D.C.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mrs. Harden:\r\nI am home today with a slight cold. My wife and daughter are gone\r\nto Indianapolis shopping. Tomorrow the parcel post packages will\r\nbegin rolling in. Our parcel post man is an understanding fellow.\r\nIt has become a sort of standing joke when he stops his truck and\r\nstarts in with various packages he smiles facetiously and says,\r\n\"Well, I see the folks were in Indianapolis yesterday.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so, tomorrow's delivery here at the house will add a tiny\r\nfraction to the already increasing postal deficit. Why? Parcel\r\npost rates are evidently too low. Mrs. Harden, that is wrong.\r\nSome helpless somebodys, somewhere, will have to make up that\r\ndeficit. The postage on those packages should slightly overpay\r\ntheir way, not underpay them.\r\n\r\nA year or so ago the Congress enacted Public Law 199, which cut\r\ndown the weight of parcel post shipments and thereby helped\r\nconsiderably in reducing the parcel post deficit, which I think\r\nis still up around 100 millions. Now the boys who use parcel post\r\nat the partial expense of the general taxpayers want 199\r\nrepealed, and have introduced HR 2685 to that effect. It also\r\nraises the poundage to 70 pounds. . . I understand HR 2685 has\r\nbeen sent to a Committee of which you are a member. . . I should\r\nlike to know your and the Committee's reactions thereto. . .\r\n\r\nThis week's Newsweek says to not be surprised if there's a\r\npostal-rate increase before long--perhaps a 4 cent rate for most\r\nfirst-class mail. Well, why not, if it takes that or 5 cents or\r\nwhatever amount, to break slightly more than even? If my letters\r\nor packages aren't more than paying their way--and I mean just\r\nthat--then let me pay more, or quit writing or sending, or else\r\njust deliver them myself. I don't want some fellow at Stonebluff\r\npaying any part of it. . .\r\nCordially,\r\n\r\n\r\nAT&T DIRECTORS BETTER STOCK UP\r\n\r\nApril 4, 1953\r\nTo the Board of Directors of American Telephone and Telegraph\r\nCompany:\r\n\r\nGentlemen:\r\nYour April, 1953, Notice of the Annual Meeting would seem to\r\nindicate there are 19 of you Directors. . . To my utter\r\namazement, I seem to find out that I own a few more shares of\r\nyour excellent Capital Stock than a majority of your Directors\r\nindividually own. A shocking revelation to me. Something must be\r\nwrong. Either I own too many or that majority owns too few. I\r\nthink the latter is the case. So, what to do?\r\n\r\nTherefore, in all Hoosier modesty, I suggest we adopt an\r\nIncentive Stock Option Plan for our Directors only, patterned\r\nafter that proposed by Standard Oil (Indiana) for Key Executives.\r\nWe must do something for our financially hard-pressed Directors,\r\nand I am one to help.\r\n\r\nPlease understand this communication is confidential between me\r\nand 18 of you Directors. I want to leave out that 30-share man\r\nbecause he is fairly well-up in an organization whose System pass\r\nI have proudly carried for lo, these many years. In righteous\r\nindignation he might rise up and take that pass away from me . . .\r\n\r\nSo let's centralize on our 25-share Director, Mr. W--, as the\r\nexample. He needs help--and badly. And who knows? If I should be\r\nthe Good Samaritan to start him up the AT&T stock ladder, maybe\r\nhe in gratitude would have me appointed Special Attorney for the\r\nAtlantic Coast Line and Louisville and Nashville Railroads (to\r\navoid any Federal complications), and that way I could get to\r\nthat American Shangri-La, Florida, for free. The possibilities of\r\nmy strategy are intriguing.\r\n\r\nBut let it be clearly known to each of you (except the 30-share\r\nman) that if our 25-share man does not up his holdings to at\r\nleast the low 30s between now and next year's Annual Meeting, and\r\nhe is up again for re-election, and I am there which I won't be,\r\nand he is there which he should be, and is pointed out to me, I\r\nshall strike him for those two passes before all and sundry. He\r\nwill refuse, and then I'll publicly expose his puny holdings in\r\nour most excellent Company. The Chairman of the Boards of two big\r\nRailroads has no business humiliating us by such niggardly\r\nholdings in our fine Company. And I am the angel with the\r\ntemerity to say so. He can't get at me (The 30-share man can--\r\nthat is why I am laying off him). As to the 25-share man, I carry\r\nnone of his passes, I am not a candidate for office, and am\r\nstanding no stud hosses. Other than being a Presbyterian, I am a\r\nfree man.\r\n\r\nThis is no threat, but always remember that if matters come to\r\nthe worst, I might come to some Annual Meeting, pull my Odd\r\nFellows membership on Mr. Bell, my Farm Bureau card on Mr.\r\nForbes, my Notarial Commission on Mr. Root, Jr., my Kiwanis\r\nstanding on Mr. Craig, My Law School diploma on Mr. Taylor, my\r\nMasonic associations on one or more big stockholders who aren't\r\nCatholics, etc.; nominate myself for Director; conduct another\r\nwhistle-stop campaign, and----?. Then wouldn't our splendid\r\nCompany be in a pickle, with a Hoosier farmer, and a Democrat at\r\nthat, on the Board, and maybe a double-jointed Railroad Board\r\nChairman or some other worthy individual thrown into the discard?\r\n\r\nSomething drastic must be done for our low bracket Directors.\r\nLet's do it--and soon.\r\n\r\nI shall anxiously await your composite solution for the\r\nsituation.\r\nFraternally, but apprehensively, Yours,\r\n\r\n\r\nBEWARE DOCTORS AND WATCH THE COWS\r\n\r\nTo Heather Anderson, a granddaughter.\r\n\r\nJuly 18, 1953\r\n\r\nMy dear Heather Bloom:\r\nWhat is our Heather doing in a hospital? They are not places for\r\nyoung ladies. Hospitals are traps for old people with sore backs\r\nand failing minds and memories whom doctors inveigle into these\r\nmedical spider's webs for reasons best known to themselves.\r\n\r\nSome folks, mostly older women, glory in their hospital records.\r\nEach trip is carefully recorded and verified with unimpeachable\r\nevidence, and is to the owner the same as a home run is to Stan\r\nMusial.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when a young fellow, about your age now, cut his\r\nfinger with a knife. What happened? Mother took a look. She\r\nwashed the layers of dirt off with good old common cold well or\r\ncistern water, soused the finger in turpentine, then wrapped it\r\nin a clean, boiled white cotton rag, tied it round and round with\r\nClark's white No. 70 thread, told him to keep it as clean as his\r\nconscience would permit--and in 48 hours it was well. Now what\r\nhappens? The neighborhood is alerted, the ambulance called with\r\norders to ring the gong vigorously enroute, doting grandparents\r\nare deluged with telegrams and telephone calls, the cigarette-\r\nfinger stained family doctor is called and frantically urged to\r\nmeet the ambulance at the back door of the hospital. He does. He\r\ninspects the knife gravely, sends it to the laboratory to check\r\nwhether it has cut bread made from wheat infected with the dread\r\nwheat cholera or has come into contact with tuleremic pork\r\nplasma, etc. The case is too serious for him alone so he calls\r\nco-counsel. The poor little feller by this time is so bewildered\r\nhe doesn't remember whether he cut his finger or wet his pants.\r\n\r\nGrandpappy is grubbing and piling deadened thorn trees, piling\r\nbrush, logs and dead limbs, spading-up locust, thorn, elm, osage\r\norange and wild crabapple sprouts . . . and otherwise disporting\r\nhimself in one of the big pastures north of town. . . Earlier in\r\nthe year, a quail would perch on that big southeast corner post\r\nof the pasture. You would know he was there because he would\r\nwhistle that shrill \"Bob White, Bob White.\" If you weren't too\r\nanxious to work you would stop and try to figure him out. . .\r\nOnce I was working diligently near the east fence line. All at\r\nonce I realized a squirrel was barking at me. I kept still and\r\nlocated the sound, but I never got to see the squirrel. But I did\r\nsee birds, woodpeckers, blue jays, rain crows and robins flying\r\ninto a certain rather small tree, and I knew what that meant at\r\nthis time of year--a mulberry tree. I tried to work toward it,\r\neasy like. When I got there the squirrel was gone but the\r\nmulberry tree and its ripening berries were right there where the\r\nsound came from. . . Where there is plenty of grass, cows never\r\nget hungry. They eat about all the time just to keep from getting\r\nhungry. If you see cows lying around in the shade, you know that\r\nall is well.\r\n\r\nBut you have to keep tab on your livestock wherever they may be.\r\nInside the highway gate, but some distance away to the east, was\r\nan open tool shed. . . Day before yesterday, as I drove in the\r\npasture and passed reasonably close to this tool shed, I saw a\r\nyoung calf in the shed on top of the hay. He'd weigh 100 to 125\r\npounds. I didn't stop. I thought he'd work his way out the same\r\nway he worked in. That evening as I went by, I forgot about any\r\ncalf. Next morning as I went by, I was thinking about other\r\nthings, so I didn't look in for the calf. About mid-afternoon,\r\nwhen I was working within hearing distance of the tool shed, I\r\nheard a cow bawling. It was the bawl of a cow that had lost her\r\ncalf. When I came out, I stopped near the shed, walked over and\r\nlooked in. There was the calf on the hay, and silent as your\r\nUncle Frankfurter when he broke the stock of my shotgun. I went\r\naround to where he had gotten in and went in the same way,\r\nclimbed up over the five or six feet of baled hay and then down\r\ntoward him. He ran over the bales faster than I could climb. Back\r\nand forth, around and around we went. Finally I got him in the\r\nsouth part of the shed. He was tiring and I was already tired. He\r\nlooked at me. I sort of fell toward him, giving out a big yell.\r\nHe got a big scare and climbed those bales toward the hole he got\r\nin through like a mountain goat. When I got out the same way, he\r\nwas half a quarter away and going strong. He must have been a\r\nhungry calf by the time he found his ma.\r\n\r\nThis will conclude the agricultural lecture for today.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND CHAMPION HAM\r\n\r\nNovember 18, 1953\r\nHonorable Frank J. McCarthy\r\nAssistant Vice President of Pennsylvania Railroad\r\n211 Southern Building\r\nWashington, D.C.\r\n\r\nMy dear Frank,\r\nYour Thanksgiving, or if you prefer, your Christmas ham deluxe is\r\non its way, . . . part of an unbelievable success story to New\r\nEnglanders and others east of the Alleghenys who feel that\r\neverybody or everything good must originate east of said\r\nMountains. . .\r\n\r\nSome six or eight years ago, a young fellow bought out a\r\ncombination locker plant, meat market and grocery store in\r\nWaveland, Indiana, population about 500, and four miles from\r\nRussellville. He gradually went into processing pork products,\r\nparticularly sugar-cured, hickory-smoked hams.\r\n\r\nLast year the Meat Interests, or some such organization, of\r\nOmaha, Nebraska, held a contest open to all pork processors of\r\nthe United States and Canada, from Swift, Armour and Wilson on\r\ndown--or up--to Coleman, of Waveland, Ind.\r\n\r\nAll unheralded and unsung, our young friend picked himself out\r\nwhat he thought was the best of his modest stock of hams and had\r\nthe temerity to betake himself and his ham to Omaha, where he\r\nentered said ham in its Class. It took first prize--represented\r\nby a big platter, on the bottom of which a ham was engraved. Not\r\ncompletely satisfied with taking first prize in its Class, our\r\nhero then entered it in the Grand Sweepstakes--the Grand Champion\r\nHam of all Hams Class--of the United States and Canada. Know\r\nwhat? To the utter consternation of the contestants, that same\r\nham again took first prize--represented by a washed-in-gold ball-\r\ntopped contraption that looked more like a pilaster in a Masonic\r\nLodge Hall than anything I can think of.\r\n\r\nThere remaining no more ham worlds to conquer, our Champion\r\nrewrapped his winner in cellophane and tin foil and brought it\r\nand the prizes home and placed them on exhibition for all to see.\r\nThat is the story. . .\r\n\r\nNow please understand I am not so naive as to be certain our man\r\nof the hour is a near-World's Champion ham producer or that\r\nchance and fate or pure gall did not, in some manner, enter into\r\nthat decision. I just think the Champ is mighty good, and hope\r\nthat you, after sampling his product, will agree he is in there\r\npitching somewhere. . .\r\nHappy Holidays and happy eating,\r\n\r\n\r\nTHANKS FOR THE BACKING\r\n\r\nFebruary 25, 1954\r\nMr. Leslie A. Lyon\r\nLyon's Music Company\r\n110-112 S. Green Street\r\nCrawfordsville, Indiana\r\n\r\nMy dear Les:\r\n. . . After my first, and in the opinion of the great majority,\r\nmy most unexpected election in our Senatorial District (the first\r\ntime a Democrat had ever been elected from Montgomery and Putnam\r\nCounties), I began to hear a lot about my so-called personal\r\npopularity. Personal popularity, the Devil! It was the wise and\r\ncapable backing I got coupled with my willingness and hustle to\r\nfollow advice. . .\r\n\r\nBut . . . Les, there must be at least more than a dozen excellent\r\nreasons why I cannot be a candidate. To recite them in detail on\r\npaper would take a sheet reaching from your store to the Court\r\nHouse. So, I shall not try to set them down on paper. But I do\r\nwant to thank you wholeheartedly for the generous compliment you\r\nhave paid me by even suggesting you would personally like for me\r\nto run. . . Please remember me most kindly to all our good\r\nfriends.\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR BALANCE, LET CANADA GO IT ALONE\r\n\r\nResponse to a questionnaire from Congresswoman Cecil M. Harden,\r\nMarch 4, 1954\r\n\r\nMemo relating to Question No. 6.\r\n\r\nI, a Democrat, along with thousands of others, not only voted for\r\nGen. Eisenhower, but were glad to do so. . . No minor reason for\r\ndoing so was that he promised to balance the budget--and soon. .\r\n. But the politicians have gotten in their work and he is\r\nwobbling just a trifle. . . At a very recent press conference, if\r\nhe is quoted correctly, he said that if employment did not pick\r\nup in March, that fact would necessitate taking action, and tax\r\nreduction might be one of the first measures to be considered,\r\nand that the government wouldn't hesitate a second to do its\r\nutmost to stop any real recession. To me that is Roosevelt\r\nphilosophy, pure and simple, which threw undue stress on consumer\r\nspending, and assumed the way to avert depression was to\r\nunbalance the budget, resort to pump priming, which can mean only\r\none thing--more inflation.\r\n\r\nThere are three ways to balance the budget:\r\n\r\n-- Cut down spending and expenses, or\r\n\r\n-- Collect more revenue (increase taxes), or\r\n\r\n-- Do both\r\n\r\nThere are no other ways under the sun I know of.\r\n\r\nThe first of these is far and away the best. That is why my\r\nanswer to your sixth question is an unqualified \"No.\" The St.\r\nLawrence Seaway would take eight or more years to build. The\r\nalleged Engineers estimated it would cost just short of one\r\nbillion dollars to build it deep enough (26 to 28 feet) to carry\r\n10% of the present ocean-going freighters. Which probably means\r\nit would end up nearer three billion in cost. And what would it\r\ncost to build it deep enough to carry the other 90%? To say\r\nnothing of the cost of dredging lake harbors, building docks, and\r\ndozens of other important expenses? For the most part it is to be\r\nlocated in Canada and subject to Canadian law. Canada says it\r\nwill build it alone. In the name of the Great Jehovah and the\r\nContinental Congress, let Canada do it! Let some country,\r\nsomewhere, sometime, some way or how, build something of its\r\nown--on its own.\r\n\r\nIt is now proposed that an immediate increase of $100 or more in\r\npersonal exemptions for all income tax payers be made, and still\r\nmore for next year. Will St. Lawrence and this increase in\r\nexemption help balance the budget? They will not. Neither should\r\npass until that budget is balanced, if we are really going to try\r\nto balance it, and St. Lawrence should not pass at this time\r\nabove everything I have as yet heard proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\nKANSAS CAN BE CRUEL\r\n\r\nMarch 29, 1954\r\nHonorable I.C. Wiatt, Chairman\r\nBoard of County Commissioners\r\nLakin, Kansas\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Wiatt:\r\nI have just read with deep concern your letter of March 25, 1954,\r\nto the effect your Board had received a signed complaint that our\r\nland is in a \"blowing\" condition, and that. . . \"the former\r\ntenant\". . . would assume no responsibility for it. . .\r\n\r\nPlease bear with me, if you have the time and inclination, and\r\nallow me to recite a part of my experiences with that land. About\r\nthe year 1895 my father bought the quarter section from the\r\nEntryman and his wife. . . During World War I, while returning\r\nhome from California in a cold January, I stopped off at Lakin.\r\nAs is the case everywhere, there is always someone who knows the\r\nlocation of land. In my case he was a man who owned about the\r\nonly Ford in town. We struck west on the highway. Then by\r\ninstinct, it seems to me, rather than by landmarks, he turned\r\nnorth over the unfenced land. In due time, he said, \"There is\r\nabout your southeast corner. . .\" It was mighty lonesome-looking\r\nland.\r\n\r\nTime went on. . . My next trip out was in summer. The land had a\r\nfair stand of buffalo grass. . . I found a young fellow who\r\nagreed to graze the land and pay the taxes. . . I never saw him\r\nagain. He moved away before my next trip. I was also told he\r\ngrazed the land, but I know he did not pay the taxes. They went\r\ndelinquent. I got that straightened out, and incidentally learned\r\na minor lesson about owning land so far from home.\r\n\r\nYou can imagine my reaction when, on the next trip out, I saw the\r\nland had been fenced and cattle were grazing on it. I went north\r\nperhaps a half-mile to a house near the east side of the road. A\r\nwoman was there alone. Her husband was away working. They had\r\ncome from Ohio. She was terribly discouraged. She cried as she\r\ntalked. Two crop failures--possibly three. They were near\r\ndesperate. . . I asked who owned the cattle. She said the Sheriff\r\nof the County owned them, and had also built the fence. She then\r\ntold me how she wished she had that land for her two cows. They\r\nwere almost starving, and she had little or nothing for them to\r\neat.\r\n\r\nAnd so I was up against the High Sheriff of Kearny County, and\r\n1,000 miles from home. The Sheriff! If there is anything a non-\r\nresident needs to learn, it is to avoid a clash with high\r\nofficials of a given section, if it can possibly be avoided. . .\r\nI was worried. Then I thought of William Allen White and of his\r\nfamous editorial, and of other great and honorable men Kansas had\r\nproduced, a good part of them farmers, like me. I decided to\r\nbeard the lion in his den. . . He sort of braced himself, and I\r\ncould see he was getting ready to get mad. . . I told him I\r\nwanted the fence left alone. I was arranging to turn this land\r\nover to the woman up the road for her two cows. . . \"You can't\r\nexpect me to give you that fence. . .\"\r\n\r\nEither he came to realize the probable justice of my stand, or\r\nelse he concluded he might be a trespasser if he persisted.\r\nAnyway he did nothing to the fence. I wrote a contract in\r\nduplicate to the effect the woman was to have possession of the\r\nland for her cows until I gave her written notice to the\r\ncontrary. No rent or charge of any kind was to be made. . . I\r\nnever did see her husband. And I never saw her again. By the time\r\nof my next trip, I was told they had sort of given up the ghost\r\nand gone back to Ohio.\r\n\r\n. . .Father was a bit proud of that \"virgin soil\", as he called\r\nit, although neither he nor mother ever got a penny out of it.\r\nNor did the rest of us until lately, when it was leased for oil\r\nand gas. . . Kansas can, and has been cruel. In my early boyhood\r\na few of those I knew went to Kansas to make their way in the\r\nworld. Some came back footsore and broken-hearted. The droughts,\r\nhot winds and grasshoppers took them, as witness the Entryman and\r\nhis wife who homesteaded this identical land in 1893 . . .\r\n\r\n. . .Two years ago I received a telephone call from a man in\r\nLakin. . . He had about 50 head of starving cattle; was out of\r\nfeed, with none available; he was desperate and could he turn-in\r\nhis cattle on my land for not more than a month? . . . I have\r\nbeen short on feed a few times, but never out. I told him I would\r\nmost certainly help in any way I could under those circumstances.\r\nTwo months later I arrived on the land. Then came the big\r\ndisillusionment. The cattle were not those of the man who called\r\nme. They were owned by one of the wealthiest men in the County.\r\nThe telephone caller only worked for him.\r\n\r\nAt the time, I came in contact with three prospective tenants who\r\nwanted to farm the land. . . Mr. W-- was most highly recommended.\r\nWe talked terms. . .I told him I would think the matter over\r\ncarefully going home, and if I decided I wanted to lease the\r\nland, would prepare a contract. . . I told him that if he did not\r\nhear from me rather promptly to just forget the land . . . You\r\ncan imagine my utter amazement when, last Fall, I went out and\r\nfound a good part of the land broken up with perhaps 40 acres of\r\nit in a maize crop failure. . . Mr. W-- said he understood the\r\ndeal to be that if he did not hear from me to the contrary, then\r\nhe was to proceed and crop the land. There you are. . .\r\n\r\nNow today, after receiving your letter, I find myself in hot\r\nwater. . . I know nothing whatever about wind erosion or how to\r\ndeal with it. Whatever I have to do, I will have to do. . . I am\r\na long way off. I do not drive a car as much as I used to. I am\r\ngetting older. . . But I do know I do not expect to continue to\r\nfarm it, if I can have my way, which I have not had in the\r\nimmediate past. . .\r\nVery Respectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nA FIRST TIME FOR EVERYTHING\r\n\r\nMay 7, 1954\r\nThe Milwaukee Chair Company\r\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin\r\n\r\nAttention: Mr. Block, I think is the name, President or Gen.\r\nManager:\r\n\r\nThe 5 metal chairs . . . were promptly delivered to our office.\r\nThey look and sit quite well and we feel sure we are going to\r\nlike them for the reception room.\r\n\r\nWhen in Milwaukee my son and I ordered some other and more\r\nexpensive chairs--leather--at the same time we ordered the metal\r\nchairs spoken of above, and it is about the delivery of these\r\nleather chairs this letter is directed. We hope to have a sort of\r\n\"opening\" for our new offices and building about June 1, 1954.\r\nNaturally, we should like to have these leather chairs on hand\r\n. . . If we knew there would be a little delay in delivery we\r\nwould try to delay our \"opening.\" It is not my intention to try\r\nto rush you. I would just like to know for a certainty and plan\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nI find myself in a dither like unto a situation that confronted\r\nme long, long years ago. I was a cadet a Western Military\r\nAcademy, Alton, Illinois, 16 years old. . . In class, I sat next\r\nto a boy two years my senior and far, far more sophisticated. He\r\nwas a member of a really rich family in St. Louis. He invited me\r\nto spend Easter vacation at his home. I was glad to go. Arrived\r\nin St. Louis I learned another St. Louis tycoon, a brewer and his\r\nwife, were giving a banquet and ball, and that I was scheduled to\r\nbe among \"those present.\"\r\n\r\nMy hostess looked me over carefully. In a casual way she asked,\r\n\"Andrew, I'll bet you forgot to bring your dress suit along?\"\r\n\r\nThe question amazed me. \"Why Mrs. --,\" I said, \"I never owned a\r\ndress suit. Boys my age where I come from don't have dress\r\nsuits.\"\r\n\r\nWhat an understanding woman she was! I could see the smile come\r\nto her eyes. Without a moment's hesitation she said, \"I know what\r\nwe'll do. Both you boys will wear your uniforms. You are more\r\nused to them and you'll feel more at home in them. And the girls\r\nwill just go wild about those uniforms. They are exactly the\r\nthing to wear.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the big event, she got me off to herself and after some\r\npreliminaries, asked, \"Andrew, do your parents have liquor on the\r\ntable or in the home?\" I said they did not have any that I knew\r\nof.\r\n\r\nShe asked, \"Did you ever taste whiskey or champagne?\" I said I\r\nhad never tasted either--that I had never seen any champagne.\r\n\r\nThe good woman fairly beamed. She was getting real enjoyment out\r\nof the interview. She then told me there would be worlds of\r\nchampagne served at the banquet. Waiters would keep refilling the\r\nglasses. Older people might get a little tipsy. . . She told me\r\nmany things. She said that at the first serving of the champagne\r\nwe might all rise for a toast. My girl (for whom she had\r\narranged) and I would sort of intertwine our wrists and glasses\r\nand she would take a sip out of my glass, but of course I would\r\nsip none of hers--that champagne was quite potent and might\r\ncreep-up on one not used to it. . .\r\n\r\nBefore the interview was over, she had become my monitor and my\r\nexcellent, trustworthy and good friend. One thing troubled me. I\r\nwanted her permission about something. I said, \"I'll behave\r\nmyself and you'll not have to be ashamed of me. All this is new.\r\nI have never been in a fine home before and have never been to a\r\nbanquet. May I have your permission to taste that champagne out\r\nof my own glass? I have always wanted to taste champagne and I\r\nmay never get the chance again.\"\r\n\r\nThat was too much for her. She had been aching to laugh out loud.\r\nShe put her arm around me and let go, saying, \"Andrew, you are\r\njust about the finest young man we ever had in our home. Of\r\ncourse you have my permission to taste the champagne. . . I just\r\nwant you to tell me how it tastes.\"\r\n\r\nThe banquet and ball were howling successes so far as I was\r\nconcerned. I made at least two big mistakes. . . I got the vast\r\nassortment of spoons and forks pretty well mixed, but soon\r\ncorrected that by watching the middle-aged woman at my side. The\r\nawful and really devastating mistake was due to my appetite.\r\nMilitary School diet was rigid. I was young, healthy and hungry.\r\nI noticed my girl minced and toyed with the fish, soup and other\r\npreliminaries, but attributed that to some feminine quirk. I ate\r\nall mine in stride. When the canvas back, caviar and other\r\nunknown real delicacies came along it was too late for me. I was\r\nfull.\r\n\r\nOn the ball room floor it was a much different story. I was\r\nyoung, lithe and limber--and absolutely sober. A great many of\r\nthe deluxe elite were too heavy in the hock, too wide in the\r\nbeam, and far, far too distended in front. One good woman\r\ncouldn't see her plate and would have to pull her fork from under\r\nto see what its tine had speared. The guests graded from mild\r\nexhilaration to pretty dam tight. My hostess' son was pretty well\r\nleft of center. I had sufficient presence of mind to ask my\r\nmonitor for dances, far more than could reasonably be expected of\r\na woman so old--probably almost pushing 40. . .\r\n\r\nBy this time you are asking, \"Why all this boring life history\r\nfrom an almost utter stranger?\" The answer is simple.\r\n\r\nI have never seen, much less occupied, an office chair pushing\r\n$300. I must get acclimated to it gradually and by easy stages or\r\nelse find myself in the same uneasy situation as that of a 16-\r\nyear-old small town boy at his first metropolitan banquet and\r\nball. . .\r\nRespectfully,\r\nDurham & Durham, Atty.'s.\r\nBy Andrew E. Durham\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTH IN A BOX CAR, NORTH IN A CADILLAC\r\n\r\nExcerpts from an article written by Pap, in the Putnam County\r\nGraphic, June 24, 1954.\r\n\r\nSome 35 years ago, a young man born and reared in Putnam County,\r\nnear Greencastle, decided to seek his fortune elsewhere. Of\r\nuncompromising Republican political stock, he ignored Horace\r\nGreeley's admonition, \"Young man go West,\" and took a different\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nHe had already arranged to buy on contract a modest acreage in\r\nthe Mississippi Delta where the silt of countless overflows of\r\nthe River had produced a soil more than 60 feet in depth--the\r\ndeepest and richest soil on Earth other than the valley of the\r\nNile. . .\r\n\r\nAnd so, one typically bleak March day, he assembled his dog, a\r\nspan or two of mules, his scanty farming tools and himself into a\r\nbox car headed south.\r\n\r\nIn later years, when speaking of that momentous occasion, he\r\nsaid, \"I think the most lonesome, homesick and desperate moment\r\nof all my ups and downs was the time I closed that box car door\r\non familiar scenes I might never see again--and the wheels began\r\nto turn. It was so cold I made a sort of bunk, wrapped my dog and\r\nmyself in the same blankets to help keep one another warm, and\r\ntried to go to sleep.\"\r\n\r\nThe trip took over a week. They all ate some days. Some days just\r\nthe mules and the dog; and one day, just the mules.\r\n\r\nDid you see a house float past?\r\n\r\nSo allow us to introduce the subject of this sketch, Mr. Lacy\r\nSimpson Stoner, and inform you Holly Bluff, Mississippi, was his\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\nArrived, he had hardly become oriented when the rising\r\nMississippi started his house toward New Orleans and the Gulf.\r\nFortunately it lodged in some nearby trees, and as the river\r\nreceded, he, aided by block and tackle, floated and pulled it\r\nback to its original or approximately original position, where it\r\nwas made more secure.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of these floods, Mr. Stoner said, \"It was nothing in\r\nthose days to have some man from up the River come along and\r\ninquire, 'Did you see a three room, part-yaller house goin' by\r\nhere in the last day or two?'\"\r\n\r\nCrops were good, with fair prices. He plowed back the profits\r\ninto more and more land and better and better mechanical\r\nequipment.\r\n\r\nAnd he took time to come back to Indiana and claim his bride, a\r\nLafayette girl, the present Mrs. Stoner.\r\n\r\nAgain the rains came and the water flooded their first floor.\r\nThey moved what they could to the second floor, where the water\r\nsoon caught up with them. They tied some of the better and more\r\nuseful articles up among the rafters, and had just selected the\r\nspot to chop out through the roof, to get to the boat which was\r\nmoored to the house, when the crest of the flood was reached and\r\nthe water slowly subsided.\r\n\r\nRevolution in the Delta\r\n\r\nThen followed more and bigger crops, bigger profits, more land,\r\nmore mechanical equipment and less sharecropper help. Meanwhile,\r\nsoy beans and other crops gradually supplanted cotton.\r\n\r\nIn time a new and modern home was built--on higher ground nearer\r\nHolly Bluff and its modern school house. This home has a large\r\nand beautiful living room paneled and beamed in \"pecky cypress\",\r\nand it was there J. Frank Durham got his idea of paneling the new\r\nDurham Building here in the City.\r\n\r\nMr. Stoner now owns some 3,000 acres of that Mississippi Delta,\r\nvirtually all of which is as level as a baseball park; a fleet of\r\n12-foot combines, tractors, a vast amount of modern equipment and\r\nenough rubber-tired low grain wagons to fill a small-sized\r\nparking lot. He has a large interest in the community cotton gin,\r\nalthough cotton has almost disappeared from his land. He has many\r\nother and varied interests.\r\n\r\nHe revolutionized farming in the Mississippi Delta by introducing\r\nmechanized equipment and changing from cotton to other and\r\nbetter-paying crops that require less manual labor. These are a\r\npart of the secrets of his astounding success, coupled with\r\nability, hard work and close careful attention and application to\r\nhis business. . .\r\n\r\nWeek before last, Mr. Stoner and his comely wife came North but\r\nnot in a box car. Their mode of travel is a June, 1954-vintage,\r\nair-conditioned Cadillac, just off the assembly line.\r\n\r\nYour editor met Mr. and Mrs. Stoner at a dinner party at Old\r\nTrails Inn being given by Mr. Andrew E. Durham in their honor.\r\nMessrs. Stoner and Durham were members of the 1917 State Scottish\r\nRite Class at Indianapolis, and lived as neighbors west of the\r\nCity. . .\r\n\r\nThe Farmer's Game\r\n\r\nMr. Stoner talked freely of his boyhood days in Greencastle. He\r\nand others of his age would gather evenings in the restaurants\r\naround town to eat hamburgers or some such food. They invented a\r\npastime they called \"the farmer's game\". . . Slips of paper were\r\nshaken up in a hat and each member drew a slip. All but one were\r\nblank. The one who drew the slip labeled \"treat\" had to do just\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nIn due time the boys improved the game to make it as sure for\r\nthose \"in the know\" not to lose as the present day one-armed\r\nbandits. There would be, say, five in the game, one of whom was\r\nthe \"sucker\". One of the conspirators would prepare the five\r\nslips. He did that by writing \"treat\" on all five slips. In the\r\nmeantime each conspirator would have obtained a blank slip of the\r\nsame shape and quality of paper. This he would have rolled-up in\r\nhis LEFT vest pocket--just in case.\r\n\r\nThe drawing would begin. The victim would have to draw a \"treat\"\r\nslip because all five were labeled that way. Those in the know\r\nwould draw, give a quick sort of look and put the slips in their\r\nRIGHT vest pockets, at the same time conjecturing aloud, \"Mine\r\nwas a blank. Wonder who got the treat slip,\" or some such remark.\r\n\r\nOne night, after being bilked three successive times, the victim\r\nbecame suspicious. Feeling he had served his apprenticeship long\r\nand faithfully, the others were ready and willing to admit him as\r\na full blood brother. They told him to prepare the slips and\r\nconduct the drawing, which he of course did according to the\r\n\"official\" rules--four blanks and one with \"treat\". To the\r\nsurprise of all, and rather contrary to the mathematical law of\r\naverages, he again drew the \"treat\" slip. This convinced him that\r\nthe game was straight.\r\n\r\n\"And so,\" said Mr. Stoner laconically, \"we saved him for another\r\nnight, until he had learned his ritual better.\"\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Stoner returned to Holly Bluff last week. Later they\r\ngo to Hot Springs, Arkansas, for the baths, a semi-annual\r\npilgrimage; then probably to Denver and the West Coast; then\r\nperhaps north to Oregon and Washington, where they may ship their\r\ncar along and continue by steamship to Alaska.\r\n\r\nWarning to Alaska\r\n\r\nLast Saturday, during the open house for the Durham Building, J.\r\nFrank Durham received a congratulatory telephone call from his\r\nfriend and schoolmate, V. Maurice Smith, at Alaska. He is the co-\r\nowner and Editor of Jessen's Weekly at Fairbanks, and also\r\nnewscaster for a local radio station. Frank alerted his friend to\r\nthe possible invasion of Alaska by Mr. Stoner and his \"farmer's\r\ngame,\" or improvements thereof. He advised his friend to keep his\r\neyes \"off that air-conditioned Cadillac and on the driver\r\nhimself, as he is by far the more dangerous of the two.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMETHING ON THE CARPET\r\n\r\nJuly 20, 1954\r\n\r\nDear Footser:\r\n. . . Which reminds me of your Uncle Charlie Bridges. He was a\r\nDeacon or whoever it is who gets to pass the plate at the\r\nPresbyterian Church for the collection.\r\n\r\nThe event happened during the First World War. The church needed\r\na new carpet. Mr. Raphael, the Pastor, extended himself in the\r\nsermon about giving for the proposed new carpet. He extolled the\r\nbrethren and sistern to \"Give, give until it hurts. If you do not\r\nhave the cash, just sign a piece of paper setting out the amount\r\nyou will give toward the new carpet, put it in the collection\r\nbox. The ushers will take care of it and you will be credited the\r\namount on the new carpet\". etc.\r\n\r\nCharlie was passing the plate. He came to old Mrs. Cooper, a\r\ndevout Presbyterian, who whispered something in his ear. Charlie\r\nstraightened up and said, \"Brother Raphael, Mrs. Cooper would\r\nlike to do a little something on the new carpet, but she has no\r\npaper.\"\r\nPap\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI: TO SOUTH AMERICA AND BACK\r\n\r\nAccompanied by daughter Aura May (alias Sugarfoot), Pap embarked\r\non a two-month land, sea and air tour of Latin America in late\r\nNovember, 1949. This journey, extraordinary for the time, was\r\nrecorded in a series of letters printed in successive editions of\r\nthe weekly Putnam County Graphic, Greencastle, Indiana.\r\n\r\nEach letter was hand-written, in pencil, on yellow, ruled tablet\r\npaper, and then mailed to the paper, where they would be set into\r\nthe equivalent of two to five full columns of type. The touring\r\nwas extensive, and the letters were inclusive, giving conjecture\r\nto just how Pap found the time to do all this writing? Aura May\r\nsaid that other than during the cruise down, he did it all at\r\nnight after she had gone to bed. She remembered one time in\r\nparticular when he awoke her at 2 a.m. to ask how to spell the\r\nname of the highest peak in the Andes--Aconcagua.\r\n\r\nAt first there was only a two-week delay between the writing and\r\nthe publication, but these intervals grew longer as the tourists\r\nprogressed from country to country, demonstrating the limits of\r\npostal departments and/or carriers of the day. By the time the\r\nfinal letter was printed, Pap and Aura May had been home\r\napproximately three months.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMBARKING FROM NEW ORLEANS\r\n\r\nAt Sea, Nov. 27, 1949\r\n\r\nTo the Graphic:\r\nWe will start with Mattoon, Ill., where my daughter, Aura May\r\nDurham, and I went to catch the Illinois Central's \"Panama\r\nLimited\" for New Orleans.\r\n\r\nThis is a thoroughly-modern, diesel-powered all-pullman train.\r\nAmong other things it has a folding removable ladder for all\r\nnight access to each upper berth, which does away with the porter\r\nand his wooden stepladder and small washrooms at each end of the\r\ncar, which permits the car to add two full sections. Time will\r\ntell whether this feature proves popular with the traveling\r\npublic. The train is fast, the roadbed good. She was on-the-dot\r\ninto Mattoon and about five minutes ahead at destination.\r\n\r\nOur reservations were at the Roosevelt Hotel . . . centrally\r\nlocated a block and a half off Canal St., reputed to be the\r\nwidest street in the world. The warm, soft dialect we generally\r\nattribute to the south is lacking. New Orleans has its own. I\r\ncan't describe it. You have to hear it.\r\n\r\nWell-suited to hospitality\r\n\r\nHospitality here, as well as in about all of New Orleans, is most\r\ncordial and unusual. Here is an example of what I mean: I thought\r\nit best to get another tropical suit--a rayon and cotton affair\r\nmade by Haspel of New Orleans. I called the manufacturer's office\r\nto locate a retail store carrying the Haspel line. I was\r\nconnected with the manager, A. Haspel himself. I stated my case.\r\n\r\nHe answered: \"We are mighty proud you like our clothes. Tell you\r\nwhat you do. You go to such and such a store almost across the\r\nstreet from your hotel, call for Mr. A. or Mr. B. and tell him\r\nwhat you want. This is an off season for hot weather clothes. He\r\nmay not have them. If not, tell him to measure you and call us\r\nand we will send down four or five to choose from.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" I said, \"I want only one suit and in Indianapolis it would\r\ncost $25.50 and that is too much trouble for both of you for that\r\nmoney.\"\r\n\r\nHe said, \"No amount of trouble is too much trouble for us to go\r\nto for a man who came all the way from Indianny to get one of our\r\nsuits of clothes.\"\r\n\r\nAnd that was what happened. The store was out, but I got the\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PILOTS UNION\r\n\r\nThat evening we went to the Roosevelt Blue Room for 8 o'clock\r\ndinner and floor show. I noticed a modestly, yet well-dressed\r\nbald headed, rather heavy-set man of about 60 eating alone at the\r\nnext table. The waiters all knew him as did many of the customers\r\nwho passed.\r\n\r\nI said to him, \"You are alone this evening. Why not come over and\r\njoin us in dessert?\"\r\n\r\nHe replied, \"I shall be delighted, and consider it an hon'r to be\r\nasked to join you and this charmin' young lady, but you must\r\nexcuse me from dessert.\" Turning to his waiter, he said, \"Bring\r\nthe bucket over here if you will, Pierre.\" The bucket was a\r\nbucket of Burgundy, fairly well gone. Naturally he asked us to\r\nshare it, and showed no resentment at our refusal.\r\n\r\nIt took only a few minutes to discover that our new friend was a\r\n\"trifle high,\" and gaining rather than losing altitude, as time\r\nwent on. He was a river pilot of long standing, and simply superb\r\nat modest elevation.\r\n\r\nPutnam County is a bit shy on pilots, but not New Orleans. If I\r\nget the facts right, outbound and inbound ships have three\r\npilots--river, bar and the ship's regular pilot. The last takes\r\ncharge only when the ship is at sea. . . On leaving the wharf,\r\nthe river pilot is in charge until the bar of the Mississippi is\r\nreached--the narrows or jetties where the river empties into the\r\nGulf some 90 miles below New Orleans. . . The \"bar pilot\" steers\r\nthe ship through the narrows and out into the Gulf. It is then\r\nthat the ship's regular pilot takes charge.\r\n\r\nIt is these bar pilots who have a unique organization, virtually\r\na family affair. To become a bar pilot you must either be born\r\ninto the family or marry into it. Talk about your tight little\r\ncorporations and monopolies! Bricklayers and other trade unions\r\nare accused of limiting memberships and daily numbers of bricks\r\nto be laid in order to hike wages. This \"union\" does the same\r\nthing by means of a sort of birth control feature. It's a honey\r\nof a trust. These bar pilots, I hear from pretty reliable source,\r\nget from twelve to fifteen thousand per year and work about six\r\nmonths of the year.\r\n\r\nLast Tuesday morning, the Director of Commerce of the Board of\r\nCommissioners of the Port of New Orleans called to invite us on a\r\ntour of the harbor, along with some eight or 10 shippers. . . New\r\nOrleans shipping is tremendous, second only to New York. I\r\ncasually mentioned San Francisco and was told that New Orleans\r\nhad more shipping than the combined West Coast. Generally\r\nspeaking, it draws the territory drained by the Mississippi\r\nRiver. New Orleans has 10 to 12 miles of wharves. On the trip we\r\nsurely saw more than 100 ships, barges, ferries and other big\r\nwater craft. Two ships were unloading thousands of cases of\r\npineapples, so our local A&P store should be stocked with\r\npineapple for you by now.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME IS A SEASONING AT ANTOINE'S\r\n\r\nThat evening the director and his wife took a local Democratic\r\nofficial and his wife and Aura May and me to Antoine's for\r\ndinner. Antoine's is an institution. Established in 1840, it has\r\nserved food uninterruptedly, and is now owned and operated by a\r\ngrandson of its founder.\r\n\r\nThe building, tableware and linen are severely plain. The waiters\r\nare noiseless and speak many languages. No bands, orchestras or\r\nentertainers--\"You go to Antoine's to give your palate an\r\nundisturbed treat.\" No bar--\"It is people who drink without\r\neating who become paralyzed by alcohol.\" Yet it has a narrow wine\r\ncellar a block long, containing well over 5,000 bottles. The\r\noldest wines date back to 1884, the oldest brandy to 1811.\r\n\r\nIts gallery of celebrities contains over 2,000 autographs and\r\npictures of distinguished visitors. Besides the main dining room,\r\nit has 15 others. One room's floor, the Mystery Room, is covered\r\nwith sawdust. Guests have included Marshall Foch, Sarah\r\nBernhardt, Will Rogers, Jenny Lind, Caruso, Edwin Booth,\r\n\"Gentleman Jim\" Corbett, General Pershing, down to enough U.S.\r\nSenators and Congressmen to ruin anybody's country.\r\n\r\nThe present head waiter has been there 40 years, his predecessor\r\n50 years. Bus boys must serve an apprenticeship of 10 years. Time\r\nis a necessary element in the proper preparation of food at\r\nAntoine's. If you are in a hurry, Antoine's recommends you go to\r\nthe corner drug store.\r\n\r\nBut let's get back to dinner before it gets cold. We started off\r\nwith a cocktail of something. I think our host said it contained\r\napplejack, champagne and some other ingredient. It had a white\r\ncollar like the beaten white of an egg. Then came \"Oysters\r\nRockefeller,\" so named because of the richness of the sauce . . .\r\nThe recipe for this sauce is a closely guarded family secret. The\r\ndish consists of six oysters on the half shell. A much used pie\r\ntin is filled with rock salt to hold the heat indefinitely. The\r\noysters covered with the sauce are imbedded in this salt and\r\nbaked. The concoction, pie tin and all, is served on a plate.\r\n\r\nDue to the salt, the oysters and sauce will remain hot for\r\nperhaps a half hour. Many a worthy brother's and sister's tongues\r\nhave been blistered. Since 1899, the management has given with\r\neach order a post card showing the number of your order. Mine was\r\n1301744. And so, figuring six oysters to each order, we find that\r\nthe actual number of oysters used to date has been near eight\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\nI had fish--Pompano en papillote--pompano served in paper bags\r\n(rumor hath it that the paper bag retains all the flavor), with\r\nPommes Soufflees, or a glorified branch of fry or potato chips\r\nblown up like large flat pea pods with peas removed.\r\n\r\nDessert consisted mostly of Cherry Jubilee. Large, fat cherries\r\nare put in a metal bowl and covered with brandy. The lights are\r\nturned off over your table. The brandy is lighted with a match.\r\nThe waiter stirs the cherries, flames and all, until thoroughly\r\nhot and the alcohol in the brandy is exhausted. Then he takes\r\nthem to the kitchen, pours them over ice cream and something and\r\nbrings back the portions, hot and cold. A Presbyterian deacon\r\ncould eat Cherry Jubilee without a twinge of conscience.\r\n\r\nAll this took from 8 to 12 p.m., followed by a ride around the\r\nold French section, listening to the music of jazz bands as we\r\npassed the dance halls, winding up the evening's entertainment\r\nabout 1 a.m. at the Morning Call--another New Orleans institution\r\nin a class of its own. Here rich and poor, young and old, meet on\r\na common level and eat delicious doughnuts and drink cups of\r\ncombined hot milk and hot coffee poured together simultaneously.\r\n\r\nNov. 24th, we sailed on the Del Mar. The ship's management\r\ndistributed brightly assorted paper tape to the passengers\r\ngathered at the rails of the different decks and the farewells\r\nand bon voyages began. A Negro jazz band assembled on the wharf.\r\nOne dancer was as nimble at catching coins tossed from the decks\r\nin an old plug hat as he was on his feet. The ship sailed at 4:20\r\np.m.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHIPBOARD AND ST. THOMAS\r\n\r\nTo The Graphic,\r\nGreencastle, Indiana\r\n\r\nSo we approached Charlotte Amalie, the only sizable town in the\r\nVirgin Islands, all white and gleaming in the sun and closely\r\nfollowing the narrow shore lines. The high hills start almost\r\nabruptly from the shore. St. Thomas Island has a population of\r\nperhaps 12,000. Of these, Charlotte Amalie has well over half.\r\n\r\nTaxis--good enough taxis--took those of us who wanted to go into\r\ntown. . . When we met another taxi head-on at the top of a hill,\r\nhe was on his left side, and so were we on ours. Woe is me, I\r\nthought. Here is where one of Russellville Bank's oldest\r\ndirectors gets directed to the nearest hospital, if any. . .\r\nDuring the time I rode taxis there in Charlotte Amalie I never\r\ngot used to left-hand driving. What makes 'em do it? Even Aura\r\nMay flinched. And I--I pushed the driver's seat forward some\r\nthree inches or so.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOTEL 1829\r\n\r\nOne Walter J. Maguire owns and manages Hotel 1829. He and his\r\nwife \"Pete\" are natives of New Jersey, living in C.A. for some 10\r\nto 12 years, since acquiring Hotel 1829. Yes, you have guessed\r\nit. The hotel was built in 1829, and it shows it. Stucco, brick\r\nand some frame. All doors and windows remain wide open. At least\r\nuntil a hurricane comes. The original tile floors remain, showing\r\nconsiderable wear. It has a mammoth combination kitchen, bar and\r\ndining room, with built-in ovens and walls hung with quart to\r\nfive gallon shining copper cooking utensils. All cooking is done\r\nwith charcoal and gasoline stoves. The second floor sills are\r\nclosely spaced and exposed from the first floor. I don't know the\r\ndimensions of these sills, but if one loosened and fell on one,\r\none would never know.\r\n\r\nThe hotel has a honey of a patio, like you see in travel bureau\r\nliterature. All first floor doors are double and fasten from the\r\ninside with glorified gatehooks that look like the twisted\r\nlightning rods on Mrs. Bridge's brick house west of Greencastle,\r\nonly bigger and heavier. The one hanging on the inside of one of\r\nthe front main double doors was about three feet long and the\r\n\"staple\" it hooked into was three-quarter inch solid iron.\r\nHurricane insurance, probably.\r\n\r\nHotel 1829 has a maximum capacity of 24, although if remodeled\r\nfor efficiency and waste spaces done away with, it could\r\naccommodate 124. Reservations are required and one hour notice\r\nfor lunch and three hours for dinner. Rates: $10 per day per\r\nperson, and up.\r\n\r\nC.A. is a free port. Silverware, souvenirs, straw hats and\r\nsandals, cigarettes, wines and liquors and vegetable markets are\r\npredominant, but the greatest of these are wines and liquors. Old\r\nGold cigarettes and the other three or four principal brands\r\nretail at 90 cents per carton, no tax. French champagnes like\r\nMoet and Somebody, $3.50 per bottle.\r\n\r\nBy the time we got there, the market was about closed. It is\r\nquite a place. It occupies a short block for length. The market\r\nhas a roof; the sides and ends are open and the stalls are made\r\nof cement. A few stragglers remained with odds and ends of\r\noranges, bananas, limes (4 for 5 cents), lemons, potatoes,\r\npeppers and things of that sort.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER SHORTAGE\r\n\r\nProbably the biggest problem for Charlotte Amalie is that of good\r\nwater, particularly drinking water. It is scarce and during the\r\ndry season, very scarce. Mr. Maguire told me drilling for wells\r\nis out of the question. They are either dry, or salt water. St.\r\nThomas has no lakes, natural ponds, rivers or streams. It is even\r\nsaid that women sometimes wash their hair in the ever-present\r\nCoca-Cola. As a result of the water shortage, large patches of\r\nsteep mountainside are cemented with water catches at the bottom\r\nfor the rains when they do come.\r\n\r\nAll the police, the woman behind the window at the post office\r\nand the school children were Negroes, neatly dressed. No race\r\nproblem here that I could see. A very few women carried loads\r\nbalanced on their heads. When the ship docked about five or six\r\nrowboats of boys gathered on the bay side. The idea was to throw\r\npennies, nickels, dimes and quarters down and they would dive for\r\nthem. They rarely missed. . . They stayed from 10:30 a.m. to 3:40\r\np.m., when the ship sailed. One of the ship's officers told me\r\nthe average take was three to four dollars.\r\n\r\nSince leaving the island of St. Thomas we have moved steadily on.\r\nThe ship averages something in the low 20's of our land miles-\r\nper-hour. . . Now we are far past the eastern hump of South\r\nAmerica, have crossed the Equator, turned back southwest and are\r\nrunning along the coast of Brazil, and tomorrow we dock in Rio.\r\nThe ship has a tiled swimming pool, well-patronized. The cabins,\r\ndining room, bar, latticed verandah, etc., are air conditioned,\r\nand well need be.\r\n\r\nThis is a fine way to rest and eat. Other than the ship's\r\nactivities, all you see is a very few cargo ships, five miles to\r\ninvisibility away, porpoises, flying fish, a gull or so,\r\noccasional low, dim landheads, the sky, the stars and moon--and\r\nwater, reasonably calm but still as restless as a candidate on\r\nelection night.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAILING DOWN THE 'RIVER OF JANUARY'\r\n\r\nTo The Graphic\r\nGreencastle, Ind.\r\n\r\nWe are southbound out of Rio de Janeiro (River of January,\r\nbecause I am told it was discovered in January). . . We docked\r\nearly on the morning of Dec. 7th and sailed out at 6 p.m. next\r\nday.\r\n\r\nI was standing at the rail when we docked. I have had feelings of\r\nhelplessness many times, and more or less acute. But when I\r\nlooked down some 30 feet and saw that crowd of coated, black\r\nhaired and hatless men, and saw those upturned faces ranging from\r\nswarthy to ebony black, and heard that strange Portuguese as it\r\ncame up in increasing volume along with its accompanying\r\npantomime . . . I wondered and wondered what I was going to do\r\nand how.\r\n\r\nBy that time passengers were descending the accommodation ladder\r\nand strangers had come up. Shortly, the cabin boy came with a\r\nshort, thin, wiry, coal black haired young fellow. He said, \"You\r\nare Mr. Durham?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said.\r\n\r\nHe handed me a card bearing the name of a well known American\r\nfirm doing business in South America and said, \"We received word\r\nyou and your daughter were arriving and I am down to ask you to\r\nbe our guests so we may have the pleasure of entertaining you\r\nwhile here. May we have that pleasure?\"\r\n\r\n\"Son,\" said I, \"you most certainly may--and before you have time\r\nto change your mind.\" And I meant it.\r\n\r\nHe looked a trifle puzzled. We went inside the Verandah Cafe and\r\nright there another less swarthy and older man accosted me in\r\nlike manner, for a like purpose, and handed me a card of another\r\nwell known American firm.\r\n\r\nWe sat down and ironed it out: the answer was most simple--and\r\nmost satisfying to both hosts. We saddled ourselves on the young\r\nfellow the first day and on the older man the second day.\r\n\r\nCome to think it all over carefully, that thing could have been\r\nrehearsed by said parties of the first part. Things fit in too\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNIQUE TRAFFIC PATTERNS\r\n\r\nIn Rio they drive cars mostly by horn. The balance of it is done\r\nby guess. The din and confusion is terrific. Added to this,\r\npedestrians pay no attention to cars and drivers give no heed to\r\npedestrians. The latter cross and re-cross the streets wherever\r\nand whenever they get the notion.\r\n\r\nThe first day in Rio we spent driving the downtown congestion\r\nalong the beaches, and other sight-seeing. The big percent is one\r\nway traffic. To get a block or so away from where you are you\r\nexecute some geometric figures they didn't have in the books when\r\nI took geometry.\r\n\r\nThis day we had an accident. Driving in the downtown congestion a\r\ncar from the lane to our right pulled into us, tearing off the\r\nright hind fender of our almost brand new convertible. Traffic\r\nstopped momentarily only. You would think the two owners were\r\nexchanging pleasantries. They gathered up the pieces and pulled\r\nout what was left of the fender to keep the tires from scraping,\r\nand away we went. No cops, no report, no exchange of license\r\nnumbers, no fight, no profanity, no nothing. It was a bit\r\ndiscouraging.\r\n\r\nAt noon we gathered at the head office, collected some more\r\nofficials and our host took us to lunch at the Jockey's Club. . .\r\nWith the aid of all present I ate those things for which Rio and\r\nBrazil are most noted. Some most excellent, some so-so. The\r\nfamous coffee at the Jockey's Club, and elsewhere for that\r\nmatter, must have bitter root and paint remover in it.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, we drove to Petropolis, the summer capitol, about\r\n40 odd miles up in the mountains over one of the few good\r\nhighways. The paved highways of Brazil, a country larger than the\r\nU.S., have a total mileage of 450 miles. That wouldn't reach from\r\nGreencastle to Topeka, Kansas. Petropolis must be a half-mile\r\nabove sea level. At places, where the highway ran near the\r\ncliff's edge, you could look down and see where you had been some\r\n15 or 20 minutes before, but you'll never know how you got from\r\nthere to where you are now.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAVERNOUS EX-CASINO\r\n\r\nOn the way is the Quintandinha (or some such spelling) Hotel--the\r\nbiggest I ever saw. Here is where the Pan-American Conference was\r\nheld. There it was on the mountain side, all quiet, no one about\r\nand just beginning to look a bit like our cattle barn east of\r\nRussellville, or \"Happy\" Cal's derby hat. The hotel is closed.\r\nThe reason? It depended on its casino to keep it going. The new\r\npresident of Brazil was instrumental in enacting a law making\r\ncasinos illegal. So now the gambling element of Brazil is\r\nthinking of getting a new president. So you see, the world is\r\npretty much the same all over.\r\n\r\nWe drove up under whatever it is that great big hotels have in\r\nfront of them and there stood six or seven cars. Most of them\r\nheld Del Mar sightseers. Nobody could get in. Our host\r\ndisappeared somewhere and came back directly, saying we would get\r\nin. I asked, \"How.\" He said, \"Folding money.\" So you see, we are\r\nstill pretty much the same, all the way around.\r\n\r\nDid you ever see a whale of a big hay loft with all the hay left\r\nout? When we stepped through the front door into the dimness of\r\nthat hotel, that was my thought. No lights and total silence.\r\nEverything on a tremendous scale and everywhere in semi-darkness.\r\nThat conference room must be the size of our court house lawn,\r\nhitch rack and all. The flags of all the nations still hang.\r\nHundreds of thousands of cruzeiros changed hands nightly under,\r\nand surrounded by those flags. Inside, I saw a swimming pool 25\r\nfeet deep at the deep end. The fellow who I think took the\r\nfolding money told me in broken English the dome of the hotel was\r\nbigger than that of St. Peter's in Rome. I doubt that. I said to\r\nhim, \"It certainly would hold a pile of clover hay.\" That went\r\nclear past and beyond him. But who am I to tell a Brazilian how\r\nbig his dome is?\r\n\r\n\r\nDOM PEDRO AND HIS MANY FANS\r\n\r\nIn Petropolis we went through the Palace of Dom Pedro. I'll not\r\ntry to tell you just who Dom Pedro was, and how he came to be,\r\nbecause I don't know. I should, after all the Dom Pedroing I went\r\nthrough that afternoon, but I got confused. But Dom Pedro had to\r\nbe some boy. Between him and his wife or wives and his sons and\r\ndaughters and grandsons and granddaughters, and their activities,\r\nthere wasn't much left to say about anybody else.\r\n\r\nAt the front door pious looking attendants slip felt slippers,\r\nopen at the heel, over your shoes, and from there on through the\r\npalace you slide your way along the highly polished wooden floors\r\n(original). Dom Pedro, his wife (let's give him credit for only\r\none) and their get were everywhere, in oil, bronze and marble,\r\nhorseback and on foot. But Dom himself seemed to take pretty much\r\nto horses for the big pictures the big scenes. We saw the throne\r\nroom, bed rooms, dining hall, nursery and its cradles, uniforms,\r\nswords, state dresses, black-hair combs a foot high, old china\r\nand glassware and ladies fans.\r\n\r\nLet me tell you about the fans. My Aunt Jennie Black was a fan\r\nfan--the kind that folded up--and the art was to fold and unfold\r\nthem gracefully. Remember? In a way, cigarettes are to our coeds\r\nwhat fans were to Aunt Jennie and her era. Well, don't think Dom\r\nPedro's queen and women folk weren't in there fanning hard with\r\ntheir fans, and long, long before Aunt Jennie and hers. A room\r\nthe size of Crawley's pool room was full of them in glass cases.\r\nHundreds, yes almost thousands of them: Wood, bone, ivory,\r\ntortoise shell, amber and whatever else that could be made into\r\nfans. Delicate filigree, gold, silver, mother of pearl, inlay of\r\nsuperb workmanship and so fine it should be magnified to show it\r\nis really hand work. Yes, they had fans in Dom's day, and just as\r\nmany as Brooklyn has now.\r\n\r\nAnd away back behind was a small cubby hole room where Dom and\r\nhis Senators, or Cabinet, or advisers, or whatever it was he had,\r\nmet and considered matters of state. Then Dom, after being duly\r\nadvised, would go out and make his own laws. Up home you had Huey\r\nLong and some others I mustn't name out loud do about the same\r\nthing, so you see, we are pretty much . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIGHTENING PROSPECTS\r\n\r\nTwo full days in Rio is hardly enough to get much idea of a\r\nforeign city of a million and a half to two million in\r\npopulation. One man expressed it this way. \"Rio has a limited\r\nnumber of rich to big rich, and a world of poor to very poor. We\r\nlack a middle class. We are very short on middle class. After the\r\nwar people of Brazil flocked to Rio, and, far far oftener than\r\nnot, left a position and life much higher than the one they\r\nattained, or could ever attain, in Rio.\"\r\n\r\nRight now, they are slowed down almost critically by reason of a\r\nshortage of American dollars. They want and badly need to buy\r\nfrom us, but have no stable currency to pay with. Added to this,\r\nit would appear to the average outsider, they have some\r\nunfortunate and crippling legislation that doesn't help this\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nWe went to a cocktail party at the Copacabana Hotel. And there we\r\nmet some 20 to 25 men from the States in various commercial and\r\nfinancial activities in Rio. It was the general opinion that the\r\nfinancial and industrial situation is rather bad. No impending\r\npanic seems evident, but a ripple of pessimism exists. As the\r\nevening advanced and the cocktails expanded, that pessimism\r\ndissipated. By the time some of us got to where a cock's tail\r\nblended into the rest of his feathers and where the cocktail\r\nparty blended into the dinner party, it appeared a boom was about\r\nto start.\r\n\r\n\r\nLABOR AND CLIMATE\r\n\r\nSailing out of Rio at 6 p.m. Dec. 8th, next morning early we\r\ndocked at Santos. We loaded 400 tons of rather inferior bananas\r\nfor Montevideo and Buenos Aires, all hand work except for the\r\ncrane that lifted the sling of loaded bananas off the dock and\r\nlowered them into the hold. When they wanted to move a car up or\r\ndown the track, about 50 men would surround it and push, and\r\nslowly she would begin to roll. At 11 a.m. the city siren blew\r\nand everybody quit work right then and there until 2 p.m. That\r\ngave us two full daylight days in Santos.\r\n\r\nI had been told in Rio that another representative of one of the\r\ncompanies would meet and take care of us at Santos. The first day\r\nwe drove to Sao Paulo, referred to by Brazilians as the \"Chicago\"\r\nof Brazil. To me, that is a Churchillian understatement. It is\r\nthe manufacturing city of Brazil, some 50 odd miles up in the\r\nmountains from Santos. The two cities have rail and truck\r\nconnections. I asked our host how come manufacturers would unload\r\nraw products or knockdown parts onto railroad cars or trucks,\r\nmake the haul up to S.P., manufacture or assemble it there, then\r\nrail or truck it back down to Santos or Rio. Why not do it at\r\nSantos or Rio and cut out all that haul and extra handling?\r\n\r\nThe answer was \"labor conditions and climate differences--mostly\r\nthe former.\" After seeing those 50 men gingerly moving that\r\nbanana car of half the capacity of one of Sir Herbert Martin's\r\nbox cars, I began to catch the idea.\r\n\r\nWe had lunch in a super class French restaurant. For some unknown\r\nreason our host and his sprightly wife wanted to take us to The\r\nJungle--a real, for sure Brazilian jungle some 140 kilometers on\r\nbeyond Sao Paulo. We started, but long, long before The Jungle we\r\npractically ran out of road. They were improving and re-locating\r\nthe highway. We held a caucus. Our host was as game as they come.\r\n. . Open revolt came when our host said he had inquired and was\r\nassured the road would get better farther on and that he would\r\nhave us back aboard ship by midnight, perhaps before that time. A\r\nvote was taken. Three were for returning then and there, with one\r\nnot voting. We turned around and headed back for Sao Paulo.\r\n\r\nOn the way out toward The Jungle we met truck after truck loaded\r\nhigh with sacked charcoal enroute to Sao Paulo where it sells as\r\nhigh as a doctor's bill back home. It is used in cooking. There\r\nseemed to be no coal. Gasoline is expensive and oil men tell me\r\nit is not as good as our \"regular.\" No Ethyl.\r\n\r\nOur host, knowing we had driven from Rio to Petropolis, at the\r\nday's end told us we had traveled almost half of the total good\r\nroad mileage of Brazil.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO MINK SOUTH OF KEY WEST?\r\n\r\nAt Rio and Santos we lost upward of a third of our original\r\npassengers. Newcomers filled all the vacated cabins, Portuguese\r\nor Spanish speaking peoples. Most of them were business men and\r\nnot tourists out for a lark. Talk started about going through\r\ncustoms at Buenos Aires, and how many cigarettes and how much\r\nliquor we could take in. For some reason opinion on number and\r\nvolume differed. . . As to liquor, the question centered around\r\nwhether it was liters or number of bottles that counted, and if\r\nso what size bottles. All of which didn't help those who had it\r\nin jugs. I never will know how the jug crowd came out.\r\n\r\nSugar Foot's problem is something else. It has to do with a neck\r\npiece Mummy or someone else in the family besides me is sending\r\nto Ann Drew in California. Now you know why it is taking this\r\nroundabout way of getting to California, so why ask me that\r\nsimple a question? But so far on the trip there has been no place\r\nfor the display of furs, and the only way that comes to me now\r\nthat we can achieve that air of affluence is for the hot water\r\nsystem of the flying machine to give out when we are 2,000 feet\r\nin the air going over the Andes to Santiago. But let's hope it\r\ndoesn't. I don't want anything to happen to anybody that high up,\r\nmuch less Sugar Foot and me. I wouldn't want that to happen even\r\nto a Republican--provided there are any of them left up there by\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\nI see I started out telling you about Aura May's problem and\r\nwound up in politics. Her problem is this: she didn't declare\r\nsaid alleged mink neck piece on leaving the States. Now some low\r\nfellow tells us we will have trouble getting \"back-in\" with it.\r\nMy hope is there are no mink south of Key West. And besides, the\r\nmore I get the few glimpses of that neck piece the more I am\r\nconvinced they're house cats made up to look like anything that\r\nhas to pay a duty.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERVIEWED BY THE URUGUAY PRESS\r\n\r\nTo The Graphic\r\nGreencastle, Ind.\r\n\r\nThe evening of Dec. 10th we sailed out of Santos, redolent of\r\ncoffee, and the next morning docked in Montevideo, to be met by\r\nanother \"angel\" from one of those heaven sent Companies we've\r\nbeen blessed with so far. . . With the aid of an interpreter, we\r\nwere to have our pictures taken and give an interview to a\r\nreporter for one of the newspapers.\r\n\r\nThey wanted to know how we liked Uruguay and Montevideo.\r\nNaturally, we didn't know, not having set foot on either yet.\r\n\r\nWell, where were we going and what were we going to do--business,\r\npleasure or diplomatic? And all this time I was repeatedly asked\r\nwhat advice I had to give to the people of Uruguay. You bet I had\r\nnone--none whatever.\r\n\r\nWhen this filtered to the reporter, he looked amazed and puzzled.\r\nHe was thinking. The next perplexed question that came through\r\nthe strainer was, \"But you are a lawyer, aren't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am a lawyer, but a lawyer is the last fellow you want to\r\ngo to up home for advice--except politicians, veterinarians and\r\nundertakers.\"\r\n\r\nThey caught the \"politician\" part of it, but I don't think the\r\nreporter ever did unravel the rest of it.\r\n\r\nHe was a persistent pressman, however, and kept firing the advice\r\nquestion at me.\r\n\r\nI finally said, \"I have no advice whatsoever to whomsoever,\" etc.\r\n(using other big sounding words lawyers use when they don't know)\r\n\"to give you splendid sovereign peoples of Uruguay. If I had to\r\ngive something, it would be this: observe International Law and\r\nyour Treaties to the letter, and then run your own country in\r\nyour own way and without let or hindrance from anybody outside.\"\r\n\r\nThe interview was an unqualified success judged from the nods,\r\ngesticulations and shaking of hands. I got so I thought it was\r\npretty good myself.\r\n\r\nBut alas. You should read what came out in the paper next\r\nmorning. . . I was quoted to have said Uruguay had a most forward\r\nand socially stable government, or something like that.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIVESTOCK--REAL AND BRONZED\r\n\r\nOur friend, the manager of the company, proved to be most\r\ncapable. . . We drove over the city after picking up his wife. .\r\n. Montevideo is much cleaner and more mechanized than is Rio or\r\nSantos, or so it seemed to me. The docks were less littered up.\r\nPerhaps people and business moved faster and more orderly. . .\r\nSaw a world of sheep. Sheep is a big industry in Uruguay--perhaps\r\nits biggest. There were also pen after pen of cattle. I never saw\r\na steer there as good as Oscar Clodfelter's worst one.\r\n\r\nIf I have worked kilos into pounds and pesos into dollars\r\ncorrectly, prime steers are selling on the hoof there at the\r\nmarket at five to six cents per pound, our money. But always\r\nremember they're probably grassers and not the way the Hazlett\r\nboys or Jude Grimes corn feeds them.\r\n\r\nAnother thing in Montevideo. I've seen a real piece of art, a\r\nbronze piece of statuary \"of heroic size.\" It sets in a park. It\r\nis called La Carreta, and depicts an early settler on a horse\r\nbeside a two-wheeled pioneer cart with one big wheel sunk in the\r\nmud plumb down to the axle pulled by one bull and seven steers or\r\noxen all yoked together, and with a spare ox tied on behind. I\r\nlooked to see about that ox. He was an ox and the only possible\r\ncriticism I have is that he should have been a cow tied on\r\nbehind. Otherwise the thing is perfection to me. The cart slopes\r\njust right, the oxen look hard-worked, the bull like a bull,\r\nthick neck and all, the horse like a thin, tired horse ought to\r\nlook, and the man like some men up on Raccoon I've seen in my\r\ntime. Only he had on some local trappings my men never had. But\r\nthere they are, the man yelling, the bull and oxen set and\r\nstraining for every ounce, and all trying like hell to get out.\r\n\r\nMaybe that cow was following behind a half quarter or so, and I\r\nfailed to see her.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEARED FOR BUENOS AIRES\r\n\r\nWe sailed out at 6 p.m. Dec. 13 for Buenos Aires. In the meantime\r\nthe Argentine doctors had come aboard to look us over and sort\r\nout the rots and specks. They, along with our ship's doctor and\r\nsome of the officers were in the bar when Sugar Foot and I came\r\nback to ship. One man who had traveled before said they were\r\nbeing mellowed-up so they wouldn't be too technical with us. If\r\nthey were, it took a long time. . . The Purser handed in Sugar\r\nFoot's passport. The doctor found the right page, took one look\r\nat her and stamped her \"sound\", remarked something about the\r\nbeautiful senorita. They are good at that down here--mighty good.\r\nI don't know how many men have kissed her hand to date on\r\nintroduction. . .They stamped me next and we were off.\r\n\r\nA man from one of those blessed firms met us at B.A., and got us\r\nthrough customs in record time. Not only that, he got us and our\r\nluggage to a waiting car, and said, \"This car and the chauffeur\r\nare at your disposal day and night during your stay in Buenos\r\nAires, which we hope will be most pleasant. . . Don't hesitate to\r\nask us for any information.\"\r\n\r\nAnd here I had been worrying about two extra cartons of\r\ncigarettes all the way from St. Thomas.\r\n\r\nWe first got settled at the Plaza Hotel and then drove to see\r\nmany of the sights. In B.A. they also drive pretty much by horn.\r\nI am told it is the second sized city in the Western Hemisphere--\r\nbigger than Chicago even. Anyway, it is big.\r\n\r\nThe sights of Buenos Aires are many and varied. About like any\r\nother S.A. city, only bigger. . . The shops are elaborate. . .\r\nPrices are reputedly relatively higher in B.A. than at home. I\r\nsincerely doubt this. I positively do. Especially if you get your\r\nmoney changed into pesos at what some are willing to give for\r\nAmerican dollars. It may be a bit shady, but it is done rather\r\nopenly. Never go to a bank. The banks are pegged. They can give\r\nyou 9.3 pesos per dollar. Our blessed friend at the dock warned\r\nus. He told us to have our (get that possessive) chauffeur stop\r\nat one of the cambios, I think they call them, and go in--just\r\nlike that. . .We got 15 for 1.\r\n\r\nDue to the number of us arriving via S.S. Del Mar, we were not\r\nrequired to go to the police station to register. The authorities\r\ndetailed a man to come to the Plaza Hotel and do the job. . . He\r\nhad a big sign, \"Silence,\" on his desk; also a typewriter. He\r\nassumed a very important look, much the same as the one I took on\r\nwhen the lobbyists began calling me \"Senator.\" The job was soon\r\nover. We received our tourist cards with instructions to carry\r\nthem at all times--or else.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOCKEY'S CLUB--WHERE THE BEEF IS\r\n\r\nBeef is the staple food, killed that morning. No self-respecting\r\nArgentine would touch ripened meat or chilled or deep freeze\r\nstuff. He wants it right off the hoof. And yet, I am inclined to\r\nthink they want it fairly well-done. Sugar Foot has been having\r\ntrouble getting hers rare enough.\r\n\r\nThe best meat I have had was at the Jockey's Club. Every town\r\ndown here seems to have a Jockey's Club. . . All of them are\r\nowned and operated by the same people. Who started them? The\r\nfarmers of the Argentine. Away back there these beef growers\r\nbegan to get rich. Then they got feudal. They were the\r\nAristocracy of hereabouts. Big holdings and immense herds. Then\r\nthey moved to town and took over. Now some of them have gone to\r\nMonte Carlo and Cannes and New York while the overseers and hired\r\nmen run the place back home. That is the way I am told. . . To be\r\na member you have to be one of those farmers. Or else a\r\ndescendant of one of those farmers--you've got to have Hereford\r\nblood somewhere in you.\r\n\r\nThe Club has all the dignity it is possible to have. Marble\r\nfloors, big well-spaced tables with large roomy chairs, heavy\r\ndark polished woodwork, immense wide stairways and steps with low\r\nrisers, an enormous library with old men in dignified dress\r\nasleep here and there, kinda like English clubs, say.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday we went to the races at Palermo track. . . We had as\r\nour guests Captain Jones and Purser Stricker of the Del Mar and a\r\nMrs. Somebody who operates a girls' school in Buenos Aires. The\r\ncaptain and Mrs. Somebody go to bet on the races, and bet they\r\ndid, on every race. I said above that we were hosts. That's\r\nwrong. The good captain had the big thing--access to the Jockey's\r\nClub part of the track, the stand right at the wire. In my\r\ninnocence I had asked them as guests. They had accepted as such.\r\nHaving sat at table with the good captain for about three weeks,\r\nhe had long since gotten my number and what I knew about Palermo\r\nand everything else south of the Putnam County line. He just\r\nbided his time and then let me down as easy as possible. He's\r\nthat way.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVALUATING THE WOMEN\r\n\r\nI remember what Claud Smith (now a pious, sedate lawyer and ex-\r\njudge down at Princeton) said once when we had gathered in a room\r\nat Indiana U for the usual talk. In his blunt, matter-of-fact\r\nway, Claud spoke up first. He said, \"Well, shall we begin talking\r\nabout the girls right off the bat, or gradually lead up to them\r\nlike we've been doing?\"\r\n\r\nSo let's talk about these beautiful women down here. They know\r\nhow to dress in a striking way. Black-eyed, black-haired with\r\nsmooth swarthy complexions. Some are as sinuous and graceful as\r\nall get out. But my observation is that the majority are from\r\ntrifling bulky to good and bulky. But you must bear in mind that\r\nI do not see much of the younger set. It is the older women I get\r\nto see most. . . I do not understand Spanish. That is a terrible\r\nhandicap. But if they talk as intelligently as they do animatedly\r\nand rapidly, they're honeys.\r\n\r\nNevertheless and notwithstanding, I think I know where the\r\nprettiest women on earth are to be found in the greatest numbers,\r\nand I'll tell you where to see them. Go sit on the Boulder in\r\nEast College campus when classes let out and you'll see them.\r\nYou'll see more per square inch there than you'll see here per\r\nsquare rod. If you are too self-conscious or too dignified now to\r\ngo sit on the Boulder, then I'll tell you, . . . if we had\r\nbrought Miss Bess Robbins and Miss Sedelia Starr down here some\r\ntime ago they would have won 99 out of 100 of all the beauty\r\ncontests hereabouts. I'll add my sister, Mrs. Margaret D.\r\nBridges. I thought she was the prettiest girl I ever saw.\r\n\r\n\r\nOVER THE ANDES BY AIR\r\n\r\nOn a certain bright morning at 11:15 we started my biggest trial\r\nby fire or whatever the poets call it--going over the Andes in a\r\nflying machine. To me the plane didn't look any too new, or the\r\npaint any too fresh, or the pilot and crew any too much like I\r\nthought high-flying Andes pilots ought to look. The passengers\r\nlooked pretty heavy, and there was a world of baggage.\r\n\r\nThe takeoff was the usual one. We got higher and higher. The\r\nliterature on the back of the seat just in front of me was none\r\ntoo assuring. It said, \"If you feel yourself getting sick just\r\nuse the strong paper bags in the pocket on the back of the seat\r\nin front of you. Don't feel ashamed. Others before you have used\r\nthem,\" or words to that effect.\r\n\r\nWe climbed and climbed. From time to time I thought I heard the\r\nengine sputter. We would hit bad going occasionally, the wings\r\nwould dip up and down, and my seat would sort of try to get fully\r\nout from under me.\r\n\r\nThe best way I know to describe the scene is . . . rectangular\r\nstraight sided patches of land of varying sizes and colors as far\r\nas one could see: green, purple, dirt color, straw color.\r\nSometimes I thought there were streams of water. Houses or barns\r\nwere mere ballot-sized squares, evidently surrounded with trees\r\nin full leaf. . . Inevitably each town had a plaza with spokes\r\nrunning out like those of a wagon wheel.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the Andes the ground was closer and looked like\r\nthe crinkled hide of an elephant. Then came the Andes. Soon there\r\nwas plenty of snow. Eventually we passed to one side of Mt.\r\nAconcagua, the highest peak in South America, 23,000 and some\r\nfeet. We must have been 21,000 feet up. Then we saw its glacier,\r\nblue-green and cold. Up there we saw lots of blue-green ice.\r\n\r\nIn short order we circled over Santiago and landed. Gosh-a-\r\nmighty! Was I glad! We landed at 1:15 p.m., one hour change of\r\ntime. It had been a three hour trip. And right there at the\r\nairport was a representative of one of those Heaven-sent U.S.\r\ncorporations I've been talking about, ready and willing to take\r\nus and our one remaining jug of St. Thomas rum through the\r\ncustoms and to the Carrera Hotel.\r\n\r\nAnd now we are going on our big adventure into and among the\r\nunknown. Daughter Joan and her husband, Bill, met a couple in\r\nParis, France, last whenever it was who are from Nehuentue, in\r\nsouthern Chile, near the lakes and volcano region. Sight unseen\r\nthey have asked us down over Christmas, and sight unseen we are\r\ngoing. They are of French extraction. Speak Spanish fluently, but\r\nno English. Sugar Foot speaks and understands considerable\r\nSpanish. But what am I to do? How am I to learn where the\r\nbathroom is even--if there is any.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN CHILE: ROCKY ROADS, BIG 'FARM'\r\n\r\nThe train from Santiago to Temuco, where we were to meet our\r\nunknown host, is a three or four car diesel train. In English, it\r\nis \"The Arrow.\" All seats are reserved and it is probably an\r\nextra fare train, all first class. The train left at 7:45 and\r\narrived in Temuco, about 450 kilometers away, at 6:10 p.m.\r\n\r\nGoing south toward Temuco, we kept in the valley with fair sized\r\nmountains on each side, quite a distance away. Garden truck,\r\nfruit trees and wheat, cattle of European breeds, considerable\r\ndairy stuff, but nary a Hereford. Huasos (Chilean cowboys,\r\ncorresponding to the Argentinean gauchos) in their mantas (cloth\r\nblankets with slits in the middle to put the head through) became\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\nTemuco is the biggest city in south Chile, about 65,000. On the\r\nplatform we met our host, a clean-cut, energetic young fellow\r\nabout 32 years old, and another young fellow who turned out to be\r\na schoolmate of our host in Paris. Our hostess was home with a\r\nslightly ailing four-month-old boy.\r\n\r\nThe two men were to take us southeast to Pucon in the lake and\r\nvolcano country, 50 kilometers away. The road was a bit rough and\r\nwe must hurry because we should see the scenery enroute and then\r\nspend the night in the fine resort hotel at Pucon. Then back next\r\nday to Temuco and thence due west another 80 kilometers or so to\r\nmine host's fundo (farm) near Nehuentue. It was all arranged.\r\n\r\nWe got in a 1947 Chevrolet that had taken a beating since it left\r\nthe factory and started over the road described as \"a bit rough\"\r\n. . . Man of Samaria! Was that road rough! And did the loose\r\nround rock fly. . . Our car had a special network of steel bolted\r\nto the frame to keep flying rock from damaging the underside. And\r\n7-ply tires--I never heard of them. And most of the time our\r\nspeedometer ranged from 45 to 80 kilometers per hour, depending\r\non how the road looked to our host. He mis-guessed many times.\r\n\r\nWe had three blowouts on that road to Pucon, and the first one\r\ntore the inner tube all to the devil. We never saw the valve\r\nstem. Our friends donned overalls, spread a piece of thick\r\nmaterial and got under.\r\n\r\nThe blowouts caused us to change plans. We couldn't make Pucon\r\nand its splendid resort hotel that night, because we might run\r\nout of tires. We would have to stop short about 25 kilometers, at\r\nVillarrica, near a tremendous volcano of that name. Our host knew\r\na French woman who ran a hotel there. Not much of a hotel for\r\nlooks and all of the comforts, but the food would be\r\nexceptionally good. It was.\r\n\r\nThat late evening was the last time we were to see Villarrica. A\r\nmountain of a volcano, snowclad, it stood high above everything\r\nelse, cold, white and still. It appeared shaped like one of the\r\npyramids of Egypt, except that the top didn't come to so acute an\r\napex. It erupted last year after a long period of dormancy. It\r\nawed me something like the Grand Canyon of Arizona does. Next day\r\nbrought a big haze.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUEST FOR HOT WATER\r\n\r\nThat hotel is something to write home about. The evenings and\r\nnights were cold. We wanted a room with twin beds and bath. By\r\ngolly, they had it--such as it was. We wanted heat, but that they\r\ndidn't have. The bed was too short for me, even sleeping\r\ncrosswise.\r\n\r\nNext morning I turned on the hot water faucet for shaving. No hot\r\nwater. My interpreter, Sugar Foot, was asleep, so I thought I'd\r\ntry to make myself understood. I asked the first girl I saw about\r\nhot water. She spoke and gesticulated rapidly, which opened the\r\nflood gates, and five or six more came running. Thus reinforced,\r\nwe all ventured back to our room.\r\n\r\nThey must have forgotten all about any daughter being along. She\r\nwas asleep and covered up, head and all. I called her. When she\r\ngot unraveled and that head emerged, framed in all those aluminum\r\nand tinware bobby pins, the nearest girl gave a wild-eyed half\r\nshriek. When the baby of the family unwound some more, the girls,\r\nseeing no blood, finally consented to listen. With a something in\r\nSpanish or French that evidently meant, \"Oh, that was what he\r\nwanted,\" the girls filed out. Aura May, in a tone they don't\r\nteach in finishing school, said, \"They will bring some hot water\r\nas soon as they can make it.\"\r\n\r\nShe gave me a crab-apple look, turned over and wound up again.\r\n\r\nIn far longer than due time, a long-eared boy brought a pint\r\ncontainer of water. It was just enough to take the chill off the\r\nbottom of the lavatory. And the rubber plug leaked, to boot.\r\n\r\nThe trip on to Pucon was uneventful, concerning tire trouble. We\r\nwere never to have any more. The hotel looked all it was\r\nrepresented to be. There were few guests. The beach was as bare\r\nas our dry lots after a year of feeding. One motor \"put-putted\"\r\nout on the lake--30 miles long--but the occupants looked like\r\nthey'd prefer being somewhere where steam heat was on. It is true\r\nthat the season was just begun--hardly that.\r\n\r\nWe all four had had enough. We started back to Temuco over that\r\nsame road. The day was cold with very poor visibility. Some of\r\nthe volcanoes were no doubt smoking like they had for hundreds of\r\nyears. We couldn't see them.\r\n\r\nSomething keeps telling me the weather south of Chile will have\r\nto change to make that hotel a good go. I want none of its stock.\r\nI'd rather have mine in Russellville Bank, and the Lord knows\r\nsome of the stock holders think that is bad enough.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREE FENCES AND OX CARTS\r\n\r\nBut we did see sights I never knew existed. I'll tell you how\r\nthey built fences 50 to 75 years ago. The country was full of big\r\ntimber. They wanted less timber and more fences. They cut the\r\ntrees into 9 to 10 foot lengths, split the timber into 9 inches\r\nto a foot for thickness, squared the sides, dug long trenches\r\nthree to four feet deep, and set these timbers side by side,\r\nclose and tight, and then filled in and there was your fence,\r\nhorse high, bull strong and pig, yes, chicken-tight, unless they\r\nflew. There are thousands of miles of that kind of fence still\r\ndown there, old and moss-covered but still pretty sound and\r\nserviceable. Think of the work and loss of timber that involved.\r\n\r\nAnother big sight is the oxen and their carts. On this trip most\r\nof them were hauling timber of one sort or another, logs or sawed\r\nstuff. We saw hundreds of oxcarts and oxen. Some carts had\r\nspokes, steel tires, steel axles and metal fellers, or whatever\r\nit is the axles fit into. Many of them had wheels made of round\r\nlogs with no metal tires or other metal about them. The axles ran\r\nthrough holes in the bare wood. They were the primitive kind, but\r\nthere were hundreds of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORLDS OF CASTE\r\n\r\nAll the time we were passing huasos in their mantas astride their\r\nhorses--hundreds of them. There were so many they almost got\r\nmonotonous. Never was a \"hello\" said, or an arm lifted in\r\nsalutation. We were in a car, and that was enough. Worlds of\r\ncaste separated them from us.\r\n\r\nThe back track to Temuco was about the same. We missed a few of\r\nour original boulders but made up for it with new ones. To be\r\nsure, much of the little stuff, say from four inches down, we had\r\nshot from under the tires out into the wheat fields and pastures,\r\nso it was out of our way, but that was only a fraction of the\r\navailable material.\r\n\r\nWe headed west from Temuco toward the Pacific. The road was to be\r\nabout like it had been for some 55 kilometers and then get\r\n\"rather bad at times from there on.\" The \"bad roads\" turned out\r\nto be dirt roads with big chuck holes.\r\n\r\nWe entered the Mapucha Indian country. They live in thatched\r\nshanties and lean-tos, some in sort of caves they had dug in\r\nsteep banks along the roadside. There were plenty of dogs and\r\nchildren. Once, at some distance, I saw a lot of smoke coming out\r\nall over a roof. I thought the place was on fire, but our host,\r\nby way of our interpreter, Aura May, said roofs are made to let\r\nout smoke. An Indian builds his fire on the floor in the middle\r\nof the house. I suppose the rain comes in the same way the smoke\r\ngoes out.\r\n\r\n\r\nA WHALE OF A FUNDO\r\n\r\nThe big moment came: We were at the home of our host and hostess.\r\nThe big white house sits on a round natural knoll, the top of\r\nwhich is about 100 feet above the surrounding ground. Flower\r\ngardens practically surround the house and are about as well kept\r\nand beautiful as any you will see anywhere; some mighty tall\r\neucalyptus trees; a fine cement tennis court with a judge's stand\r\nand seats all around for spectators; double garage; a long,\r\nturning, bowered walk leading from the base of the hill up to the\r\nfront door, the bower made of trimmed and trained small sycamore\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nA fundo in Chile corresponds to an Argentinean estancia--a big\r\nfarm to a whale of a big farm. This fundo has some 3,000 acres.\r\nHe has another down the road back toward Temuco. Fundo No. 1 has\r\na big Delco lighting system, so you know what that means--three\r\nor four all time men.\r\n\r\nI shall not try to account for the army of men and women this\r\n\"fundoist\" (let's just coin another new word) employs, but I'll\r\ngive you a rough idea. He pays off through a window of his office\r\nin the house. From about one or two p.m. to five o'clock that\r\nSaturday, when he and his overseer knocked off for tea, they had\r\npaid 62 men and women. After tea they went back at it and then\r\nagain after dinner. I was never told the full count.\r\n\r\nHe always has a long list of potential employees. He is good pay.\r\nAnd yet I know a smallish man back home who gets exactly 10 times\r\nthe money that this man pays his overseer per month. Now maybe\r\nyou can begin to account for those beautiful gardens, those\r\nprecision trimmed hedges, that spick and span house, those neat\r\nwalks, weedless lawn, splendidly cooked meals faultlessly served,\r\nand so ad infinituma seeming inexhaustible supply of fabulously\r\ncheap man and woman power by our standards. Not so much down here\r\nby Chilean standards, in Chilean money, made in Chile.\r\n\r\nOur room in the Carrera Hotel in Santiago with twin beds, tub and\r\nshower, service galore, large, airy and well-appointed in every\r\nway, on the 14th floor with French windows and magnificent view--\r\na splendid room in probably the biggest and best hotel in town--\r\ncost us 606 pesos per day, sales tax and tips included. In our\r\nmoney, as we exchanged it, that means $6.06. Even a Durham\r\nwouldn't kick on that.\r\n\r\nWe will get back to the fundo and go out the front door, make a\r\nright angle and have a look. Below and directly in front are the\r\nbarns, barn lots, drives, pens, slaughterhouse, enormous two\r\nstory wheat granary, potato houses, stables, sheds, blacksmith\r\nshop, lumber room and sawmill pretty well equipped to make any\r\nwooden thing a farm needs, the Delco building, the flour mill,\r\nthe cheese factory and probably a lot of other \"small stuff' like\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nHe had six riding horses in one stable when I looked in. Two of\r\nthem were thoroughbred Chilean horses he seemed rather proud of,\r\nalthough he is extremely modest about what he owns. Aura May went\r\nriding to the nearby Indian town and back on the big hills,\r\ntaking a look at the Pacific Ocean off there to the west about\r\ntwo miles.\r\n\r\nBeyond the aforementioned barns and so forth is the highway, and\r\nbeyond that is near 2,000 acres of about the finest bottom land\r\nin all Chile. It is supreme. It extends over a mile to the river\r\nand almost three miles up and down, to a very small town,\r\nNehuentue, his post office. The river is rather narrow, but deep\r\nand navigable--salt water up past him, and with a small tide, say\r\ntwo feet. He has his own private dock on the river where he loads\r\nhis wheat, potatoes, cattle, sheep and whatever else he may want\r\nto ship.\r\n\r\nHe appears to think his livestock is a small part of the fundo.\r\nAnd yet, when he got the idea I thought a good deal of cattle, he\r\ntook Sugar Foot and me into a pasture of an excellent sort of\r\nstrange grass where he had 50 or 60 grassers he expected to weigh\r\n1,000 pounds by cold weather--next July or August. They were of\r\nall colors and duo colors, but good boned, uniform, and in good\r\nflesh--the best I had seen. I saw perhaps another 300 animals, 40\r\nor 50 good-sized hogs and a good many sheep. And still, he isn't\r\nin the livestock business--much.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MISSING PURSE\r\n\r\nEarly Christmas Day afternoon, we started to Temuco to catch the\r\ntrain back to Santiago. We had one of the four compartments on\r\nthat long steam locomotived train, which arrived in Santiago the\r\nnext morning at 10 a.m.\r\n\r\nWe stepped jauntily into a well worn taxi and started for the\r\nCarrera Hotel when Aura May jumped straight up. Where was her\r\npurse, her passport, over $300 in U.S. currency, about 3,000\r\npesos in Chilean money, the ship tickets to Panama, the flying\r\nmachine tickets to Los Angeles, her hair tinware and other\r\nfeminine goods and wares too numerous to mention? We got the\r\ndriver turned around and back. The train was still standing in\r\nthe shed. I had to watch the baggage to save what we had left.\r\nAura May took off like a teal at Le Pas, Manitoba, five days\r\nafter opening day. She flew past the gate man like he wasn't\r\nthere. Gate men seem to know when women mean business. The last I\r\nsaw, she was headed down the right platform.\r\n\r\nTo me a long time elapsed. . . Then here she came--with the\r\npurse, shoulder sling and all, intact except for a few hundred\r\npesos she, in her gratitude, had scattered to whomsoever would\r\ntake them.\r\n\r\nThe porter had promptly taken the purse to his superior. . . If\r\nyou ever again hear me speak ill of Chilean porters, call my\r\nattention to this item of my experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHIPBOARD TO LIMA\r\n\r\nThe train ride to Valpariso, first down the valley, then over and\r\nthrough mountains took something over three hours. We arrived\r\nshortly after 11 a.m. Grace Line representatives at Santiago had\r\nassured us our ship, the Santa Cecilia, would not sail until 2\r\np.m. or later. On arrival . . . at the accommodation ladder,\r\nthree coated officers said the ship sails at noon. We sailed\r\nalmost immediately, headed for Callao, port city of Lima. We were\r\nfirst going south to San Antonio to pick up some copper, 44 tons\r\n(not gallons) of whiskey and 8 tons of brandy.\r\n\r\nI knew we were to spend New Year's day on shipboard, but didn't\r\nthink it would take that much.\r\n\r\nThis ship accommodates only 50 passengers approximately, and is\r\nmore of a cargo ship than a passenger. Her length is just about\r\n450 feet. The accommodations are excellent.\r\n\r\nThat evening at dinner found us again safely ensconced at the\r\ncaptain's table, only this time it is a table for four, whereas\r\nthe Del Mar accommodates six. Capt. Tierney of San Francisco and\r\nNew York presides.\r\n\r\nWe headed back north. Our first stop was Antofagasta, Chile,\r\nnorth of Valpariso. We arrived in the early morning. We were to\r\ntake on 1,900 tons of Anaconda 99+ percent copper for New York.\r\nIt would take all day. We were to sail at 6 p.m. New Year's eve.\r\nWe were free for the day.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOO MUCH MONEY\r\n\r\nBy miscalculation of some sort we were hundreds of pesos too\r\nmuch. Here was our last chance to get rid of them. Sugar Foot and\r\nI footed it around to the main part of town to buy most anything\r\nworthwhile, small and light, and to mail some letters.\r\n\r\nThe mailing of letters, with reasonable assurance of their\r\narrival at destination, is a real chore. You must go to the post\r\noffice. So far as I know, post offices are always crowded down\r\nhere. In the confusion of a foreign language you must first\r\nselect the correct windows in the correct order, especially if\r\nyou want to register and air mail your letters. If you send by\r\nregular mail, the addressees will be confined to wheel chairs ere\r\nthe arrival of such mail.\r\n\r\nWe looked and looked to spend all those extra pesos. She saw\r\nnothing whatsoever. We did buy the Dec. 26th Latin-American\r\nedition of Time in English for 35 pesos, but that didn't make a\r\ndent in our sheaves of Chilean money.\r\n\r\nThen she had a brilliant idea. \"Tonight is New Year's Eve. Let's\r\nbuy some Chilean champagne and burgundy for the table tonight. We\r\nstill have three more nights on shipboard to use any surplus.\"\r\n\r\nTwo fairly heavy packages and two boys to carry them about solved\r\nour peso problem.\r\n\r\nWell, about 9 p.m. it was announced--just like that--the captain\r\nwas giving a dance and New Year's party.\r\n\r\nNew Year's Day, 1950, our first and only stop was Ilo, Peru,\r\nwhere we took on 47 tons of canned tuna fish. Some five miles\r\nout, going to Ilo, I saw drove after drove of . . . guano birds.\r\nI had seen the snowlike tops of the rocks on shore in the\r\ndistance. Guano is a fertilizer and big business down here. If it\r\nhadn't been for the guano birds there would have been no Grace\r\nLines, now 100 years old.\r\n\r\nMost of the west coast of South America is a desolate place.\r\nMountains of brown bare earth and rock rise and stretch inland,\r\nparallel to the coast. It just never rains. The cold Humboldt\r\nstream sees to that. The sun shines hot, but the air is cold,\r\neven in mid-day. The towns and cities look dusty and worn, like\r\nthe dry sections of the U.S. Lots of adobe-looking buildings. The\r\nwhole country is drier than a rambo apple.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE INQUISITION 'RELIEVED' THE RICH\r\n\r\nWe docked at Callao about 6 a.m. Jan 2 for a week's stay in Lima.\r\n\r\nThe Tagle Torre must have been a sort of Foreign Ministry. It was\r\nbuilt about 1735, as it had tile of that date in the walls. There\r\nis a lot of brown spindled wood in its make-up, both inside and\r\noutside. All about are tremendously large heavy gold leaf\r\nmirrors. A big oil painting of Pizarro, conqueror of Peru, hangs\r\non the wall. Just inside the patio is a monster reared-up lion's\r\nhead with a beam at the top. From this beam scales were suspended\r\nto weigh gold and silver they took from the Indians, or the\r\nsubjects, or both, to send to Spain. Anyway, every thing of value\r\nthat was loose or could be pried loose, went to Spain.\r\n\r\nThe next stop was the Palacio de la Inquisicion. Here is where\r\nthey held the inquisitions. The idea was to \"inquisite\" rich men,\r\nthe richer the better, and the more the \"take\" would be. They\r\nnever let facts or the truth interfere in the least. Not in the\r\nslightest degree. And so they fabricated charges out of thin air\r\nand without element of truth whatsoever, against any man,\r\nprovided he was rich. . . Cut off his head, confiscate his lands,\r\nsell off the Herefords and the old mule team, take their 10\r\npercent \"cut\" and send the balance to Spain. They never fooled\r\nwith poor people. They were like Robin Hood, only far more so.\r\n\r\n\r\nA VISIT TO THE INCA RUINS\r\n\r\nThe city has a museum of Inca civilization and it is a honey.\r\nMany original big long pointed stones with their carvings have\r\nbeen removed from in front of the temples, brought down and set\r\nup here. Big and little stones of very hard structure were worked\r\ninto human heads, dogs, cats and so forth. Mummies, burial sacks,\r\nelaborate and fine fabrics of wearing apparel are everywhere.\r\nThere are thousands of square feet of pottery of every shape, and\r\nstill showing the original delicate colors. It would take weeks\r\nto even take a rather hurried look at the things that museum\r\ncontains. Incas were a great and cultured people.\r\n\r\nThe closest ruins to Lima are the Pachacamac ruins, 32 kilometers\r\naway. We drove there one afternoon. High up was what was left of\r\nthe Temple to the Sun. They are always on the highest ground as\r\nthe sun cut more of a figure with the Incas than anything else. .\r\n. We drove through the narrow streets of the town, with the stone\r\nwalls of the stores or houses rising high above us on either side\r\nas far as cars were permitted, or could go, almost to the walls.\r\nThere was our temple in a pretty bad condition of decay. These\r\nruins had long been sacked. Part of the findings was in the\r\nmuseum I told you about. The crumbling walls and stairways and\r\nmoats(?) were of stone carefully and symmetrically made and laid.\r\n\r\nThe main stairway would allow five or six to go abreast. It had\r\nsharp angles every so often, and high walls, the better to\r\nprotect and defend in case of attack, probably. Higher up it had\r\nno walls, just steps after steps and paths always leading higher.\r\nWe got to the top-acres of it. Sand and ruins.\r\n\r\nOver toward \"town,\" and to one side and much lower were the ruins\r\nof the Temple to the Moon. It is being restored. . .You can see\r\nthe original round wooden poles in perfect preservation. It never\r\nrains. But there is so much restoration there is little original\r\nleft. Inside the temple is the original square bath(?) made good\r\nand tight of shaped stone. It holds muddy water with fish\r\nflopping now and then.\r\n\r\nI suggested driving to the big Inca ruins--about like I'd suggest\r\ndriving to Shawnee Mound near Wingate--but it is considerably\r\nover 1,000 kilometers from here, eight or nine thousand feet up\r\nin the mountains toward Bolivia. You either take a train, which\r\nis a very hard ride, or go by plane. In any event, it takes about\r\na week if you want to see any considerable part of the ruins--\r\nthere is something about plane schedules that interferes. And so,\r\nI shall never get to see the great big Inca ruins.\r\n\r\nWe were introduced to a young lady who was born right at the big\r\nInca ruins. This young lady, who has lived here since she was\r\nseven, has a father who manufactures some kind of the finest of\r\nall fine wools, I think up there at the ruins. Anyway, he goes\r\nback and forth about every 15 days. Our young lady herself has\r\nfound some minor pieces of Inca stuff. Her father has found many.\r\nAnd her grandpa got pretty well off finding and peddling Inca\r\nstuff, like Mutiny's Grandpa Wells did making and peddling wheat\r\nfans at black market prices.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTREET NOISES AND GAMES\r\n\r\nOur \"fleet\" of rooms is the noisiest place in town. And that is\r\nsaying something. One night long after midnight I sat at one of\r\nthese windows in my sleeping outfit looking at the crowd (yes, a\r\ncrowd), thinking and trying to count the different noises. I was\r\nalso thinking about my creditors, and how I was now getting\r\ncloser and closer to them, and sooner or later, I'd have to face\r\nthem. Well, what I have remaining in money value is getting\r\npretty low. As to the noises, I got up to 14 but there are lots\r\nmore than that. The honks, street cars and newsboys drown out the\r\nculls and low grade noises.\r\n\r\nAs Aura May has disappeared more and more from her father's side,\r\nhe has ventured more and more in the marts of trade and commerce.\r\nAbout the first venture here was into the banana situation. I had\r\nseen push carts of fruit everywhere. Close observation, at a\r\ndiscreet distance, disclosed customers bought, peeled and ate the\r\nfruit and then dropped the peels in a receptacle on the cart. I\r\ncould do that. I did.\r\n\r\nLightning calculation disclosed I was paying about two cents\r\nAmerican each for the biggest ones. A young Indian had preceded\r\nme. I offered him one. He accepted. Word got over the grape vine.\r\nMy clientele increased, and there we stood blithely peeling and\r\neating and aiming at the waste basket. Aura May would have been\r\nashamed for me. When a client missed, I cut him off the list.\r\nThey caught onto that easily although no English was spoken\r\nexcept by me. The adventure cost me a full 90 cents. Try having\r\nfun buying 90 cents worth of bananas back home.\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE CROSSES ABOUND\r\n\r\nThe Grace Line decided to sail the Santa Margarita a day early\r\n(Jan. 9). That can be accounted for in that these ships are for\r\ncargo first, and secondarily for passengers. We sailed at 8 p.m.\r\npromptly. No, my friends. We are not at the captain's table, but\r\nwe are doing our level best.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion to date, the Southern Cross is among the most\r\noverestimated sights down this way. Counting all three ships, I\r\nhave been shown four or five Southern Crosses, all different, and\r\nat least a pair of False Crosses. From our patio outside the\r\nFrench doors of the hotel in Buenos Aires, I had picked out what\r\nI thought was the real thing, and was pretty well satisfied. Now\r\nI'm not so sure.\r\n\r\nLast night, for instance, I was out alone and had selected my\r\nSouthern Cross for the evening. . . Along came one of the seamen\r\nand I asked him to show me the Southern Cross. He said, \"It is\r\nbelow the horizon now. It might be visible just before daylight.\"\r\n\r\nToday the sea was calm and it is that way tonight. Today, by Act\r\nof Providence I won a shuffleboard game from the steward. That is\r\nabout the first since the man with heart trouble who voted for\r\nGarfield defaulted to me off Brazil somewhere.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Paita, Peru, Jan. 11, and anchored off shore about\r\na half mile in 160 feet of water. We began loading from a sizable\r\nship bearing the U.S. flag, named Washington Star, 40 tons of\r\ndecapitated frozen tuna, weighing 20 to 60 pounds each, and\r\ncotton from the interior. Around us are row boats peddling\r\nbananas, mangos, alligator pears, wool blankets, silverware,\r\nleather boots, and \"authentic Inca relics made down the coast,\"\r\nthe owner of the Washington Star tells me. Some of the \"art\"\r\nfigures are not to be found in D.A.R. collections. Two New Jersey\r\ndoctors bought out the entire stock.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHIP'S WHISTLE MARKS CROSSING OF EQUATOR\r\n\r\nAt Sea\r\nJanuary 13, 1950\r\n\r\nWe are just now crossing the Equator northbound. One long blast\r\nannounced our crossing. The temperature of the sea water is 78\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\nThe 40-mile trip \"up the river\" to Guayaquil, principal port of\r\nEcuador, was made in a Grace Line yacht, Santa Rosita, formerly a\r\nsubmarine chaser powered by a General Motors diesel capable of 27\r\nknots. She is fast. She has to be. The Guayas River is not only\r\nfast but seems to cover about all outdoors hereabout. It takes\r\npower to buck the river's current. And when the tide is running\r\nout it takes still more power.\r\n\r\nGuayaquil is a pretty rusty looking city to me. The population is\r\nabout 250,000. The rain had stopped before our arrival. The day\r\nwas cloudy, but it was very, very hot and humid nonetheless. The\r\ntown was full of pushcart and sidewalk salesmen, all sorts of\r\noutdoor food sales and the ever-present Coca Cola. Our hats are\r\noff to the Coca Cola people. Perhaps in only one or two places in\r\nfar south Chile were we without the jurisdiction of a \"refreshing\r\npause.\"\r\n\r\nHere were bananas and pineapples galore. A vendor would take an\r\n18 to 20-inch pineapple by the stalk, pare off the outer shell\r\nquite deftly, slice it crosswise, and sell it by the slice at the\r\nend of a long sharp butcher knife. I don't know the price,\r\nprobably two slices for a cent. Foreigners are told to lay off\r\nfood here on the streets.\r\n\r\nPractically all shops and stores are open air affairs. You just\r\nwalk in and there you are among the dry goods. All have more or\r\nless useless trinkets. The small rooms are crowded to\r\nsuffocation, with no room to turn around in. Panama hats are a\r\nstaple. . . On the other hand, all shopkeepers and salesmen were\r\ncourteous, attentive and tried to help. No high pressure\r\nsalesmanship anywhere as you and I know it.\r\n\r\nIn one shop, a woman was carefully watching me. I thought it was\r\nto keep me from filching one or more articles. But no. She\r\nfinally had the audacity to touch me lightly where the old wallet\r\nshould be, and the proprietor spoke up, \"My wife wants to know if\r\nthe senor will tell us where he got his suit of clothes, and how\r\nmuch he paid for it?\" Seeing my chance to try to repay Haspel,\r\nthe maker, who had gone to the trouble to send several different\r\nstyles to the store across the street from the Roosevelt Hotel in\r\nNew Orleans, I peeled off my coat and wrote down everything in\r\nthe label except the number of the patent. And so, Messrs. Haspel\r\nup there in New Orleans, if a prepaid order comes from Guayaquil\r\nat the retail price of $22.50, please remember I am your\r\n\"drummer\" without portfolio and that I am not adverse to an\r\nunreasonable commission.\r\n\r\nComing back down the river to the ship, the passengers got into a\r\ngeneral discussion of what they had seen and what they enjoyed.\r\nSome liked one thing and some another. But the consensus seemed\r\nto center on the beautiful, graceful and elaborate marble\r\ntombstones and mausoleums at the cemetery. So next time when in\r\nGuayaquil, go out and have a look at its No. 1 attraction.\r\n\r\nOf the present passenger list, one of the most interesting to me\r\nis a piano playing timber buyer, or let us say, a timber buying\r\npiano player. I have seen a great many piano players and lots of\r\ntimber buyers in my time, but this, I think, is the first\r\ncombination of the two professions in any one man I have had the\r\ngood fortune to encounter. The load he carries must be Herculean.\r\nAt one time I was a piano player. That was after father and I\r\ndecided the life of a pool expert was not the life for me. At the\r\nzenith of my interpretation and rending of the masters I was also\r\nenrolled in college, but even my best friends on the faculty were\r\nunanimous in agreeing I was not both a student and a piano\r\nplayer.\r\n\r\nMy new friend buys balsa by the ship load and sends it to the\r\nU.S. and England. We talked about walnut, oak, mahogany and then\r\nsome Brazil and South American heavy woods. He got red oak mixed\r\nup with California redwood. We got that straightened out. Some\r\nenterprising Californians had inveigled him into buying some big\r\nred oak (redwood) wine casks and selling them to Chilean\r\nvintners. He got run out of Chile for that. \"Baad taazt. No\r\ngoot.\"\r\n\r\nI finally worked out his pedigree. He was a Czech. A real\r\npianist, he had played in Prague, Zurich, Vienna and all around.\r\nWhen World War II started, he started looking for a new home. He\r\nbecame a refugee and finally wound up in Guayaquil, where he\r\nexpected to teach piano. That was optimism supreme.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOFFEE BY THE TON, NOT CUPFUL\r\n\r\nBuenaventura, Colombia\r\nJan. 14, 15, 16, 1950\r\n\r\nWe have gone into the coffee business in a rather big way. We are\r\nto take on 43,000 bags, about 150 pounds to the bag. That makes\r\nover 3,200 tons, or more than enough to run Margaret and Frances\r\nover Labor Day.\r\n\r\nThis town has perhaps 30,000 population. Some tell me it has\r\n65,000, some as low as 10,000. You guess. I went around into\r\ntown. It is about like Guayaquil on a smaller scale. A native who\r\nis employed by Grace Line told me he was half Indian--his mother\r\na full-blooded Indian--I don't know what the other half is.\r\nColombia, according to him, is 60 percent Negro and 10 percent\r\nwhite. Spanish is the language.\r\n\r\nIt happened here in Buenaventura, of all places, and on\r\nshipboard. Something was said about Greencastle, Ind. A young\r\nMrs. Burt and her husband were returning to the states after six\r\nyears with the Kennicott Copper Co. in Chile. Mrs. Burt heard the\r\nremark and said her father and mother were both born in or near\r\nGreencastle. His name was Jack Reeves. He taught in the grade\r\nschool in Greencastle. His mother was a Schafer. We knew her\r\nuncle, Frank Schafer.\r\n\r\nWe are tardy. We were to have sailed last evening (Sunday) at 6,\r\nthen 9 p.m., then 6 a.m. today, then 9 a.m. The reason for the\r\ndelay was too much coffee to load--and rain. I am told it rains\r\nhere every day and that the annual rainfall is 360 odd inches.\r\n\r\nWe got away at 10 a.m. We are now on the high seas headed for\r\nwhere the Pacific discovered Balboa.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOT TIMES IN THE CANAL ZONE\r\n\r\nCanal Zone Jan. 18-21, 1950\r\nTo The Graphic,\r\nGreencastle, Ind.\r\n\r\nThe ride to the Canal Zone was uneventful. Enroute, the question\r\narose whether to stay with the ship and ride through the locks\r\nand canal to the east side to Cristobal, or to get off at Balboa\r\nand hunt our way to the Tivoli Hotel, as originally planned.\r\n\r\nTwo New Jersey doctors and their wives, the timber buying piano\r\nplayer and his wife and some of the ship's officers advised\r\nstaying with the ship and then coming back here by train or bus,\r\nas suited best. Mr. and Mrs. Burt (nee Reeves) were also for\r\nsticking with the ship. All the women were going shopping on the\r\nAtlantic side for linens, ivory and oriental silks, etc. \"at\r\nwonderful prices\" (and they were--Tiffany prices). Then after\r\ndinner everybody was to go to a night club the two doctors' wives\r\nknew about. The ship's officers were ignored as to sailing time\r\nand matters of other unimportance to Grace Line stockholders.\r\n\r\nWe reversed ourselves and stayed with the ship.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE ATLANTIC BY SHIP\r\n\r\nI shall not try to describe the feats of engineering the building\r\nof the Panama Canal involved: Ridding the place of mosquitoes and\r\nmalaria; damming the outlet of a river so the mean level of the\r\nnew, partly man-made lake would be about 87 feet above the\r\nAtlantic and Pacific Oceans; making cuts of 100 feet or more in\r\nsolid rock; dredging the channel so our ship drawing almost 30\r\nfeet could steam through.\r\n\r\nThree giant locks on the Pacific side lifted us almost 30 feet\r\nper lock, so at the third lock we could sail out into first a\r\nwinding canal and then into that tremendous lake whose new level\r\nleft thousands of islands of its former jungle hill tops in size\r\nall the way from a few square feet to hundreds and probably\r\nthousands of acres. Studded all along were thousands of dead bare\r\ntree trunks and forks still sticking up out of the water, and\r\nsome of those trees went by us not any too far off.\r\n\r\nEntering an approach to the first lock, six electric \"mules\"\r\n(three on each side) would take hold of us by heavy wire cables,\r\nget us midway from the sides of the giant cement walls. We would\r\ncreep along into the lock proper. There we were, way down there\r\nbelow the surface of the lock, with a monster set of double steel\r\ndoors ahead barring our further progress. Another pair of steel\r\ndoors would close behind us. No way to get out. Then the water\r\nbelow started bubbling and we started rising.\r\n\r\nThe way that lock filled with water was a marvel. All the\r\nBaptists in the Southern jurisdiction pumping simultaneously\r\nwouldn't have raised us the first foot in an hour. A young fellow\r\nstanding at the rail with me said it took eight or 10 minutes\r\nand, after a rapid mental calculation, three million cubic feet\r\nof water. I made it 20 minutes and three billion cubic feet of\r\nwater. The young man said he worked at the locks. Let's give him\r\nthe benefit. So when I get home don't come bringing me a lot of\r\nauthentic figures.\r\n\r\nWe got out into the canal and on into the lake and to the\r\nAtlantic locks, where the process was reversed and we were\r\nlowered about 87 feet. We docked after 7 p.m. We had started in\r\nabout 9:30 a.m.\r\n\r\nNow, for my advice. Go through it once by all means. Then never\r\nrepeat. It becomes very monotonous and very hot. At times we only\r\ncrept. The high temperature yesterday was 89. The low last night\r\n77.\r\n\r\nWe went down the gang plank alone and unattended and into the\r\nearly night and the arms of customs. He slapped on five blobs of\r\nglue, five stickers at the few remaining places for stickers and\r\nadded five banker's initials and pronounced us pure and\r\nundefiled.\r\n\r\nA Grace Line representative called and made a reservation for us\r\nat the Washington Hotel. An eager taxi cab driver loaded us and\r\noff we went.\r\n\r\nAll along I had been amazed at the size of the linen in South\r\nAmerican hotel rooms. Some bath towels were as long as I was. At\r\nthe Washington Hotel we got out of the 5x6 foot bath towel area.\r\nThe cotton manufacturers hereabouts must have lost control over\r\nthe Legislature.\r\n\r\nWe hied ourselves to the shopping rendezvous, with Aura May in\r\nthe lead. With true feminine instinct and bird dog accuracy she\r\nnever faltered a step as we hotfooted it down to the \"shopping\r\ndistrict\" of a strange town. She said, \"They should be right\r\nalong about here.\" And sure enough, there, three doors on down,\r\nthey were--every one of them--the two doctors' wives buried under\r\nthe two biggest tablecloths. . .\r\n\r\nTrading slowed down. The ship's passengers went back to stow\r\npackages and get ready to night club. They were to come to the\r\nWashington and pick up A.M. Nothing was said about me. They never\r\ncame. The Santa Margarita, faithful to the winds of commerce,\r\nsailed at midnight.\r\n\r\nThe night before we had been put to sleep by the gentle roll of\r\nthe Pacific. That night we went to sleep with the Atlantic\r\nbeating at the foundations of our hotel--almost.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PACIFIC BY RAIL\r\n\r\nI knew the general manager of the Panama Railway. Met him through\r\na college friend. . . The railroad people gave us passes. They\r\nwould send the railroad \"jitney\" to our hotel to pick up the\r\nbaggage and us to catch the 12 o'clock train for Balboa. They\r\nwould have a van at Balboa to take us to the Tivoli hotel.\r\n\r\nThe train ride of 30 miles took about one and a quarter hours--\r\ndiesel power. We came first class. The right-of-way was bound by\r\nwild banana, reed and semi-jungle. The road had a good many\r\nbridges, cuts, curves, considerable grade and evidently cost a\r\ngood deal of money. No featherbedding, I was told, like our roads\r\nunfortunately have.\r\n\r\nWe stepped off the train at Balboa and into a car chauffeured by\r\na cap with three letters on it; drove four or five blocks and\r\nwhen we got out at the Hotel Tivoli we were in Ancon. And right\r\ndown there a block at the foot of the hill is Panama City--the\r\nrelatively new Panama.\r\n\r\nWhere oh where have our two-letter corporation guardians gone?\r\nThose alleged evaders of the anti-trust laws, who have so\r\nfaithfully shepherded us these thousands of miles through the\r\nmazes of Portuguese and Spanish gyrations and possible\r\nmalefactions?\r\n\r\nWe registered and A.M. asked for mail. There was none.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Haven't we had a reservation here for two months?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\"\r\n\r\nLater I came down and went through the same procedure with\r\nanother man, with the same results. Not satisfied, I tackled\r\nanother clerk. He went through the books. Yes, we had had a\r\nreservation, but hadn't shown up the proper day. \"Any mail?\" He\r\nrummaged around and threw out a handful, all but one for A.M., .\r\n. . also a card noting we had not arrived as per schedule and if\r\nwe should arrive later to call a certain number.\r\n\r\nWe did. He was the faithful manager of one of our two faithful\r\nconservators. He came around and took us sight-seeing: Through\r\nthe slums, good residential sections, up and down narrow crowded\r\none-way streets and the Broadway of Panama (Fifth Avenue) past\r\nthe Oriental stores.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUINS OF OLD PANAMA\r\n\r\nHe took us out to the ruins of old Panama--the original Panama.\r\nIt is on a bluff seven or eight miles up the Pacific to the left\r\nof present Panama. The monks who laid it out had an eye to\r\nsafety. Up there the Pacific deepens very slowly from the shore.\r\nThe bottom is mud and a sort of quicksand. You can drag one leg\r\nafter another out nearly a half mile before you get over your\r\nhead. Invasion ships would have to anchor a long way out, and\r\nthat would give the town more time to get ready for the assault.\r\nOn each side and in back was impenetrable jungle.\r\n\r\nIn about 1560 they built a wooden church. It burned down. They\r\nbuilt another and it burned. Then they really built a church--of\r\nstone. The walls of one part of that church still stand, say 60\r\nfeet high. Then a convent. Things were really going good. The\r\ntown prospered and everybody was safe.\r\n\r\nIn 100 years or so here comes Henry Morgan. He really knew how to\r\nset a fire. He pillaged, killed, sacked and burned things--\r\ncompletely. He did such a complete job the monks lost heart and\r\ncame to the present Panama and set out building again.\r\n\r\nOld Panama is a shambles. Pieces of stone wall stand out\r\neverywhere, as do crumbled stone pillars of foundations. All is\r\ndesolation. The ruins, I am told, extend far back into the\r\npresent jungle. Nobody seems to care to preserve what is left. We\r\ndrove the car into the convent. There were the square holes where\r\nfloor supports of wooden beams used to enter.\r\n\r\nWe don't particularly like this hotel. It is a mammoth sort of a\r\nwooden building. Big rooms, high ceiling, big doors, big windows,\r\nbig halls, big slow elevator, big bathrooms, all of wood and\r\neverything could stand painting. Somehow I feel if the termites\r\nwould let go hands, the place would crumble. We are on the third\r\nfloor and I hope no Henry Morgan comes along.\r\n\r\nSightseeing, we passed government buildings, government\r\ntile-roofed homes for canal workers and PXs. Whenever you see\r\ngovernment property you see order and paint. You fellers up there\r\nare paying for it.\r\n\r\nWe went to the San Jose Church, one of the oldest in Panama. It\r\ncontains the gold altar the priests painted black on the occasion\r\nof an invasion. The invaders thought it had no value and left it\r\nalone. It looked to me like it had a lot of gold leaf somebody\r\nhad overlooked intentionally.\r\n\r\nWe went to where \"Congress\" was in session. Senators in white\r\nsuits had their heads stuck out windows and were conversing in\r\nlow important tones. Inside, one Senator was gesticulating and\r\nyelling at the top of his voice how he had saved and now was\r\nagain saving the glorious country of Panama from bankruptcy and\r\nruin. Our host, who knew heated Spanish, said the oratory had\r\nsomething to do with another sizable raise in salary.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUNTING FOR SHOE LACES\r\n\r\nOur last day, A.M. decided to do some shopping on foot and by\r\nherself. I made final preparations for our flight early in the\r\nmorning to Mexico City. This done, I also went out on my own but\r\nnot for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nI had the National City Bank of New York branch bank in mind as\r\none of my objectives; a bowl of Yardley's shaving soap as\r\nanother; a shoe shine and a pair of shoe laces as two others. It\r\nis remarkable how many stores you can get into with good grace\r\nwith that combination, if you are always careful to ask for the\r\nthing you feel sure they don't have. That opens the way\r\ngracefully for a pleasant conversation.\r\n\r\nI gained friendly entrance to a world of places looking for the\r\nshaving soap, before I unexpectedly found it. That left the bank\r\nand the shoe laces to attain. The bank was a certainty, but in\r\ndue time I actually became worried about brown shoe laces. I had\r\nasked in vain at too many places. Then all of a sudden my\r\ntroubles were over--on ahead half a block was a sign, Florsheim\r\nShoes.\r\n\r\nI went to about where I thought shoe laces were located and asked\r\nthe man for a pair of brown shoe laces. He answered he had none.\r\nHe had black and white laces, but no browns. Brown shoes were\r\noutdated and always had been outdated. They were a thing a man of\r\ntoday was not using. The truth, so help me.\r\n\r\nShortly thereafter, still shoelaceless, I came to the National\r\nCity branch, went in, introduced myself as a banker representing\r\na bank that had had an account with the parent bank for over 50\r\nyears. The manager, a Mr. Cramer, was originally from Vermont,\r\nand therefore a hard man to crack, but the 50 years and the brown\r\nshoe lace trouble did the trick. He took me to lunch at the Union\r\nClub, a pretty nifty club quite near his bank and right against\r\nthe Pacific Ocean. When we arrived the tide was out and the\r\ncity's big cement sewer tiles were exposed for a quarter of a\r\nmile out. After lunch, which was delayed by three or four\r\ndifferent kinds of rum, the rum or something had pulled the tide\r\nin and all the tiles were covered with water.\r\n\r\nWe got the brown shoe laces at a cobbler's shop, but they did\r\nhave to dig under a big pile of old scrap leather and shoe shop\r\nsaw dust to get them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLD SPANISH TRAIL\r\n\r\nIn late mid-afternoon our big corporation host and his wife came\r\nto take us to one of the nearby jungles about 20 miles out. Not\r\nbig like the Brazilian jungles, but thick as a new bride's potato\r\npeelings. The new highway now crosses the old Spanish Trail,\r\nwhich is in a part of that jungle. The Trail was laid out to\r\ncross the isthmus to get to the Atlantic. And there it was, round\r\nrocks and all. Not in good repair, of course, but a trace of what\r\nit once was.\r\n\r\nThe Trail was made for a purpose. The Spaniards would go down to\r\nPeru and rob the Incas. Then they would make slaves of some of\r\nthem and bring them and the gold and other loot by ship to\r\nPanama. Then make the slaves carry the booty over that Trail to\r\nPuerto Bello on the Atlantic side, where the king's\r\nrepresentatives would take their \"cut\". The balance went to\r\nSpain, as I have heretofore told you.\r\n\r\nOur host wanted us to try some coconut water when we got back to\r\ntown. The proprietor took two green coconuts out of the box, cut\r\nthe ends off of each with a hatchet, reamed out a core into the\r\nhollow inside where the water is, set the nuts on the table and\r\nstuck soda water straws in the holes. The rest was up to us. . .\r\nIt isn't particularly bad. There isn't much taste to it. Sort of\r\ninsipid, like water in southwest Kansas in summer.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEST POINT CONNECTION\r\n\r\nOur host took us to his home. I knew all along there was a good\r\ndeal to this young fellow. His conversation was too bright and\r\nkeen. His wit was too original, and to the point. . . But the\r\nhouse! Holy Nellie, what a house!! I presume it was his father's.\r\nHowever that may be, our host and his wife also lived there.\r\nWrought iron grillwork, tile floors, furniture, rugs, silver and\r\nchina tableware, oil paintings.\r\n\r\nI shall try to describe just one item--a heavy, closely and\r\nbeautifully woven wool rug that hung on one of the big walls. It\r\nhad to be about 20x14 or 16 feet, and perhaps two inches thick.\r\nIt was a reproduction of the Seal of West Point--eagle, arrows,\r\ncolors and all. The names of the father and three boys were woven\r\nin the rug. It was made by Ecuador Indians who had only a post\r\ncard to guide them, together with dimensions supplied by the\r\nfather. Those Indians could not read and were otherwise as\r\nprimitive as could be. But they knew how to weave and they knew\r\ntheir colors and keen eyes gave them the proportions.\r\n\r\nLet me give you a part of the fellow's pedigree, verified by a\r\nbanker of good repute--if the latter is possible. He, his two\r\nbrothers and his father are all graduates of West Point. His\r\nfather was ambassador to the United States from Ecuador. And his\r\npaternal grandfather was a former president of the Republic of\r\nEcuador.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HAZARDS OF FLIGHT\r\n\r\nYesterday (Jan. 21) we flew from Panama City. It took all day.\r\nThe going was bad enough all along, but over high ridges and\r\nmountains or deep valleys it overdid things way too far. Somebody\r\nsaid wind currents caused it.\r\n\r\nThen too, I saw what I thought were three loose screws sticking\r\nup on the wing on my side. I watched them closely, what time I\r\nwasn't getting things back level or watching that infernal\r\nelectric sign up ahead that advised, \"Tighten seat belt.\" It was\r\nthe only honest thing about the ship--it never overstated.\r\n\r\nThe loose screws worried me considerably, so I went over and\r\nlooked at the other wing, but they had them over there too. All\r\nlooked of the same size, spaced alike, and equally rusted, so I\r\ndidn't move over. One side was as good as the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUM FOR THE EARS\r\n\r\nGoing up and coming down they gave us gum to chew. In a place\r\nsuch as I was, I always obeyed the stewardess or anybody in a\r\nblue suit and white cap. Chewing gum would, along with yawning,\r\nkeep our ears from stopping up--maybe. Something went wrong. All\r\nof a sudden it came to me that everything had become absolutely\r\nquiet, like walking around in new snow. I listened for the roar\r\nof the motors. They had stopped. We were in a pickle. I turned to\r\nAura May and said something, but I couldn't hear what I said.\r\n\r\nIt took a lot of gum chewing, yawning and calisthenics at the\r\nnext stop to get partially unstopped. And my jaws are tired and\r\nsore. I'm not a regular gum-chewer.\r\n\r\nWe got off the ground early in the morning, circled over Panama\r\nCity and the ocean, then back over land and a densely forested\r\narea. The tree tops looked like closely packed mushroom buttons,\r\nonly the colors were varying shades of green. I couldn't see a\r\nfield, road or house, and only rarely a stream.\r\n\r\nOur first stop was at Managua, capital of Nicaragua. We went over\r\nLake Nicaragua, a big lake.\r\n\r\nWe set down next at San Salvador. We approached it over\r\ncomparatively level terrain. Thatched houses and cultivated\r\nfields were thick. The airport was as neat and nice as I have\r\nseen. It served coffee and shoeshines free. But I almost got\r\ncaught.\r\n\r\nAlligator bags are the vogue there. Aura May rather liked one.\r\nJust to test the man I asked the price. To my amazement he said\r\n$18. I said too much. He said, \"What you give?\" I said, $10.\r\nBefore it was over, he was down to $12.50 and I was getting\r\npanicky. He was too close. I shook my head. He shook his. I left\r\nwithout looking back and never did go around that part of the\r\nbuilding thereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\nPALACE AND MARKET\r\n\r\nWe next set down at Guatemala, with a two and a half hour wait.\r\nWe hired a taxi and went to town. Enroute we passed two small\r\ncoffee plantations. The driver told us Guatemala coffee was the\r\nfinest in the world. They said the same thing at Santos and\r\neverywhere else, particularly Buenaventura and its mocha coffee.\r\n\r\nWe went to the presidential palace and got in. It's a fine place\r\nfor the size and wealth of the country. Particularly the tile and\r\nstained glass murals depicting historical scenes of Guatemala.\r\nSplendid features were enormous glass chandeliers with prismatic\r\nglass tassels, and mahogany woodwork and floors of the banquet\r\nand reception rooms. The outside walls and windows had\r\nconsiderable bullet marks depicting the various revolutions the\r\ncountry had undergone. Also something to see is the one-piece\r\ntable-top, sides, lower shelf and legs, with its intricate\r\ncarvings, behind which the dictator of the day presides,\r\nlistening to the wham of bullets outside.\r\n\r\nThe hillside Indian market took my eye. I yelled, \"Whoa,\" and\r\njumped out and got right in among them--kids, dogs, squatting\r\nwomen, tied-up hens, herbs, overripe bananas and other fruits,\r\nbaskets, blankets, dolls, piles of yams, some pretty bony meats\r\nand a world of other things. To progress, you had to step over,\r\nthrough or around whatever was in front of you. I was making fair\r\nprogress when our wild-eyed driver caught up and told me it was\r\nno place for me to be. My English caught the ear of a nearby\r\nfellow who had lost his wife and kid somewhere in the market. He\r\nwas a House of God missionary from near Abilene, Texas, and had\r\nbeen down almost a month. We hit it up fine. The driver shrugged\r\nhis shoulders and followed along. For my part, I had a pretty\r\ngood time. The trip cost me five dimes and three nickels. I kept\r\nthe quarter, had a good following, and everybody was on my side\r\nexcept the driver.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUST SIGN ON THE LINE\r\n\r\nAt the airport I ran into more trouble. The manager was paging me\r\nin an accent I never heard before. Aura May caught it. He told me\r\na bottle of whiskey had broken in one of our bags and had leaked\r\nall over everything near. They didn't know what damage had been\r\ndone or how I had broken the bottle.\r\n\r\n\"How I had broken the bottle?\" I said. \"Besides, I had no whiskey\r\nin any bag. Are you sure it was whiskey? Where is the bag?\"\r\n\r\n\"It smells like whiskey,\" he said. \"The bag has been transferred\r\nto the Mexico City plane. It is about time to leave. We admit the\r\nliability. We have made out the form. Just sign here.\"\r\n\r\n\"What amount did you fill in for the damage?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"We left that blank to fill in later. We will do that for you.\"\r\n\r\nWe finally agreed he would radio their representative in Mexico\r\nCity, and when we go through customs there we could all have a\r\nlook.\r\n\r\nUp from Guatemala we ran into higher and higher mountains and\r\nrougher and rougher land below. In time, Mt. Popocatepetl,\r\n17,500-odd feet high, loomed in the distance, as did Mt.\r\nIxtaccihuatl, a trifle lower. Now, you don't pass old Popo like\r\nyou do an unattended traffic light on a bright Sunday morning.\r\nShe stays in sight for a long time.\r\n\r\nWe grounded just before dark. In customs we opened up for all to\r\nsee and smell. People would go by, catch a whiff and raise their\r\neyes just like they were experiencing a sensation of \"My Sin\"\r\ntoilet water. It was a broken bottle of Chilean wine some\r\nstranger had put in the wrong bag--maybe.\r\n\r\nYears ago, I learned something. Our railroads never kill anything\r\nexcept thoroughbred stock. That bottle of wine was nestled inside\r\nmy brand new tuxedo, next to my brown suit and one of the Haspel\r\ntropicals and two or three of Aura May's dresses. Kindly tell\r\nCentral Insurance Agency.\r\n\r\n\r\nBACK TO \"COLD\" WEATHER\r\n\r\nSaturday, we flew say 1,500 miles here from intense heat to\r\ncomparative cold. We are 7,500 feet up. This room in the Geneva\r\nHotel is none too hot. It has heat of course, but they don't turn\r\nit on enough. Electricity is rationed or something.\r\n\r\nToday, Sunday, Aura May went to see the people she lived with\r\nwhen in school here three or four years ago, and they had quite a\r\nreunion. These Mexicans are that way if they like you.\r\n\r\nI hunted up another native market and had another good time. Two\r\nor three blocks of sidewalk have been partly boxed in with old\r\ncorrugated metal roofing and partly left open to walk along. Hot\r\ntamales, fruits of all kinds, women cooking rather dirty looking\r\nmeats and foods over rusted, greasy home made charcoal burners. I\r\nsaw sheep heads with the wool on at one place and stood around to\r\nlearn what disposition of them was being made, but no customers\r\ncame along.\r\n\r\nWe had been warned to drink no water or milk and to eat nothing\r\nlike lettuce or strawberries, in fact to eat nothing that does\r\nnot have a peeling on it. Anything out of a corked bottle is all\r\nright.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSIDER TOUR OF MEXICO CITY\r\n\r\nTo The Graphic,\r\nGreencastle, Ind.\r\n\r\nIn Mexico City, we thought our string of rare good fortune had at\r\nlast run out. But no. On Monday morning the manager of one of\r\nthose heartwarming two corporations called to say he had just\r\nreturned to town, and that a car and driver were at our disposal\r\nday and night for the one-week period of our stay.\r\n\r\nThat was the third time I had heard the combination \"day and\r\nnight\" inserted in the conversation. It made me wonder whether\r\nsome of my predecessors--old buzzards in their late 30s like me--\r\nhad come down and vainly attempted to rejuvenate their youth with\r\na pop gun burst of night life activity, or whether it was just a\r\nLatin American way of expressing an all out attitude toward\r\nguests. I found them a good deal that way as I went along.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRIVER KNOWS HIS WAY AROUND\r\n\r\nThat afternoon our driver showed up--capless and uniformless--but\r\nwhatever he may have lacked in uniform, he made up for in\r\nability, knowledge and intelligence. He was a wonder. He seemed\r\nto know everybody and what their weaknesses were--custodians,\r\npolicemen, lottery ticket vendors, car watchers and parking place\r\nattendants. Known and liked by everybody, he probably hadn't a\r\nsingle enemy in town.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the cap of my shoe and the rest of the shoe had\r\nparted company. Did he know where a shoe sewing machine could be\r\nfound? That may sound trite to you as we were in a city of 3\r\nmillion people, but in Mexico City machines are as rare as bad\r\nwomen in Greencastle. Everything is hand work. All he said was,\r\n\"We go.\" We did, a mile or two. The price was 50 centavos--a\r\ntrifle over five cents in our money.\r\n\r\n\r\n10% OFF ON 60 ROOSTERS\r\n\r\nWe looked around a big jewelry store. I happened to see a little\r\nsterling silver fork, the sort of thing you use to spear out\r\nolives and cherries or jab into canapes. The thing that caught my\r\neye was that on the end of the handle was a rooster--good old\r\nDemocratic stuff. It seems that a rooster in Mexico means\r\nsomething national--at least not political as we know it. I asked\r\nthe saleswoman the price. She told me. I asked how much by the\r\ndozen. She multiplied by 12. Six dozen? She multiplied the last\r\nfigure by six. I said, \"Thank you,\" and turned to go.\r\n\r\nBack at the car, we were talking about the forks and the design\r\non them. Our trusty driver evidently caught the drift, because he\r\nsaid, \"I think I know silver factory, Cheaper. We go?\"\r\n\r\nWe did. How could I pass up a silver factory? There they were by\r\nthe hundreds--roosters and all. Our driver went in with us. The\r\nprice? It was considerably less for one than the other place. How\r\nmuch for a dozen? It was some less than 12 times the price of\r\none. How much for five dozen? Some less than five times the dozen\r\nprice. Fortunately, some people from Evansville came along just\r\nat the right time and I moved off.\r\n\r\nIn due time our faithful driver sidled up and said, \"I get you\r\n10% off your price.\"\r\n\r\nMy main idea had been to see a silver factory, but there is\r\nalways a time to quit bluffing, even though you started out more\r\nor less in fun. I said, \"Go buy them.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so, I have 60 roosters. Even so, they're much cheaper than 60\r\nroosters on the hoof.\r\n\r\nEnrique is the name of our driver. He is a Colombian. Where and\r\nhow and when he acquired his knowledge and information is\r\nprobably a mystery even to his employers. Enrique is a\r\nphilosopher too. His hobbies are art, fine homes and buying\r\nlottery tickets.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHURCHES AND PYRAMIDS\r\n\r\nEnrique is thoroughly up on his churches, and there are lots of\r\nthem in Mexico as well as all South America. He said the Basilica\r\nof Guadelupe was the richest in the New World, and one of the\r\noldest. It is in the old part of town. We arrived during Mass.\r\nHundreds were attending that afternoon. The altar is a massive\r\nstructure, and evidently of tremendous value. In back is a mural\r\nthe Pope gave the church for its success in extending the faith.\r\nEnrique got hold of a boy who unlocked the doors of a big wall\r\ncase and showed us the gold service of the church.\r\n\r\nWe had parked the car at the side. When we left, Enrique gave\r\nsome money to a man, not exactly a policeman, but somehow\r\nconnected. I asked what it was for. He shrugged and said, \"Graft.\r\nIf I had not given him money he would have spotted the car and\r\nthe next time he would have damaged it in some way. These fellows\r\nare bad that way.\"\r\n\r\nWe drove next day to the pyramids--quite a distance from town.\r\nThe temple or shrine to the snake gods is something to see. Made\r\nentirely of stone masonry, the outside is adorned with those\r\nfamous protruding gargoyles, still in a reasonably good state of\r\npreservation. The masonry is excellent. On top was a sacrificial\r\naltar where Enrique told us thousands of human beings, mostly\r\nwomen, were beheaded from time to time to appease the snakes.\r\nTroughs led down and to each side, where two sizable wells at\r\nlast stopped and held the flow of blood.\r\n\r\nThe high stone walls of the fort enclosed an area of a good many\r\nacres. The walls are more or less hollow because the priests\r\nlived inside and thought up new and more vicious ways and means\r\nof torturing a simple people.\r\n\r\nNo one seems to know who built the pyramids, or when. They were\r\nerected prior to the advent of the Aztecs, 1,500 to 3,000 years\r\nago. The Pyramid of the Sun is 200 feet high and big around in\r\nproportion. Its building entailed millions of man hours. The\r\nTemple to the Moon is much lower and smaller, but at that was no\r\nafter school hours chore.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIEVES MARKET, PRIVATE SERENADE\r\n\r\nOne afternoon Enrique suggested he show us some fine homes, but I\r\nsuggested we go out among the Indians and the poorer peoples'\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"Maybe you like to go to the Thieves Market, where they\r\nsell stolen goods and pick your pockets.\" . . . We could drive\r\nslowly, and stop now and then, and see from the car. . .\r\n\r\nThe street was crowded. Everything that wasn't old was shoddy. If\r\nall that stuff had been stolen goods, it would have taken the\r\nentire population months to have actually stolen the articles,\r\nand when they got done the value of the whole thing would have\r\nbeen in the low thousands of dollars. No the Thieves Market in my\r\nopinion is a part of the \"dress\" of Mexico City. The words sound\r\nmysterious and dangerous, and give the tourists a shot in the\r\narm. Still I was glad I had taken Enrique's advice and kept to\r\nthe car. Six or eight dirty hands in my pocket could have left\r\nenough germs to have contaminated everybody west of Stilesville.\r\n\r\nWe also encountered a singer and serenader and his band who\r\nassembled around our car and played for us for five pesos (less\r\nthan 60 cents) a song. We had five fiddles, one cornet, three\r\nwhopping big guitars, two regular size guitars and one mandolin.\r\nI was asked what I wanted. I suggested \"The Fire Scene\" from\r\nWagner or Lilly Pon's latest song, but they didn't know those so\r\nI told them anything purely Mexican. . . It was what I would call\r\na big Carnegie Hall success. We left amid profuse thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREASURED HOMES\r\n\r\nI thought a change might not be a bad idea. We drove into what he\r\nsaid was the finest residential district--very fine and elaborate\r\nhomes. The proportion will not equal that of any American city.\r\nThe proportion of poor and poverty stricken people is high here.\r\nThe most striking feature of these homes to me is the extravagant\r\nuse of wrought iron grillwork in the openings in the walls\r\nsurrounding the premises and the framing of all windows and\r\ngates. The designs are intricate. These homes are built with the\r\nidea of exclusion. It is hard to see the grounds unless a gate or\r\ndoors are left open. Enrique would stop very candidly where there\r\nwas an opening. What we saw was always immaculately kept. Labor\r\nis cheap.\r\n\r\nEnrique saved \"the three finest homes in Mexico\" for last. They\r\nwere really fine homes. And they were big of course. One was\r\nbuilt by a rich Spanish merchant, the other two by politicians,\r\nboth of whom at one time or another had been connected with the\r\nTreasury of Mexico. Quite a coincidence I thought--best two out\r\nof three.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of:\r\nTitle: Epistles from Pap: Letters from the man known as 'The Will\r\nRogers of Indiana'\r\n\r\nAuthor: Andrew E.
