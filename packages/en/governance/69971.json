There is no attempt to treat the subjects\r\nembraced, or rather touched upon, in any historical sequence, but,\r\nby brief hints and random suggestions, to seize the principal and\r\ninteresting features of the country and its institutions, the people\r\nand their characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe comparative method correlated with cause or effect is used in the\r\nchapters on the government and administration, national and cantonal.\r\nMany familiar facts in Swiss history, and experiences had by the United\r\nStates, are introduced to show their relation to and effect upon\r\ncertain political ideas. In fact, all through the Swiss federal polity\r\nand that of the United States run not only parallels of illustration,\r\nbut lines converging to and pointing out essential truths in popular\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nDating from the “Eternal Covenant” of Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden,\r\nconcluded in 1291, under all vicissitudes of government and\r\nconstitution,--with radical varieties of character, occupation,\r\nreligion, language, and descent,--love of liberty and a passionate\r\ndevotion to the republic have characterized the people, with “life,\r\nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness,” the great objects of\r\ngovernment, federal, cantonal, and communal. During this period of six\r\nhundred years the smallest free commonwealth and the oldest federal\r\nrepublic in the world presents a valuable stock of political experience.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult for a stranger to discover all that is remarkable\r\nin any country, and perhaps as hard to treat of so many different\r\nsubjects with such care as to omit nothing that is material. The utmost\r\nendeavor, at least, has been used to be exact, and an effort to give\r\na more complete view of the modern state of the country than has yet\r\nappeared. There is no design in the “Introduction” to write even an\r\nhistorical outline; it is not necessary to the purpose of this work;\r\nbut only to relate such general facts, as to its former state, as may\r\nserve to discover the causes which gave rise and birth to the present\r\nConfederation.\r\n\r\nWhere references to national and local laws or ordinances and leading\r\nhistorical events are necessary, partial repetition has been deemed\r\npreferable to directing the reader to previous citations.\r\n\r\nAs the Swiss, in different Cantons, speak different languages with\r\nseveral distinct idioms, there is necessarily a great diversity of\r\nnomenclature; the aim has been to follow that locally prevalent, and\r\nespecially in the designation of the Cantons by their German, French,\r\nand Italian names.\r\n\r\nThe writer has had frequent recourse to the following authorities:\r\n“The Swiss Confederation,” by Sir Francis Adams and C. D. Cunningham,\r\nLondon; “The Federal Government of Switzerland,” by Bernard Moses, San\r\nFrancisco (these two books are of recent date, supplementing each other\r\nwell, and constitute the only systematic and valuable publication in\r\nEnglish on the constitutional history and public law of Switzerland);\r\nWoolsey’s “Political Science,” Woodrow Wilson’s “The State,” Freeman’s\r\n“History of Federal Government,” May’s “Democracy in Europe,”\r\n“Encyclopædia Britannica,” Reclus’s “The Earth and its Inhabitants,”\r\nfurnish briefer but valuable accounts. Elaborate works in German\r\nand French consulted are Bluntschli’s “Staats und Rechts Geschichte\r\nder Schweiz,” Dubs’s “Das öffentliche Recht der schweizerischen\r\nEidgenossenchaft,” Droz’s “Instruction Civique,” and Magnenat’s “Abrégé\r\nde l’Histoire de la Suisse.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.

They were known as the Rhetians, from\r\nthe name of their hero Rhetus; hence the country about the source of\r\nthe Rhine, embracing the Grisons, is even now called by some, Rhetia.\r\nThe Canton of Schwyz claims to have been peopled by the Cimbrians, who,\r\nleaving their original habitations in Sweden, Norway, and Friesland,\r\nconquered their way over the Rhine to the cities of the Gauls, in the\r\ncountry which is now France. The people of Gaul implored help from\r\nRome; a strong army was sent against them, defeating and driving them\r\ninto the Helvetian mountains. Another tradition says that they were\r\na race of Gaulic Celts, whom some unknown accident had guided from\r\nthe borders of the Rhine and Main to those of the Lake of Geneva,\r\ntheir collective name being Helvetians, after whom the country was\r\nnamed in Roman times. The first authentic mention we find of these\r\npeople, as a nation, is by Julius Cæsar, who, in the first book of his\r\n“Commentaries,” related the war he waged with the Helvetians, who had\r\nmade an irruption into Burgundy during his government in Gaul. He\r\ndefeated them, and reduced the country to the obedience of the Romans,\r\nannexing it to that part of his government which was called Gallia\r\nCeltica. They lived in subjection to the Roman government till that\r\nempire fell. Among the new kingdoms and principalities that were raised\r\nout of the ruins was the kingdom of Burgundy, composed of a Vandal race\r\nfrom the Oder and the Vistula. Helvetia was overrun and made a part of\r\nthis kingdom in the beginning of the fifth century (409 A.D.). Then\r\nfollowed irruptions of Alemanni, Ostrogoths, and Franks. The division\r\nof Switzerland into German- and French-speaking races is doubtless to\r\nbe ascribed to these early settlements of different tribes from Germany\r\nand Gaul. In the sixth century (550 A.D.), the Franks having subjected\r\nthe other two, all Helvetia was united to the crown of France. It was\r\nlost to the kings of France during the ninth century, under the weak\r\nreign of Charles the Fat. About the year 870 there sprang up again\r\ntwo new kingdoms of Burgundy, one called Cis-Jurana and the other\r\nTrans-Jurana; the first, at the end of fifty years, was merged in the\r\nlatter. In this kingdom was comprehended the country of Helvetia, and\r\ncontinued part of it till about 1032, when Rudolph, the third and last\r\nking of Burgundy, dying without children, left all his kingdom to the\r\nEmperor Conrad II., whose successors enjoyed it for two centuries, when\r\nit was broken into several petty sovereignties.\r\n\r\nFeudalism had been rapidly growing up, and, like other parts of Europe,\r\nHelvetia fell under the rule of military chiefs and of powerful bishops\r\nand abbots. A numerous and ancient nobility divided the possession with\r\necclesiastical lords; of the former, conspicuous were the Dukes of\r\nZähringen and Counts of Kyburg, Rapperswyl, and Hapsburg; and of the\r\nlatter, the Bishop of Coire, the Abbot of St. Gallen, and the Abbess\r\nof Seckingen. There is no country whose history better illustrates\r\nthe ambiguous relation, half property and half dominion, in which\r\nterritorial aristocracy under the feudal system stood with respect to\r\ntheir dependants. The power under these princes, to which the country\r\nwas subjected, was so limited that it might properly be said to be\r\nunder their protection rather than their dominion. In the thirteenth\r\ncentury the race of the Dukes of Zähringen became extinct, which made\r\nway for the Counts of Hapsburg to enlarge their authority, being raised\r\nafterwards to the Austrian Duchy, and invested with the imperial\r\ndignity in Germany. The Helvetic people placed themselves under the\r\nprotection of Rudolph of Hapsburg, with permission to send governors or\r\nbailiffs among them. They were governed with mildness while he lived.\r\nHe died, and his son Albert did not tread in his father’s footsteps.\r\nThis was the beginning of the fourteenth century, the memorable period\r\nof Rütli and William Tell. A resolution was taken to form a general\r\ninsurrection in each Canton, in order to surprise and demolish all the\r\ncastles and drive the governors and adherents out of the country. “They\r\njudged that a sovereign unjust towards a vassal, ceased to be himself\r\nprotected by justice, and that it was lawful to employ force against\r\nhim.”[1]\r\n\r\nThe confederates pursued so well the measures agreed on that their\r\nobject was easily accomplished, and with rare examples of moderation.\r\nA few years later, a further attempt was made to bring them under\r\nthe yoke of the empire, when the brave peasants routed the imperial\r\narmy, under Leopold, Duke of Austria, at Morgarten, on the 15th of\r\nNovember, 1315. This victory confirmed the independence of the three\r\noriginal Cantons. Soon afterwards followed the perpetual league of\r\nBrunnen, on December the 9th of the same year; there is at Brunnen this\r\ninscription: “_Hier geschah der erste Bund, Anno 1315, die Grundfeste\r\nder Schweiz_” (“Here was the first perpetual league, the foundation of\r\nSwitzerland”).\r\n\r\nAccording to the Swiss historian, Planta,[2] the Helvetic union, as\r\nfounded by the three forest Cantons, called _Waldstätten_, composed of\r\nSchwyz, Uri, and Unterwalden, bears date from the most remote periods\r\nof their existence, and was framed long before they knew how to commit\r\nit to writing. In 1291 this league was reduced to writing; the first\r\ncovenant is in Latin, and begins, “_In nomine Domini, Amen_,”[3] and\r\nthis form was followed in the several later covenants at Rütli, 1307,\r\nand Brunnen, 1315. Each Canton obligated itself to assist and succor\r\nthe others, with its utmost force, and at its own expense, against\r\nall persons or states that should assault or molest any of them; that\r\nneither of the Cantons should submit to receive any new sovereign\r\nwithout the knowledge and consent of the others; that none should enter\r\ninto any alliance or engagement with any other prince or state without\r\nthe said consent; and that if any difference should arise between any\r\ntwo of these confederated Cantons, the third should be the arbitrator,\r\nand obliged to assist that Canton which submitted to its arbitration\r\nagainst the other that should refuse it. The express purpose of this\r\nleague was for self-defence against all who should attack or trouble\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of each Canton was purely democratic; the supreme\r\npower was vested in the people at large; all males of fourteen years\r\nold in Uri, of fifteen in Schwyz and Unterwalden, having a voice.\r\nThough deputies were chosen to represent the people in the Council of\r\nRegency, and a Landammann, or chief magistrate,[4] was also appointed,\r\nyet the supreme power was exercised by a general assembly held in the\r\nopen air. In 1332 Luzern joined the three Cantons, and thus arose\r\nthe federation of the Four Forest Cantons, _Vierwaldstätten_. Zurich\r\ncame in in 1351, Zug and Glarus in 1352, and Bern in 1353. These eight\r\nCantons continued until 1481, or a hundred and twenty-eight years,\r\nwithout increasing their number, and are distinguished by the name\r\nof the _Eight Old Cantons_. For a long time these Cantons possessed\r\nmany distinctive privileges. This league upheld its independence in\r\n1386 against Duke Leopold III., of Austria, in the battle of Sempach,\r\nwhen the most heroic courage was shown. This resulted in the decree\r\nof Sempach, whereby the eight Cantons agreed to preserve peace among\r\nthemselves; to uphold each other; and in war to unite their banners\r\nagainst the common enemy. The last remnant of ancient Helvetic\r\nterritories in Aargau was wrested in 1417 from Frederic, Count of\r\nTyrol. Though still comprehended within the nominal sovereignty of the\r\nempire, encroachments upon their territory or their political liberties\r\nwere no longer dreaded. They were henceforth free from external control\r\nand from contributions imposed by the Germanic Diet. In 1444 followed\r\nthe defeat of the Dauphin Louis of France at St. Jacob, and the defeat\r\nof the Burgundians at Morat and Nancy in 1477. In 1481 Solothurn and\r\nFreiburg were admitted. The Cantons then bound themselves under a\r\ntreaty effected at Stantz, Canton of Unterwalden, in December of that\r\nyear, to two additional articles:\r\n\r\n1. That all the Cantons oblige themselves to succor one another in the\r\nsupport of the form of government then established in each of them.[5]\r\n\r\n2. That a body of military laws therein referred to should be received\r\nthroughout the whole nation, and the observation of them enjoined.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Maximilian I. determined to force the Swiss to join the\r\nSuabian League; hence resulted the Suabian war, which was concluded\r\nafter the Swiss had gained six victories, by the peace of Basel in\r\n1499. In 1501 Basel and Schaffhausen acceded to the league. In 1512, by\r\nthe Milanese war, the Swiss obtained from Milan the territory which at\r\npresent forms the Canton of Ticino. In 1515, after losing the battle of\r\nMarignano,[6] an advantageous peace was concluded with France, which\r\nwas followed by the first formal alliance with that kingdom in 1521;\r\nand the two countries enjoyed an almost uninterrupted amity for nearly\r\nthree hundred years.\r\n\r\nSuch was the political state of Switzerland in the beginning of the\r\nsixteenth century; it was an independent federal republic, renowned in\r\nwar and distinguished for its ancient political institutions. In the\r\nThirty Years’ War the Confederates maintained a prudent neutrality, and\r\nthe Peace Congress of Münster in 1648, through the mediation of France,\r\nsolemnly acknowledged the complete renunciation of Switzerland’s\r\nnominal allegiance to the German empire. From this time until the\r\noutbreak of the French Revolution, in 1789, the history of Switzerland\r\npresents few events of general importance. Appenzell had been united\r\nto the league in 1573, making the number of Cantons thirteen. The\r\nthirteen Cantons took the name of _Eidgenossen_, a word signifying\r\nconfederates, because they bound themselves together as comrades by\r\noath. This endured without a further change of actual members until\r\n1803. From the peace of Aarau, in 1712 (generally credited to 1718,\r\nsince the Abbot of St. Gallen did not accede to it until six years\r\nafter its agreement), down to 1798, the Cantons enjoyed the blessings\r\nof seventy-nine years of comparative quiet. The tranquillity enjoyed\r\nwas favorable to the progress of commerce, agriculture, the arts,\r\nand sciences. The French Revolution, which disturbed the peace and\r\nunsettled the political institutions of every country in Europe,\r\nconvulsed Switzerland with civil war and anarchy. In January, 1798, a\r\nFrench army entered Switzerland to assist the Pays de Vaud, which had\r\ndeclared its independence against the Bernese; Bern was taken and the\r\nSwiss Confederation converted into the “Helvetic Republic, one and\r\nindivisible.”\r\n\r\nThe Cantons of Schwyz, Uri, Unterwalden, Zug, Glarus, and Appenzell\r\ndeclared that they would not accept the laws which had been forced\r\nupon them, and leagued together to resist. These refractory Cantons\r\nwere overpowered and coerced, but so gallantly did they maintain their\r\nground that the French general declared, “that every Swiss soldier\r\nfought like a Cæsar.” It was then ordained by the French that an oath\r\nof allegiance to the new government should be taken in every Canton.\r\nSchwyz, Uri, Unterwalden, and Zug refused obedience to this ordinance.\r\nIt was forced upon them and upheld by a costly army, which practised\r\nintolerable exactions and haughty and insolent domination. Geneva\r\nat this time was annexed to France. Lavater styled this epoch “the\r\nfirst year of Swiss slavery.” The atrocities of the French invasion\r\nof Switzerland excited great indignation in Europe. All that tyranny\r\nthe most oppressive, rapine the most insatiate, cruelty the most\r\nsanguinary, and lust the most unbridled, could inflict did that devoted\r\ncountry experience. The effect on the friends of freedom may be judged\r\nof from the following indignant lines of Coleridge, once an ardent\r\nsupporter of the Revolution, in his “Ode to Freedom,” written in 1798:\r\n\r\n  “Forgive me, Freedom! oh, forgive those dreams;\r\n  I hear thy voice, I hear thy loud lament,\r\n  From bleak Helvetia’s icy cavern sent;\r\n  I hear thy groans upon her blood-stain’d streams;\r\n  Heroes, that for your peaceful country perish’d,\r\n  And ye that, fleeing, spot your mountain snows\r\n  With bleeding wounds, forgive me that I cherish’d\r\n  One thought that ever bless’d your cruel foes;\r\n  To scatter rage and traitorous guilt,\r\n  Where peace her jealous home had built;\r\n  A patriot race to disinherit\r\n  Of all that made their stormy wilds so dear.”\r\n\r\nWhen Switzerland became the battle-field of French and Austrian armies,\r\nby the treaty of Lunéville, between the Emperor of Austria and the\r\nFrench Republic, the independence of the Helvetic Republic, and the\r\nright of the people to adopt whatever form of government they pleased,\r\nwere guaranteed; but the irreconcilable dissensions of the French and\r\nNational Swiss parties prevented the adoption of any constitution\r\ngenerally acceptable to the people.\r\n\r\nThe withdrawal of the French troops in 1802 led at once to a revolution\r\nin almost every Canton. Again Napoleon, First Consul of the French\r\nRepublic, in contravention of the treaty, interfered, and subdued the\r\nmovement. Forty thousand French troops took military occupation of\r\nSwitzerland. Deputies were ordered to assemble at Paris, and after\r\nlong discussion with them, Napoleon, on the 2d of February, 1803,\r\ntransmitted to Switzerland what is known as the Act of Mediation, under\r\nwhich he assumed the title of “Mediator of Switzerland.” In some cases,\r\nwhat had been subject lands were incorporated into the league, and to\r\nthe thirteen old Cantons six new ones were added,--St. Gallen, the\r\nGrisons, Aargau, Thurgau, Ticino, and Vaud.\r\n\r\nThe downfall of the arbitrary “Mediator” was for the Swiss, as for\r\nthe greater part of Europe, the signal of a happy deliverance. The\r\napparent interest taken by Bonaparte in the welfare of Switzerland,\r\nand his anxious desire to suit its civil institutions to the local\r\nprejudices and habits of each small community, were wholly military\r\nand political. He looked upon Switzerland as a watch-tower between\r\nthe three great divisions of Europe, of which the Act of Mediation\r\nsecured possession to him, without the trouble of a garrison. Soon\r\nafter his defeat at Leipsic in 1813, the Allies invaded Switzerland,\r\nand in December of that year the Swiss Diet met at Zurich and formally\r\nannulled the Act of Mediation. A general council was assembled, and new\r\narticles of confederation agreed upon, known as the Federal Pact, in\r\nSeptember, 1814. This Confederacy was acknowledged by the Congress of\r\nVienna, November 20, 1815; by which the eight powers, Austria, Russia,\r\nFrance, England, Prussia, Spain, Portugal, and Sweden, proclaimed\r\nthe neutrality of Switzerland and the inviolability of its soil. It\r\nmust in justice be said that at that epoch of sweeping annexations\r\nand unblushing bartering of countries, Switzerland was better treated\r\nthan she had reason to expect,--Russia and England were her steadfast\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nThe nineteen Cantons were increased to twenty-two by the addition\r\nof Geneva, which had been annexed to France under the Directory in\r\n1798, and Neuchâtel[7] (a Prussian possession), and the Valais.\r\nThe greater Cantons demanded a return to the old status and their\r\nante-revolutionary supremacy. The relapse would have been worse, had\r\nit not been for the Allied Powers, who would guarantee neutrality only\r\non the condition that the new Cantons be maintained free.\r\n\r\nIn 1817 Switzerland, upon the invitation of the Emperor Alexander of\r\nRussia, joined the Holy Alliance. The restoration of peace to Europe,\r\nand the securities obtained for the neutrality and independence of\r\nSwitzerland at the Congress of Vienna, gave great encouragement to the\r\nintellectual and material progress of the country, wealth increased,\r\nand industry prospered. Public works of great utility were undertaken,\r\nincluding noble roads over the passes of the St. Gothard, the St.\r\nBernard, and the Splügen. In July, 1830, the peace of the country\r\nwas suddenly disturbed by the French Revolution. Violent political\r\nagitation broke out in riots and insurrection. Political wrongs were\r\nrudely redressed; but life and property were respected. The general\r\naim of this movement was to wrest from the aristocratic class and\r\nthe capital towns the exclusive privileges which they had gradually\r\nrecovered since the beginning of the century, and to increase the\r\npower of the people. The Cantons were forced to reorganize their\r\nconstitutions on a more liberal and democratic basis. This movement\r\nnaturally drifted into a plan for revising the federal constitution;\r\nbut the effort to do this in 1832 was defeated by a popular vote.\r\n\r\nThe old religious jealousy of the Catholic and Protestant Cantons now\r\nrevived with increased violence. These troubles were attributed by many\r\nto the influence of the Jesuits, and an active agitation was commenced\r\nfor obtaining their expulsion. Under the claim that religion was in\r\ndanger, delegates from seven Catholic Cantons assembled at Rothen,\r\nin the Canton of Luzern, and formed a separate League, called the\r\n_Sonderbund_, or separate confederation. In violation of the Federal\r\nPact of 1815, these Cantons engaged to defend each other by an armed\r\nforce, and appointed a council of war to take all necessary steps. The\r\nFederal Diet, in session at Bern in July, 1847, realized that prompt\r\naction must be taken to suppress a movement which was threatening the\r\ncountry with a civil war. Friendly negotiation having failed, the Diet\r\ndeclared the League to be dissolved, and at once hostilities broke out.\r\nA sharp, decisive contest of only eighteen days’ duration brought the\r\nstrife to an end; the seceding Cantons were overwhelmed and forced back\r\nto their allegiance.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the Confederation being so decisively proved, it\r\nwas regarded an opportune time to revive the effort for a thorough\r\nreformation of the federal system. This was accomplished the following\r\nyear by the constitution of 1848.\r\n\r\nSwiss history is largely the history of the drawing together of parts\r\nof three adjoining nations for common defence against a common foe,\r\nlittle by little winning their independence.\r\n\r\n“A liberty that sprang to life in Greece; gilded next the early and\r\nthe middle age of Italy; then reposed in the hallowed breast of the\r\nAlps, and descended at length on the coast of North America, and set\r\nthe stars of glory there. At every stage of its course, at every\r\nreappearance, it was guarded by some new security; it was embodied\r\nin some new element of order; it was fertile in some larger good; it\r\nglowed with a more exceeding beauty.”[8]\r\n\r\nThe name “Swiss” and “Switzerland,” German “_Schweiz_,” French\r\n“La _Suisse_,” supposed to be derived from the Canton of Schwyz,\r\nthough long in familiar use, did not form the official style of the\r\nConfederation until 1803. Schwyz, according to Gatschet, signifies\r\n“clearing the ground by fire;” and, again, it is derived from “Sweiter”\r\nand “Swen,” two brothers who are said to have founded it; and these\r\nfamily names, common in Sweden, are now heard in the valleys of Schwyz.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland is triangular in shape, and occupies an almost\r\nimperceptible space upon an ordinary map of the world. Voltaire used\r\nto say he “shook his wig and powdered the republic.” It is bounded\r\non the north and east by Germany, on the south by Italy, and on the\r\nwest by France; and is situated between latitude 45° 50′ and 47° 50′\r\nnorth, and longitude 6° and 10° 25′ east. Its greatest length from\r\neast to west measures two hundred and sixteen miles; its greatest\r\nbreadth north and south is one hundred and fifty-six miles. Nearly its\r\nentire boundary is formed by rivers, lakes, and mountains. The Rhine\r\nconstitutes almost two sides of its boundary, from the point where the\r\nvarious streams from the glaciers of the Grisons have met to form a\r\nriver into the Lake of Constance, and from its exit thence to where\r\nthe Jura Mountains turn its course to the Northern Ocean. The Jura\r\nseparates it from France; and with merely an outlet for the Rhone, the\r\nAlps take up the line, dividing its rugged regions from the plains of\r\nNorthern Italy. On the eastern side is an entangled mass of mountains;\r\non the western side is a succession of parallel ridges, separated from\r\neach other by longitudinal valleys. The elevation varies from six\r\nhundred and forty-six feet, at Lake Maggiore, to fifteen thousand two\r\nhundred and seventeen feet on Monte Rosa. Only two per cent. has an\r\naltitude less than one thousand feet, and six per cent. of the whole\r\nsurface is covered with snow-fields and glaciers. Two-thirds of its\r\nsurface consist of lofty mountain chains and valleys; the remainder a\r\nplain thirteen hundred feet above the level of the sea. That portion\r\nwhich lies to the east of the Rhine rises from a platform no less than\r\nthree thousand two hundred feet in height, even in the valleys. All\r\nof Switzerland, with Savoy, and indeed the Tyrol and other adjoining\r\ncountries, lie on a huge mountain. They all have their valleys, it\r\nis true, but their valleys are more elevated than even the hills of\r\nthe lower regions. Two of the mightiest European rivers, the Rhine\r\nand Rhone, have their sources in Switzerland. Their head-waters are\r\nseparated only by the tangled mass between the Pizzo Rotondo and\r\nthe Oberalp Pass,--the Rhine running towards the east and the Rhone\r\ntowards the west. The St. Gothard may be regarded as the central point\r\nof the country, and from its sides these two rivers take their rise\r\nin a great transversal valley of the Central Alps. On the east, the\r\nRhine, springing from the glaciers, flows through the Grisons to the\r\nnorth and loses itself in the Lake of Constance, issues from it at\r\nStein, and flows to the westward as far as Basel, where it commences\r\nits perpendicular course towards the German Ocean. On the west, the\r\nRhone, rising in the blue and glittering glacier of the same name,\r\ndescends through the long channel of the Valais, expands into the Lake\r\nof Geneva, and takes its rapid course to the Mediterranean. Both of\r\nthese rivers purify their waters in a large lake; and in their passage\r\nthrough the same Jurassic range of mountains they both form cataracts\r\nand waterfalls, though separated by that time by an interval of one\r\nhundred and eighty miles. Nine-tenths of the central table-lands of\r\nSwitzerland belong to the Rhine system, and only one-tenth to the\r\nRhone. In addition to these, two great rivers on the north of the St.\r\nGothard, the Reuss and the Aar, descend in parallel ravines through\r\nrugged mountains, feeding the Lakes of Luzern, Thun, and Brienz; while\r\non the south its snows nourish the impetuous torrents of the Ticino,\r\nwhich swells out into Lake Maggiore, and loses itself in the waves of\r\nthe Po.\r\n\r\nWithin two degrees of latitude, Switzerland contains the climate of\r\nthirty-four degrees. The variety in the vertical configuration of the\r\ncountry naturally affects its climate, and nearly every valley and\r\nevery mountain-side has a climate of its own. Besides “mathematical\r\nclimate,” which is expressed by latitude, and depends on the elevation\r\nof the surface of the earth to the sun, modern science gives “physical\r\nclimate.” It describes isothermal lines, which do not exactly coincide\r\nwith the circles of latitude, but diverge to north or south, according\r\nas the temperature is modified by other factors, such as the height\r\nof the land above the sea, the modifying action of mountain chains,\r\ncurrents of wind and water, and the neighborhood of lakes and sea.\r\nThe climate of Switzerland is specially modified by the influences\r\nwhich spring from the capricious consequences of the nearness of\r\nmountains, which are a bulwark against the periodical agitations of the\r\natmosphere; they form a great barrier to the northward against the icy\r\nblasts sweeping down from the snow-fields of Russia and Siberia; and to\r\nthe south, to the hot Libyan winds blowing across the Mediterranean.\r\nFor regular isotherms, it would be idle to seek in such a broken\r\nregion. The lakes, which are fed by the glacier waters, have a cooling\r\neffect on the temperature of the summer heat; the temperature of the\r\nwater of Lake Brienz does not exceed from 48° to 53° Fahrenheit in the\r\nwarmest days. It is a great benefit to the circulation of air which\r\ncomes in contact with surfaces so relatively cold, nor do these bodies\r\nof air carry away with them any large amount of moisture, because the\r\nlow temperature of the water does not favor any great evaporation.\r\nWithin a short distance one may see at the same time all the seasons\r\nof the year, stand between spring and summer,--collecting snow with\r\none hand and plucking flowers from the soil with the other. In Valais\r\nthe fig and grape ripen at the foot of ice-clad mountains; while near\r\ntheir summits the lichen grows at the limit of the snow-line. There\r\nis a corresponding variety as regards the duration of the seasons. In\r\nItalian Switzerland, winter lasts only three months; at Glarus, four;\r\nin the Engadine, six; on the St. Gothard, eight; on the Great St.\r\nBernard, nine; and on the Théodule Pass, always. Upon first beholding\r\nthe peaks of the Alps, shrouded in their everlasting mantles of snow,\r\none would little dream that in the valleys beneath ran musical streams\r\nof summer water, with emerald meadows spreading their velvet cloaks,\r\ndappled with clustering rose-bush, and the sun-loving flowers of the\r\ngardens of the tropics.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times writers exhausted their eloquence in painting the\r\nhorrors of the climate of the Alps. Livy wrote, “and the snows almost\r\nmingling with the sky, the shapeless huts situated on the cliffs, the\r\ncattle and beasts of burden withered by the cold, the men unshorn and\r\nwildly dressed, all things, animate and inanimate, stiffened with\r\nfrost, and other objects more terrible to be seen than described, renew\r\ntheir alarm.”[9]\r\n\r\nTo-day, within its habitable regions, the climate is distinguished for\r\nbeing generally temperate, healthful, and invigorating. It enjoys, from\r\nits geographical smallness, immunity from the penalty a vast continent\r\npays in colossal visitations and vicissitudes of meteorological\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe Föhn is a remarkable local wind in Switzerland; it is a strong\r\nsouthwest or south wind, very hot and dry, formerly supposed to\r\noriginate in the Sahara, and flowing in towards the area of low\r\natmospheric pressure; or to be a tropical counter-current of the trade\r\nwinds. Meteorologists now hold that it is engendered by local causes.\r\nCommencing its descent in the northern valleys with a high temperature,\r\nit necessarily increases its temperature and dryness as it passes\r\ninto the higher pressure of lower levels; it sweeps through certain\r\nvalleys, especially in Glarus and Uri, where old laws enact that when\r\nit blows, every fire in the place, for whatever purpose used, is to be\r\nextinguished, for its violence is often extreme. It is much dreaded,\r\nyet acts beneficially by a rapid polar-like awakening of nature; it is\r\nit which melts most of the snow in the spring, and “without the Föhn,”\r\nsays the peasant of the Grisons, “neither God nor the golden sun would\r\nprevail over the snow.” The Bise is the opposite of the Föhn, a cold,\r\nbiting north wind, whose tooth has been sharpened by its passage over\r\nthe ice-fields, bringing all the chills of Siberia, and searching one\r\nthrough and through, eating into the very marrow. This wind is confined\r\nwithin a narrow area of the country, pouring from the northeast over\r\nthe Boden-See, and along the Jura to the Lake of Geneva below Lausanne;\r\nits effect is blighting on the pastures, which it sometimes visits at\r\nuntimely seasons, killing even cattle exposed to it in May.\r\n\r\nThe German, Burgundian, and Italian nations which joined together to\r\nform the modern Swiss nation, cast away their original nationality, and\r\nmade for themselves a new one, forming a nation as real and true as if\r\nit had strictly answered to some linguistic or ethnological division.\r\nThese northern and southern nations of Europe have been singularly\r\nintermingled in Switzerland, and in this respect furnish an interesting\r\nstudy, as a striking exception to the general idea suggested by\r\nthe word “nation” as a considerable continuous part of the earth’s\r\nsurface, where speakers of a single tongue are united under a single\r\ngovernment. The long persistent division of the Swiss people into\r\nGerman, French, and Italian stands in marked contrast with the thorough\r\nunity of the nation. They have never been blended into one people,\r\nso far as speaking a common language is concerned. German, French,\r\nItalian, Romansch, and Ladin are spoken within the limits of the\r\nConfederacy. And even the dialects of the German differ so much as to\r\nmake communication almost impossible, at times, between the different\r\nvillages and towns.\r\n\r\nThe census of December 1, 1888, showed the total population of\r\nSwitzerland to be 2,933,612. The German-speaking element increased from\r\n2,030,792, in 1880, to 2,092,479, which, taking into account the normal\r\ngrowth of the population, was no relative increase; the proportion in\r\nboth cases being about seventy-one per cent. of the whole. The French,\r\non the other hand, increased from 608,007 to 637,710, which was a\r\nrelative increase of from 21.4 to 21.07 per cent., while the Italian\r\ndeclined actually as well as relatively, the numbers being 161,923\r\nin 1889, and 156,482 in 1888, or 5.7 and 5.3 per cent. respectively.\r\nThe decline of the Italians in Uri and Schwyz may be explained by the\r\nreturn home of a large number of Italian workmen engaged on the St.\r\nGothard Railway. It is difficult to explain the large decrease of\r\nGermans in the Cantons of Bern and Neuchâtel, while the French have\r\nincreased. In general, the French increase in Switzerland seems to be\r\nat the expense of the Germans, while the German element recovers its\r\nplace at the expense of the Italian.\r\n\r\nThe region extending from the Lake of Geneva to the Lake of Constance,\r\nand from the foot of the Alps to the foot of the Jura, forms only\r\none-fourth of Switzerland, so far as area is concerned; but nearly\r\nits whole population, wealth, and industry are concentrated there.\r\nThe population is settled in the plains, the hill regions, and the\r\nvalleys; there are chalets nearly eight thousand feet high on the\r\nFleck and Indre Alps, but only one town, viz., Chaux-de-Fonds, in the\r\nJura of Neuchâtel, has been built at an elevation of more than three\r\nthousand two hundred feet; but there are villages in Alpine valleys\r\nwith an elevation of four thousand to five thousand feet, and the\r\nhamlet of Juf, in the dreary valley of the Avers, has an elevation of\r\nsix thousand seven hundred feet, and is the highest village in Europe\r\npermanently inhabited.\r\n\r\nIn point of religion the Swiss are as sharply divided as they are in\r\ntongue and customs. It is to the increasing efforts of the clergy,\r\nduring the many centuries that elapsed between the fall of the Roman\r\nempire and the revival of knowledge, that the judicious historian of\r\nSwitzerland ascribes the early civilization and humane disposition\r\nof the Helvetic tribes; and invariably the first traces of order and\r\nindustry appeared in the immediate neighborhood of the religious\r\nestablishments. The traveller will behold with interest the crosses\r\nwhich frequently mark the brow of a precipice, and the little chapels\r\nhollowed out of the rock where the road is narrowed, and will consider\r\nthem so many pledges of security; and he will rest assured that so long\r\nas the pious mountaineer continues to adore the “Good Shepherd” he\r\nwill never cease to befriend the traveller or to discharge the duties\r\nof hospitality. That a church, or rather that churches, existed in\r\nSwitzerland in the fourth century is proved by the signatures, coming\r\ndown from that date, of certain bishops and elders of Geneva, Coire,\r\nand the Valais; and one century later it is known that other places\r\nbesides these had been in a measure Christianized. The Fraternity\r\nof St. Bernard was founded in the latter part of the tenth century\r\nby Bernard de Menthon, an Augustinian canon of Aosta, in Piedmont,\r\nfor the double purpose of extending bodily succor and administering\r\nspiritual consolation to travellers crossing the Pass of St. Bernard,\r\nwhere winter reigns during nine months of the year. The idea of\r\nestablishing a religious community in the midst of savage rocks, and at\r\nthe highest point trodden by the foot of man, was worthy of Christian\r\nself-denial and a benevolent philanthropy. The experiment succeeded in\r\na degree commensurate with its noble intention: centuries have gone\r\nby, civilization has undergone a thousand changes, empires have been\r\nformed and overturned, and one-half of the world has been rescued\r\nfrom barbarism, while this piously-founded edifice still remains in\r\nits simple and respectable usefulness where it was first erected, the\r\nrefuge of the traveller and a shelter for the poor. The building,\r\nthe entertainment, the brotherhood, are marked by a severe, monastic\r\nself-denial which appears to have received a character of stern\r\nsimplicity from the unvarying nakedness of all that greets the eye in\r\nthat region of frost and sterility. In storms, monks, helpers, and dogs\r\nall go out to search for helpless travellers; and during the severe\r\nwinter of 1830 both packs of dogs had to be taken out, and nearly all\r\nperished; the names of Barry and Bruno are kept with those of departed\r\narchbishops and monks. These St. Bernard dogs are adapted, by their\r\ninstincts, intelligence, and benevolence, to the charitable work in\r\nwhich they are engaged. The moment they scent a traveller buried in the\r\nsnow they announce the fact by setting up a loud bark, but they do not\r\nwait for the arrival of their human companions, but begin at once to\r\ndig into the snow with all their strength. The pure breed is said to be\r\nextinct, but the cross variety still retains many of the good points of\r\nthe genuine breed.[10]\r\n\r\nEinsiedeln is a very ancient and celebrated monastery in the Canton of\r\nSchwyz; it is more generally known as the Monastery of “Our Lady of the\r\nHermits,” and is one of the most famous pilgrim resorts in the world.\r\nIt was here that Meinrad, an anchorite of the house of Hohenzollern,\r\nis supposed to have retired in the ninth century, and built a cell\r\nfor the worship of the Black Virgin, presented to him by the Abbess\r\nHildegard of Zurich. He was murdered, and respect for his memory\r\ninduced a religious community to establish themselves there. On the\r\noccasion of the consecration of the chapel erected by them, the Bishop,\r\nit is related, was anticipated by angels, who performed the rite to\r\nheavenly music at midnight. Leo VIII. declared this consecration to be\r\na full and perfect one, and forbade the repetition of the rite; and\r\nPope Benedict VIII. placed Count Meinrad in the catalogue of saints\r\none hundred and fifty years after his death. The inscription over\r\nthe church-door at Einsiedeln is “_Hic est plena remissio peccatorum\r\na culpa et a pœna_” (“Here is plenary remission of sins from their\r\nguilt and from their punishment”). There is a copious fountain before\r\nthe church, and another tradition has it that the Saviour visited the\r\nshrine and drank from it. This fountain has fourteen jets, carved to\r\nimitate the heads of strange beasts and birds, and the pilgrims must\r\ndrink of every one to make sure that they should not miss the right\r\none, which is said to have refreshed our Lord.\r\n\r\nIt has been disputed to whom the priority in the race of reform in\r\nSwitzerland belongs, Zwingli or Luther. Zwingli himself declares that\r\nin 1516, before he had heard of Luther, he began to preach the gospel\r\nat Zurich, and to warn the people against relying upon human authority.\r\nThe name of Zwingli is always associated by the Swiss with the rise of\r\nProtestantism as that of Calvin is with its triumphant progress.[11]\r\nThis Reformation, introduced by Zwingli and extended by Calvin,\r\noccasioned the fiercest dissensions. Early in the sixteenth century\r\nboth Geneva and Zurich became cities of refuge for French, Italian,\r\nand English who were forced to flee from their native lands on account\r\nof their faith. The first edition of the English Bible was printed in\r\nZurich in 1535. The Reformers separated themselves into Lutherans,\r\nCalvinists, and Anabaptists. It was held to be the duty of each Canton\r\nto force its own faith upon the whole body of the people; church-going\r\nwas enforced by fines and corporal punishment; staying away from\r\nchurch on Sunday mornings, in some localities, was followed by a loss\r\nof citizenship. The latter part of the sixteenth and the whole of the\r\nseventeenth century are crowded with controversies and bloodshed;\r\nthat violence and those animosities which are found so terribly to\r\nprevail where religious zeal has been abused for the purposes of\r\nintolerance. Nowhere were the doctrines of the Protestant Reformation\r\nmore ardently embraced; nowhere was the strange moral phenomenon,\r\nwhich is to be traced in so many quarters of Europe, more conspicuous\r\nthan among the Cantons of Switzerland, the early, exact, permanent,\r\ngeographical division, which was realized between the Protestant and\r\nPopish communities; a division which frequently an insignificant stream\r\nor street has been sufficient to maintain for ages. Religious parties,\r\nlike glaciers, became at once frozen up in set attitudes and forms,\r\nwhich no subsequent events have been able to alter. In three instances\r\ncontroversies on the subject of religion kindled violent and bloody\r\ncontests. The most memorable was the war between Bern and Zurich, on\r\nthe one part, and five little Catholic Cantons on the other, in 1712.\r\nAt the close of the period of the Reformation, seven of the Cantons,\r\nLuzern, Schwyz, Uri, Unterwalden, Zug, Freiburg, and Solothurn adhered\r\nto their ancient Catholic faith; the Cantons of Bern, Basel, Zurich,\r\nSt. Gallen, and Schaffhausen adopted the reformed religion; Appenzell\r\nand Glarus recognized both forms of worship. In Geneva, over which the\r\nDuke of Savoy ruled, the effects of the Reformation were peculiarly\r\nimportant. Calvinism, as it existed at Geneva, was not merely a system\r\nof religious opinion, but an attempt to make the will of God, as\r\nrevealed in the Bible, an authoritative guide for social and personal\r\nas well as for moral direction. Moral sins were treated after the\r\nexample of the Mosaic law, as crimes to be punished by the magistrates;\r\n“elsewhere,” said Knox, speaking of Geneva, “the word of God is taught\r\nas purely, but never anywhere have I seen God obeyed as faithfully.”[12]\r\n\r\nReprobating and lamenting that the great reformer depended upon the\r\nuse of the sword for the extirpation of heresy, let us remember that\r\nCalvin was not only the “founder of a sect, but foremost among the\r\nmost efficient of modern republican legislators; and that his genius\r\ninfused enduring elements into the institutions of Geneva, and made\r\nit for the modern world the impregnable fortress of popular liberty,\r\nthe fertile seed-plot of democracy.” That “theological city,” called\r\nby some the Jerusalem of Switzerland, seems to be pervaded by an\r\nendemic influence inciting to religious discussion and agitation;\r\nthe eager, irrepressible spirit of John Calvin walks abroad from his\r\nunknown sepulchre as the _genius loci_. The Reformation contributed in\r\nSwitzerland to the enlightenment of the people and to the maintenance\r\nof a spirit of freedom; but in a political point of view it was the\r\ncause of the gravest evils, which continued long after the original\r\nconvulsions. To differences of race and language it added divisions\r\nof religious faith and the conflict of hostile churches. For some\r\ntime there was an alliance of clerical aggressiveness and ambition,\r\nwith the employment of religion as a political influence. The radical\r\ngovernment of Zurich was violently overthrown on the 6th of September,\r\n1839, in consequence of the nomination of Dr. Strauss to a chair of\r\ntheology; thousands of peasants, led by their pastors and singing\r\nhymns, armed with scythes and clubs, entered Zurich, and the government\r\nwas forced to dissolve itself. As late as the war of the Sonderbund,\r\nin 1847, religious intolerance appeared to threaten the integrity\r\nof the Confederation; and by an article in the Constitution of\r\n1848, and re-enacted in that of 1874, the Jesuits and all affiliated\r\nsocieties were interdicted throughout the Confederation. Hostility to\r\nthe Jesuits was not regarded as hostility to the Catholic religion.\r\nThe order of Jesuits, as then existing in Switzerland, could not be\r\nconsidered purely religious, but partly political, partly sectarian and\r\ncontroversial, its direct aim being to aggrandize the Church at the\r\nexpense of the state, and the Catholic religion at the expense of the\r\nProtestant. From the first of these two tendencies, it was repugnant to\r\na large portion even of the Catholic world. The whole history of the\r\nJesuits in Switzerland betokened an organized and systematic teaching\r\nof religion, not exclusively for religious ends, but largely as a means\r\nfor procuring political and social ascendency; even to the extent of\r\nreducing it to rule, craft, and professional duty. It was against\r\nthis tendency, not against any matters essential to the Catholic\r\nreligion, that even the Catholic world protested. The growth of the Old\r\nCatholics, after the Vatican Council of 1870, caused many disturbances\r\nin Western Switzerland, specially in the Bernese Jura. Inaugurated\r\nin the Catholic universities of Germany, it was transplanted for a\r\ncomplete and more vigorous growth into the soil of Geneva, and there\r\ntaking on a logical, consistent, and organized form, it seemed fitted\r\nfor the wide propagation and success that marked the great Reformation\r\nof the sixteenth century, to which, in its early stages, it showed\r\ncurious points of undesigned coincidence.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss serve God and serve Liberty; two facts which go far to\r\nsolve all the phenomena of their remarkable history. They hold with\r\nPlutarch that “a city might more easily be founded without territory\r\nthan a state without belief in God.” It may be, as Professor Tyndall\r\ncontends, that there is “morality in the oxygen of the mountains.” Man\r\nfeels himself reduced to nonentity under the stupendous architecture of\r\nthese elevated regions which carries his thoughts up to the Creator.\r\nA cultivated and pious mind may find itself stayed and soothed and\r\ncarried upward, at some evening hour, by those great symbols of a\r\nduration without an end to a throne above the sky; and this impression\r\nmay be deepened until the outward glory reproduces itself in the\r\ninward, and causes it to cry out:\r\n\r\n  “Great Hierarch! Tell thou the silent sky,\r\n  And tell the stars, and tell yon rising sun,\r\n  Earth, with her thousand voices, praises God.”\r\n\r\nThe lives of the Swiss are in continual struggle with the elements,\r\nthe visible power of the Deity; their sober habits, simple, natural,\r\nimaginative, all predispose them to believe; and the Gospel easily\r\nobtained dominion over their faith and feelings.\r\n\r\nThe sublime works of nature are equally calculated to arouse sentiments\r\nof patriotism; they are capable of a companionship with man, full of\r\nexpression of inexplicable affinities and delicacies of intercourse.\r\nNo race of men can dwell in Switzerland, amidst its mountains, its\r\nprecipices, its rocks, glaciers, avalanches, and torrents, without\r\nbeing strong, brave, and resolute. Just as we recognize an elevated\r\nregion by its growth of peculiar timber, whether stunted or lofty,\r\nalike in their power of resisting the tempest, and by its hardy plants\r\ncharacterized by their intense tenacity of life, just so a mountainous\r\ncountry is indicated by a courageous, athletic, close-knit population\r\nof liberty-loving, patriotic men.\r\n\r\n“_Montani semper liberi_,” everywhere mountainous regions have been\r\nfavorable to a free and manly spirit in the people; in every zone the\r\nmountain races are a free, a pastoral, an unchanging people, rather\r\nconfirming Emerson’s hasty generalization as to snow and civil freedom.\r\nIn the East the warlike hill-tribes have been less subject to despotic\r\nrule than the milder races dwelling on the plains. The varied grandeur\r\nof the mountains no less than the awful power of the ocean counts for\r\nsomething in the perpetuation of distinctive characteristics. But the\r\nspirit of freedom is thought to take a different color from the sea and\r\nfrom the mountain; in the mountain it is stubborn and resolute; by the\r\nsea it is excitable and fickle. The hill-tribes of Judea kept their\r\ncovenant, the tribes of Jordan fell away; those Medes who never changed\r\ntheir laws descended from the Caspian Alps, those Greeks who sought new\r\nthings from day to day were dwellers by the Ægean Sea. Among the vines\r\nand olives in Italian gardens men are soft, poetic, phosphorescent, no\r\nless full of fire than they are fond of change; among the pines and\r\nlarches of the Swiss glaciers men are hardy, patient, dumb, as slow to\r\nfume and flash as they are hard to bend and break. The poet Wordsworth\r\nrepresents that it was the peculiar fortune of Switzerland to enjoy the\r\ninfluence of mountain and sea at once,--\r\n\r\n  “Two voices are there: one is of the sea,\r\n  One of the mountains; each a mighty voice:\r\n  In both, from age to age, thou didst rejoice,\r\n  They were thy chosen music, Liberty.”\r\n\r\nThere are few principles of action which are more immediately\r\nbeneficial to society, and which have received more assiduous\r\ncultivation, than _love of country_. The Swiss regards his country\r\nwith the tenderness of filial affection, and, like the undiscerning\r\nlover, fondly gazes without discrimination upon its beauties and\r\nits deformities.[13] Enamored of their rocks, ice, and snow, they\r\nlook on milder climates and more fruitful plains without one envious\r\nemotion. Deeper down even than the deep-seated differences of race,\r\nlanguage, and creed lies the feeling that comes from the common\r\npossession of a political freedom that is greater than that possessed\r\nby surrounding peoples: this is the enduring bond of the Confederation.\r\nSwitzerland has demonstrated that democracies are not necessarily\r\nshort-lived. The short-lived glory of Athens and its subjection under\r\nthe rough foot of the astute Macedonian was not the result of too\r\nmuch freedom, but because the Greek states had too little unity. In\r\nSwitzerland republican institutions can claim to have been fairly\r\ntried and thoroughly succeeded. Dating from the perpetual Alliance\r\nof 1291, the Confederation now counts six centuries; living through\r\nmany forms of government, feudal, clerical, imperial, radical, the\r\nLeague of Cantons never ceased to be a union of republics, and is the\r\nonly federal government which has come down from mediæval times to\r\nour own day. We see that the Swiss have lasted well, “for utility is\r\ntheir bond and not respects.” While in some European countries very\r\nanomalous forms of government have assumed the republican name, it is\r\ngratifying to observe that there is at least one European state in\r\nwhich republicanism is a fact and a living force properly understood\r\nand properly practised, uniting with as large a measure of individual\r\nliberty all the advantages of careful and judicious legislation,\r\neconomy in the administration, and justice in the execution of the\r\nlaws to as high a degree as can be found in any country. Every man is\r\nfree; every child educated; the sovereign power resides in hands that\r\ndefend it in danger and adorn it in peace; a common faith that love\r\nof country, “all for each and each for all,” is better than a love of\r\nself pervades the entire population. Amid powerful monarchies there\r\nis a state without king or nobles, with a well-developed system of\r\ndemocratic institutions, admirably suited to the genius of the people\r\nand administered with the economy, the wisdom, and the consistency\r\nof a well-regulated family. There the problem of a free commonwealth\r\nwas first solved, and popular government first made possible. There\r\nare presented some of the most striking examples of democracy in its\r\nsimplest form, and of carefully-contrived and durable republican\r\ninstitutions, to be found in the annals of political history. There is\r\na government based on the simple but sound philosophy expounded in the\r\nhomely observations of the honest old boatman of Geneva, Jean Desclaux,\r\n“If one man rule, he will rule for his own benefit and that of his\r\nparasites; if a minority rule, we have many masters instead of one,\r\nall of whom must be fed and served; and if the majority rule, and rule\r\nwrongfully, why the minimum of harm is done.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n“On the main-land only two little spots at the two extremities of\r\nthe old Teutonic world came out of the mediæval crucible with their\r\nself-government substantially intact. At the mouth of the Rhine, the\r\nlittle Dutch communities were prepared to lead the attack in the\r\nterrible battle for freedom with which the drama of modern history was\r\nushered in. In the impregnable mountain fastnesses of upper Germany,\r\nthe Swiss Cantons had bid defiance alike to Austrian tyrant and to\r\nBurgundian invader, and had preserved in its purest form the rustic\r\ndemocracy of their Aryan forefathers. By a curious coincidence, both\r\nthese free peoples in their efforts towards national unity were led to\r\nframe federal unions, and one of these political achievements is from\r\nthe stand-point of universal history of very great significance.”[14]\r\nWriters, as a rule, properly consider a federal government, owing to\r\nits nice balances in regard to a division of power between the union\r\nand the members, and in regard to the conflicting interests of the\r\nparts, as a peculiarly delicate and almost unadjustable framework.\r\n\r\n“The federative system,” says Guizot, “is one which evidently requires\r\nthe greatest maturity of reason, of morality, of civilization in the\r\nsociety to which it is applied.” The two poles of a federal government\r\nare independent action of the members in certain things, and a central\r\npower or government which in certain things is equally independent.\r\nThe aim is to gain the advantages of the concentrated power of great\r\nstates, while retaining the advantages of local interest found in small\r\nstates. On the one hand, each of the members of the union must be\r\nwholly independent in those matters which concern each member only. On\r\nthe other hand, all must be subject to a common power in those matters\r\nwhich concern the whole body of members collectively. Switzerland\r\nrepresents the happy outcome of the first attempt at such a federal\r\nunion made by men of Teutonic descent. Complete independence in local\r\naffairs combined with adequate representation in the Federal Council\r\nhas effected such an intense cohesion of interests throughout the\r\nnation as no centralized government, however cunningly devised, would\r\never have secured. The constitutional history of the confederation is\r\na study in federalism. First a mere defensive alliance or league;[15]\r\nthen a _Staatenbund_, or permanent alliance of several small states, to\r\nwhich the term confederacy nearly corresponds; then a _Bundesstaat_, or\r\nan organized state with central legislative, executive, and judicial\r\ndepartments, which answers substantially to the term federation as\r\nusually employed, and as realized in the Constitution of 1848, and\r\nperfected in that of 1874. The distinction which German publicists\r\nhave introduced into political science between a _Staatenbund_ and\r\na _Bundesstaat_, constituting the two chief forms of union between\r\nstates, is a very valuable one,--the former word denoting a league\r\nor confederation of states; the latter, a state formed by means of\r\na league or confederation. In order to know to which of the two\r\nclasses a given state belongs, we need to inquire only whether the\r\npolitical body in question has the essential qualities of a state\r\nor not. Confederation and federation; both are composite political\r\nbodies, and in so far different from mere alliances which form no new\r\nstate. _Staatenbund_, or confederation, is rather a conglomeration of\r\nstates than a real state; it retains the character of a contractual\r\ncombination of states. _Bundesstaat_, or federation, implies the\r\nadvance from the incomplete and transitional form to the formation of a\r\ncollective state or union; it is a more highly developed _Staatenbund_,\r\nthe difference is only one of degree in purpose, form, and powers\r\nto carry out the national will. A confederation, by joining several\r\nstates in a political association, presents at least externally the\r\nappearance of one state of an international personality; but yet is\r\nnot organized into one central state distinct from the particular\r\nstates. The management of the collective state is left either to\r\nsome particular state as President (_Vorort_), or to an assembly of\r\ndelegates and representatives of all the several states. The former\r\nwas the case with the Greek leagues under the hegemony of Sparta and\r\nAthens; the latter with the American Union under the ancient articles\r\nof 1778, and the German confederation of 1815. In a federation there\r\nare not merely completely organized particular states, each remaining\r\nsovereign and independent within the range of such powers as it does\r\nnot hand over to the federal authority; but there is an independently\r\norganized common or central state, that within the range of the powers\r\nhanded over to it forms a single commonwealth under a government with\r\nits own executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The Achæan\r\nleague was already in some measure such a federal state. This form of\r\nstate first appears in modern times in the Constitution of the United\r\nStates adopted in 1787, and subsequently imitated by Switzerland.\r\nThe Swiss Confederation previous to 1848 joined the members of the\r\nleague only on such terms and for such purposes as were agreed on, and\r\ntheir common affairs were administered by a federal Diet. Still each\r\nCanton remained perfectly independent in all its internal concerns;\r\neven keeping the right of separate dealings with foreign governments.\r\nThere was nothing which could be strictly called a federal government,\r\nwhose one will makes the constitution, and demands obedience from the\r\nminority, even of particular Cantons. The foundation of the Swiss\r\nConstitution is the old Swiss league, which lasted from 1291 to 1798.\r\nBut there had been simply alliances between different Cantons, and no\r\nreal federal constitution existed. The establishment of the Helvetic\r\nRepublic, one and indivisible, was the first attempt at a constitution.\r\nThe representative democracy of the United States found a soil ready\r\nprepared for it in Switzerland, to which it was transplanted by French\r\nintervention. The constitution _unitaire_ was imposed on Switzerland\r\nmost tyrannically, but it was not in itself a bad one. Under what may\r\nbe called the French readjustment of Switzerland, constitutions rose\r\nand fell and succeeded each other in rapid rotation from 1798 to 1803.\r\nFirst appears a project of the Constitution of March, 1798; by this a\r\nsingle centralized state was substituted for the thirteen old Cantons.\r\nIt served with modifications as the groundwork of another sketched\r\nin April of the same year. This latter was prevented by the outbreak\r\nof war between France and Austria in 1799 from taking root. Another\r\nConstitution of May, 1801, approved by Bonaparte, then First Consul,\r\nwas acceptable to few in its political and territorial arrangements.\r\nThe Cantons became mere divisions, like counties or departments.\r\nOne of its earliest provisions abolishes the ancient democracies of\r\nthe Forest Cantons. The traditions of independence in these older\r\nCantons, and the elements of internal opposition, were too strong to\r\nadmit of submission. The inhabitants of these sequestered regions,\r\ncommunicating little with the rest of the world, ardently attached to\r\ntheir liberties, inheriting all the dauntless intrepidity of their\r\nforefathers, clearly perceived that, in the wreck of all their ancient\r\ninstitutions, the independence of their country could not long be\r\nmaintained. They saw that the insidious promises of the French envoys\r\nhad terminated only in ruinous exaction and tyrannical rule. Animated\r\nby these feelings, “We have lived,” said they, “for several centuries\r\nunder a republic based on liberty and equality; possessing no other\r\ngoods in the world but our religion and our independence; no other\r\nriches but our herds; our first duty is to defend them.” This attempt\r\nto form the whole of Switzerland into a united representative system\r\ncould not be permanent, and was soon dissolved. Other constitutions\r\nfollowed in October, 1801, February, 1802, and July, 1802. Then\r\nFebruary 2, 1803, came, under the so-called Act of Mediation, a\r\nmoderately centralized federal government granted by Napoleon. Old\r\nfamily and civic privileges were annulled; all Swiss were made equal\r\nin the eye of the law, and vassalage was altogether abolished, and\r\nfree right of settlement in any part of Switzerland assured to all.\r\nAll alliances of one Canton with another, or with a foreign state,\r\nwere interdicted. This was stipulated in consequence of an improper\r\nalliance in 1442 by Zurich with the House of Austria. It was ordained\r\nthat each Canton should send one deputy to the general Diet; that they\r\nshould have definite instructions and powers of attorney, and should\r\nnot vote against their instructions. The functions of the Diet were\r\ndeclared to be: 1. To proclaim war or peace, and conclude foreign\r\nalliances, which required the consent of three-fourths of the Diet.\r\n2. To fix regulations for foreign commerce, capitulations in foreign\r\nservice, and the recruiting of soldiers. 3. To levy the contingent,\r\nappoint commanders of the armed forces, and the foreign ambassadors. 4.\r\nTo adopt measures of external utility and settle disputes between one\r\nCanton and another. The act concluded in these terms: “The present act,\r\nthe result of long conference with enlightened persons, appears to us\r\nthe best that could be devised for the constitution and happiness of\r\nthe Swiss. As soon as it is carried into execution the French troops\r\nshall withdraw. We recognize Helvetia as organized by this act as an\r\nindependent power, and guarantee the Federal constitution, and that of\r\neach Canton in particular, against the enemies of the tranquillity of\r\nthe state.” This act for the remainder of Napoleon’s reign settled the\r\ncondition of the Helvetic Confederacy; and although it was peaceful\r\nand prosperous, the Act of Mediation was felt to be the work of a\r\nforeigner and master, and it fell with the extinction of his power.\r\nHere French readjustments came to an end, and after the Congress of\r\nVienna, March, 1815, guaranteed the neutrality of Switzerland, there\r\nfollowed in November of the same year the Federal Pact. This was a\r\nlooser confederation, and in many respects a return to the state\r\nof things previous to the French Revolution, and restored to the\r\nCantons a large portion of their former sovereignty. There continued\r\nto be a _Tagsatzung_, or Diet for general affairs, consisting of\r\n“ambassadors from the sovereign estates,” meaning the Cantons, each\r\nCanton still having only one voice, and three-fourths of the votes\r\nbeing necessary for war or peace and treaties with foreign powers;\r\nbut in other matters of business an absolute majority decides. It\r\nfixes the rate of troops and taxes for federal purposes; gives every\r\nCanton the right to demand defence against internal and external\r\nforce; provides for the settlement of disputes between the Cantons;\r\nputs an end to all dependent territory and exclusive possession of\r\nrights by a class of citizens; and continues the old plan of having a\r\n_Vorort_. Military capitulations and conventions concerning affairs\r\nof police or public economy may be made by single Cantons, provided\r\nthey oppose no federal principles, nor existing league, nor cantonal\r\nrights. Ambassadors from the league may be sent to foreign powers when\r\ntheir appointment is thought necessary. In extraordinary cases the\r\n_Vorort_ may be invested with especial powers, and a committee can be\r\nappointed, composed of the officer of the _Vorort_, who is intrusted\r\nwith the management of the federal affairs in conjunction with other\r\nrepresentatives of the Confederation. This representative committee\r\nis chosen by six circles of Cantons each in turn. The Diet gives the\r\nrequisite instructions to these federal representatives, and fixes\r\nthe duration of their duties, which cease, of course, when there is\r\na new Diet. When this assembly is not in session, the _Vorort_ has\r\nthe charge of federal affairs within the limits existing before 1798.\r\nCloisters and chapters are allowed to continue, but are subject to\r\ntaxation like private property; and the Helvetic national debt is\r\nacknowledged. The Federal Pact became unpopular not merely from its\r\nown intrinsic defects and ambiguities, but also from the time and\r\ncircumstances of its origin. It was a reactionary instrument, bringing\r\nback the yoke of the patrician families and the extreme Ultramontane\r\nparty. The central authority of the Confederation was wreak. It had no\r\npowers, either legislative, executive, or administrative, binding upon\r\nthe several Cantons; no provision for the repression of wars between\r\nrival Cantons, nor for the proper restraint of separate alliances with\r\nforeign powers which endangered the peace, if not the independence, of\r\nthe federal state; no federal army, no public treasury, no national\r\nmint, no common judiciary, nor any other common marks of sovereignty.\r\nThe Diet assembled for little more than deliberation, all matters\r\nof importance being referred to the determination of the Cantons.\r\nNational affairs were discussed in general Diets, as in fact they\r\nhad been from the beginning, but they were Diets which lacked the\r\nvery essentials of republican government, majority rule, and power of\r\nexecution. They depended more upon moral authority than legal powers,\r\npersuading where they could not command obedience. The difficulties of\r\na union so obviously imperfect and narrow were greatly increased by\r\nthe Reformation, which alienated the Catholic and Protestant Cantons,\r\ncausing political and religious struggles that culminated in civil war.\r\nThere is then a constitutional rest until the next great revolutionary\r\nstorm, which swept over so many countries of Europe in 1848, when a\r\nnew constitution, modelled in many respects after that of the United\r\nStates, was adopted, and superseded the Federal Pact. It changed the\r\nfederal union of states into a federal republic; a transition from\r\na _Staatenbund_ to a _Bundesstaat_. The stage of confederation was\r\npassed over and the higher state of federation reached; an organized\r\nnation, and at the same time the peoples of the particular Cantons\r\nalso possessing organic unity; a Swiss nation, and yet a Bernese and\r\nGenevese people. The Constitution of 1848 was the first which was\r\nentirely the work of the Swiss without any foreign influence. For\r\nthe revolution of 1848, which paralyzed Austria, Rome, and Germany,\r\nenabled the Swiss to reassume in full the reins of self-government.\r\nTwo legislative chambers were for the first time created, and invested\r\nwith the power of enacting laws and issuing orders which are binding\r\ndirectly on individual citizens. This most important and far-reaching\r\nprinciple, that the Federal head should operate directly on individuals\r\nand not on states, involved momentous consequences, forcing the\r\nconstruction of a “Composite State.” The joint action of the two\r\nchambers, constituting the _Bundesversammlung_, or Federal Assembly,\r\nbecame a substantive part of the government of every Canton; and,\r\nwithin the limits of its attributions, made laws which are obeyed\r\nby every citizen, and executing them through its own officers, and\r\nenforcing them by its own tribunal; powers essential for an effective\r\nfederal government. The old Diets never ventured on any undertaking\r\nof public utility, amelioration, or reform, during more than three\r\nhundred years. The Confederation was loose and incomplete even for its\r\nessential objects, mutual defence and foreign relations. The principal\r\nobjects of this new constitution were:\r\n\r\n1. The strengthening of the national government, reconciling the\r\nsupremacy of the Confederation with the autonomy of the Cantons.\r\n\r\n2. The overthrow of oligarchies.\r\n\r\n3. The protection of the state from the dominion of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe first two were attained by the direct provisions of the\r\nConstitution; the third was afterwards promoted by the expulsion of the\r\nJesuits and their affiliated societies from Swiss territory. A great\r\nbenefit was conferred upon the Confederation by the unification of such\r\nmatters as coinage, weight, measures, and posts; and the surrender by\r\nthe Cantons to the Confederation of the exclusive right to levy duties\r\nat the frontiers of the country. For twenty-four years Switzerland\r\nenjoyed under this Constitution uninterrupted peace and prosperity; the\r\nEuropean wars between 1855 and 1871 did not disturb her neutrality,\r\nthough military operations offered great temptation to march across her\r\nterritory. In 1872 a project of amendment was submitted conferring upon\r\nthe general government many additional powers. By a small popular and\r\na large cantonal majority it was defeated. The agitation for amendment\r\ncontinued, and in 1874 a more moderate revision of the Constitution\r\nof 1848 was again presented. This remodelling in 1874 did little more\r\nthan work out in a complete and logical form the principles laid down\r\nin 1848; the most marked difference being a further enlargement of the\r\nFederal authority; forming a well compacted union, a Federal state,\r\neach portion of which has its sphere of sovereignty. This revised\r\nConstitution received the sanction of the Federal Assembly, January 31,\r\n1874, was submitted to the popular vote on Sunday, April 19, following,\r\nresulting in a vote of 340,199 in favor of, and 198,013 against,\r\nacceptance. The vote by Cantons was fourteen and a half Cantons for,\r\nand seven and a half Cantons against, acceptance (the votes of the\r\nhalf-Cantons being counted each as a half vote). The Cantons voting\r\nagainst the adoption of the Constitution were Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden\r\n(the original three), Luzern, Zug, Freiburg, Valais, and Appenzell\r\n(Inner). A decree of the Federal Assembly, May 28, 1874, after setting\r\nforth that the revised Federal Constitution had received both a\r\nmajority of all the votes cast and the approval of a majority of all\r\nthe Cantons, says, “That it is, therefore, hereby solemnly declared in\r\neffect, bearing date of May 29, 1874.” The Federal Council, on May 30,\r\n1874, ordered the above decree, together with the Constitution, to be\r\nenrolled in the official collection of statutes of the Confederation,\r\nand the decree to be transmitted to the governments of the Cantons, to\r\nbe published by them through posting up in public places. The Federal\r\nsystem thus established has many features which are strikingly like,\r\nas well as many which are almost as strikingly unlike, those in the\r\nsystem of the United States. The preamble, and Articles I. and II. of\r\nthe Constitution, point out the aim and lay down the fundamental idea\r\nof the Confederation.\r\n\r\n    IN THE NAME OF ALMIGHTY GOD.\r\n\r\n    The Swiss Confederation, desiring to confirm the alliance\r\n    of the confederates, to maintain and to promote the unity,\r\n    strength, and honor of the Swiss nation, has adopted the\r\n    Federal Constitution, following:\r\n\r\n    ARTICLE I.--The peoples of the twenty-two sovereign Cantons\r\n    of Switzerland, united by this present alliance [then follow\r\n    the names of the Cantons], form in their entirety the Swiss\r\n    Confederation.\r\n\r\n    ARTICLE II.--The purpose of the Confederation is to secure\r\n    the independence of the country against foreign nations, to\r\n    maintain peace and order within, to protect the liberty and\r\n    rights of the confederates, and to foster their common welfare.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution is divided into three chapters, embracing,\r\nrespectively, seventy, forty-seven, and four articles, numbered\r\nconsecutively throughout the whole. The chapters have subdivisions,\r\nwith descriptive titles to the general heads.\r\n\r\nThe first chapter is titled _General Provisions_, and covers a wide\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nA literal transcript of the most important provisions of this chapter\r\nwill be given.\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n    The Cantons are sovereign so far as their sovereignty is\r\n    not limited by the Federal Constitution, and as such they\r\n    exercise all the rights which are not delegated to the Federal\r\n    government. All Swiss are equal before the law, with neither\r\n    political dependence, nor privilege of place, birth, persons,\r\n    or families. The Confederation guarantees to the Cantons their\r\n    territory, their sovereignty (within the limits fixed), their\r\n    Constitutions, the liberty and rights of the people, the\r\n    constitutional rights of citizens, and the rights and powers\r\n    which the people have conferred on those in authority. The\r\n    Cantons are bound to ask of the Confederation the guarantee of\r\n    their Constitutions: this is accorded, provided,--\r\n\r\n    (_a_) That the Constitutions contain nothing contrary to the\r\n    provisions of the Federal Constitution.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) That they assure the exercise of political rights\r\n    according to republican forms, representative or democratic.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) That they have been ratified by the people, and may be\r\n    amended whenever the majority of all the citizens demand it.\r\n\r\n    All separate alliances and all treaties of a political\r\n    character between the Cantons are forbidden. The Confederation\r\n    has the sole right of declaring war, of making peace, and\r\n    of concluding alliances and treaties with foreign powers,\r\n    particularly treaties relating to tariffs and commerce. No\r\n    military capitulations shall be made.[16] Members of the\r\n    Federal Government, civil and military officials of the\r\n    Confederation, and Federal Representatives or Commissioners\r\n    shall not accept from foreign Governments any pension, salary,\r\n    title, present, or decoration. The Confederation has no right\r\n    to maintain a standing army: every Swiss is subject to military\r\n    service. The Confederation may construct at its own expense, or\r\n    may aid by subsidies, public works which concern Switzerland\r\n    or a considerable part of the country: the Confederation has\r\n    the right of general supervision over the water and forest\r\n    police measures in the upper mountain regions. It is authorized\r\n    to adopt regulations as to the right of fishing and hunting,\r\n    especially for the preservation of the large game in the\r\n    mountains, and for the protection of birds which are useful\r\n    to agriculture or forestry. Legislation pertaining to the\r\n    construction and operation of railways is an affair of the\r\n    Confederation. It has the right to establish, in addition to\r\n    the existing Polytechnic school, a Federal University and other\r\n    higher institutions of learning, or assist in their support.\r\n    The customs are in the province of the Confederation; it may\r\n    levy export and import duties; but the collection of the\r\n    Federal customs shall be regulated according to the following\r\n    principles:\r\n\r\n    1. Import duties.\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Materials necessary to the manufactures and agriculture\r\n    of the country shall be taxed as low as possible.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Likewise all articles which may be classed as necessaries\r\n    of life.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) Luxuries shall be subjected to the highest duties.\r\n\r\n    2. Export duties shall also be as low as possible.\r\n\r\n    3. The customs legislation shall include suitable provisions\r\n    for the continuance of commercial and market intercourse across\r\n    the frontier.\r\n\r\n    The freedom of trade and of industry is guaranteed throughout\r\n    the whole of the Confederation: excepted from this rule are\r\n    the salt and gunpowder monopolies, the Federal customs,\r\n    measures of sanitary police against epidemics and cattle\r\n    diseases, import duties on wines and other spirituous liquors,\r\n    and other taxes on consumption expressly permitted by the\r\n    Confederation, under certain restrictions: but all the import\r\n    duties levied by the Cantons as well as the similar duties\r\n    levied by the Communes to cease, without indemnity, at the end\r\n    of the year 1890. The Confederation has power to enact uniform\r\n    provisions as to the labor of children in factories, and as\r\n    to the duration of labor fixed for adults therein, and as to\r\n    the protection of workmen against the operation of unhealthy\r\n    and dangerous manufactures. The business of emigration agents\r\n    and of private insurance companies shall be subject to the\r\n    supervision and legislation of the Confederation. The opening\r\n    of gambling-houses is forbidden (those in existence allowed\r\n    until December 31, 1877, to close); necessary measures may\r\n    also be taken concerning lotteries. The post and telegraphs\r\n    (now includes the telephone) in all Switzerland are controlled\r\n    by the Confederation, and the proceeds belong to the Federal\r\n    Treasury; the tariff charges shall be regulated according to\r\n    uniform principles in as equitable a manner as possible, and\r\n    inviolable secrecy of letters and telegrams is guaranteed. To\r\n    the Confederation belongs the exercise of all rights included\r\n    in the coinage monopoly: it alone shall coin money, establish\r\n    the monetary system, and enact provisions, if necessary, for\r\n    the rate of exchange of foreign coins, and to make by law\r\n    general provisions as to the issue and redemption of banknotes:\r\n    it shall not, however, establish any monopoly for the issue\r\n    of banknotes, nor make them a legal tender. The Confederation\r\n    fixes the standard of weights and measures. The manufacture\r\n    and the sale of gunpowder throughout Switzerland pertains\r\n    exclusively to the Confederation (the manufacture and sale of\r\n    spirituous liquors was made a Federal monopoly December 22,\r\n    1885). Every citizen of a Canton is also a Swiss citizen, and\r\n    as such he may participate in the place where he is domiciled\r\n    in all Federal elections and popular votes, after having duly\r\n    proven his qualification as a voter.[17] A Federal law shall\r\n    establish the distinction between settlement and temporary\r\n    residence, and shall at the same time make the regulations\r\n    to which Swiss temporary residents shall be subjected as to\r\n    their political rights and their civil rights. A Federal law\r\n    shall make provision as to the cost of the care and burial\r\n    of indigent persons of one Canton who may become sick or die\r\n    in another Canton. Freedom of conscience and belief shall be\r\n    inviolable; no one shall be compelled to take part in any\r\n    religious society or in any religious instruction, or to\r\n    undertake any religious act, nor shall he be punished in any\r\n    way whatever for his religious views. The person who exercises\r\n    the parents’ or guardians’ authority has the right, conformably\r\n    to the principles above stated, to regulate the religious\r\n    education of children up to the close of their sixteenth year.\r\n    The exercise of civil or political rights shall not be abridged\r\n    by any provisions or conditions whatever of an ecclesiastical\r\n    or religious kind. Religious views shall not absolve from the\r\n    performance of civil duties. No person is bound to pay taxes\r\n    of which the proceeds are specifically appropriated to the\r\n    expenses of any religious society to which he does not belong.\r\n    The free exercise of religious worship is guaranteed within\r\n    the limits of morality and public order; the Cantons and the\r\n    Confederation may take suitable measures for the preservation\r\n    of public order and of peace between the members of different\r\n    religious bodies, as well as against any interference in the\r\n    rights of citizens or of the state by church authorities.\r\n    Contests in public and private law which arise out of the\r\n    formation or the division of religious bodies may be brought by\r\n    appeal before the competent Federal authorities. No bishopric\r\n    shall be created upon Swiss territory without the consent of\r\n    the Confederation; neither the order of the Jesuits nor the\r\n    societies affiliated with them shall be suffered in any part\r\n    of Switzerland, and all participation of their members either\r\n    in church or school is prohibited; this prohibition may be\r\n    extended also by Federal ordinance to other religious orders\r\n    whose action is dangerous to the state, or disturbs the peace\r\n    between sects. The establishment of new convents or religious\r\n    orders or the restoration of those which have been suppressed\r\n    is forbidden. The civil status and the keeping of records\r\n    thereof is subject to the civil authority (taking it away from\r\n    the clergy, who were formerly the custodians). The disposition\r\n    of burial-places shall belong to the civil authorities; they\r\n    shall take care that every deceased person may be decently\r\n    interred (to prevent denial of burial by the church). The\r\n    right of marriage is placed within the protection of the\r\n    Confederation; this right shall not be limited for confessional\r\n    or economic considerations, nor on account of previous conduct\r\n    or other police reasons; no tax upon admission or similar tax\r\n    shall be levied upon either party to a marriage. Freedom of\r\n    the press is guaranteed; the Confederation may enact penalties\r\n    against the abuse of the freedom of the press when directed\r\n    against it or its authorities. The right of petition is\r\n    guaranteed. No person shall be deprived of his constitutional\r\n    judge, and there shall consequently be no extraordinary\r\n    tribunal established.[18] Ecclesiastical jurisdiction is\r\n    abolished. Suits for personal claims against a solvent debtor\r\n    having a domicile in Switzerland must be brought before the\r\n    judge of his domicile; in consequence his property outside the\r\n    Canton in which he is domiciled may not be attached in suits\r\n    for personal claims; with reference to foreigners, however,\r\n    the provisions of the respective international treaties shall\r\n    apply. Imprisonment for debt is abolished. The exit duty on\r\n    property is abolished as respects foreign countries, provided\r\n    reciprocity be observed. The Confederation shall have power to\r\n    legislate:\r\n\r\n    1. On civil capacity.\r\n\r\n    2. On all legal questions relating to commerce and to\r\n    transactions affecting chattels (law of commercial obligations,\r\n    including commercial law and law of exchange).\r\n\r\n    3. On literary and artistic copyright.[19]\r\n\r\n    4. On the legal collection of debts and on bankruptcy.\r\n\r\n    Capital punishment abolished;[20] corporal punishment is\r\n    forbidden. The Confederation by law provides for the\r\n    extradition of accused persons from one Canton to another;\r\n    nevertheless, extradition shall not be made obligatory for\r\n    political offences and offences of the press. Measures shall be\r\n    taken by Federal law for the incorporation of persons without\r\n    a country.[21] The Confederation has power to expel from its\r\n    territory foreigners who endanger the internal or external\r\n    safety of Switzerland.\r\n\r\nThe second chapter embraces the _Federal Authorities_:\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n    1. The Federal Assembly or Legislative Department.\r\n\r\n    2. The Federal Council or Executive Department.\r\n\r\n    3. The Federal Tribunal or Judicial Department.[22]\r\n\r\n    4. The Federal Chancellery.\r\n\r\n    It is provided that the duties of Secretary to the Federal\r\n    Assembly and Federal Council shall be performed by a Federal\r\n    Chancellery under the direction of a Chancellor of the\r\n    Confederation. The Chancellor shall be chosen for the term of\r\n    three years by the Federal Assembly at the same time as the\r\n    Federal Council. The Chancellery shall be under the special\r\n    supervision of the Federal Council.\r\n\r\n    5. Miscellaneous provisions.\r\n\r\nThese are three in number:\r\n\r\n    1. All that relates to the location of the Federal authorities\r\n    is a subject to be determined by the Confederation.\r\n\r\n    2. The three principal languages spoken in Switzerland--German,\r\n    French, and Italian--shall be considered national languages of\r\n    the Confederation.[23]\r\n\r\n    3. The officials of the Confederation shall be responsible\r\n    for their conduct in office. Federal law shall define this\r\n    responsibility and the means of enforcing it.\r\n\r\nThe third chapter directs the method by which the Constitution can be\r\namended.\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n    1. The Federal Constitution may at any time be amended.\r\n\r\n    2. Each revision shall take place by the ordinary method of\r\n    Federal legislation.\r\n\r\n    3. If one branch of the Federal Assembly passes a resolution\r\n    for amendment of the Federal Constitution and the other does\r\n    not approve; or upon the demand of fifty thousand qualified\r\n    voters, in either case, the question whether the Constitution\r\n    ought to be amended must be submitted to a vote of the Swiss\r\n    people, voting yes or no. If a majority of the citizens voting\r\n    pronounce in the affirmative, there shall be a new election\r\n    of both branches of the Federal Assembly for the purpose of\r\n    preparing amendments.\r\n\r\n    4. The amended Constitution shall go into effect whenever\r\n    it shall receive a majority of all the votes cast, and the\r\n    approval of a majority of the Cantons. In determining the\r\n    majority of the Cantons, the vote of a half-Canton shall be\r\n    counted as half a vote. The result of the popular vote in each\r\n    Canton shall be taken as determining the vote of the Canton.[24]\r\n\r\nThe Constitution closes with five articles, styled _Temporary\r\nProvisions_:\r\n\r\n    1. The proceeds of the posts and customs shall be divided\r\n    upon the existing basis until such time as the Confederation\r\n    shall take upon itself the military expenses up to this time\r\n    borne by the Cantons. The loss which may be occasioned to the\r\n    finances of any Canton by the sum of the charges which result\r\n    from certain articles of the Constitution shall fall upon such\r\n    Canton only gradually.\r\n\r\n    2. The provisions of the Federal laws and of the Cantonal\r\n    concordats, constitutions or Cantonal laws which are contrary\r\n    to this Constitution cease to have effect by the adoption of\r\n    the Constitution, or when the Federal laws passed in pursuance\r\n    thereof, shall be published.\r\n\r\n    3. The new provisions in regard to the powers of the Federal\r\n    Tribunal shall not take effect until the passage of the Federal\r\n    laws relating to it.\r\n\r\n    4. The Cantons shall be allowed a period of five years within\r\n    which to introduce the system of free instruction in primary\r\n    public education.\r\n\r\n    5. Those persons who practise a liberal profession, and who\r\n    before the publication of the Federal law provided for by the\r\n    Constitution have obtained a certificate of competence from a\r\n    Canton or a joint authority representing several Cantons, may\r\n    pursue that profession throughout the Confederation.\r\n\r\nThere have been three amendments to the Constitution from the date of\r\nits adoption in 1874 to 1889 inclusive:\r\n\r\n    1. In 1879, Article lxv. of the Constitution abolishing capital\r\n    punishment was repealed, and in lieu thereof the following\r\n    substituted: “No death penalty shall be pronounced for a\r\n    political crime.”[25]\r\n\r\n    2. In 1885, Article xxxii. of the Constitution was modified\r\n    so that drinking-places and the retail trade in spirituous\r\n    liquors should be excepted from the guarantee of freedom of\r\n    trade and of industry; but the Cantons might by legislation\r\n    subject the keeping of drinking-places and the retail trade\r\n    in spirituous liquors to such restrictions as are required\r\n    for the public welfare. And Article xxxii. _bis_ was added\r\n    authorizing the Confederation by legislation to regulate the\r\n    manufacture and sale of alcohol. In this legislation those\r\n    products which are intended for exportation, or which have\r\n    been subjected to a process excluding them from use as a\r\n    beverage, shall be subjected to no tax. Distillation of wine,\r\n    fruit, and the products of gentian roots, juniper berries, and\r\n    similar products are not subject to Federal legislation as to\r\n    manufacture or tax. After the cessation of the import duties\r\n    on spirituous liquors, as provided for, the trade in liquors\r\n    not distilled shall not be subjected by the Cantons to any\r\n    special taxes, or to other limitations than those necessary\r\n    for protection against adulterated or noxious beverages.\r\n    Nevertheless the powers of the Cantons defined in the\r\n    Constitution are retained over the keeping of drinking-places,\r\n    and the sale at retail of quantities less than two _litres_.\r\n    The net proceeds resulting from taxation on the sale of alcohol\r\n    shall belong to the Cantons in which the tax is levied. The net\r\n    proceeds to the Confederation from the internal manufacture of\r\n    alcohol, and the corresponding addition to the duty on imported\r\n    alcohol, shall be divided among all the Cantons in proportion\r\n    to population. Out of the receipts therefrom the Cantons must\r\n    expend not less than one-tenth in combating drunkenness in its\r\n    causes and effects. The Confederation shall provide by law\r\n    that for such Cantons or Communes as may suffer financial loss\r\n    through the effect of this amendment, such loss shall not come\r\n    upon them immediately in its full extent, but gradually up to\r\n    the year of 1895.[26]\r\n\r\n    3. In 1887, Article lxiv. of the Constitution was so amended\r\n    as to give the Confederation the power to make laws, “On\r\n    the protection of new patterns and forms, and of inventions\r\n    which are represented in models and are capable of industrial\r\n    application.”\r\n\r\nAll amendments to the Swiss Constitution are incorporated in their\r\nlogical place in the text immediately upon their adoption.\r\n\r\nMuch legislation called for by the mandatory provisions of the\r\nConstitution, and suggested by the discretionary powers vested in\r\nthe Confederation, has passed into Federal statutory enactments. A\r\nfew may be mentioned. An elaborate law as to military service, tax\r\nfor exemption therefrom, and pensions; statutes regulating labor\r\nin factories, containing a wide range of provisions for the health\r\nand safety of employés; the practice of the professions of medicine\r\nand dentistry; the construction and management of railroads; the\r\nprotection of literary and artistic property and patents; hunting\r\nand fishing; the control of forests, dikes, and water-courses in the\r\nmountainous regions; the election of members of the Federal Assembly\r\nand organization of the Federal Tribunal; the method of taking the\r\n_Referendum_; rights of citizenship and expatriation; banking and\r\nbankruptcy; emigration and immigration. There are very comprehensive\r\nlaws also as to “civil capacity and obligations” and “marriage and\r\ndivorce.” The Federal law on “civil capacity and obligation” comprises\r\nmore than nine hundred articles, and deals with every imaginable kind\r\nof contract except that relating to the acquisition and transfer of the\r\nownership of land; this forming part of the independent legislation\r\nof the several Cantons. The law of “marriage and divorce” includes\r\nregistration of births and deaths, and presents a law which is a\r\ncarefully-prepared, scientific whole. The legal age of marriage;\r\ndegrees of consanguineous or other relationship; consent of parents;\r\nrules for notice of intention; provision for verifying the facts\r\nalleged; certification both of the fact and means of the dissolution of\r\na previous marriage, whether by death or divorce; strict requirements\r\nfor publication of the banns; restrictions as to locality within which\r\nthe marriage must occur; civil marriage made obligatory; and details of\r\nthe conditions under which marriages may be declared void and divorces\r\ngranted; these constitute some of the main features of the law.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution, with the evolution through Federal laws made\r\nnecessary by it, contains much detail, showing the mind of the\r\nGerman race therein. It is not confined to an enunciation of general\r\nprinciples, but determines specifically and at length, with some\r\nconfusion of repetition and at times distressing prolixity, many\r\nthings which, under a general provision, might have been clearly\r\ninterpreted to belong, as the case might be, to either the Federal\r\nor Cantonal authority. It contains a large number of articles which\r\nhave no reference to the distribution or exercise of sovereign power,\r\nbut which embody general maxims of policy or special provisions as to\r\nmatters of detail, to which the Swiss attach great importance, and\r\nwhich therefore they do not wish to be easily alterable. It goes far\r\nbeyond that of the United States in inscribing among constitutional\r\narticles either principles or petty rules which are supposed to have\r\na claim of legal sanctity. It gives to the Federal authorities power\r\nand supervision over a variety of special interests; a system that may\r\nwork well in a small country, but not in one so large as the United\r\nStates, with such diversified and local aspects. For these reasons the\r\ntext of the Swiss Constitution is not so brief,[27] nor its language so\r\nterse, as that of the United States, which a famous English statesman\r\nhas called, “The most wonderful work ever struck off at a given time\r\nby the brain and purpose of man.” The Swiss Constitution leaves little\r\nroom for contention in the construction of its phraseology, meaning\r\nthe same thing to-day, to-morrow, and forever. Its written provisions,\r\nstipulations, and guarantees leave little room for the exercise of\r\n“doubtful powers.” With such a mass of detail, the Confederation is not\r\ncompetent to act directly; the execution of much is left to the Cantons\r\nacting under the supervision of the Federal authorities, which only\r\ninterfere where the former neglect or refuse to fulfil their obligation.\r\n\r\nThe repeated and remarkable stipulations of the Constitution, reaching\r\nalmost every conceivable exercise of religious action and freedom,\r\npresent one of its most marked characteristics and radical departures\r\nfrom that of the United States. The latter contains only two allusions\r\nto the subject. The first in Article VI.: “No religious test shall ever\r\nbe required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the\r\nUnited States.” The second in the first amendment: “Congress shall\r\nmake no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting\r\nthe free exercise thereof.” Previous to the Swiss Constitution of\r\n1874 there was no mention of individual religious liberty. That of\r\n1848 guaranteed the free exercise of divine worship to the recognized\r\nconfessions, the Roman Catholic and the Reformed (_i.e._, the Church\r\nReformed by Zwingli and Calvin), but forbade the order of Jesuits. It\r\nis manifest that the framers of the Constitution of 1874 were resolved\r\nto effectually suppress the further exercise of the ecclesiastical\r\nnarrowness and sectarian antagonism which, as late as the Sonderbund\r\nWar of 1847, disturbed the peace and threatened the stability of the\r\nConfederation. The extreme rigor with which these provisions of the\r\nConstitution are enforced, and the latitude of action given under them\r\nto Cantonal authority, do appear at times to be strained to an extent\r\ndeaf to both humanity and common sense. In 1888, “Captain Stirling,” of\r\nthe Salvation Army, a subject of Great Britain, was sentenced in the\r\nCanton of Vaud to one hundred days’ imprisonment in Chillon Castle for\r\nattempting to proselyte some children. The appeal made in her behalf to\r\nthe Federal Council was refused, and she was compelled to complete the\r\nterm of her sentence. Surely no danger was threatened that might not\r\nhave been averted by her removal to the frontier, or the offence atoned\r\nfor by a slight fine. The case presented an appeal to that unknown\r\nquantity, the Swiss sense of the ridiculous. The sanctity of the law is\r\nall very well; but when the law is one against persons who sing hymns\r\nto children in the street, and its terrors are those of Bonnivard’s\r\nprison, the plot of the drama seems hardly equal to the majesty of the\r\nscene. To put a young lady, for so trivial an offence, under triple\r\nbolts and bars for months is a piling up of the agony which indicates a\r\nsingular weakness of dramatic resource. Perhaps the military style of\r\nthe movements in these days of alarming concentrations on Continental\r\nfrontiers may have invested the “colonels” and “captains” in the\r\nSalvationist train, even of the gentler sex, with undue importance\r\nand alarm. It is difficult to reconcile Federal and Cantonal action\r\nin Switzerland in this and other instances with the spirit of the\r\ninviolability of freedom of faith and conscience guaranteed by the\r\nConstitution. Religious liberty encounters no little restriction and\r\nabridgment in several of the Cantons. Each Canton has still its own\r\nestablished Church, supported and ruled by the civil magistrate. In\r\nrecent times free churches have been founded in Geneva, Neuchâtel,\r\nand Vaud, and are showing a high degree of spiritual vitality and\r\nliberality. It would be better if it could work out an entire\r\ndissolution of the connection between Church and State throughout the\r\nConfederation, and religion be allowed to take its natural course.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of Switzerland is a conscious and sagacious\r\nreproduction of the Constitution of the United States, with noteworthy\r\nvariations called for by the different conditions of the two\r\ncommonwealths. The Government of the United States is one of limited\r\nand enumerated powers; “the powers not delegated to the United States\r\nby the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved\r\nto the States respectively, or to the people.” The restrictions under\r\nthe Swiss Constitution apply mostly to the Cantons. In Switzerland, as\r\nin the United States, there is no single determinate sovereign body\r\nor assembly, or any real sovereign other than the people themselves.\r\nIn the Swiss Confederation the popular will does everything; the\r\nlegislative power being directly exercised by the body of the people\r\nby way of _Referendums_. In the Republic of France the tendency is\r\nto centralize the direction of public affairs almost entirely in\r\nthe Chamber of Deputies. In the United States it is claimed, with\r\nsome color of truth, that the initiative and legislation are being\r\ngradually taken away from Congress by a very occult, but authoritative,\r\ngovernment of committees.\r\n\r\nThe separation of persons and functions is most complete in the\r\nUnited States; the Constitution enforcing a distribution of powers,\r\nand directly or indirectly the powers of every authority existing\r\nunder it are defined, limited, and carefully regulated. In the\r\nSwiss Constitution these respective powers are not at all clearly\r\ndistinguished; in fact, they seem to have been purposely left\r\nindeterminate. There are none of the elaborate checks and interlocking\r\nvetoes found in the United States. It is true the Swiss have the\r\nthree organs,--a Federal Legislature, a Federal Executive, and a\r\nFederal Court; but they fail in the strict separation of each of these\r\ndepartments from and its independence of the other. Said John Adams,\r\n“Here is a complication and refinement of balances, which for anything\r\nI recollect, is an invention of our own and peculiar to us.”\r\n\r\nThere is also an entire absence from the Swiss Constitution of any\r\nprovisions touching those personal rights and ancient muniments of\r\nliberty designated as the “Bill of Rights;” such as are contained in\r\nthe first ten amendments of the Constitution of the United States;\r\nthose fundamental principles that guarantee to the individual a sphere\r\nof liberty upon which the government may not encroach; a branch of\r\nconstitutional law which it has been the peculiar province of American\r\npolitical science to develop. This omission from the Swiss Constitution\r\nmay have been for the same reason that it occurred in the original\r\nConstitution of the United States; that these rights were sufficiently\r\nimplied and understood in any system of free government. These cardinal\r\nrights are claimed by the Swiss to be expressly provided for in the\r\nCantonal constitutions. Again, it is held that all these inherent and\r\nindefeasible rights are amply secured by the article of the Federal\r\nConstitution requiring the organic law of the Cantons to “insure the\r\nexercise of political rights after republican forms.”\r\n\r\nHamilton met the objection to the Constitution of the United States\r\ncontaining no “Bill of Rights,” in the “Federalist” (No. 84), by\r\nsaying, “Bills of rights are, in their origin, stipulations between\r\nkings and their subjects, abridgments of prerogative in favor of\r\nprivilege, reservation of rights not surrendered to the prince. It is\r\nevident, therefore, that, according to their primitive signification,\r\nthey have no application to constitutions professedly founded upon the\r\npower of the people, and executed by their immediate representatives\r\nand servants. Here in strictness the people surrender nothing; and as\r\nthey retain everything they have no need of particular reservations.”\r\nBut Jefferson expressed the prevalent opinion when he wrote, “The\r\nexecutive in our governments is not the sole, it is scarcely the\r\nprincipal, object of my jealousy. The tyranny of the legislatures is\r\nthe most formidable dread at present, and will be for many years.”\r\nThese restraints upon legislative power have proven most fortunate ones\r\nin the United States; for the provision, “No person shall be deprived\r\nof life, liberty, or property without due process of law,” together\r\nwith those provisions which forbid the taking of private property\r\nfor public use without just compensation, and the enactment of laws\r\nimpairing the obligation of contracts, lies at the foundation of all\r\nconstitutional protection of private rights in the citizen. Thus a\r\nbody of constitutional law has been formed which is not yet completely\r\ncrystallized, but is being daily shaped by the decisions of the courts.\r\nIn annexing the “Bill of Rights,” the founders of the government may\r\nnot have had a correct idea as to what would be the full effect of its\r\nprovisions, but the object they had in view was perfectly clear. They\r\nbelieved that wherever power was placed, it was liable to be abused.\r\nThey intended to restrain the impulse of popular majorities, and more\r\nespecially to prevent the legislature from becoming despotic and\r\ntyrannous. But the number of rights which can be effectually protected\r\nby the Constitution is very limited; and the legislature must always\r\nretain sufficient power to disturb seriously all social relations,\r\nif it is determined to make use for this purpose of the means at its\r\ncommand. The utmost that a constitution can be expected to do is to\r\nprotect directly a small number of vested rights, and to discourage and\r\ncheck indirectly the growth of a demand for radical measures.\r\n\r\nThe power of the general government in Switzerland, as that of the\r\nUnited States, extends not merely to those affairs which are turned\r\nover to it by the exact words of the Constitution itself, but also\r\nto the relations whose control by the central government appears as\r\na necessity for its performance of the duties devolving upon it. In\r\na comparison of the Swiss Federal polity with that of the United\r\nStates, it must be borne in mind that the infinite variety in the\r\nlocal and otherwise peculiar circumstances of different nations,\r\nproduces wide discrepancies between governments bearing a common\r\nappellation. There exists, indeed, but little community of opinion\r\nor uniformity of practice beyond the circumscribed limits of those\r\nmaxims in politics which are deducible by direct inference from moral\r\ntruths. The great mass of those rules and principles which have a more\r\nimmediate influence on practice, and give to government its tone and\r\npeculiar organization, are of a description purely local; deriving\r\ntheir force from local interests, and therefore, however just, are only\r\napplicable in their full extent to the particular case. Hence it is\r\nthat constitutions, nominally and externally the same, have little or\r\nno interior resemblance, and in many instances only so far correspond\r\nas to justify us in referring them to one common standard. The United\r\nStates and Switzerland have republican states joined in a republican\r\nunion, with a division of powers between states and union approximately\r\nthe same; and they present the most completely developed types of\r\nthat federalism “which desires union and does not desire unity;” the\r\nsame problem upon which all civilized peoples have been working ever\r\nsince civilization began,--how to insure peaceful concerted action\r\nthroughout the whole, without infringing upon local and individual\r\nfreedom in the parts; to reconcile the welfare and security of the\r\nwhole with the local claims and diversified institutions of the\r\ncomponent parts. The Swiss Constitution blends these ends harmoniously\r\nin a government not too centralized to act in the interest of the\r\nlocalities; but a little too closely wedded to routine to adapt itself\r\nto changing conditions. The federative principle implies the existence\r\nof opposing tendencies, active within a superior agency, which is\r\ncapable of regulating their mutual aggression, and of securing their\r\nharmony. Over the two historical forces, _Nationalism_ and _Localism_,\r\nthe federative principle asserts its supremacy, and gives them\r\nsimultaneous, correlated, and adequate expression. Under confederation,\r\nboth _Nationalism_ and _Localism_ by different processes increase\r\neach its original determinative strength; and the danger arises that\r\neither alone might force a union of but partial means and incapable of\r\nthe highest end. The federative principle by its own creative energy\r\nchooses the time and method of its complete self-assertion, and brings\r\nits factors to the work of “forming the more perfect union.” Thus\r\n_Nationalism_ and _Localism_, though their methods are in constant\r\nwarfare, their aim is one,--the good of the individual, who in his dual\r\nrelation is an epitome of the controlling principle. A complete harmony\r\nof the two elements of the federative principle can never be realized;\r\nbut the tendency is ever towards harmony, thus placing before our hopes\r\nan ideal state. In constructing his ideal republic, Plato rejects\r\ndiscordant powers and forces which would bring false harmony, and\r\nleaves but two essential elements: “These two harmonies I ask you to\r\nleave,--the strain of necessity and the strain of freedom, the strain\r\nof courage and the strain of temperance.” In a republic, national will\r\nand local self-rule--the one federative principle--constitute true\r\nharmony.[28]\r\n\r\nThe question of government is a question of the application of means to\r\nan end; that end being, in general terms, the happiness and prosperity\r\nof the people. Government considered as comprehending those laws and\r\nprinciples which regulate the conduct of the individual in his relative\r\ncapacity to the state, being continually present to his mind, must\r\ninvariably influence his habits of thinking and acting. The genius of\r\nthe organic law, the Constitution, is transfused into the national\r\nmind, and in the character of the citizens we recognize the congenial\r\nspirit of the laws.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Swiss Constitution is the history of a confederation\r\nof free Cantons, uniting city and rural communities in a common\r\nleague; providing at once for separate autonomies, and for confederate\r\nunion and government; insuring mutual protection and a national\r\npolicy. It represents a wise and politic union; a union constituting\r\nan honorable European state in the full enjoyment of its ancient\r\nfranchises; a union of strength and national life and enduring liberty.\r\nTimes and circumstances taught their own lesson; civil and religious\r\nestablishments were imperfectly produced, roughly moulded, and slowly\r\nimproved, but they were adequate to dispense the blessings of a\r\nfree government to a brave and artless people, in a state of great\r\ncomparative independence and honor, security and happiness.\r\n\r\nA constitution is valuable in proportion as it is suited to the\r\ncircumstances, desires, and aspirations of the people, and as it\r\ncontains within itself the elements of stability and security\r\nagainst disorder and revolution. Measured by this standard, the\r\nSwiss Constitution is an excellent adaptation to the conditions of\r\na most varied and composite nationality. With a strong paternal\r\ntendency, the Constitution takes cognizance of the citizen at his\r\nbirth by registration, and guarding him through life with legislative\r\nscrutiny, vigilant and minute, it insures him a “decent burial.” Yet\r\nthis searching, far-reaching, central authority is administered in\r\na beneficent and patriotic spirit, with a jealous regard for all the\r\nhighest natural rights of man.\r\n\r\nFederalism tends to conservatism; it is almost certain to impress on\r\nthe minds of citizens the idea that any provision included in the\r\norganic law is immutable and, so to speak, sacred. History shows that\r\nthose states have been most stable and prosperous which, in casting\r\noff an old allegiance or in ordering their political constitutions\r\nafresh, made no more changes than were absolutely needful, and did not\r\nviolently snap the tie between the old and the new state of things;\r\nthat the best form of government will commonly be that which the events\r\nof its history have given it,--a government which has arisen out of\r\nthe events and necessities of the country. Switzerland and the United\r\nStates are examples of commonwealths whose success has been largely\r\nowing to the comparatively small amount of change which accompanied\r\ntheir acquisition of independence. Each has that form of government\r\nwhich the events of its history have made natural for it. In each the\r\nexisting political system is founded on the practical needs of the time\r\nand place. Referring to the preamble of the _Declaration of Rights_,\r\nwherein the prayer is made, “That it may be declared and enacted that\r\nall and singular the rights and liberties asserted and declared, are\r\nthe true ancient and indubitable rights and liberties of the people\r\nof this kingdom,” Burke says, “By adhering in this manner to our\r\nforefathers, we are guided, not by the superstition of antiquarians,\r\nbut the spirit of philosophic analogy. In this choice of inheritance\r\nwe have given to our frame of policy the image of a relation in blood,\r\nbinding up the constitution of our country with our dearest domestic\r\nties, adopting our fundamental laws into the bosom of our family\r\naffections; keeping inseparable, and cherishing with the warmth of\r\nall their combined and mutually reflected charities, our state, our\r\nhearths, our sepulchres, and our altars.” Switzerland and the United\r\nStates in their organic law and its application, while presenting many\r\nand essential differences, constitute the only two genuine and thorough\r\nrepublics in existence; and each system better suits the position\r\nof the nation which has adopted it. Switzerland, though beyond all\r\nothers a regenerate nation, was still an old nation; above all things\r\na system was needed which should preserve everything and jeopardize\r\nnothing. She seized on a rare and happy moment, when all the despots\r\nof Europe had enough to do at home, to reform her constitution without\r\nforeign intermeddling; and she formed a system which exactly suits\r\nthe position of a small, free, conservative power, ready as ever to\r\ndefend its own, but neither capable nor desirous of aggrandizement at\r\nthe expense of others. The Swiss have a way of keeping their current\r\nhistory to themselves; or the outside world has a way of not asking\r\nfor it, which is much the same thing. They are unique among civilized\r\npeople for the extreme modesty of their claim upon the attention of\r\nmankind. This might imply the highest qualities or the lowest; but no\r\none who knows anything of the little republic will doubt to which of\r\nthem it is to be assigned. She lives, moves, and works without fuss or\r\nfriction; and is constantly solving in her own way some of the hardest\r\nproblems of politics. She has found out how to maintain perfect peace\r\nbetween diverse races and conflicting creeds; to adjust and harmonize\r\ndiscordant views and principles; and preserve to the several elements\r\nof the confederacy a due proportion of constitutional authority. This\r\ndifficult task has been accomplished, not indeed without frictions,\r\nnot without armed collisions, and not until after many trials and\r\nexperiments; but it has been done, and on the whole successfully.\r\n\r\nNothing is so easy as to find fault in every form of government, and\r\nnothing so hard as to show a perfect one reduced to practice. Most of\r\nthe plans of government seem to have been formed like houses built\r\nat several times; for as the old parts of them always deface the new\r\nand render them irregular, so upon the establishment of any new frame\r\nsomething of the old is still preserved and enters into the frame of\r\nthe new, which is not of a piece with it, and consequently spoils its\r\nsymmetry. No one can look closely into the Constitution of Switzerland\r\nand fail to discover that, in its provisions, the principles of a\r\ndemocratic confederation find the elements of sound and vigorous health.\r\n\r\nEnlightened freedom, governed and secured by law, upholds the fabric\r\nof the Constitution; salubrious streams issuing from education and\r\npatriotism, consecrated by religion, mingle with each other, and\r\nunite in diffusing fertility through every channel of the state. The\r\neverlasting league still lives on, to shame the novel and momentary\r\ndevices of the kingdoms and commonwealths which rise and fall around\r\nit.[29]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERAL ASSEMBLY.\r\n\r\nBundesversammlung; Assemblée fédérale.\r\n\r\n\r\n“A legislative, and an executive, and a judicial power comprehend the\r\nwhole of what is meant by government.”[30] We find in Switzerland this\r\ngeneral division of powers, with many interesting and instructive\r\npeculiarities, which give the Swiss federalism an individual character.\r\n\r\nThe need for two chambers in a federal state has become an axiom of\r\npolitical science. Where there is a twofold sovereignty, that of the\r\nwhole nation, and that of the states or Cantons, which are joined\r\ntogether to form it, each sovereignty must be represented in the\r\nlegislature. With the two chambers, one representing the people as\r\na whole, the other the integral parts as constituent members of the\r\nwhole, each element is a check upon the other by the coexistence of\r\nequal authority. By the Constitution of 1874, “With reservation of\r\nthe rights of the people and of the Cantons the supreme authority of\r\nthe Swiss Confederation is exercised by the Federal Assembly, which\r\nconsists of two sections or councils, to wit:\r\n\r\n“1. The National Council (_Nationalrath_; _Conseil National_).\r\n\r\n2. The Council of States (_Ständerath_; _Conseil des États_).”\r\n\r\nRelating to the National Council, the Constitution has eight articles,\r\nviz.:\r\n\r\n1. The National Council is composed of representatives of the Swiss\r\npeople, chosen in the ratio of one member for each twenty thousand\r\npersons of the total population. Fractions of upward of ten thousand\r\npersons are reckoned as twenty thousand. Every Canton, and in the\r\ndivided Cantons every half-Canton, chooses at least one representative.\r\n\r\n2. The elections for the National Council are direct. They are held in\r\nfederal electoral districts, which in no case shall be formed out of\r\nparts of different Cantons.\r\n\r\n3. Every male Swiss who has completed twenty years of age, and who\r\nin addition is not excluded from the rights of active citizenship\r\nby the legislation of the Canton in which he is domiciled, has the\r\nright to take part in elections and popular votes. Nevertheless, the\r\nConfederation by law may establish uniform regulations for the exercise\r\nof such right.\r\n\r\n4. Every lay Swiss citizen who has the right to vote is eligible as\r\nmember of the National Council.\r\n\r\n5. The National Council is elected for three years, and entirely\r\nrenewed at each general election.\r\n\r\n6. Members of the Council of States, or of the Federal Council, or\r\nofficials appointed by the latter, shall not at the same time be\r\nmembers of the National Council.\r\n\r\n7. The National Council chooses from among its members, for each\r\nregular or extraordinary session, a President and a Vice-President. A\r\nmember who has held the office of President during the regular session\r\nis not eligible either for President or Vice-President of the next\r\nregular session. The same member may not be Vice-President for two\r\nconsecutive regular sessions. The President shall have the casting vote\r\nin case of a tie; in elections, he votes in the same manner as any\r\nother member.\r\n\r\n8. The members of the National Council receive a compensation from the\r\nfederal treasury.\r\n\r\nThe qualification of the elector, as above described, is that of being\r\nin the enjoyment of the “active right of citizenship,”--_i.e._, not\r\nexcluded from the rights of a voter by the legislation of his Canton.\r\nThis also applies to those who have been deprived of their civic rights\r\nby virtue of the penal law, and in consequence of a judicial sentence;\r\nand in some Cantons embraces insolvents and paupers. The limitation\r\nof eligibility to “lay” Swiss citizens does not necessarily exclude\r\necclesiastics, as illustrated in a recent case of a Bernese clergyman,\r\nwho, being chosen a member of the National Council, simply laid aside\r\ntemporarily, by resignation, his clerical robes; should he fail any\r\ntime of re-election he may return to the pulpit. Naturalized citizens\r\nare not eligible until five years after they have become citizens. The\r\nprovision forbidding a member to hold the office of President for two\r\nconsecutive ordinary sessions makes it possible, during the life of\r\na National Council, for one-fourth of the Cantons (even counting the\r\nhalf-Cantons) to be honored with this officer; and certainly gives but\r\nlittle opportunity for the building up of a one-man power, just this\r\nside of absolute. The power of the presiding officer of the National\r\nCouncil is too insignificant to justify any parallel with that of the\r\nSpeaker of the United States House of Representatives. A federal law\r\nregulates in a uniform manner, and by ballot, the election for members\r\nof the National Council; the execution of the law is entirely under\r\nthe direction of the Canton, and in immaterial details there is a\r\ngreat diversity. There are registers in each Commune, in which every\r\ncitizen having a vote must be inscribed. These registers are open two\r\nweeks before the day of the election, and close three days previous\r\nto it. In some Cantons, a card from the Commune where the voter is\r\nregistered is left at his house; in others, he must present himself\r\nat the proper office and obtain his card. The election takes place on\r\nthe last Sunday in October triennially. The polls generally are in the\r\nchurches, and no one is permitted to enter except upon the presentation\r\nof the requisite proof as to his right to vote. Candidates must be\r\nelected by an absolute majority of the votes cast. Should there be a\r\nfailure of election, a second ballot under the same conditions is had\r\nthe following Sunday. If a third ballot becomes necessary, the election\r\nis again repeated the next Sunday, when the _scrutin de liste_ is\r\nrestricted to a number not exceeding three times the number of members\r\nto be chosen; and these must be taken in order from those receiving the\r\nlargest vote in the previous _tours de scrutin_. In this final trial\r\nthe candidate or candidates, as the case may be, having a plurality\r\nare elected. The members are elected on a general ticket,--that is,\r\n“at large” for the district, not for the Canton. These districts are\r\ncalled _arrondissements_, and the method of voting is known as _scrutin\r\nd’arrondissement_.\r\n\r\nThe National Council at present consists of one hundred and forty-five\r\nmembers, apportioned among forty-nine electoral districts. The\r\nnumber returned from these districts varies from one to five members\r\neach. The Cantons of Uri and Zug, and the half-Cantons of Obwald,\r\nNidwald, and Inner-Rhoden compose only one district each. Bern has six\r\ndistricts and twenty-seven members; Zurich, four districts and sixteen\r\nmembers. Every elector is entitled to vote for as many members as his\r\ndistrict is entitled to, but not cumulatively. A federal census for\r\nthe apportionment of representation is taken every ten years. Members\r\nreceive a compensation of twenty francs per day (about $3⁸⁶⁄₁₀₀) when\r\nthe National Council is in session,[31] and a travelling allowance of\r\ntwenty centimes per kilometre (a fraction under .03 per mile). A member\r\nloses his _per diem_ if he does not answer the roll-call at the opening\r\nof the day’s session, unless he should appear later and give to the\r\nsecretary a sufficient excuse for his dilatoriness. If subsequently,\r\nduring that day’s session, there is a vote by roll-call (_appel\r\nnominal_), or if there is a count of the House to ascertain the\r\npresence of a quorum, the compensation of the members whose absence is\r\ndisclosed is forfeited for that day. This law is not a “dead letter,”\r\nbut is strictly enforced, and with a frugal-minded people tends to keep\r\nthe members in their seats.\r\n\r\nThe Council of States (_Ständerath_; _Conseil des États_).\r\n\r\nThe space devoted to the Council of States in the Constitution is\r\none-half of that given to the National Council, and is comprised within\r\nfour articles:\r\n\r\n1. The Council of States consists of forty-four representatives of the\r\nCantons. Each Canton elects two representatives, and in the divided\r\nCantons, each half-Canton elects one.\r\n\r\n2. No member of the National Council or of the Federal Council may be\r\nat the same time a member of the Council of States.\r\n\r\n3. The Council of States elects from among its members a President and\r\nVice-President for each regular and extraordinary session. From among\r\nthe representatives of that Canton from which a President has been\r\nelected for a regular session, neither the President nor Vice-President\r\ncan be taken for the next following regular session. Representatives of\r\nthe same Canton cannot occupy the position of Vice-President during two\r\nconsecutive regular sessions. When the votes are equally divided, the\r\nPresident has a casting vote; in elections, he votes in the same manner\r\nas the other members.\r\n\r\n4. Members of the Council of States receive compensation from their\r\nrespective Cantons.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the two Houses is manifestly borrowed from the\r\nmodel of the United States; but it is apparent that the Council of\r\nStates does not so closely correspond with the Senate of the United\r\nStates as the National Council does to the House of Representatives. It\r\nhas no such clearly-defined character as the Senate in distinctively\r\nrepresenting the federal feature of the union between the Cantons.\r\nFor the mode in which its members shall be elected, the qualifications\r\nwhich they shall possess, the length of time which they shall serve,\r\nthe salary which they shall receive, and the relations they shall bear\r\nto those whom they represent, in fact, every element of their character\r\nas representatives is left to the Canton, and a great variety of\r\nprovisions prevail.[32] The small Cantons in which the people assemble\r\nannually (_Landsgemeinde_) have their members elected by this assembly,\r\nby the raising up of hands for such or such a candidate. In other\r\nCantons, including Zurich, Thurgau, and Basel-rural, the whole Canton\r\nforms but one district for the nomination of the members; the votes\r\nare deposited in the ballot-box of the Commune, and are collected and\r\ncounted by a cantonal board. In the Cantons having the representative\r\nsystem, such as Geneva, Freiburg, Ticino, and Bern, they are chosen\r\nby the cantonal legislative body. The terms of the members vary from\r\none to three years; twelve Cantons elect for one year, twelve for\r\nthree years, with Valais holding to the mean of two years. Their\r\ncompensation, paid by the Canton, is the same as that received by the\r\nmembers of the National Council, with the exception of Geneva, where\r\nit is double the amount, or forty francs. When serving on committees\r\nduring recess, the members of the Council of States are paid by the\r\nConfederation. The Vice-Chancellor serves as Secretary of the Council\r\nof States.\r\n\r\nThe Council of States has no special executive powers apart from the\r\nNational Council like the United States Senate; which in some respect\r\ngive that body a further strength and dignity of its own. The Swiss\r\nSenate rests solely on its general position as one necessary element of\r\nthe federal system. The two branches of the Assembly are co-ordinate,\r\nstanding in all respects on an equal footing. The work of each\r\nsession, so far as known at its opening, is divided between the two\r\nHouses by a conference of their Presidents. The right of initiative\r\nbelongs to each House, and to each member of the Assembly. There may be\r\na shade of superior consequence and dignity attaching to the National\r\nCouncil. It is designated first in order by the Constitution, it has a\r\nfixed term of service, and when the two Houses are in joint session,\r\nthe President of the National Council takes the chair. In the National\r\nCouncil are to be found the more ambitious and active men in political\r\nlife, for the members of the Federal Council are sure to be chosen\r\nfrom this body. The members of both Houses equally enjoy the usual\r\nprivileges and immunities of members of representative bodies. The\r\ntwo Houses act separately in all strictly legislative matters; coming\r\ntogether for deliberation in common only for the exercise of certain\r\nelectoral and judicial functions.\r\n\r\nThe powers of the Federal Assembly are thus set forth in the\r\nConstitution\r\n\r\n1. The National Council and the Council of States have jurisdiction\r\nover all subjects which the present constitution places within the\r\ncompetence of the Confederation, and which are not assigned to other\r\nfederal authorities.\r\n\r\n2. The subjects which fall within the competence of the two Councils\r\nare particularly the following:\r\n\r\nLaws pertaining to the organization and election of federal authorities.\r\n\r\nLaws and ordinances on subjects intrusted by the Federal Constitution\r\nto the Confederation.\r\n\r\nThe salary and compensation of members of the federal governing bodies,\r\nand of the Federal Chancellery; the establishment of federal offices,\r\nand determination of their salaries.\r\n\r\nThe election of the Federal Council, of the Federal Tribunal, of the\r\nFederal Chancellor, and of the General of the Federal Army.[33]\r\n\r\nAlliances and treaties with foreign countries, and the approval of\r\ntreaties made by the Cantons between themselves or with foreign powers;\r\nsuch cantonal treaties shall, however, not be submitted to the Federal\r\nAssembly, unless objection be raised to them by the Federal Council or\r\nby another Canton.\r\n\r\nMeasures for external safety; for the maintenance of the independence\r\nand neutrality of Switzerland; the declaration of war and the\r\nconclusion of peace.\r\n\r\nThe guarantee of the constitutions and the territory of the Cantons;\r\nintervention in consequence of such guarantee; measures for the\r\ninternal safety of Switzerland, for the maintenance of peace and order;\r\namnesty and pardon.[34]\r\n\r\nMeasures for securing observance of the Federal constitution; for\r\ncarrying out the guarantee of the Cantonal constitutions, and for the\r\nfulfilment of federal obligations.\r\n\r\nThe power of controlling the federal army.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the yearly budget, the audit of public accounts,\r\nand federal ordinances authorizing loans.\r\n\r\nGeneral supervision of the federal administration and of federal\r\ncourts; appeals from the decisions of the Federal Council upon\r\nadministrative conflicts of jurisdiction between federal authorities.\r\n\r\nRevision of the Federal constitution.\r\n\r\n3. Both Councils shall assemble once each year in regular session, on\r\na day to be fixed by the standing orders.[35] They may be convened in\r\nextra session by the Federal Council, or on demand of one-fourth of the\r\nmembers of the National Council, or of five Cantons.\r\n\r\n4. In either Council a quorum is a majority of the total number of its\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n5. In the National Council and in the Council of States, a majority of\r\nthose voting shall decide the question.\r\n\r\n6. For federal laws, decrees, and resolutions, the consent of both\r\nCouncils is necessary. Federal laws shall be submitted for acceptance\r\nor rejection by the people upon the demand of thirty thousand qualified\r\nvoters, or of eight Cantons. The same principle applies to federal\r\nresolutions, which have a general application, and which are not of an\r\nurgent nature.\r\n\r\n7. The Confederation shall by law establish the forms and times of\r\npopular voting.\r\n\r\n8. Members of either Council vote without instructions.\r\n\r\n9. The Councils deliberate separately. But in the case of the elections\r\n(specified in Section 2), of pardons, or of deciding a conflict of\r\njurisdiction, the two Councils meet in joint session, under the\r\ndirection of the President of the National Council. Votes shall be\r\ndecided by simple majority of the members of both Councils, present and\r\nvoting.\r\n\r\n10. Measures may originate in either Council, and may be introduced by\r\nany member of each Council.\r\n\r\n11. The sittings of both Councils shall, as a rule, be public.\r\n\r\nThe law-making department in any sovereign state is the repository\r\nof most power; consequently the constitution of Switzerland, like\r\nthat of the United States, after enumerating the powers which shall\r\nbe exercised by authority of the general government, confers them in\r\nterms upon the most immediate representative of the sovereignty. In\r\nSwitzerland this is the Federal Assembly; in the United States it\r\nis Congress. The scope of powers conferred upon the Swiss Federal\r\nAssembly enables it to exercise not only legislative, but supervisory,\r\nexecutive, and judicial functions. The separation of its powers from\r\nthose of the Federal Council and the Federal Tribunal--the executive\r\nand judicial departments--is neither clearly set forth nor in practice\r\nis it strictly observed. Cases have occurred, the jurisdiction over\r\nwhich being involved in so much doubt, the interested parties, from\r\nabundance of caution, submitted their memorials simultaneously to two\r\nof these federal departments. The Swiss Federal Assembly exercises a\r\npower more comprehensive and greater than that given probably to any\r\nlegislative body; at least in a republic, where there is a professed\r\norganic distribution of the three great heads. It elects the Federal\r\nExecutive, Federal Judiciary, and the Commander of the Army. It is\r\nthe final arbiter on all questions as to the respective jurisdiction\r\nof the Executive and the Federal Court. It would appear that there\r\nis no decision of the Executive which cannot be revised by it. It is\r\nthe chief power in the land. No veto can intervene nor any judicial\r\npower question the constitutionality of its statutes. Its acts form\r\nthe law which the court must execute. The Swiss people, as it were,\r\nspeak in each legislative enactment; and the only check or revision\r\nto which it is amenable rests with the people themselves by means of\r\nthe _Referendum_. The authority of the Swiss Assembly, it is true,\r\nexceeds that of the Congress of the United States, and yet it may be\r\nregarded as a weaker body. For while in each case there lies in the\r\nbackground a legislative sovereign, capable of controlling the action\r\nof the ordinary legislature, the sovereign power is far more easily\r\nbrought into play in Switzerland than in the United States. Again,\r\nevery ordinary law passed by the Swiss Assembly may be annulled by a\r\npopular vote. The freedom from instruction secured to the members of\r\nthe Federal Assembly was first declared in the Swiss Constitution of\r\n1848. The whole history of the representative principle proves the\r\nsoundness of the doctrine, that the vesting an entire discretion in\r\nthe representative is an essential part of the definition. It is not\r\nto the power of instructing the representative that constituents are\r\nto look for an assurance that his efforts will be faithfully applied\r\nto the public service; but it is to the power of reducing him from\r\nthe elevation to which their suffrages have raised him. The object to\r\nbe obtained is not to compel the representative to decide agreeably\r\nto the opinions of his constituents, for that would be compelling him\r\noften to decide against his better judgment; but it is to force him\r\nto decide with a single view to the public good. It is by leaving him\r\nunshackled with positive instructions, while he is subject to the\r\nultimate tribunal of the opinion of his constituents, that the end in\r\nview is to be accomplished of bringing into action, in the proceedings\r\nof the legislature, the greatest practicable quantity of intelligence\r\nunder the guidance of the purest disposition to promote the welfare of\r\nthe community. The view which Burke takes of the relation between a\r\nrepresentative and his constituents is in the main so correct, and is\r\nso luminously expressed, that no one can read it without pleasure and\r\ninstruction. The passage occurs in his celebrated speech at Bristol\r\non the conclusion of the poll. “Certainly, gentlemen,” he says, “it\r\nought to be the happiness and glory of a representative to live in the\r\nstrictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved\r\ncommunication with his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great\r\nweight with him; their opinion high respect; their business unremitted\r\nattention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures,\r\nhis satisfactions to theirs; and above all, ever and in all cases to\r\nprefer their interest to his own. But his unbiased opinion, his matured\r\njudgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you,\r\nto any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from\r\nyour pleasure; no, nor from the law and the constitution. They are a\r\ntrust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable.\r\nYour representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment;\r\nand he betrays instead of serving you if he sacrifices it to your\r\nopinion.”\r\n\r\nNeither the Constitution of the United States, nor that of Switzerland,\r\nvests anywhere any power of dissolution of the legislative body. The\r\nSwiss Assembly is chosen for a definite time; when that time is up it\r\ndissolves by the operation of the law; before that time is up no power\r\ncan lawfully dissolve it.\r\n\r\nEither the National Council or Council of States can recommend to the\r\nFederal Council that it shall prepare and present for its consideration\r\ncertain bills; or a member can suggest one to his own House, and, if\r\nagreeable, the matter will be referred to the Federal Council with\r\ninstruction to draft the necessary bill; or the Federal Council itself\r\npresents bills upon its own initiative. The Assembly recommends to\r\nthe Federal Council by motions, called _postulats_, such alterations\r\nor reform in bills submitted by it as seem to them to be proper. If\r\nthe Federal Council does not assent to a particular _postulat_ coming\r\nfrom one of the Houses, it makes a report to that effect to the House,\r\nand if the latter insists upon its view, then a formal proposition is\r\ndrawn up, and if carried in both Houses, the Federal Council is bound\r\nto execute its provisions. It must be understood that every bill must\r\npass through the hands of the Federal Council, and by it laid before\r\nthe Assembly. When a bill is presented by the Federal Council, the\r\nHouse, which has first to take it up, appoints a committee to examine\r\nand report upon it. These committees or commissions are appointed as\r\nthe occasion arises,--there being no standing committees,--by the\r\nPresident of the House and the _scrutateurs_; constituting together\r\nwhat is called a _bureau_. These _scrutateurs_, four in the National\r\nCouncil and two in the Council of States, are elected every session\r\nfrom the members of their respective Houses; and it is also their duty\r\nto determine and to announce the result, whenever a vote is had, either\r\nby ballot, division, or _viva voce_; they occupy an elevated position\r\nto the right of the President. On the submission of a committee’s\r\nreport, the bill is discussed, and ultimately either passed with or\r\nwithout amendments, or rejected. If passed, it goes to the other House,\r\nwhere a similar process is undergone. When passed by both Houses it\r\nbecomes law, and is published as such by the Federal Council in the\r\n_Feuille fédérale Suisse_; subject, however, to the _Referendum_, if\r\nduly demanded. The Federal Council, in publishing a law, decree, or\r\nresolution not subject to the _Referendum_, fixes the date when it\r\nshall go into force, if this is not done in the text of the bill.\r\nGenerally, this date is the day of publication. For all measures liable\r\nto the _Referendum_, what is termed _délai d’opposition_ is named,\r\nbeing a period of three months, during which the appeal to the popular\r\nvote can be demanded. In case of no appeal being taken, the law goes\r\ninto force after the expiration of the three months.\r\n\r\nThe daily sittings of the Assembly open at eight o’clock in the\r\nmorning during the June session, and nine o’clock during the December\r\nsession; the adjournments are usually from one to two o’clock P.M. The\r\nsessions never extend beyond three weeks. It requires from the federal\r\ntreasury a small sum to defray the entire annual cost of the Assembly.\r\nIn the legislative appropriation bill for 1889 the following sums\r\nwere provided for the compensation of the two Houses of the Assembly:\r\n_Ständerath_, salaries and mileage of committees, 10,000 francs;\r\nsalary and mileage of translator, 3000 francs; service, 2500 francs;\r\ntotal, 15,500 francs; _Nationalrath_, salaries and mileage of members\r\nand members of committees, 200,000 francs; translator, 3000 francs;\r\nservice, 3000 francs; total, 206,000 francs. So the entire outlay of\r\nthe country for its legislative department for the year was 221,500\r\nfrancs, or about $44,000; one thousand dollars less than is annually\r\npaid to nine members of Congress.\r\n\r\nOne in visiting the chambers of the Assembly is much impressed with\r\nthe smooth and quiet despatch of business. The members are not\r\nseated with any reference to their political affiliations. There are\r\nno “filibustering,” no vexatious points of order, no drastic rules\r\nof “clôture,” to delay or ruffle the decorum of its proceedings.\r\nInterruptions are few, and angry personal bickerings never occur.\r\nThere are no official stenographers, or _verbatim_ reports made of\r\nthe proceedings; press reporters represent only the local papers\r\nand furnish a very meagre synopsis of the daily business. The small\r\ngallery set apart for the public is rarely occupied. “Leave to\r\nprint” or a written speech memorized and passionately declaimed are\r\nunknown; there are none of these extraneous and soliciting conditions\r\nto invite “buncombe” speeches or flights of oratory for the press\r\nand the gallery. The debates are more in the nature of an informal\r\nconsultation of business-men about common interests; they talk and\r\nvote, and there is an end of it. This easy colloquial disposition of\r\naffairs by no means implies any slipshod indifference, or superficial\r\nmethod of legislation. There is no legislative body where important\r\nquestions are treated in a more fundamental and critical manner.\r\nThe members of the National Council stand up to speak, while those\r\nof the Council of States speak from their seats. The tri-lingual\r\ncharacteristic of the country is carried into the Assembly; and within\r\na brief visit to either House, different members may be heard to speak\r\nsuccessively in German, French, and Italian. If the presiding officer\r\nof either House is a German and cannot speak French, his remarks are\r\nimmediately repeated by a French official interpreter who stands at\r\nhis side; and with a President who is French and cannot speak German\r\nthe process is reversed. The members from the Italian Cantons, as a\r\nrule, understand French or German sufficiently not to require special\r\ntranslation into their tongue. All bills, reports, resolutions, and\r\nlaws are published in the three languages. The Swiss have been as\r\nsuccessful in reconciling the difficulties of diverse dialects in the\r\nfederal legislature as in the harmonious union of Cantons. It was a\r\nserious obstacle in the way of the union, when the legislature of\r\nthe kingdom of the Netherlands, founded in 1814, had three different\r\nlanguages spoken in its Halls,--Dutch, Flemish, and French. This was\r\nconsidered to foreshadow the disruption in 1830, as it intensified\r\nevery prejudice and difficulty. The _personnel_ of the Assembly is\r\ngrave and sedate, dignified and serious. A large majority of the\r\nmembers are past middle age,--men of education, culture, and experience\r\nin public life. Many of them have held office first in their Communes\r\nand then in their Cantons. It is curious that, in a country where it\r\nis hard to find the court-house or a lawyer’s sign, one-fourth of the\r\nmembers of the Assembly report themselves as _advokats_; next in number\r\ncome merchants, then farmers, physicians, bankers, and professors.\r\nOne-third are given as incumbents of various other cantonal and\r\ncommunal offices. It is very common for a person to fill at the same\r\ntime a federal, cantonal, and communal office, where the duties do\r\nnot conflict and belong to the same general class. This is regarded\r\nas both simplifying and cheapening the public service. The very dress\r\nof the members, in its severe sombreness and uniformity, bespeaks\r\nthe stable and serious bent of their minds. Scarcely the change of a\r\ncravat would be required for the entire body to appear at a funeral\r\n_de rigueur_. The oath administered to the members of the Assembly is\r\ncalculated to emphasize the high and sacred trust assumed. It runs\r\nthus: “I swear, by God the Almighty! to maintain the constitution and\r\nthe laws of the Confederation, faithfully and truly to guard the unity,\r\npower, and honor of the Swiss nation, to defend the independence of the\r\nFatherland, the freedom and rights of the people, and its citizens in\r\nthe whole, to fulfil conscientiously all duties conferred upon me, as\r\ntruly, as God blesses me.” In taking this oath the member stands with\r\nhis right hand uplifted, the thumb and first two fingers extended,\r\nindicating the Trinity.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Assembly practically enjoy a life-tenure; once\r\nchosen a member, one is likely to be re-elected so long as he is\r\nwilling to serve. Re-election, alike in the whole Confederation and\r\nin the single Canton, is the rule; rejection of a sitting member, a\r\nrare exception. Death and voluntary retirement accounted for nineteen\r\nout of twenty-one new members at the last general election. There are\r\nmembers who have served continuously since the organization of the\r\nAssembly in 1848. Referring to this sure tenure of officials generally,\r\nthe President of the Confederation, in a public address, said, “Facts\r\nand not persons are what interest us. If you were to take ten Swiss,\r\nevery one of them would know whether the country was well governed or\r\nnot; but I venture to say that nine of them would not be able to tell\r\nthe name of the President, and the tenth, who might think he knew it,\r\nwould be mistaken.” To some extent this remarkable retention of members\r\nof the Assembly may be ascribed to the fact that the people feel that\r\nthey are masters of the situation through the power of rejecting all\r\nmeasures which are put to the popular vote. The position of a member is\r\nhaloed with dignity, and is not a place sought from material motives,\r\na perquisite more than an honor. The absence of this fiscal view of\r\nthe office of the legislator brings in its train an equal absence\r\nof the “rotation” notion. The Assembly is not made up on the theory\r\nof mutation or by agencies more malign. Some are fond of declaring\r\nagainst the caprice and ingratitude of the people, says Mr. Freeman\r\nin his “Growth of the English Constitution,” and of telling us that\r\nunder a democratic government neither men nor measures can remain for\r\nan hour unchanged. The spirit which made democratic Athens, year by\r\nyear, bestow her highest offices on the patrician Pericles and the\r\nreactionary Phocion, still lives in the democracies of Switzerland,\r\nin the _Landsgemeinde_ of Uri, and the Federal Assembly at Bern. The\r\nministers of kings, whether despotic or constitutional, may vainly\r\nenvy the sure tenure of office which falls to the lot of those who\r\nare chosen to rule by the voice of the people. Grote, who wrote his\r\n“History of Greece” in Switzerland, stated that his interest in the\r\nSwiss Cantons arose from the analogy they presented to the ancient\r\nGreek states; and specially as confirming the tendency of popular\r\ngovernments to adhere to their leaders with the utmost tenacity of\r\nattachment.\r\n\r\nCorruption at the polls, civic jobbery, the declension of legislative\r\ncharacter, the greed for official pelf,--these evils are not restricted\r\nto any people or country. An imperfect answer as to the cause and\r\nremedy is difficult; a complete answer is impossible. Some of these\r\nevils are connected with political problems that are vexing our epoch\r\nin every state and country where constitutional government and a\r\nliberal suffrage prevail. Switzerland, with a government so adequate\r\nfor a simple people and small country, appears to have firmly resisted\r\nthe impact of these political ills. Service in the federal legislature\r\nis accepted from a sense of patriotic duty; neither emolument nor\r\nself-aggrandizement being an element of its membership worthy of\r\nconsideration. The election of deputies to the Swiss Assembly is an\r\nevent which creates no violent commotion or even general interest\r\nin the great body of the people. A large majority of the candidates\r\nare unopposed; there is no opportunity for bribery to sap the public\r\n_morale_, or any field for the unscrupulous plying of the disgraceful\r\nartifices and incidents which too often mark a hotly-contested election\r\nin the United States. An election, general or local, is not an occasion\r\nof bustle or clamor, turbulence or revelry; there are no processions,\r\nno party badges, no music, no “pole-raising,” probably not a speech,\r\nand no candidate present when the exercise of this important privilege\r\nis going on. It is an affair of deliberation and decision, of sobriety\r\nand wisdom. The electors themselves feel that they are called upon to\r\nexercise a serious and elevating duty; the solemn and deliberate act\r\nof choosing men to govern the destinies of a civilized and enlightened\r\npeople. It may be that the Swiss elections, being held on Sunday, and\r\nthe polls often in the churches, in part contribute to inspire the\r\nelector with respect for himself, for the character which he has to\r\nsustain, and for the institution in which he thus bears an honorable\r\npart. It is feared that the suggestion of such a remedial agency in the\r\nUnited States would be regarded by our churchmen as _ægrescit medendo_.\r\nThe excitement attending the popular elections in the United States\r\nas now conducted is in the main of a vicious and degrading character.\r\nInstead of infusing into the hearts of the people a spirit of\r\npatriotism, leading them to value the blessings of the government under\r\nwhich they live, it infuses little but rancor and malignity; giving\r\nan opportunity for the indulgence of vicious passions which are born\r\nbut do not die with the emergency; evolving the gross, vulgar morality\r\nwhich, provided you do no injury to a man’s person or possessions, sees\r\nnothing in your conduct towards him to condemn; which is near-sighted\r\nto the turpitude of slander and misrepresentation directed against\r\nhim, and blind to the iniquity of needlessly invading a man’s private\r\nlife; a morality which is incapable of comprehending that one source\r\nof happiness ought to be as sacred from wanton encroachment and\r\ndisturbance as another; and that visible property is not the only thing\r\nwhich can be purloined or invaded. These evils are being submitted to,\r\nwithout any strenuous effort to remove them, as if they were not a mere\r\nexcrescence, but formed an integral or essential part of the system,\r\nwhich they deform and debase.\r\n\r\nThere can scarcely be said to be any party alignments in the Swiss\r\nAssembly. It is comparatively free from the “offensive partisanship,”\r\n“pernicious activity,” and system of party organization and activity\r\nwhich flourish in the United States with exuberant and, in some\r\nrespects, ominous vigor. While nominally three political divisions\r\nexist in the Swiss Assembly, the Right, Centre, and Left, the accepted\r\ngeneral classification reduces them to two, Radicals and Conservatives.\r\nThe main line of separation is the same perplexing issue running\r\nthrough all political history, the rivalry between the state and\r\nnation, one seeking to minimize, the other to magnify the sphere of\r\nthe central government. The Radicals are those who seek to give the\r\nbroadest interpretation to the constitution, so as to enlarge the\r\nfield of federal authority. The Conservatives are jealous of every\r\nencroachment upon the traditional prerogative of the Cantons, and\r\ndesire to restrict and confine the limits of federal action. The\r\nRadicals are the most numerous, commanding an absolute majority in\r\nboth the National Council and the Council of States. Within these\r\ntwo broad divisions there are many different shades that separate on\r\nquestions of a social, religious, and economic character. Then these\r\ngrand and subdivisions have an entirely different significance, as\r\napplied to federal or cantonal questions; a Radical as to the one, may\r\nbe a Conservative as to the other. The Radical and Conservative of the\r\nCanton of Vaud is by no means the same as the Radical and Conservative\r\nof the Cantons of Zurich and Aargau; the Radical of Geneva is very\r\ndifferent from the Radical of St. Gallen. The two parties are not\r\ndistinguished from each other by any systematic respect or disrespect\r\nfor cantonal independence. So the purely political question between\r\nprivilege on one side and the sovereignty of the people on the other\r\nis one of subordinate moment; the former does not find expression\r\nin any party formula. It is an error to estimate the character and\r\ntendencies of the Swiss parties by the names which they bear,\r\nRadical and Conservative, in the light of the footing these names\r\nhave obtained in every language in Europe, and the strong feelings of\r\nesteem or hatred associated with them. As such they are nowise fully\r\ncorrect designations of the political divisions, prominently opposed\r\nin Switzerland, and of the points at issue between them. It is not\r\ntrue that the Swiss Radical desires over-centralization to the extent\r\nof unitary government; but, with the Conservative, holds to the great\r\ntheory of local self-government as founded upon these propositions;\r\nthat government is most wise, which is in the hands of those best\r\ninformed about the particular questions on which they legislate; most\r\neconomical and honest when in the hands of those most interested in\r\npreserving frugality and virtue; most strong when it only exercises\r\nauthority which is beneficial in its action to the governed. There is\r\na feeling common to the population of every Canton and Commune, which\r\nputs all idea of any party advocating one concentrated system out of\r\nthe question. Madison says, “An extinction of parties necessarily\r\nimplies, either a universal alarm for the public safety, or an absolute\r\nextinction of liberty.” Political parties perform functions of the\r\ngreatest possible importance; through their organizations is fulfilled\r\nthat obligation which is incumbent upon every citizen of a republic,\r\nto give an earnest, careful, and habitual attention to the conduct\r\nof government. Parties are the exponents and representatives of the\r\ngreat issues that constantly arise in every free community. By the\r\ndiscussions that arise between them public opinion is formed, the\r\npeople educated in their political rights, a due sense of citizenship\r\ngenerated and fostered; they are a great centripetal force in every\r\nsystem of home-rule government.\r\n\r\nThe strong attachment to party, with its resultant full crop of\r\npolitical dissension, in the United States has at the same time\r\nawakened a zeal for turning the powers of government to profitable\r\npublic account, and a sensibility to the exposure of wrong or abuse,\r\nwhich manifest themselves in a thousand beneficial ways. “It is one\r\nof the advantages of free government,” declares Sir James Mackintosh,\r\n“that they excite sometimes to an inconvenient degree, but upon\r\nthe whole, with the utmost benefit, all the generous feelings, all\r\nthe efforts for a public cause, of which human nature is capable.”\r\nSwitzerland, in the legislative branch of her federal system, gathers\r\ntogether a body of men remarkable for that generous and patriotic\r\nimpulse which moves noble minds to sacrifice private interests to the\r\npublic good, and that public spirit that is the sense of duty applied\r\nto public affairs; none of the cowardly and unpatriotic sentiment\r\nexpressed in the speech of Cato, “when vice prevails and impious men\r\nbear sway, the post of honor is a private station.” With a Swiss, the\r\npost of honor is always the post of duty, and the call of duty is\r\nloudest from the public service, and secures the ready response of\r\nthe best citizens. Nowhere does popular government rest upon a firmer\r\nfoundation of public spirit and the willing and active interest of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERAL COUNCIL.\r\n\r\nBundesrath; Conseil fédéral.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three main forms of executive embrace the hereditary and\r\nirresponsible king, with or without a responsible ministry; the\r\nsingle responsible president; and the executive council. The most\r\ntypical examples of these are: the constitutional monarchy of England;\r\nthe Presidency of the United States; and the Federal Council of\r\nSwitzerland. Or, there may be said to exist four chief ways in which\r\nparliamentary government is worked.\r\n\r\n_First_, that of England, where the executive is the primary and the\r\nlegislature the ultimate source of power; the English ministers have\r\nthe right of initiative, but they cannot remain in office without a\r\nmajority in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n_Second_, the German plan, where the ministers are solely dependent\r\nupon the Crown, but cannot spend money without parliamentary sanction.\r\n\r\n_Third_, there is the constitution of the United States, under which\r\nthe functions of both branches are clearly defined; the Cabinet being\r\nexcluded from Congress, and Congress having no control over it, further\r\nthan the confirmation of its members by the Senate.\r\n\r\n_Fourth_, the Swiss system, wherein the executive is as great a\r\ndeparture from the precedent of the United States, and has produced\r\nsomething at least as widely different from the President of the United\r\nStates, as he differs from an European king. The Swiss constitution\r\nprovides no executive head, in the sense of that of the President\r\nof the United States; there is practically no such functionary. The\r\nSwiss executive has, in fact, none of the functions that are given to\r\nthe President of the United States, as an independent power in the\r\nState, making him as truly the representative of the sovereign people\r\nas Congress itself. Andrew Jackson, indeed, habitually prided himself\r\non the privilege of representing the masses; and the use of the veto\r\nby the President is in most cases highly popular, for through it the\r\nPresident is expected to counterbalance the power of the legislature.\r\n\r\nNot until 1833, was there any project of reform in Switzerland\r\nlooking to a special federal executive, apart from all the cantonal\r\ngovernments. Previously, the federal executive authority was not vested\r\nin any special magistrate or council, but exercised by the council\r\nof one or the other of the three directing Cantons, as explained in\r\nthe “Introduction.” This had of course the inconvenience, among many\r\nothers, of causing the employment of federal authority to be more or\r\nless guided by the politics actually prevalent in each of the three\r\ndirecting Cantons. Up to 1848, the legislative and executive power\r\nwere vested in the same body. Switzerland, in its federal character,\r\nhaving never known a personal head of any kind, when the old weak Diet\r\nwas changed into a real federal government, it naturally limited the\r\nexecutive power far more than it is limited in the United States; and\r\nthe powers left to the executive were no less naturally intrusted, not\r\nto a President, but to a council. Unwilling to trust the executive\r\npower to any single man, it was placed in the hands of a council of\r\nseven. It may be called an impersonal executive. There is nothing about\r\nit to invite the homage of those whose chief object it is to find\r\nsomething to abase themselves before; its walks cannot be recorded in a\r\ncourt circular; it holds no drawing-rooms or levées; it pays no one the\r\nhonor of a visit, and no one has the honor of being invited to visit\r\nit in return. A legislature chosen for a fixed term, which cannot be\r\ndissolved before the end of that term, chooses an Executive Council,\r\nfor the term of its own existence. To such a body no scrap or rag of\r\nroyal purple can hang; and it completely refutes the notion that the\r\nexecutive power of a republic is simply a shadow of kingship, a mere\r\ntransfer from a life and hereditary tenure to an elected and limited\r\nterm. The organization, powers, and duties of the Federal Council are\r\ndefined by the constitution in the following provisions:\r\n\r\n1. The supreme direction and executive authority of the Confederation\r\nshall be a Federal Council, consisting of seven members.\r\n\r\n2. The members of the Federal Council are chosen by the Federal\r\nAssembly for the term of three years, from among all Swiss citizens\r\neligible to the National Council. But not more than one member shall\r\nbe chosen from the same Canton. After every general election for the\r\nNational Council, the Federal Council shall also be integrally renewed.\r\nVacancies which occur in the course of the three years are filled, for\r\nthe rest of the term, at the ensuing session of the Federal Assembly.\r\n\r\n3. The members of the Federal Council shall not during their term\r\nof office hold any other office, either in the service of the\r\nConfederation or of a Canton, or follow any other pursuit, or exercise\r\na profession.\r\n\r\n4. The Federal Council is presided over by the President of the\r\nConfederation. There is also a Vice-President. The President of the\r\nConfederation and the Vice-President shall be chosen, for the term\r\nof one year, by the Federal Assembly from among the members of the\r\nCouncil. The retiring President is not eligible either as President or\r\nVice-President for the year ensuing. The same member may not hold the\r\noffice of Vice-President for two consecutive years.\r\n\r\n5. The President of the Confederation, and the other members of the\r\nFederal Council, shall receive an annual salary from the federal\r\ntreasury.\r\n\r\n6. A quorum of the Federal Council consists of four members.\r\n\r\n7. The members of the Federal Council have the right to take part\r\nin the discussions, but not to vote in either House of the Federal\r\nAssembly; and also the right to make motions on any matter under\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n8. The powers and the duties of the Federal Council, within the\r\nlimits of this constitution, are particularly the following: It\r\ndirects federal affairs conformably to the laws and resolutions of\r\nthe Confederation: it shall care that the constitution, federal laws\r\nand ordinances, and also the provisions of the federal concordats be\r\nobserved: it shall take the necessary measures for their execution\r\neither on its own initiative or upon complaint, so far as the decision\r\nof such affairs has not been vested in the Federal Tribunal. It takes\r\ncare that the guarantee of the cantonal constitutions is enforced. It\r\nproposes bills and resolutions to the Federal Assembly, and gives its\r\nopinions upon the propositions sent to it by the Federal Assembly or\r\nthe Cantons. It executes the federal laws and decrees, the judgments\r\nof the Federal Tribunal, as well as the compromises or decisions in\r\narbitration on questions of dispute among the Cantons. It makes such\r\nappointments as are not intrusted to the Federal Assembly, Federal\r\nTribunal, or other authority. It examines the treaties made by the\r\nCantons with one another, or with foreign countries, and approves them,\r\nif proper. It watches over the external interests of the Confederation,\r\nespecially in all international relations, and shall, in general, have\r\ncharge of foreign affairs. It protects the external safety, and the\r\nindependence and neutrality of Switzerland. It protects the internal\r\nsafety of the Confederation, and the maintenance of its peace and\r\norder. In cases of urgency, and when the Federal Assembly is not\r\nin session, the Federal Council shall have authority to raise the\r\nnecessary troops and employ them, with the reservation that it shall\r\nimmediately call the Federal Assembly together, if the number of men\r\ncalled out shall exceed two thousand, or if they remain in arms more\r\nthan three weeks. It has charge of the federal army affairs and all\r\nother branches of administration which belong to the Confederation.\r\nIt examines those laws and ordinances of the Cantons which must be\r\nsubmitted for its approval; it exercises supervision over those\r\nbranches of cantonal administration that are placed under its control.\r\nIt administers the finances of the Confederation, introduces the\r\nbudget, and submits a statement of the accounts of federal income\r\nand expenditure. It supervises the conduct of all the officials and\r\nemployés of the federal administration. It submits to the Federal\r\nAssembly at each regular session a report of its administration, and\r\na statement of the condition of the Confederation, internal as well\r\nas external; and recommends to its attention such measures as in its\r\njudgment are desirable for the promotion of the common welfare. It\r\nalso makes special reports when the Federal Assembly or either branch\r\nthereof requires it.\r\n\r\n9. The business of the Federal Council is distributed by departments\r\namong its members. This distribution has the purpose only of\r\nfacilitating the examination and despatch of business; every decision\r\nmust emanate from the Federal Council as a body (a single authority).\r\n\r\n10. The Federal Council and its departments are authorized to call in\r\nexperts on special subjects.\r\n\r\nIn the exercise of several of its most important functions the\r\naction of the Federal Council is essentially judicial. This is\r\nconspicuously so in its right to examine the agreements made by\r\nCantons among themselves or with foreign governments; and to judge\r\nof their conformity with the federal constitution. Under the name\r\nof “administrative law,” it passes in a judicial capacity upon the\r\nvalidity of numerous cantonal laws and ordinances, such as school\r\naffairs, freedom of trade and commerce, patent rights, rights of\r\nsettlement, freedom from military service, rights of religious bodies,\r\nvalidity of cantonal elections, votes, etc. But there is no efficient\r\ninstrumentality for the enforcement of the decrees of the Federal\r\nCouncil against the Cantons in these cases. If a Canton adopts a\r\nmeasure which the Council on appeal holds to be unconstitutional, and\r\nit declines to conform to the Council’s order, the latter has no direct\r\nway of enforcing it. The two methods of coercing a refractory Canton,\r\nso far tried, have been,--to send a special agent to negotiate with the\r\ncantonal authorities, and should his efforts fail, to quarter troops\r\nand the expense of their maintenance upon the offending Canton, until\r\nit yields; the other method is to keep back from the Canton subsidies\r\nwhich are to be provided for local purposes from the federal treasury.\r\nBoth of these methods have been found efficacious. The Federal Council\r\nretains, however, under all circumstances, a very affectionate, if not\r\nreverential, tone in its communications to the Cantons, addressing them\r\nas “Faithful and dear confederates,” and closing, “We embrace this\r\noccasion, faithful and cherished confederates, to commend you with\r\nourselves to divine protection.”\r\n\r\nThe Federal Council exercises wider discretionary authority, in the\r\nmatter of arrest, of temporary imprisonment, of expulsion from the\r\nterritory, and the like, than seems inferable from the terms of the\r\nconstitution. A recent decree of the Federal Council forbade public\r\nexhibitions of magnetism and hypnotism. Wherever there is discretion\r\nthere is room for arbitrariness, and in a republic, no less than under\r\na monarchy, discretionary authority on the part of the government means\r\ninsecurity for legal freedom on the part of the citizen. The Swiss\r\nconstitution apparently is more democratic than that of the United\r\nStates, from the fact that it does not vest the veto in any official;\r\nyet in the amount of authority which is allowed to the executive power\r\nover the citizen it is less democratic. Every legislative measure\r\npasses under the inspection of the Federal Council before action\r\nby the Federal Assembly; and the measures adopted by the Assembly\r\nare promulgated by the Council, signed both by the President of the\r\nConfederation and by the Chancellor, the ministerial officer of the\r\nCouncil; no doubt, in all cases, two signatures are safer than one.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Council, rather than to take the initiative, sometimes,\r\nby means of a suggestion from itself, is requested to present to the\r\nAssembly a measure; in this event a rejection of the measure would\r\nnot be regarded by the Council in the light of a defeat. During the\r\nrecesses of the Assembly the federal Councillors, at the head of\r\ncommittees designated by the Assembly or with expert commissions,\r\nmeet in different parts of the country, to consider subjects that\r\nare to be brought before the Assembly. The bills are then prepared,\r\nwhich, with full and careful explanatory reports, are published in the\r\nofficial journal and carried by the newspapers to every corner of the\r\nConfederation. They are discussed by the people, and when the Assembly\r\nmeets it is ready to take action with but little, if any, debate by the\r\nprompt enactment of these recommendations into law, the chief to whose\r\ndepartment the subject-matter appertains being present, when it is\r\ntaken up in the Assembly, to give any further information that may be\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nAll Swiss citizens eligible to the National Council are declared to be\r\neligible to the Federal Council. But practically the qualification of\r\na federal Councillor is _prior_ membership of the National Council.\r\nPrimarily the selection of federal Councillors is always made from\r\namong the members of the National Council; and by a strange custom\r\ninvariably observed with only one exception since 1848, they are again\r\ntriennially returned to the National Council from their respective\r\ndistricts while still serving as federal Councillors, and with the full\r\nknowledge that within a few days after the convening of the Federal\r\nAssembly they will be again chosen by that body for a new term in the\r\nFederal Council. This necessitates supplementary elections to fill the\r\nvacancies created in the Assembly. Again, at every recurring election\r\nof the National Council, one of the sitting members from each district\r\nwherein a federal Councillor resides, must make room for this temporary\r\nappearance of the federal Councillor in the National Council, as a\r\ncondition precedent to his re-election. The sitting members cheerfully\r\nyield to this exigency, conscious that they are standing aside for a\r\nmere _locum tenens_, and in no wise imperilling the ultimate return\r\nto their seats, after a traditional custom has been accommodated. One\r\ndistrict has of late years disregarded this custom, declining to go\r\nthrough the empty form of electing to the National Council the federal\r\nCouncillor residing there, and whose re-election as federal Councillor\r\nis conceded. This one obdurate district may, by persisting in its\r\ncourse, be the means of the final overthrow of a practice, which at\r\npresent involves a double election for six seats every three years\r\nat considerable expense and trouble: and apparently incapable of any\r\nintelligent explanation. Like many customs, it has simply taken root\r\nwithout any inquiry, and propagates itself without any opposition. A\r\npartial explanation may be discovered in the desire to preserve the\r\nidentity of the federal Councillor with his Canton, and as a renewed\r\ndeclaration that he continues to enjoy the confidence of, and is in\r\naccord upon questions of public policy with, that local constituency\r\nwhich in all probability he served for many years in the National\r\nCouncil, before his promotion to the Federal Council. A federal officer\r\nholding his office directly from the Federal Assembly, and at the same\r\ntime invested with the popular confidence of a local constituency\r\nequally with the other members of that assembly, presents a most\r\nremarkable assertion of local political autonomy in a purely national\r\naffair.\r\n\r\nOriginally these federal Councillors, when during their term elected\r\nto the National Council for the purpose of re-election to the Federal\r\nCouncil, took their seats in the former when it convened, and exercised\r\nall the functions of a member, yet concurrently holding their\r\nportfolios in the Federal Council for an unexpired term. This twofold\r\nservice continued until their re-election for a new term took place,\r\nwhen they resigned their seats in the National Council, and resumed the\r\nsingle service of federal Councillors. It is related that one member\r\nof the Federal Council, some years since, only secured re-election by\r\nmeans of his own vote during his transition service as above described\r\nin the National Council. Of late years the exercise of these dual\r\nrights and privileges incident to this most singular condition of\r\nthings, while not in violation of any law, has been regarded with\r\ndisfavor, and the federal Councillors, during the few days of their\r\nmembership triennially in the National Council, confine themselves to\r\nthe privileges and rights that attach to a Councillor.\r\n\r\nThe geographical assignment of the members of the Federal Council is\r\nwell established by an unwritten law, which is faithfully observed; a\r\nwell-established usage in the election of the Federal Council assigns\r\none member to each of the Cantons of Bern, Vaud, Zurich, and Aargau,\r\nand St. Gallen or Thurgau, then one each to the Catholic and Italian\r\nSwiss. The constitutional inhibition of the choice of more than one\r\nmember from the same Canton may be regarded as a restriction that\r\nlimits the choice without any adequate counter-benefit; it may exclude\r\nfrom the government statesmen of high merit, and thus diminish the\r\nresources of the state.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Federal Council can be and are continually\r\nre-elected, notwithstanding sharp antagonisms among themselves,\r\nand it may be between them and a majority in the Assembly. They\r\nalso continue to discharge their administrative duties, whether\r\nthe measures submitted by them are or are not sanctioned by the\r\nvoters. The rejection of measures approved and proposed by them does\r\nnot necessarily injure their position with the country. The Swiss\r\ndistinguish between men and measures. They retain valued servants in\r\ntheir employment, even though they reject their advice. They retain in\r\nthe service Councillors whose measures the voters nevertheless often\r\nrefuse to sanction. Valuing the executive ability of these men, still\r\nthey may constantly withhold assent from their suggestions.\r\n\r\nThe Council substantially in its present form came into existence\r\nwith the Constitution of 1848; the first election of its members\r\ntaking place in November of that year. The election, therefore,\r\nwhich occurred on the 13th of December, 1887, was the fourteenth\r\ntriennial renewal of the Council, and covered a period of thirty-nine\r\nyears. During this period the complete roster of the members embraces\r\nonly twenty-seven names; even this small ratio of change resulted\r\nin seven cases from death, and eleven from voluntary retirement;\r\nleaving only two who failed to be re-elected on the avowed ground\r\nof political divergence. This most remarkable conservatism on the\r\npart of the Assembly, in retaining the members of the Council by\r\nrepeated re-elections, has survived important issues of public\r\npolicy, including several revisions of the constitution, upon which\r\nthere was a wide diversity of opinion in the Council; some of whom\r\nactively participated in the discussions, antagonizing the views of\r\na majority of the Assembly; the Assembly to which they owed their\r\nelection and upon which they relied for their retention in office.\r\nTheir periodical re-election, though seemingly _pro forma_, carries\r\nwith it a salutary sense of accountableness. This sure tenure of\r\nservice in the Federal Council makes those chosen look upon it as\r\nthe business of their lives. Without this permanence attached to the\r\nposition, such men as now fill it could not be induced to do so.\r\nThey are men trained to vigorous personal and intellectual exertion,\r\nwho often surrender pursuits yielding a much more profitable return.\r\nPrecariousness of tenure in responsible positions discourages one\r\nfrom engaging in those measures of long-sighted policy or those plans\r\nof necessarily slow accomplishment, in which he might be so shortly\r\ninterrupted, and his labors rendered abortive and unavailing. Political\r\nscience, the science of wise government, is perhaps that department of\r\nintellectual exertion which requires the greatest powers of mind and\r\nthe intensest application. Its facts are multifarious and complicated,\r\noften anomalous and contradictory, and demanding the guidance of clear\r\nperceptions. Its principles are many of them abstruse, and to be\r\ndeveloped by long and close processes of reasoning; and the application\r\nof these principles requires the sagacity of quick observation and\r\nlong experience. It is a business which requires as long and arduous\r\npreparation as any profession which can be named; and as entire\r\ndevotion to it, with freedom from all other serious or momentous\r\noccupation, when its duties are once undertaken, as the calling of\r\na lawyer, a physician, a merchant, or an engineer. One chief reason\r\nwhy there are so many needless, blundering, crude, mischievous, and\r\nunintelligible actions in public life, is that men have not dedicated\r\nthemselves to its requirements as a separate study or profession; but\r\nhave considered it to be a business which might be played with in their\r\nhours of leisure from more serious pursuits.\r\n\r\nA member of the Federal Council cannot, during his term, “occupy any\r\nother office in the service of the Confederation or a Canton, or\r\nfollow any other pursuit, or practise any profession.” He devotes his\r\nentire time and attention to his department, and not a mere casual,\r\nintermitting, and brief attention; or merely giving the refuse of his\r\ntime and abilities in passing judgment on what others have devised and\r\nexecuted. He is obliged to attend to the routine, the detail, and all\r\nthe technical niceties of its daily administration.\r\n\r\nThe salaries paid to these distinguished officials are not relatively\r\nhigher than the wages of the people at large; and are very\r\ninsignificant when compared with the compensation accorded for like\r\nservices in other countries. Each of the seven members receives an\r\nannual salary of 12,000 francs or $2316; the President of the Council\r\nis given 1500 francs additional, making his salary $2605. This increase\r\nof salary to the President is made under the head of “expenses of\r\nrepresentation,” understood to mean entertainments and kindred purposes\r\ndevolving upon this official. The entire annual appropriation made for\r\nthe maintenance of the executive department will not exceed $17,000.[36]\r\n\r\nThe business of the Federal Council is distributed among seven\r\ndepartments, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\n2. Interior.\r\n\r\n3. Justice and Police.\r\n\r\n4. Military.\r\n\r\n5. Finance and Customs.\r\n\r\n6. Industry and Agriculture.\r\n\r\n7. Posts and Railways.\r\n\r\nEach one of these departments is presided over by one of the\r\nCouncillors. When the Council is integrally renewed by the Assembly\r\nthere is no designation or assignment of any department; the members\r\nare simply chosen as federal Councillors, and make the apportionment\r\namong themselves; and an agreeable understanding has always been\r\nreached. According to the constitution this departmental division is\r\nonly “to facilitate the examination and despatch of business; all\r\ndecisions must emanate from the Council as a whole.” Regular Council\r\nmeetings are generally held twice a week. A decision is not valid\r\nunless at least four members are present, and no decision can be\r\nreversed except by four out of the seven, in a session attended by more\r\nthan four. The Councillor presides over his department, conducting it\r\nmuch as an ordinary Secretary would under a cabinet system. In theory,\r\neach is responsible for all, and all are responsible for each. There is\r\nno question of rank, each department is of equal dignity.\r\n\r\nThe _Bundespräsident_, or President of the Confederation, is merely\r\nthe chairman for a year of the Federal Council. He is only the chief\r\nof the executive; he is not himself the whole of it, and therefore can\r\nhardly be called the executive chief of the nation. His commission\r\nas President simply enhances his dignity, and does not confer upon\r\nhim any additional power or responsibility. The other members are\r\nhis colleagues, not his mere agents or advisers; he is only _primus\r\ninter pares_. He has no appointive power or patronage, no veto, no\r\nright of even nomination to any position. Not a single Swiss official\r\nat home or abroad is disturbed by the annual change in the executive\r\nhead. Few republics have invested a single magistrate with such large\r\npowers as the President of the United States; few commonwealths have\r\ngiven a nominal chief magistrate so small a degree of power as belongs\r\nto the Swiss President. He is not a chief magistrate. He is chief\r\nof a board, which board, in its collective capacity, acts as chief\r\nmagistrate. The central authority in Switzerland, since the birth of\r\nthe republic, has always been vested in a committee; and a committee\r\nit is to-day. The small addition to the salary, giving audience for\r\nletters of credence and recall from diplomatic representatives,\r\nprecedence on state and ceremonial occasions, and the right to be\r\naddressed as “_Son Excellence_,” about exhaust the special privileges,\r\npower, and dignity of the President of the Confederation. He is just as\r\naccessible to the public as any of his colleagues. He has no guards,\r\nno lords in waiting, no liveried ushers, no gewgaws and trappings.\r\nYou may go to his official quarters with as little ceremony as you\r\nmay call on a private citizen. The stranger may knock at the door\r\nand the chief magistrate of the Confederation bids him to come in.\r\nThe new President enters upon the discharge of his duties on the 1st\r\nof January, following his election.[37] There is no formal or public\r\ninstallation, no demonstration, civic or military. The newly-elected\r\nPresident repairs to his modest chambers in the federal palace at noon,\r\nwhere alone he receives all who desire to call and pay their respects.\r\nThis opportunity is availed of very little beyond the members of the\r\ndiplomatic corps, who are expected to tender their congratulations\r\npersonally and on behalf of the governments they represent. The writer\r\nwas told by a colleague, who had been recently transferred to Bern\r\nfrom a post with an elaborate court, that on the announcement of the\r\ndeath of the Swiss President he donned his full diplomatic uniform to\r\ngo and tender his official and personal condolence to the bereaved\r\nfamily. With considerable difficulty he found the executive mansion\r\nin apartments on the third floor of a building of a modest street.\r\nThere being no _portier_, he rang the bell at the street entrance\r\nand ascended the stairs. Reaching the floor of the apartments he was\r\nmet at the door by a woman who was wiping her mouth with the corner\r\nof her apron, evidently having been disturbed in a meal. She invited\r\nthe diplomat in, and receiving the card, to his surprise, instead\r\nof leaving the room to deliver it, she invited him to be seated and\r\nopened the conversation. He soon discovered that she was the widow\r\nof the deceased President, and a woman of good education, force, and\r\ncharacter. All the organs of the Swiss government have an unassuming\r\nand civic appearance, retaining in a degree the wisdom, moderation, and\r\nsimplicity of their ancient manners; those who are invested with high\r\ntrusts are ever ready and willing to retire to complete equality with\r\ntheir fellow-citizens, from the eminence of civil or military station\r\nto which their talents and the call of their country have raised them.\r\nThere is nothing of pomp and majesty; the soil is too natural for the\r\nartificial forms of court diplomacy. The manly consciousness of freedom\r\nwhich creates and finds expression in the constitution elevates the\r\nmiddle classes who form its chief support; while the direct or indirect\r\ncontact with public affairs develops the intelligence and strengthens\r\nthe character of the citizen.\r\n\r\nIn its organization and practical workings, the Swiss executive is\r\nclaimed by some to be modelled after a better pattern than that\r\nof the United States, in so far as escaping the great quadrennial\r\ncontests, and the passions, ambitions, and disappointments born of them\r\nconstituting, as more than once illustrated in the past, the greatest\r\nnational peril.\r\n\r\nPrevious to 1888, the President of the Confederation _ex officio_\r\nbecame chief of what was called “The Political Department,” including\r\nthe conduct of foreign affairs. A reorganization was found to be\r\nadvisable, and, being formulated by the Federal Council and approved\r\nby the Federal Assembly, came into force on the 1st of January, 1888.\r\nUnder this rearrangement of portfolios “Foreign Affairs” is placed on\r\na new and separate footing and no longer falls to the President of\r\nthe current year. This new department retains what belonged to the\r\n“Political Department,” with the exception of the former presidential\r\nfunctions. It is charged also with the management of commerce in\r\ngeneral, with work preparatory to the negotiation of commercial\r\ntreaties, and co-operation in drawing up the customs tariff; also with\r\nmatters relating to industrial property, copyright, and emigration; and\r\ncovering all the more important relations of Switzerland with foreign\r\ncountries. It is the uniform practice for the Vice-President to succeed\r\nthe President. In this way every member of the Federal Council in turn\r\nbecomes President and Vice-President once during each septennial period.\r\n\r\nBelonging to different political parties, the Councillors frequently\r\nantagonize one another on the floor of the Assembly, but this is not\r\nfound to interfere with their harmonious working as an administrative\r\nbody. The right of the members of the Federal Council to participate in\r\nthe debates and make motions in the Federal Assembly, gives that body,\r\nwhat the Congress of the United States has not, the advantage of a\r\ndirect ministerial explanation. Yet that ministerial explanation cannot\r\nbe, as it may be in England, mixed up with fears of votes of censure\r\non one side or of a penal dissolution on the other. Irremovable by the\r\nexisting Assembly,[38] with the question of their re-election dependent\r\non an Assembly which is not yet in existence, they have less need than\r\neither American or English statesmen to adapt their policy to meet any\r\nmomentary cry. Is it not a most excellent political system? Is not this\r\nrelation between the legislature and the executive, both in theory and\r\npractice, happily devised? It brings a quick and close communication\r\nbetween these two great branches, and tends to promote a good\r\nunderstanding between them. Elected by the Assembly, coming into office\r\nalong with it, there is every chance of the Council acting in harmony\r\nwith it; and their power of taking a share in the debates at once\r\nenables the Assembly to be better informed on public affairs. There\r\nis much in the Swiss experiment to refute the belief that there can\r\nbe no executive power proper, unless it derives its authority from an\r\nindependent source, and is made directly by the people, so it may claim\r\nto be equally representative of the people, and to have received still\r\ngreater proof of the public confidence. The choice of the executive by\r\nthe legislative body may be susceptible to the objection that it fails\r\nto furnish the limit and restraint that each of these powers should\r\nexercise on the other; and that it is entitled to be regarded as only a\r\n_Cabinet d’Affaires_,--a purely administrative committee. The history\r\nof the Swiss system has developed no unusual dissensions between these\r\npowers, and none are likely to occur. With the legislature governed as\r\na rule by motives of public utility, there is little room for want of\r\nharmony with the executive, the simple function of which is to carry\r\ninto effect the measures which the legislature has decreed.\r\n\r\nThe present Federal Council of Switzerland is composed of men of\r\nhigh order of ability, instructed by education and disciplined by\r\nexperience. They are men of crystalline integrity, trained familiarity\r\nwith the duties of their post, and profoundly patriotic in motive.\r\nAmong all the changes and complications of late years, no government\r\nin Europe in its executive action has displayed a higher degree of\r\npractical wisdom than the Federal Council of Switzerland. It acts with\r\nsterling good sense and moderation, the result in a great measure of\r\nthat slow and cautious temperament which has ever marked the Swiss\r\ncharacter; traits which perhaps may be traced back to the privations\r\nand distress through which, during a long course of years, they\r\nstruggled to the attainment of a dear-bought independence. It presides\r\nover the national interests in an equitable and impartial spirit,\r\ndealing wisely and temperately with the people without encroachment\r\nor oppression, and, if we may judge from the insignificance of their\r\nemoluments, without desire of advantage. The Councillors move in the\r\nsurest way, both to the attainment and preservation of power, through\r\nthe medium of those qualities which secure the esteem and gain the\r\nconfidence of the people. The people, on the other hand, behold\r\nwith content and satisfaction the absence of all selfish or ignoble\r\npurpose in the labors of the Councillors; and sacrifice all factious\r\nopposition and interference to the public benefit which they know to be\r\nidentified with the vigor, stability, and welfare of the government. It\r\nis not too much to say that in the Federal Council of Switzerland an\r\nhonest attempt is made to follow the wise admonition of Cicero in his\r\n“Offices:” “Those who design to be partakers in the government should\r\nbe sure to remember the two precepts of Plato; first, to make the\r\nsafety and interest of their citizens the great aim and design of all\r\ntheir thoughts and endeavor without ever considering their own general\r\nadvantage; and, secondly, to take care of the whole collective body of\r\nthe republic so as not to serve the interests of any one party to the\r\nprejudice or neglect of all the rest; for the government of a state is\r\nmuch like the office of a guardian or trustee, which should always be\r\nmanaged for the good of the pupil, and not of the persons to whom he is\r\nintrusted.”\r\n\r\nThere has been some movement to change the mode of appointment to\r\nthe executive power of the Confederation. Like other human things,\r\nit is not absolutely ideal in its working. The relations between the\r\nexecutive and judicial departments are not what they should be, though\r\nmuch better than they were at the beginning of the constitution. Yet,\r\non the whole, the working of the Swiss executive during the forty-two\r\nyears of its trial has been such that it need not shrink from a\r\ncomparison with the working of either of the two better known systems.\r\nThe fact of the Council being not directly chosen by the people is\r\nclaimed by some to be inconsistent with the “democratic theory.”\r\nSurely it is not wise to exchange at the bidding of a certain abstract\r\ndoctrine a system which has worked well for so long, for one which is\r\nnot certain to work better, and which might work a great deal worse.\r\nBy many constitutional students the actual form of the Swiss executive\r\nis looked on as the happiest of the political experiments of the\r\npresent half century. It seems to have escaped both some of the evils\r\nwhich are incident to kings and some of the evils which are incident\r\nto presidents. It seems more wisely planned, in all events for the\r\ncountry in which it has arisen, than those forms to which we are better\r\naccustomed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERAL TRIBUNAL.\r\n\r\nBundesgericht; Tribunal fédéral.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Swiss Federal Tribunal, in its present form, dating from 1874,\r\nwas originally set up in 1848. It is, however, the product of an\r\nhistorical development extending over nearly six hundred years, and\r\nthe history of this period only will explain the exact meaning of the\r\ncarefully-balanced and guarded phrases which describe its jurisdiction.\r\nPrevious to 1848 there existed two methods for peaceably settling\r\ndisputes among members of the Confederation,--_friendly remonstrance_\r\nand _arbitration_.\r\n\r\n1. _Friendly Remonstrance._--This was the plan adopted in the two\r\nearliest treaties of alliance, those of 1291 and 1315. In both cases\r\nthere were only three parties to the treaty,--Uri, Schwyz, and\r\nUnterwalden,--and the object was to settle disputes between neighbors,\r\nand in a friendly and informal way. The “Witan,” or wise men, met\r\ntogether to heal the quarrel according to the rules of equity and\r\nright. If either party refused to accept their decision, the other\r\nconfederates were to enforce obedience.\r\n\r\n2. _Arbitration._--This first appeared in 1351, when Zurich joined\r\nthe League. It became more common as the number of the confederates\r\nincreased, and was the method employed when friendly remonstrance\r\nfailed, and when war was not declared. The arrangement as to the place\r\nof meeting, the number and the method of choosing the arbitrators,\r\nand other details, varied according to the stipulations contained in\r\nthe various treaties by which each Canton had been admitted into the\r\nConfederation. The number of arbitrators was usually fixed at two for\r\neach party, and, in case of disagreement, they selected an impartial\r\nforeman or umpire; “the question of the choice of the foreman,” says\r\na contemporary historian, “was unquestionably the main point in the\r\nwhole system of the Courts of Arbitration, for, generally, he was\r\nthe only real and impartial judge.” This method was substantially\r\nthe only one employed from 1351 to 1798. During the existence of\r\nthe Helvetic Republic, there was established a Central Judiciary\r\nalong with a Central Executive and Legislature. It consisted of a\r\nmember and an assistant, nominated by each Canton, one-fourth being\r\nrenewed annually. It had original jurisdiction over the members of\r\nthe executive and of the legislature, and in criminal cases involving\r\nthe penalty of death or of imprisonment and banishment. It acted as a\r\nCourt of Appeals in civil matters, when the decisions of the inferior\r\ncourts were invalid by reason of want of jurisdiction, whether through\r\ninformality or violation of the constitution. This court practically\r\nsubsisted under Napoleon’s Act of Mediation, set up in 1803. With\r\nthe partial restoration of things in 1815 to the _status quo ante_\r\n1798, came naturally the restoration of the arbitration system, with\r\nreference to which the most elaborate regulations were laid down in\r\nthe Federal Pact. This codification legally subsisted till 1848. A\r\nrevision was attempted in 1832, when, after the Paris Revolution of\r\n1830, more liberal ideas began to assert themselves in Switzerland, but\r\nit failed through the opposition of the Conservatives. The Reformers,\r\nhowever, were successful in 1848, and by the constitution adopted that\r\nyear, a Federal Court was created, with jurisdiction in civil and\r\ncriminal cases, and also a limited jurisdiction in cases where rights\r\nguaranteed by the constitution were alleged to have been infringed;\r\n_provided_ that the Federal Legislature referred such cases to it.\r\nThe court consisted of eleven judges and eleven substitutes, elected\r\nby the Federal Assembly for a term of three years. The president and\r\nvice-president of the court were appointed by the same body annually.\r\nAnother attempt at revision was made in 1872, by which the functions of\r\nthe court as an interpreter and upholder of rights guaranteed by the\r\nfederal and cantonal constitutions would be very much extended, but it\r\nwas rejected. There was an appeal on questions of public law to the\r\nFederal Council, from which there was a further appeal to the Federal\r\nAssembly. If the two chambers agreed, the decision was final; if they\r\ndisagreed, the decision of the Federal Council prevailed. This system\r\nwas found unsatisfactory, as a large part of the time of the chambers\r\nwas occupied in the discussion of mixed questions of law and politics.\r\nWhen the Constitution of 1874 was adopted, this and many other defects\r\nwere in a measure remedied.\r\n\r\nThe fourth or last division of Chapter II. of the Swiss constitution,\r\n“Federal Authorities,” is devoted to the Federal Tribunal, and declares:\r\n\r\n1. There shall be a Federal Tribunal for the administration of justice\r\nso far as it belongs to the Confederation. There shall be, moreover, a\r\njury for criminal cases.\r\n\r\n2. The members of the Federal Tribunal and their alternates shall be\r\nchosen by the Federal Assembly, which shall take care that all three\r\nnational languages are represented therein. The organization of the\r\nFederal Tribunal and of its sections, the number of its members and\r\nalternates, and their terms of office and salary shall be determined by\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n3. Any Swiss citizen who is eligible to the National Council may be\r\nchosen to the Federal Tribunal. The members of the Federal Assembly or\r\nFederal Council, or officials appointed by those authorities, shall not\r\nat the same time belong to the Federal Tribunal. The members of the\r\nFederal Tribunal shall not during their term of office hold any other\r\noffice, either in the service of the Confederation or any Canton, nor\r\nengage in any other pursuit, nor practise a profession.\r\n\r\n4. The Federal Tribunal shall organize its own chancery, and appoint\r\nthe officials.\r\n\r\n5. The judicial authority of the Federal Tribunal shall extend to civil\r\ncases:\r\n\r\n(_a_) Between the Confederation and the Cantons.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Between the Confederation on the one part and corporations or\r\nprivate persons on the other part; when such corporations or private\r\npersons are the plaintiffs, and when the amount involved is of a degree\r\nof importance to be fixed by federal legislation.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Between Cantons.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Between Cantons on the one part and corporations or private\r\npersons on the other part upon the demand of either party, and where\r\nthe amount involved is of a degree of importance to be fixed by federal\r\nlegislation. It further has jurisdiction in suits concerning the status\r\nof persons not subjects of any government (Heimathlosen), and conflicts\r\nbetween Communes of different Cantons respecting the right of local\r\ncitizenship (_droit de cité_).\r\n\r\n(_e_) The Federal Tribunal shall, moreover, decide other cases upon the\r\ndemand of both parties to the suit, and when the amount involved is of\r\na degree of importance to be fixed by federal legislation.\r\n\r\n(_f_) The Federal Tribunal, with the aid of juries to pass upon\r\nquestions of fact, shall also have jurisdiction in criminal cases:\r\n\r\n(1) Involving high treason against the Confederation or rebellion or\r\nviolence against the federal authorities.\r\n\r\n(2) Involving crimes and misdemeanors against international law.\r\n\r\n(3) Involving political crimes and misdemeanors which are the cause of\r\nthe result of such disturbances as call for armed federal intervention.\r\n\r\n(4) Involving charges against officials appointed by a federal\r\nauthority upon the application of the latter.\r\n\r\n(_g_) The Federal Tribunal further has jurisdiction:\r\n\r\n(1) Over conflicts of jurisdiction between federal authorities on the\r\none part and cantonal authorities on the other part.\r\n\r\n(2) Disputes between the Cantons involving questions of public law.\r\n\r\n(3) Complaints concerning violations of the constitutional rights\r\nof citizens, and complaints of private citizens on account of the\r\nviolation of concordats or treaties. Conflicts of administration are\r\nreserved and are to be settled in a manner prescribed by federal\r\nlegislation. In all the forementioned cases the Federal Tribunal shall\r\napply the laws passed by the Federal Assembly, and those resolutions\r\nwhich have a general import. It shall in like manner conform to all\r\ntreaties which have been ratified by the Federal Assembly.\r\n\r\n(_h_) Besides the cases mentioned, the Confederation may by law place\r\nother matters within the jurisdiction of the Federal Tribunal; in\r\nparticular, it may give to that court powers for securing uniformity\r\nin the application of all federal laws passed in accordance with\r\nprovisions of the constitution.\r\n\r\nIn 1874, within one month after the new constitution came into force,\r\nthe Federal Assembly passed a very elaborate law relating to the\r\nFederal Tribunal. The jurisdiction of the court was extended to:\r\n\r\n1. Cases of expropriation for the construction of railways and other\r\nworks of public utility.\r\n\r\n2. Questions between the Confederation and railway companies, and the\r\nwinding up of the latter.\r\n\r\n3. Cases which by the constitution or the legislation of a Canton are\r\nintrusted to its competency, when such cantonal provisions have been\r\napproved by the Federal Assembly.\r\n\r\nAs a Court of Appeals under the same federal law it sits:\r\n\r\n4. In cases where federal laws have to be applied by Cantonal\r\nTribunals, and the amount of the matter in dispute is 3000 francs\r\nat least, or cannot be estimated; where either party appeals from\r\nthe judgment of the highest Cantonal Court (by agreement the parties\r\ncan make the appeal directly from the lower Cantonal Court, without\r\ngoing to the Cantonal Court of Appeal). It also decides in cases of\r\nextradition, when the demand is made under an existing treaty, in so\r\nfar as the application of the treaty is questioned; it settles boundary\r\nquestions between two Cantons, and questions of competence between the\r\nauthorities of different Cantons. In questions of jurisdiction between\r\nthe Federal Court and cantonal authority, or as to whether it should be\r\nsettled by a court of arbitration, the Tribunal itself decides as to\r\nits own competence. In cases where questions between Cantons or between\r\na Canton and the Confederation come before the court, they come on\r\nreference from the Federal Council. If the Council decides negatively\r\nas to whether a matter ought to come before the court, the Assembly has\r\nthe final determination on the point.\r\n\r\nThis general organizing act of 1874 fixes the number of members of the\r\ncourt and the alternates; their terms of office, salaries, and other\r\ndetails. The number of judges is reduced from eleven to nine, and the\r\ncourt shall never contain, at any given time, two or more persons\r\nfrom the same family; the term is extended from three to six years.\r\nThe president and the vice-president are to be elected by the Federal\r\nAssembly from among the judges, for the term of two years. The salaries\r\nare fixed at 10,000 francs a year for the judges; 11,000 francs for\r\nthe president (or chief justice), and from 6000 to 8000 francs for\r\neach of the secretaries. There must be two secretaries at least, one\r\nfrom German-, the other from French-speaking Switzerland; both must\r\nspeak German and French, and one also Italian. They are chosen by the\r\ncourt by ballot, and for a term of six years. The assistant judges or\r\nalternates receive twenty-five francs a day when serving, and a fixed\r\ntravelling allowance. These assistant judges only sit in the place of\r\nthe judges who are prevented for some reason from sitting in person.\r\nThe judges and the secretaries when away from the seat of the court\r\non official business are paid fifteen francs a day additional, and a\r\ntravelling allowance. The vacations of the court must not exceed four\r\nweeks in the year; but either the president or vice-president must\r\nalways remain at the permanent seat of the court. Temporary leave\r\nof absence may be granted to the members of the court and to the\r\nsecretaries. The judges (but not the assistant judges) are required to\r\nreside where the court is fixed. In cases of elections and in civil\r\nand constitutional causes, seven judges form a quorum, and the number\r\npresent must always be uneven (apparently because the president has\r\nno casting vote). A judge, ordinary or assistant, cannot sit when his\r\nrelatives of blood, or by marriage in an ascending or descending line,\r\nor collaterals up to and including cousin-german or brother-in-law, are\r\nin any way interested in the case. A judge is similarly disqualified\r\nfrom sitting, when the affairs of his wards are under consideration,\r\nor in a case in which he has taken any part personally as federal or\r\ncantonal official, or judge, or arbitrator, or counsel; or in affairs\r\nrelating to an incorporated company of which he is a member; or when\r\nhis Commune or Canton of birth is a party; or when a suit is brought\r\nagainst the executive or legislature of his Canton of birth. A judge\r\nof either kind, ordinary or alternate, may be objected to by a party\r\nto a suit, if the said judge is an enemy of or dependent on one of\r\nthe parties; or since the institution of the suit, as a member of the\r\ncourt, has expressed his opinion on it; but the Federal Court as a\r\nwhole must be accepted by the parties. If by reason of such objections\r\nthere are not enough members to form a quorum, the chairman selects\r\nby lot from among the presidents of the Supreme Cantonal Courts a\r\nsufficient number of “extraordinary assistant judges,” _pro hac vice_.\r\nThe act designates three thousand francs as the minimum amount for\r\n“degree of importance” to give jurisdiction in cases where a money\r\nvalue must be fixed by federal legislation.\r\n\r\nAll members and officials of the court must be bound by oath to fulfil\r\nthe duties of their respective offices; the oath to be administered\r\nto the judges in the presence of the Federal Assembly. This oath may\r\nbe taken by a “_Handgelübde_,” or raising of the hand, in the case of\r\npersons objecting on conscientious grounds to take an oath. The court\r\nis to sit and give judgment in public; this does not apply to the\r\njuries or to preliminary inquiries. The president settles the order\r\nof business and maintains order in court; being empowered to imprison\r\ndisobedient persons for twenty-four hours; and in extreme cases to\r\nfine up to a hundred francs and to imprison up to twenty days. Every\r\nyear the court must submit an account of the business transacted by\r\nit to the Federal Assembly, which has a right to criticise any act of\r\nthe court, but can alter only by a federal law any of its decisions\r\nof which it may disapprove. The officials of the court have the right\r\nof transacting in any Canton, without asking leave of the cantonal\r\nauthorities, all business which falls within their jurisdiction. Each\r\njudge is permitted to deliver opinions in his own dialect. Another\r\nfederal law regulates with great detail the costs of the court,\r\nwhich are defrayed out of the federal treasury, and likewise the\r\nfees which are to be paid by parties to the suits. In the exercise\r\nof the criminal jurisdiction the court goes on a circuit. For this\r\npurpose the Confederation is divided into five assize districts. One\r\nof these districts embraces French Switzerland; a second, Bern and\r\nsurrounding Cantons; a third, Zurich and the Cantons bordering upon\r\nit; a fourth, central and part of east Switzerland; and the fifth,\r\nItalian Switzerland. The court annually divides itself for criminal\r\nbusiness into three sections; a Chamber of Accusation and a Criminal\r\nChamber, each composed of three judges and three alternates, and a\r\nCourt of Criminal Appeal (_Tribunal de Cassation_), with five judges\r\nand five alternates. Sentences are only valid when the court consists\r\nof five members. The Criminal Chamber decides at what places in the\r\nseveral districts assizes shall be held. The localities selected\r\nfurnish at their own cost places of meeting. The cantonal police and\r\ncourt officials serve as officers of the court. The court elects every\r\nsix years, to hold for the whole term of the court, two “Judges of\r\nInquest” (_Untersuchungsrichter_), who are charged with the preparation\r\nof cases. The federal assizes are composed of the Criminal Chamber and\r\na jury of twelve, elected in the Cantons by the people, and drawn by\r\nlot from the list of the district in which the assizes are to be held.\r\nThere is one juror for every one thousand inhabitants in the first four\r\ndistricts as above given; and one for every five hundred in the fifth\r\ndistrict. With certain exceptions, every citizen having the right to\r\nvote in federal matters is eligible as a juror. The exemptions are:\r\nthose of the full age of sixty, those whose names were placed on the\r\nprevious list of jurors, and those who are incapacitated by sickness\r\nor infirmity. The names of all the jurors of the district are placed\r\nin an urn, and fifty-four are drawn by lot. The _Procureur-général_ or\r\nstates-attorney, appointed by the Federal Council for the case, has the\r\nright to challenge twenty and the accused also twenty; the remaining\r\nfourteen are summoned, and two of this number are selected by lot to\r\nact as substitutes in case of need. In order to acquit or condemn a\r\nprisoner there must be a majority of at least ten out of the twelve;\r\notherwise, a new trial must take place with another jury. These federal\r\nassizes are of rare occurrence, the last one being at Neuchâtel in\r\n1879, when an anarchist was condemned for a crime against international\r\nlaw (instigation to the assassination of sovereigns).\r\n\r\nThe power of the court in the matter of claims for violation of rights\r\nof citizens has been exercised with much latitude. The most usual\r\nand proper cases arising under it are: infringements of the federal\r\nguarantee to the citizen of equality before the law, of freedom of\r\nsettlement, of security against double taxation, of liberty of the\r\npress, etc. But the court has gone much beyond these; its jurisdiction\r\nhas been extended to the hearing of complaints against cantonal\r\nauthorities, for ordinary alleged failures of justice, such as could\r\nhardly have been contemplated by the constitution. It has even taken\r\njurisdiction of cases where the appellant asserts a denial of his claim\r\nby a cantonal judge, grounded upon merely obstructive motives or an\r\narbitrary application of the law.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of 1874 had as one of its chief objects the\r\nstrengthening of the federal judiciary; and by statutes, enacted in\r\npursuance of the constitutional authority given to the Federal Assembly\r\nto place other matters within the competence of the court, there have\r\nbeen transferred generally to it the appeals heretofore made from\r\nthe Federal Council to the Federal Assembly. There is no purpose to\r\nentirely exclude the legislative branch from judicial action; for the\r\nconstitution, in dealing with the Federal Tribunal, expressly provides\r\nthat “administrative” cases are reserved to the Assembly; and the act\r\nof 1874 defined the jurisdiction of the Federal Council and Federal\r\nAssembly, under this reservation, to embrace disputes respecting\r\npublic primary schools of the Cantons, liberty of commerce and trade,\r\nrights of established Swiss, religious disputes relating to matters of\r\npublic law, questions as to the calling out of the cantonal militia,\r\nconsumption taxes and import duties, exemption from military service,\r\nand the validity of cantonal elections and votes. In all these cases\r\nan appeal lies from the Federal Council to the Federal Assembly. Thus a\r\nwide field of judicial action is withheld from the sphere of the court,\r\nand upon questions which do not appear to possess any “administrative”\r\ncharacter; producing a division of functions which is very anomalous.\r\nThere has always existed in Switzerland a very strong current of\r\nopinion, that the court should be occupied exclusively with questions\r\nof public law, and should possess no jurisdiction in matters of private\r\nlaw. The Federal Tribunal has no officers of its own to execute its\r\njudgments; but its judgments, as well as the decrees of courts of\r\narbitration in intercantonal conflicts, are executed by the Federal\r\nAssembly; and the Federal Assembly in turn is obliged to resort to\r\ncantonal machinery for the purpose of doing this; so that, in fact,\r\nthese judgments finally are executed by the cantonal authorities.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Tribunal had no permanent seat from 1848 to 1874, and\r\nmet in different places. In 1874, by action of the Federal Assembly,\r\nLausanne was chosen for its permanent location; the Canton of Vaud, in\r\nconsideration of this honor, erected and presented to the Confederation\r\na _palais de justice_, the most elegant and commodious public building\r\nin Switzerland.\r\n\r\nNo professional qualification is required for eligibility to the\r\nFederal Tribunal; any Swiss citizen eligible for the lower branch\r\nof the Federal Assembly may be elected to the Tribunal. There is\r\nno qualification for any federal office in Switzerland higher than\r\nthat for a member of the _Nationalrath_, or lower House of the\r\nFederal Assembly. Any vote-possessing Swiss, twenty years of age\r\n(except a naturalized citizen, who must wait for five years after his\r\nnaturalization), may be President of the Confederation or president\r\nof the Federal Tribunal,--_i.e._, chief justice of the Confederation.\r\nIt naturally occurs that there should be some better guarantee for\r\nthe depth of knowledge and solidity of judgment necessary for the\r\nintelligent consideration and discreet determination of the responsible\r\nduties attached to these high positions, and which can be the result of\r\nnothing but the thought and experience of more mature years. Certainly\r\nin high judicial life there should be a tact, a ripeness, and a nicety\r\nof judgment, an intuitive apprehension of the relations of things, and\r\na wisdom, which age indeed does not always bring, but which age alone\r\ncan bestow.\r\n\r\nThe courts in Switzerland have no place in the political government of\r\nthe country. The Federal Tribunal does not simply owe its existence to\r\nthe Federal Assembly, but is constitutionally forbidden to pass upon\r\nthe validity of the acts of its creator. It is not empowered to judge\r\nof violations of the constitution, or to keep the legislature within\r\nthe limits of a delegated authority, by annulling whatever acts exceed\r\nit. According to the Swiss theory, the legislative department wields\r\nsupreme power; is the sole judge of its own powers; and if, therefore,\r\nits enactments conflict with the constitution, they are nevertheless\r\nvalid, and must operate _pro tanto_ as modifications or amendments of\r\nit. The legislature is deemed to have the right of taking its own view\r\nof the constitution. Its utterance is the guide for the court, which\r\nis always subordinate to it, and bound to enforce every law passed by\r\nit.[39] How different from the authoritative position of the courts in\r\nthe United States, where there is no department of the government in\r\nwhich sound political views are more valuable than in the judiciary. No\r\nlawyer can be found with the requisite strength of mind and character\r\nto make a good judge on the Supreme Bench who is not a man of clear,\r\nwell-defined, and vigorous political opinions. The interpretation of\r\nthe more difficult legal problems calls for the application of those\r\nfundamental principles of government upon which the great parties\r\nare founded. In the history of the United States, parties have been\r\nbroadly characterized by their attitude towards the constitution. Their\r\ngreatest victories have been won in the decisions of the Supreme Court,\r\nas each in turn has been represented there, and has impressed its views\r\nupon the decisions of the judicature. Marshall, Taney, Chase, are the\r\nnames which stand as the high-water marks of the juridic-political\r\nhistory. De Tocqueville, referring to the Supreme Court, says, “That\r\nthe peaceful and legal introduction of the judge into the domain of\r\npolitics is perhaps the most standing characteristic of a free people.”\r\nThe Supreme Court of the United States is universally regarded as the\r\nmost perfect instance of a court exercising the office of guardian\r\nand interpreter of the constitution. It must not be forgotten that,\r\nas such, it came into existence only under the second constitution;\r\nprevious to 1787, it was a mere committee of appeals, the judges\r\nappointed directly by Congress, and dependent on it, or on its\r\nindirect action. To-day it is the pivot on which the constitutional\r\narrangements of the country turn. It determines the limits to the\r\nauthority, both of the government and of the legislature; its decision\r\nis without appeal; completely filling the idea held by some writers,\r\nthat federalism implies the predominance of the judiciary in the\r\nconstitution. It is a tribunal which can set aside a law of Congress,\r\nand enjoin the executive from proceeding, when it is satisfied that\r\neither law or proceeding is contrary to the constitution. It spurns\r\nthe warning of Lord Bacon to his ideal judge, in consulting with the\r\nking and the state, “to remember that Solomon’s throne was supported\r\nwith lions on both sides; let them (the judges) be lions, but lions\r\nunder the throne, circumspect, that they do not check or oppose any\r\npoint of sovereignty.” Such power no other tribunal in any country\r\nof the world possesses. No other country has a court whose power is\r\nabsolute to thwart, even the present will of the nation, by declaring\r\nit out of harmony with a fundamental law adopted a century ago. Caleb\r\nCushing thus addressed the Supreme Court: “You are the incarnate mind\r\nof the political body of the nation. In the complex institutions of\r\nour country, you are the pivot upon which the rights and liberties of\r\nall government and people alike turn; or, rather, you are the central\r\nlight of constitutional wisdom around which they perpetually revolve.”\r\nThe question of the court being identical with or independent of the\r\nlegislature of the supreme or federal government, and the separation of\r\nthe legislative and the judicial functions of government, is strongly\r\nset forth in No. 78 of the “Federalist,” written by Alexander Hamilton:\r\n\r\n“Some perplexity respecting the rights of the courts to pronounce\r\nlegislative acts void, because contrary to the constitution, has\r\narisen from an imagination that the doctrine would imply a superiority\r\nof the judiciary to the legislative power. It is urged that the\r\nauthority which can declare the acts of another void, must necessarily\r\nbe superior to the one whose acts may be declared void. There is no\r\nposition which depends on clearer principles, than that every act of\r\na delegated authority, contrary to the tenor of the commission under\r\nwhich it is exercised, is void. No legislative act, therefore, contrary\r\nto the constitution, can be valid. If it be said that the legislative\r\nbody are themselves the constitutional judges of their own powers,\r\nand that the construction they put upon them is conclusive upon the\r\nother departments, it may be answered, that this cannot be the natural\r\npresumption, where it is not to be collected from any particular\r\nprovisions in the constitution. The interpretation of the laws is the\r\nproper and peculiar province of the courts. A constitution is, in fact,\r\nand must be, regarded by the judges as a fundamental law. It must\r\ntherefore belong to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the\r\nmeaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body. If\r\nthere should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two,\r\nthat which has the superior obligation and validity ought, of course,\r\nto be preferred; in other words, the constitution ought to be preferred\r\nto the statute. Nor does the conclusion by any means suppose a\r\nsuperiority of the judicial to the legislative power. It only supposes\r\nthat the power of the people is superior to both; and that where the\r\nwill of the legislature declared in its statutes, stands in opposition\r\nto that of the people declared in the constitution, the judges ought\r\nto be governed by the latter, rather than the former. They ought to\r\nregulate their decisions by the fundamental laws, rather than by those\r\nwhich are not fundamental.”\r\n\r\nJefferson apprehended encroachments by the Supreme Court, and declared\r\nthat it had the power “to lay all things at its feet.” This alarm\r\nproved to be unfounded, and Mr. Jefferson himself, when the court in\r\nhis judgment passed beyond the undoubted limits of its authority, did\r\nnot hesitate to disregard the opinion of Chief-Justice Marshall, that\r\nit was the duty of his secretary to deliver a judicial commission which\r\nhad been signed by his predecessor.[40]\r\n\r\nTo many the Supreme Court in its inception seemed the weakest of the\r\nthree departments; and it is doubtful if either Madison or Hamilton,\r\nboth of whom expected the court to exercise the power of declaring\r\nlaws unconstitutional, appreciated the mighty force passing into the\r\nhands of the hitherto subordinate power. The judiciary act of 1789\r\nprovided for a review in the Supreme Court of cases where the validity\r\nof a State statute or of any exercise of State authority should be\r\ndrawn in question on the ground of repugnancy to the constitution,\r\ntreaties, or laws of the United States, and the decision should be in\r\nfavor of the validity.[41] Though in the line of natural development,\r\nand previous to the convention of 1787, asserted in New Jersey,\r\nVirginia, Massachusetts, New York, and North Carolina, the exercise\r\nof the full measure of this power in constitutional law presents an\r\ninteresting study in the history of the national and State governments.\r\nA resolution was introduced in Congress in 1824 (Letcher, of Kentucky),\r\nso to amend the judiciary act as to require more than a majority of\r\nthe judges to declare a State law void; and in 1830 an attempt was\r\nmade to repeal that section of the act, but it failed by a vote of one\r\nhundred and thirty-seven to fifty-one. The doctrine of a co-ordinate\r\njudiciary met with violent opposition in some of the States, notably\r\nin Ohio in 1805, and in Kentucky in 1824 (“old court and new court”\r\nstruggle), and in the State of Pennsylvania as late as 1843. This power\r\nto disregard the acts of the legislature and declare them null and void\r\nbecause contrary to the supreme law of the constitution has been a\r\nsource of endless wonder to foreign students of the American system. In\r\nspeaking of it, Sir Henry Maine says, “There is no exact precedent for\r\nit, either in the ancient or in the modern world.”[42] It is a new and\r\noriginal idea in political science, introduced and applied exclusively\r\nin the courts of the United States. The elevation of the judiciary to\r\nequal rank with the executive and the legislature was the outgrowth of\r\na natural process of political evolution through a written constitution\r\nand a federal system of government. Kent, in referring to the case\r\nof Marbury vs. Madison, writes: “The power and duty of a judiciary\r\nto disregard an unconstitutional act of Congress or of any State\r\nlegislature were declared in an argument approaching to the precision\r\nand certainty of a mathematical demonstration.”[43] The power was\r\nnever seriously questioned in the federal courts after that clear and\r\nconclusive opinion, and it was gradually established in all the States.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss Federal Tribunal, as a copy, is neither so consistent with\r\nsound theory, nor so safe in practice, as its prototype in the United\r\nStates. The two systems meet by very different devices the problems\r\npeculiar to federalism, and especially as concerns the interpretation\r\nof the fundamental pact, or articles, or constitution, on which the\r\nunion rests. In the United States, this function is performed in the\r\nlast resort by the Supreme Court, and there is perhaps no other part\r\nof our system which has extorted more admiration from foreign critics\r\nthan this exalted prerogative of the judiciary. But the Federal\r\nTribunal of Switzerland is a body of much more limited power and far\r\nless dignity. Even its jurisdiction is determined in part by the laws\r\nrather than by the constitution. In short, this tribunal appears as a\r\nmere instrumentality of the other organs of the government, and not,\r\nlike the United States Supreme Court, a mediator between them, or even\r\na superior above them. The statesmen of Switzerland felt that a method\r\nfit for the United States might be ill-fitted for their own country,\r\nwhere the latitude given to the executive is greater; and the Swiss\r\nhabit of constantly recurring to popular votes makes it less necessary\r\nto restrain the legislature by a permanently enacted instrument.\r\nThe Swiss constitution itself almost precludes the possibility of\r\nencroachment upon its articles by the legislative body. When the\r\nsovereign power can easily enforce its will, it may trust to its own\r\naction for maintaining its rights; when, as in the United States, the\r\nsame power acts but rarely and with difficulty, the courts naturally\r\nbecome the guardian of the sovereign’s will expressed in the articles\r\nof the constitution. The right to declare laws void is not regarded\r\nthroughout Europe generally as judicial in its character, and hence\r\nhas not been intrusted to the courts; this may furnish a partial\r\nexplanation of the incompetence of the Swiss court in that respect.\r\nThe Federal Tribunal has been much improved since it was originally\r\nset up, and will doubtless, with the decay of unreasonable jealousy of\r\nthe central government on the part of the Cantons, approach more and\r\nmore closely the Supreme Court of the United States, of which it is\r\nan avowed copy, so far as Swiss political traditions and prejudices\r\nwould permit in 1848 and 1874. It rests with the Federal Assembly to\r\ndetermine by statutes the particular questions which shall be submitted\r\nto the court; these have already been greatly extended, and the court\r\nwill ultimately be given a still more independent and influential\r\nposition. The essence of judicial power consists not in judging, but\r\nin laying down the law, or, according to the Roman expression, not _in\r\njudicio_, but _in jure_. The purity of justice, the liberty of the\r\ncitizens, have gained by the change, and government has not lost in\r\nsecurity. Judicial power should be removed as far as possible from all\r\nwarping influence. It should be the great defender of established order\r\nagainst the legislative and executive departments of government. Its\r\nrelation to the law-making and the law-executing powers is peculiarly\r\ndelicate and important. There is need that some other power, not\r\npolitical, removed from the struggles of the present, having no ends\r\nof its own to answer in the future, should have the function to decide\r\nwhat is the meaning and application of a law; and whether there is any\r\npositive conflict between a new one and a received one, or between a\r\nnew one and a constitution. This should be a power able to watch over\r\nthe constitution, and prevent invasions of it. The highest court can\r\nexercise this guardianship better than any other board of control that\r\ncan be devised. The power of the judiciary, under certain conditions,\r\nto pronounce upon the constitutionality of the laws is “a security to\r\nthe justice of the state against its power.”[44] The supreme power of\r\nthe court becomes the servant of the federative principle, which as\r\na mediator between opposing forces is pre-eminently a principle of\r\njustice. The decision is now national, now in favor of the state, and\r\nthus, through interpretation, the constitution is developed, and the\r\ntwo forces have as free play in the judicial as in the more strictly\r\npolitical action.\r\n\r\nWe speak of three co-ordinate branches and of their working, each in\r\na separate and defined province; and yet, as must of necessity be\r\nthe case in human affairs, the lines of demarcation are not always\r\nclear, and unless confusion is to be endless, a power must exist\r\nsomewhere to determine the limits of the separate provinces, and to\r\ndecide controversies in regard to them. The power to do this has been\r\nconfided under the system of the United States to the courts, in\r\naccordance with the principles of the common law, if not by the express\r\nprovisions of the constitution. To the United States Supreme Court is\r\nconfided the duty of deciding questions involving the limitations of\r\nthe different branches of the government. It diminishes the danger of\r\ncollision between the different political bodies among which power\r\nis distributed, because these bodies are not brought into direct\r\ncontact, but act each in its own way directly on the people; the\r\ncourts regulating conflicts of authority as they arise. The peace,\r\nthe prosperity, and the very existence of the Union are invested in\r\nits hands; the executive appeals to it for assistance against the\r\nencroachments of the legislative power, and the legislature demands\r\nits protection from the designs of the executive; it defends the Union\r\nfrom disobedience of the States, and the States from the exaggerated\r\nclaims of the Union, the public interests against the interests of\r\nprivate citizens, and the conservative spirit of order against the\r\nfleeting innovations of democracy. This form of government, with the\r\nimmense power it gives to the courts, could not exist among a people\r\nwhose reverence for law and submissiveness to its mandates were not\r\nvery great, and would not be possible, moreover, if it did not rest on\r\na popular basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE CANTONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrior to the year 1798, the condition of a Swiss Canton was that of\r\na great feudal lord, with an aggregate of many separate seigniorial\r\nproperties; acquired partly by conquest, partly by purchase. In the\r\ntown Cantons, such as Bern, Basel, and Zurich, the town was the\r\nlord, and the country districts were attached to each as dependent\r\nproperties. In the rural Cantons, such as Uri and Schwyz, it was an\r\naggregate of democratic communities, which exercised lordship over\r\nother dependent communities in their neighborhood. The conquered\r\ndistricts, instead of being created into new Cantons, remained subject,\r\nin some cases to individual Cantons, in others to associations of\r\nCantons for their members jointly. In the rustic communities the\r\ngovernment was a pure democracy; in the cities it was tempered with a\r\nsmall mixture of aristocracy. Each Canton had a separate coinage, its\r\nbatzen and rapps, kreutzers and schillings, sous and centimes, that\r\nwould not pass beyond its frontier.[45] Each Canton had its own agents\r\naccredited to foreign powers. Each Canton kept a custom-house, and\r\nmanned a tower at every bridge, at which each load of grass, butt of\r\nwine, sack of corn, and pound of cheese that passed the boundary was\r\ntaxed. Every Canton was a distinct body, independent from any other,\r\nand exercising the sovereign power within itself; looking upon the rest\r\nas mere allies to whom it was bound only by such acts to which it had\r\nconsented, and when any new thing not comprehended in this agreement\r\nhappened to arise, each Canton retained the power of determining the\r\nmatter for itself. The idea that the minority of Cantons was bound by\r\nthe decision of the majority took root slowly, and internal affairs\r\ndepended for settlement on remonstrance and mediation. They were kept\r\ntogether by the peculiarity of their topographical position, by their\r\nindividual weakness, by their fear of powerful neighbors, by the few\r\nsources of contention among a people of such simple and homogeneous\r\nmanners, and by their joint interest in their dependent possessions.\r\nThe conditions of the country and of its society contributed to\r\ndivide instead of to unite the different Cantons. Mountains and lakes\r\nseparated them into almost distinct nationalities; they were peopled\r\nby different races, with differences of language, religion, customs,\r\nindustries, material interest, and social development,--more than a\r\nhundred parcels of territory, each having its separate history, and\r\nin many cases a far greater difference between the inhabitants than\r\nbetween the people of Maine and Texas, of Massachusetts and California,\r\nfor they were a polyglot people without a community of language,\r\nto which, as a cohesive force, nothing can compare, especially in\r\na democratic state governed by opinion expressed through universal\r\nsuffrage. Many were the difficulties and dangers through which\r\nthe Cantons had to struggle to break up this system and overcome\r\nthese causes of dissension. This was gradually accomplished by the\r\nprinciples of confederation, judiciously and temperately applied to the\r\ncircumstances of the country.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss Cantons of to-day have very much the political organism of\r\nthe United States. They are sovereign in so far as their sovereignty\r\nis not limited by the federal constitution; and as such they exercise\r\nall the rights which are not delegated to the federal government.\r\nThe Cantons are units of a federal state, possessed within certain\r\nlimits of independent and supreme power. The Swiss constitution,\r\nafter guaranteeing to the Cantons their sovereignty, their territory,\r\ntheir constitutions, etc. (as pointed out in the chapter on the\r\nconstitution), again and again reverts to the rights, powers, and\r\nduties of the Canton with that remarkable detail which characterizes\r\nthe text of that instrument in everything it touches. These cantonal\r\nprovisions are, viz.:\r\n\r\n1. The Cantons have the right to make conventions among themselves upon\r\nlegislative, administrative, or judicial subjects; in all cases they\r\nshall bring such conventions to the attention of the federal officials,\r\nwho are authorized to prevent their execution if they contain anything\r\ncontrary to the Confederation or to the rights of the Cantons.\r\nShould such not be the case, the respective Cantons may demand the\r\nco-operation of the federal authorities in their execution.\r\n\r\n2. By exception, the Cantons preserve the right to conclude treaties\r\nwith foreign powers, respecting the administration of public property,\r\nand border and police intercourse; but such treaties shall contain\r\nnothing contrary to the Confederation or to the rights of the Canton.\r\n\r\n3. Official intercourse between the Cantons and foreign governments or\r\ntheir representatives shall take place through the Federal Council.\r\nBut the Cantons may deal directly with the subordinate officials and\r\nofficers of a foreign state in regard to the subjects enumerated (in\r\nSection 2).\r\n\r\n4. In the case of sudden danger of foreign attack, the authorities of\r\nthe Canton threatened shall request the aid of other members of the\r\nConfederation, and shall immediately notify the federal government,\r\nwithout prejudice, however, to the action of the latter. The Cantons\r\nso summoned are bound to give aid. The expenses shall be borne by the\r\nConfederation.\r\n\r\n5. In case of internal disturbance, or when danger threatens from\r\nanother Canton, the authorities of the Canton threatened shall\r\nimmediately notify the Federal Council, in order that it may take\r\nthe necessary measures within the limits of its power, or may summon\r\nthe Federal Assembly. In urgent cases the authorities of the Canton\r\nnotifying the federal government of its action, may ask the aid of\r\nother Cantons, to which the latter are bound to respond. If the\r\ncantonal government is unable to call for aid, the federal authority,\r\nhaving the power, may, and if the safety of Switzerland is endangered\r\nshall, intervene without requisition. In case of federal intervention,\r\nthe federal authorities shall take care that the provisions of the\r\nconstitution guaranteeing the sovereignty of the Cantons be observed.\r\nThe expenses shall be borne by the Canton asking the aid or occasioning\r\nfederal intervention, except when the Federal Assembly otherwise\r\ndecides on account of special circumstances.\r\n\r\n6. In the cases mentioned (Sections 4 and 5), every Canton is bound to\r\nafford undisturbed passage for the troops. The troops shall immediately\r\nbe placed under federal command.\r\n\r\n7. The Cantons may require proofs of competency from those who desire\r\nto practise the liberal professions; federal legislation may provide\r\nfor certificates of competency valid for the whole Confederation.\r\n\r\n8. Cantons, under the supervision of the Confederation, shall enforce\r\nthe federal laws relating to weights and measures.\r\n\r\n9. Every citizen of a Canton is a Swiss citizen. As such (after\r\nfurnishing evidence of his right to vote) he can take part at his\r\nplace of residence in all federal elections and votes. No one shall\r\nexercise political rights in more than one Canton. Every Swiss citizen\r\nshall enjoy where he is domiciled all the rights of the citizens of\r\nthe Canton, as also all the rights of the citizens of the Commune. He\r\nshall, however, have no share in the common property of the citizens or\r\nof the corporation; nor shall he exercise the right to vote in matters\r\npertaining purely to such affairs unless the Canton by legislation has\r\notherwise provided. In cantonal and communal affairs he gains the right\r\nto vote after a residence of three months. The cantonal laws relating\r\nto the right of Swiss citizens to settle outside the Cantons in which\r\nthey were born, and to vote on communal questions, are subject to the\r\napproval of the Federal Council.\r\n\r\n10. No Canton shall expel from its territory one of its own citizens,\r\nnor deprive him of his rights, whether acquired by birth or settlement\r\n(_origine ou cité_).\r\n\r\n11. Every Swiss citizen shall have the right to settle at any place\r\nwithin Swiss territory, if he possesses a certificate of origin or\r\nsome similar paper. In exceptional cases the right of settlement may\r\nbe refused to, or withdrawn from, those who, in consequence of a penal\r\nconviction, are not entitled to civil rights. The right of settlement\r\nmay, moreover, be withdrawn from those who, in consequence of serious\r\nmisdemeanors, have been repeatedly punished; and also from those who\r\nbecome a permanent charge upon public charity, and to whom their\r\nCommune or Canton of origin refuses adequate assistance after having\r\nbeen officially asked to grant it. In Cantons where the system of local\r\nrelief obtains, the permission to settle, if it relates to natives of\r\nthe Canton, may be made dependent on the condition that the parties\r\nare able to work, and have not hitherto been a permanent charge upon\r\npublic charity in their previous place of residence. Every expulsion\r\non account of poverty must be approved by the cantonal government,\r\nand previous notice given to the government of the Canton of origin.\r\nA Canton in which a Swiss establishes his domicile shall not require\r\nsecurity nor impose any special obligations for such establishment.\r\nNor shall the Commune in which he settles require from him other\r\ncontributions than those which it requires from its own citizens. A\r\nfederal law shall fix the maximum fee to be paid the registration\r\noffice for a permit to settle.\r\n\r\n12. Persons settled in Switzerland shall, as a rule, be subjected to\r\nthe jurisdiction and legislation of their domicile in all that pertains\r\nto their personal status and property rights. Federal law shall\r\ndetermine the application of this principle, and shall also make the\r\nnecessary regulations to prevent double taxation of a citizen.\r\n\r\n13. A marriage contracted in any Canton or in a foreign country,\r\naccording to the laws there prevailing, shall be recognized as valid\r\nthroughout the Confederation.\r\n\r\n14. The Cantons by law shall provide against all abuse of the freedom\r\nof the press, but such legislation shall be subject to the approval of\r\nthe Federal Council.\r\n\r\n15. Citizens shall have the right to form associations, so far as they\r\nare not, either in their purpose or methods, illegal or dangerous to\r\nthe state. The Canton by law shall take the measures necessary for the\r\nsuppression of abuses.\r\n\r\n16. All the Cantons are bound to treat the citizens of the other\r\nconfederated states like their own citizens, both in their legislation\r\nand in judicial procedure.\r\n\r\n17. Civil judgments, definitely pronounced in any Canton, may be\r\nexecuted anywhere in Switzerland.\r\n\r\n18. The exit duty on property leaving one Canton for another\r\n(_Abzugsrechte_; _la traite foraine_) is hereby abolished, as well as\r\nrights of first purchase (_Zugrechte_; _droit de retrait_) by citizens\r\nof one Canton against those of another Canton.[46]\r\n\r\n19. The administration of justice remains with the Cantons, save as\r\naffected by the powers of the Federal Tribunal.\r\n\r\n20. The Cantons may, by correspondence, exercise the right of\r\ninitiative as to measures in either council of the Federal Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe duty of the federal government to intervene for the enforcement\r\nof its guarantee of the “constitutional rights of citizens” in the\r\nCantons has been declared by the Federal Council in these words:\r\n“When complaints are made regarding the violation of the constitution\r\nin a Canton, and these are brought before the federal authorities,\r\nthe latter become in duty bound to investigate them and to form a\r\ndecision as to their foundation or want of foundation, and as to\r\nnecessary further regulations. For the Confederation guarantees\r\nthe constitutional rights of the citizen as well as the rights of\r\nthe authorities. The earlier articles of union also guaranteed the\r\nconstitutions, but this guarantee was otherwise explained, and many\r\ncomplaints of unconstitutional proceedings and circumstances were\r\nraised and disregarded. It was desired that these should be no longer\r\nendured, and there was demanded an effective guarantee against\r\nviolations of the constitution. Thus arose Article 5 of the federal\r\nconstitution, which guaranteed with almost pedantic care the rights of\r\nthe nation and the constitutional rights of the citizen. It would, in\r\nfact, be a remarkable relapse into the old view and order of things, a\r\nstriking denial of the principles contained in Article 5, if we were to\r\nassume that, in case of a formally presented complaint, the federal\r\nauthorities were free to interfere or not. We hold rather that in such\r\ncases the federal authorities are obliged to take up the complaints and\r\nrender a decision regarding them.”\r\n\r\nIf a cantonal law violates the federal constitution or a federal\r\nlaw, the Federal Tribunal will declare it invalid; but in some cases\r\nrecourse must be had to the Federal Council. The protection guaranteed\r\nby the constitution applies to disturbances of the peace within a\r\nCanton, to attacks of one Canton on another, or to a foreign attack.\r\nThe appeal, as a rule, is to the Federal Council, exceptionally to\r\nother Cantons; with the existing facilities for communication with the\r\nFederal Council, aid is now demanded exclusively from that body. This\r\nfeature in the relation of the general government to the Canton, and\r\nCanton to Canton, is very different from that of the United States\r\nto the State, and State to State. The State is more independent than\r\nthe Canton of this external interference. It is not obliged to obey\r\nthe summons of any other State for help; it has, in fact, no right\r\nto render any such aid. The government in the United States may not\r\nintervene even to preserve order in a State except on the request of\r\nthe legislature or the executive of the State.\r\n\r\nA special federal law enumerates the crimes for which one Canton may\r\ndemand from another the extradition of criminals. It embraces both\r\nstatutory and common-law crimes, and only stops at the limitation\r\nfixed by the constitution, which declares that extradition may not be\r\nrendered obligatory for political offences and those of the press. But\r\nextradition may be refused, in any case, of persons who have acquired\r\ncitizenship, or who have settled in a Canton, when this Canton binds\r\nitself to try and punish the accused according to its own law; or\r\nallows a sentence already pronounced in another Canton to be executed\r\nby its own officials.\r\n\r\nThe Cantons, not being limited by the terms of the federal\r\nconstitution, are left sovereign in matters of civil law (except as\r\nregards the civil capacity of persons), the law of land, land rights,\r\ndescent and distribution, criminal law, cantonal and local police,\r\norganization of the Communes, public works in general, organization\r\nof schools (within limits of the constitution), the conclusion of\r\nconventions with each other (called concordats), respecting matters\r\nof administration, police, etc. The changes introduced by the\r\npresent constitution have had the effect to supplant many of the\r\ncantonal laws, often very dissimilar and conflicting, by federal laws\r\napplicable to the whole Confederation; establishing a uniformity\r\nupon many important relations between the citizens and the state.\r\nRevisions of the fundamental laws of the Cantons have been frequent;\r\nmost of the cantonal constitutions are of a recent date. From 1830\r\nto 1874 there have been twenty-seven total or partial revisions of\r\nthe cantonal constitutions. In a large measure these were required\r\nto harmonize them with the federal constitution, first of 1848 and\r\nthen of 1874. An amendment to a cantonal constitution becomes valid\r\nonly when ratified by the federal authorities; no concrete case being\r\nnecessary to test it,--the Swiss procedure to assure the supremacy\r\nof the federal constitution being political, not judicial. Cantonal\r\nconstitutions present an infinite variety in their organisms and\r\noperations; but it will be sufficient to give the general features\r\nof one of the two distinctive types, the representative system; the\r\nother, the _Landsgemeinde_ or open Assembly, composed of all the people\r\npossessing votes, is reserved for a separate chapter. In the Cantons\r\nof the representative system the legislative department consists of\r\nbut a single house, called the Greater or Grand Council (_Grosser\r\nRath_), and in a few of the Cantons known as the _Kantonsrath_ or\r\n_Landrath_. The members are elected by direct popular vote, and, with\r\nfew exceptions, by the secret ballot; from electoral districts and by\r\n_scrutin de liste_. The average representation is about one to every\r\none thousand inhabitants. In a few Cantons, representation is not\r\nbased upon the population, but is determined by the number of active\r\ncitizens; and in the Canton of Luzern, the number of representatives\r\nis fixed by the constitution without any regard to the population, or\r\nprovision for future reapportionment. Every vote-possessing citizen\r\nis ordinarily eligible for the Greater Council; the last vestiges\r\nof property-qualification having disappeared. The Canton of Geneva\r\nlimits eligibility to those who have attained their twenty-sixth year.\r\nIn some Cantons functionaries salaried by the state are excluded.\r\nThere is a curious diversity presented in the federal and cantonal\r\nage-qualification. A citizen of the Grisons attains political majority\r\nfor cantonal electoral purpose at the age of seventeen, or three years\r\nbefore he can participate in federal elections. In the Canton of Geneva\r\nthe citizen only attains his political majority for cantonal purpose\r\nat the age of twenty-one, or one year after he is a voter at federal\r\nelections; and a Genevese can be a member of the Federal Assembly or\r\nthe federal supreme court or even President of the Confederation six\r\nyears before he is eligible to his cantonal legislature.\r\n\r\nThe terms in the Greater Council vary from one year to five. In many\r\nof the Cantons the members receive no pay; the highest amount paid\r\nis in the Canton of Geneva, and it is only six francs for each day\r\nthat there is a sitting. The Greater Council, besides drafting the\r\nlaws and decrees, and interpreting, suspending, and repealing them,\r\nis ordinarily invested with legislative power over the organization\r\nof administrations; the supervision of the execution of the laws;\r\nthe right of pardon; the ratification of cantonal agreements; the\r\nestablishment of cantonal taxes and the mode of their collection;\r\nnaturalization; ratification of loans contracted by the Canton; the\r\nacquisition and alienation of cantonal property; public buildings;\r\nthe fixing of salaries and emoluments; the surveillance of the\r\nexecutive and judicial powers, and the settlement of conflicts of\r\njurisdiction between these powers; the fixing of the annual budget;\r\nthe appointment of the members of the Lesser or State Council, as\r\nwell as the members of the Supreme Tribunal. In Geneva, Basel-rural,\r\nZurich, and Thurgau, the members of the Lesser Council are elected\r\ndirectly by the people. This Lesser Council, which constitutes the\r\nexecutive power, is variously called, in the different Cantons,\r\n_Conseil d’État_, _Staatsrath_, _Standeskommission_, _Kleinerrath_.\r\nOriginally it was quite a large body; but recent revisions of the\r\ncantonal constitutions have made a reduction in the number, and it now\r\nconsists of from five to seven members, who distribute among themselves\r\nthe different departments on the same system as that described of\r\nthe Federal Council. The terms vary from two years to four. In some\r\nCantons the members must be divided as far as practicable among the\r\nseveral electoral districts. In all the Cantons this executive power\r\nis collegiate,--that is, not vested in a single individual, but in a\r\ncommission. Nowhere does the chief magistrate hold the independent\r\nposition of an American State governor, but, like the President of\r\nthe Confederation, is mere chairman of the council. The salary paid\r\nthe members of the executive council is from three to five thousand\r\nfrancs a year. This Council proposes laws and decrees to the Greater\r\nCouncil, and watches over the maintenance of public tranquillity and\r\nsecurity, as well as over the execution of the laws, decrees, and\r\nregulations of the Greater Council. It administers the funds of the\r\nstate; appoints those executive and administrative functionaries who\r\nare immediately subordinate to it, and watches over them; it has also\r\nthe higher surveillance of the communal administrations, the poor,\r\nthe schools, and the churches. The qualification for a member of the\r\nexecutive or Lesser Council is the same as that of the Greater Council;\r\nand in both instances it is uniformly limited to active citizens and\r\nlaymen, and they are re-eligible without limit. The executive council\r\nin the larger Cantons is represented, in districts established for the\r\npurpose, by _Prefects_, or _Regierungsstatthalter_, or _Statthalter_,\r\nwho, associated with two Councillors, compose a commission for many\r\npurposes. Although agents of the executive council, they are not always\r\nappointed by it, but sometimes by the Greater Council, and often\r\ndirectly by the people. The constitutions of most of the Cantons say\r\nthat the legislative, executive, and judicial functions shall be kept\r\ndistinct; yet in practice the line of demarcation is often ignored.\r\nThe legislative bodies are given an important share both in the\r\nadministration and interpretation of the laws. As in the federal, so\r\nin the cantonal constitutions, there is not to be found that delicate\r\nadjustment of the political forces, forming so conspicuous a feature\r\nin the national as well as in the State system of the United States;\r\nthat great ingenuity and skill in the contrivances which prevent the\r\ndifferent representative bodies from being mere fac-similes of each\r\nother, and at the same time preserve their equality in point of power.\r\n\r\nA cantonal constitution usually opens with the declaration that the\r\n“sovereignty resides in the people as a whole” (“_auf der Gresammtheit\r\ndes Volks beruhe_”); and then follows the further declaration that\r\nthe people, by virtue of that sovereignty, “give it [the Canton] the\r\nfollowing constitution;” also that this sovereignty is to be “directly\r\nexerted by the active citizens and only indirectly by the magistrates\r\nand officials;” that “the people exercise the legislative power in\r\nco-operation with the cantonal council” (referring to the right of\r\n_Initiative_ and _Referendum_); and that in this “it is the duty of\r\nevery citizen to participate.”\r\n\r\nAll the cantonal constitutions contain, in a more or less explicit and\r\nelaborate manner, provisions of this nature, viz.:\r\n\r\nAll citizens are equal in the eye of the law and enjoy the same civil\r\nrights; free expression of opinion by word or in writing; the right\r\nof association and of assembly is guaranteed, subject to no other\r\nrestrictions than those of the common law; in libel suits, alleged\r\ndefamatory publications must not only be proven to be true, but must\r\nappear to have been made from “honest motives and a righteous purpose;”\r\nhouse and home right inviolable; house-searching by an official vested\r\nwith this power must be in advance carefully explained by the official,\r\nas to the reason for and the extent of the proposed search; innocent\r\npersons sentenced are entitled to restitution and just satisfaction\r\nfrom the state; father and son, father-in-law and son-in-law, two\r\nbrothers, or two brothers-in-law cannot serve at the same time as\r\nmembers of the executive or judicial department; all citizens subject\r\nto taxation must contribute to the burdens of the state and the\r\ncommunity in accordance with their respective means; small estates\r\nof persons disabled for work, as well as a sum absolutely necessary\r\nfor support, shall be exempt from taxation; tax exemptions in favor\r\nof private persons or industrial companies forbidden; no new taxes\r\non the consumption of any of the necessaries of life to be levied;\r\ncantonal and district officers to receive fixed salaries, all fees\r\ngoing into the state treasury; organization and management of charity\r\nleft to the community;[47] the state to make suitable contributions\r\nto lighten the burdens of poor communities, and especially to extend\r\nits influence and aid in the education of the children of the poor,\r\nimproving the hospital service, and reforming the character and\r\nameliorating the condition of the neglected and dissolute; to render\r\nassistance and facilities for the development of trades-unions based on\r\nthe principle of self-help; to pass laws essential for the protection\r\nof the laboring classes; judicial sentences not to be set aside or\r\nmodified by any legislative or administrative authority, except in so\r\nfar as the pardoning power is vested in the cantonal council. There\r\nare also numerous provisions relating to church affairs and education,\r\non parallel lines with those of the federal constitution, with the\r\naddition that the former includes the organization and management of\r\nthe church communities which are exclusively under cantonal authority.\r\n\r\nThe Cantons are left quite free to organize their courts as they\r\nplease; justice, in general terms, being administered by the Canton\r\nwith recourse in specified cases to the Federal Tribunal. The cantonal\r\njudicial organization presents two well-defined courts: the district\r\ncourts (_Bezirksgerichte_ or _Amtsgerichte_), which are courts of\r\nfirst instance; and a supreme or appellate court (_Obergericht_ or\r\n_Appellationsgericht_), which is the court of final instance. Some\r\nof the Cantons have justices of the peace; these are elected by the\r\nCommunes for a term of six years, and have jurisdiction up to fifty\r\nfrancs. Either party to a suit, or the justice, may demand that\r\ntwo jurors elected by the casting of lots be summoned to assist in\r\nthe trial. For the hearing of criminal cases, there is a trial in\r\na few Cantons by a jury under the presidency of a section of the\r\nsupreme-court justices, but in the others a special criminal court\r\nacts without a jury. In three of the large Cantons, Geneva, Zurich,\r\nand St. Gallen, there are special _Cassation_ courts put above\r\nthe _Obergericht_. Zurich and Geneva have also special commercial\r\ncourts (_Handelsgerichte_). In many of the Cantons the supreme court\r\nexercises certain semi-executive functions, taking the place of a\r\nministry of justice, in overseeing the action of the lower courts, and\r\nof all judicial officers, such as the states-attorneys. The courts\r\nmake annual reports to the legislative council, containing a full\r\nreview of the judicial business of each year, discussing the state of\r\njustice, with criticisms upon the system in vogue, and suggestions of\r\nreform. These reports are important sources of judicial statistics.\r\nThe terms of cantonal judges vary from three to four and six years.\r\nThe judges of the inferior courts are elected directly by the people;\r\nthose of the supreme courts by the legislative council. In Bern the\r\nlegislative council also elects the presidents of the district courts.\r\nNo qualification for election to the bench is required except that of\r\nbeing an “active citizen.” But invariably, to the higher courts at\r\nleast, competent lawyers are chosen; and re-election is the rule. The\r\ndistrict courts render final judgments on claims from fifty to two\r\nhundred francs. Either party to the suit has the right to demand that\r\ntwo district judges preside as associate judges. The district courts,\r\nconsisting of a president and four judges, decide as of first resort,\r\nand the appellate chambers of the supreme court, as of second and final\r\nresort, all claims exceeding two hundred francs. The commercial court\r\ndecides finally all claims exceeding five hundred francs, provided\r\nthe defendant is entered in the commercial register. In proceedings\r\nbefore the district and commercial courts the claim is first submitted\r\nto a justice acting as _propitiator_; he summons the parties for the\r\npurpose of effecting an amicable adjustment of their difficulties; if\r\nno agreement can be reached, a lawsuit permit is issued by the justice\r\nand handed to the plaintiff, which he in turn presents to the court. In\r\na majority of cases the court proceedings are oral; only in exceptional\r\ncases, involving difficult and novel questions or intricate accounts,\r\nan order will be made for written preparatory proceedings. After the\r\ncourt hears an oral statement of the claim and the defence, it decides\r\nwhether further evidence shall be produced, and issues an order setting\r\nforth what must be established by each party in the form of written\r\ntestimony; and this must be presented to the court in an accurate and\r\ncarefully-prepared form. The judgment of the court is first rendered\r\norally, and written notice of the same given to the parties. When an\r\nappeal lies, it must be taken within ten days from the receipt of the\r\nabove notice. In all cases the plaintiff must make a deposit to cover\r\nthe costs, but the costs are to be finally paid by the party cast in\r\nthe suit.\r\n\r\nUnder the constitutional provision, that final civil judgments rendered\r\nin one Canton are executory in any other Canton, sometimes a question\r\narises as to the obligation of one Canton to carry out the decree of\r\nthe court of another Canton. This question must be referred for final\r\ndecision to the federal authorities. In only one Canton, that of Uri,\r\nis there a departure from the federal system, and there the cantonal\r\ncourts have the power to declare invalid a cantonal legislative\r\nenactment.\r\n\r\nTrial by jury, even for felony, does not universally exist in the\r\nCantons. The substitution of a tribunal or judicial body instead of\r\nthe unitary system, though claimed to be almost tantamount, is far\r\nfrom fulfilling the essential purpose of a jury. Knowledge, skill,\r\nand strict impartiality belong to the judge; common sense and common\r\nfeelings to private individuals on a jury. The judge is deaf, blind,\r\nand inexorable, and knows only the law; the jury is under the influence\r\nof public opinion, or even of public prejudices, which must not be\r\noverlooked altogether, and for the sake of the law itself, of peace\r\nand good government. The jury is, in fact, a legislative as well as a\r\njudicial power, negatively at least, for deciding on law as well as\r\non fact; they may and do silence the law when they please. Unforeseen\r\ncases occur sometimes where an undue advantage is taken of the law.\r\nThe jury may suspend, in fact, its application until it is altered; in\r\nother cases, less uncommon, the strict application of the law would be\r\ndirectly in opposition to public feelings and prejudices, to the extent\r\nof threatening popular violence and revolution. A judge cannot make the\r\nlaw bend to circumstances; government cannot yield without disclosing\r\nweakness and encouraging the factious; but the jury, being supposed to\r\nparticipate in these public feelings, may preserve the peace without\r\ndisgrace, by a sort of innocent denial of justice. A jury of judges,\r\nas the silent part of the bench may be deemed, cannot be ignorant of\r\nthe law, and would make themselves gratuitously contemptible if they\r\npretended to participate in the feelings of the multitude. Besides\r\nthe obvious use of juries as a check on judiciary proceedings for the\r\nsafety of individuals, the institution is of high political importance.\r\nIt is one of the hidden springs upon which the cumbrous machine of\r\nsociety is, as it were, suspended, and enabled thereby to sustain\r\naccidental shocks without coming to pieces.\r\n\r\nThere was abundant justification in the early cantonal criminal\r\ncodes for the abolition, by the federal constitution, of capital\r\npunishment[48] and corporal pains. Many of the codes were not\r\ndistinguished for justice, gentleness, or rationality. Nowhere were\r\nwitches more relentlessly pursued than in some of the Cantons of\r\nSwitzerland. The laws denouncing them were of Draconian severity. Stern\r\nwere the ordinances and strange the customs of the older Cantons.\r\nIn 1666 an entire family, mother, son, and daughter, were burned in\r\nUnterwalden for practising forbidden arts. No less than one hundred\r\nand fifty individuals were executed at Geneva, in a period of fifty\r\nyears, during the seventeenth century, for the capital offence of\r\nwitchcraft, denominated _lèse-majesté divine au plus haut chef_. The\r\nlast execution for sorcery was in Glarus in 1782. So late as 1824 a man\r\nwas racked in Zug, and in the archives of Obwald appears an entry, in\r\n1840, of a payment of thirty francs to the executioner for beating a\r\nprisoner, who had proved refractory under examination, with rods, in\r\nthe torture-chamber. The Swiss historian Müller relates that one Sak,\r\nat Bern, was sentenced to be whipped, and led out of the gate by the\r\nexecutioner, for returning from banishment, and if he returned again\r\nhe should be drowned; also Hanns, the public executioner of Bern, was\r\nbanished two miles from the jurisdiction of the town for having spoken\r\nimmodestly to respectable men and women, and if he returned he should\r\nhave his eyes put out. An inn-keeper of Bern, having procured the\r\nseal of a councillor who lodged at his house, made use of it to forge\r\nobligations for sums of money which, supported by false witnesses, he\r\nclaimed after an interval of several years; the fraud being discovered,\r\nhe was broken upon the wheel, and the witnesses “boiled in a kettle.”\r\nIn Zurich, any one clipping the coin, had his fingers clipped off, and\r\nwas then hanged. In the council-room of the old Rathhaus of Appenzell\r\ncan still be seen an instrument known as the “bocksfutter”; it consists\r\nof a long bench, on which delinquents, ordered to be punished with\r\nstripes, and prisoners, who were obstinate about admitting their\r\nguilt, were wont to be placed, with legs and arms outstretched as if\r\nthey were going to swim; but every attempt to move these members was\r\nprevented by enclosing them in iron clamps firmly fastened to the\r\nbench; this preliminary completed, the executioner was called in,\r\nand ordered to give the victim as many strokes with “_ochsenziemer_”\r\non the bare body, as the judges might think necessary, to loosen his\r\ntongue or purge him of his offence. Another so-called truth-finder\r\n(_wahrheitserforschungsmittel_) was a cage, in which one could neither\r\nstand upright nor stretch his legs, but only cower on the floor in a\r\nconstrained position. At Freiburg the punishment for stealing five\r\nsous was death by decapitation; and a stranger striking a burgher was\r\nfastened to a post and scalped, while a burgher striking a stranger\r\npaid three sous. Capital punishment was inflicted by cutting off the\r\nhead, which was done in this manner: the culprit was made fast in an\r\narm-chair, and a cap placed on his head with a hole in the top, by\r\nwhich an assistant took hold of his hair, while the executioner, placed\r\nbehind, struck off his head with a broadsword.\r\n\r\nThere is little or nothing in the Swiss cantonal institutions to\r\ntempt unworthy men into official life. The salaries are nominal, with\r\nvery remote chances for any personal aggrandizement. In the local and\r\nmunicipal administrations, it is difficult, if not impossible, for any\r\none class to employ the powers of government for purely selfish ends.\r\nMany of the officials serve the Canton, municipality, and community\r\nwith motives as honorable as their services are intelligent and\r\nefficient. The Cantons and communities are comparatively free from\r\ndebt, and not burdened by excessive taxes. There is a general aversion\r\nto incurring public debts, common to the Swiss, from the federal head\r\ndown through the cantonal, municipal, and community administrations.\r\nThe revenues of these little states are small, and require strict\r\neconomy in every branch of expenditure. Nothing is wasted on useless\r\nconsumers and their retainers; an exact account must be rendered of\r\nthe employment of the public funds; and precision and publicity in the\r\nkeeping of public accounts. The people yields its servants, indeed,\r\nsome compensation, but it does not reward them with pensions or with\r\nsuperabundant influence. It builds up no official class who forget\r\ntheir citizenship and separate themselves from the mass of the people,\r\nsqueezing as many advantages as possible out of their offices, even\r\nto the prejudice of efficient service. The Cantons, upon enumeration,\r\nnumber not twenty-two but twenty-five, because three of them have\r\nbeen divided into half-Cantons, making nineteen whole and six half\r\nCantons. Basel is divided into Basel-Stadt and Basel-Landschaft (urban\r\nand rural); Appenzell, into Ausser-Rhoden and Inner-Rhoden; and\r\nUnterwalden, into Obwald and Nidwald (above and below the forests\r\nwhich formed the boundary between them). The rending of these Cantons\r\ninto half-Cantons was the work of party feuds; in one place springing\r\nfrom political causes, in a second from religious strife, and in the\r\nthird from wrangles about wood and grass. Unterwalden was divided\r\nas early as 1366. The division of Appenzell occurred in 1597; the\r\nCatholic magistrates having turned out some Protestant ministers,\r\nso serious a quarrel ensued between the two communions, that other\r\nCantons were called in as mediators; to restore peace they resorted to\r\na sort of political divorcement; the Canton was divided between the\r\ntwo parties, and a river marked the boundary; the Catholics passed\r\non one side and the Protestants on the other, selling or exchanging\r\nreciprocally their fields and houses. The separation in Basel took\r\nplace in February, 1832; the city of Basel maintained that the country\r\npeople should either accept the constitution which pronounced them\r\ndependent and inferior, or renounce all connection with her: in vain\r\nthe Diet protested against this division, but the city persisted in\r\nthe separation rather than put itself on a level with the peasants.\r\nOnly in one case, that of Basel, was the division accompanied by any\r\nviolence. There is not a great difference between the population of the\r\nhalves in the Cantons of Basel and Unterwalden; the urban half, of the\r\nformer, having an excess of 12,000, and Obwald, of the latter, 3000;\r\nbut the population of Ausser-Rhoden is four and a half times that of\r\nInner-Rhoden. There is a wide diversity in the area of these several\r\nhalf-Cantons, not easily accounted for, except in the case of Basel,\r\nwhere one-half is composed of the city of Basel. Each half-Canton\r\nkeeps its own share of sovereign power; each is practically complete\r\nin its state autonomy, the original cantonal integral having little\r\nrecognition beyond the representation in the Council of States. In\r\nthat body the members from these half-Cantons display, more or less,\r\nthe antagonism which originally led to the division of their Cantons;\r\nCatholic Appenzell is almost certain to oppose Protestant Appenzell; so\r\nwith all of the members from the fractional Cantons, they are arrayed\r\non different sides of all local questions, seriously impairing their\r\ninfluence. In extent, population, and wealth, the Cantons are about\r\nequal to a county; still, each is one of the twenty-two confederate\r\nstates. The official order of the Cantons corresponds with the\r\nhistorical date of their entry into the Confederation, except that\r\nZurich, Bern, and Luzern, after joining the league of small Cantons,\r\nwere placed at the head. Uri occupies the first place in chronological\r\norder, and anciently Luzern took the lead, but when Zurich entered\r\nthe Confederation, as an imperial city, in 1351, it displaced Luzern\r\nby virtue of its great wealth; and two years later Bern joined the\r\nleague, and was awarded the second place on account of its military\r\npower. The standards of the three original Cantons are very suggestive\r\nof their history. The one of Uri represents a bull’s head, with the\r\nbroken links of the yoke hanging around the neck; that of Schwyz a\r\ncross, the double symbol of suffering and deliverance; and the banner\r\nof Unterwalden bears two keys, symbolical of the keys of the apostle\r\nSt. Peter, and destined to open the iron gates of their long slavery.\r\nEmile de Laveleye, in his “Primitive Property,” gives the following\r\ntouching legend as to the method in which the boundary between the\r\n_Marks_ or Communes of Uri and Glarus was formerly fixed: “The two\r\nCantons are separated by frozen peaks and a lofty chain of mountains\r\neverywhere except at the Klaussen passage, through which one can easily\r\npass from the valley of the Linth to that of the Reuss. In times past,\r\nthere were disputes and struggles between the people of Uri and Glarus\r\nas to the debatable boundary of their pastures. To decide the question,\r\nthey agreed that, on St. George’s day, a runner should start at the\r\nfirst cock-crow from the bottom of each valley, and that the frontier\r\nshould be fixed at the point where they met. The start was to be\r\nsuperintended by inhabitants of Glarus at Altdorf, and by inhabitants\r\nof Uri at Glarus. The people of Glarus fed the cock, which was to give\r\nthe signal to their runner, as much as possible, hoping that, being in\r\nfull vigor, it would crow early in the morning. The people of Uri, on\r\nthe contrary, starved their cock; hunger kept it awake, and it gave\r\nthe signal for the start long before dawn. The runner started from\r\nAltdorf, entered the _Schaechenthal_, crossed the top, and began to\r\ndescend on the other side towards Linth. The Glarus cock crowed so\r\nlate that their runner met the one from Uri far down the slope on his\r\nside. Desperate at the thought of the disgrace which would be reflected\r\non his countrymen, he begged earnestly for a more equitable boundary.\r\n‘Hearken,’ answered the other, ‘I will grant you as much land as you\r\ncan cross, ascending the mountain with me on your back.’ The bargain\r\nwas struck. The Glarus man ascended as far as he could, when he fell\r\ndead from fatigue on the banks of the stream called _Scheidbaechli_\r\n(the boundary line). This is why Urner Boden, situated on the slope\r\nfacing Glarus, beyond the division of the water, belongs to Uri. It is\r\na curious legend in which, as so often in Swiss history, the citizen\r\ngives his life for the good of his country.”\r\n\r\nIndividual Cantons have a national character, either because all\r\ntheir inhabitants belong to one people, as in the German Cantons\r\nof northern and eastern Switzerland, or in the French Cantons of\r\nwestern Switzerland, or in Italian Ticino; or because one nationality\r\ndecidedly prevails, as the Germans in Bern and Graubünden, and the\r\nFrench in Freiburg and Valais. The result of holding different\r\npeoples together without transforming them into one nationality has\r\nbeen attained only by allowing each people free course in its local\r\nand inner life. The drift of Switzerland’s history and its political\r\ntrend are unquestionably towards a more compact nationality. The\r\nconstitution was a compromise between the advocates and opponents of\r\nnationalism. Every change from 1814 down to 1874 has taken something\r\nfrom the Canton and Commune and bestowed it on the Confederation.\r\nIn every stage of its historical growth it has been a fight of the\r\nConfederation against the Canton, on behalf of general rights; those\r\ninterests of the citizen which are claimed to lie beyond the proper\r\nsphere of local laws and customs. The national government has steadily\r\nextended its influence, every step increasing the authority of the\r\nnation at the expense of the cantonal independence; a steady growth\r\nin national feeling, a constant drift towards a stronger federal\r\ngovernment. Many branches of legislation have been taken away from\r\nthe Cantons, which under the constitution of the United States\r\nadhere to the States. The federal government has absorbed numerous\r\nmatters of social and economic importance, such as those relating\r\nto railways, telegraph, factories, insurance, debts, marriage, the\r\nlaw of contract, and general measures of sanitary precaution. “Swiss\r\ndemocratic federalism tends towards unitarianism. This is no doubt\r\nin part due to the desire to strengthen the nation against foreign\r\nattack. It is also due, perhaps, to another circumstance. Federalism,\r\nas it defines and therefore limits the power of each department of the\r\nadministration, is unfavorable for the interference or to the activity\r\nof government. Hence a federal government can hardly render service\r\nto the nation by undertaking for the national benefit functions which\r\nmay be performed by individuals.”[49] Wherever in the history of the\r\nworld we find a federation having an internal organization sufficiently\r\nstrong to maintain its own existence, we observe an inevitable drift of\r\npower from the several states to the central government, striving to\r\nascertain over how broad a field it is expedient and right to extend\r\nthe activities of government. Yet it is impossible to study attentively\r\nthe march of Swiss affairs without seeing that what really lie next to\r\nthe hearts of the people are their cantonal and local institutions;\r\nand while a well-assured nationality is kept up, in event of foreign\r\ndanger or common peril, nevertheless, the citizens look for protection\r\nas well as for command to their own cantonal authority. A familiar\r\ncolloquialism is often used, which illustrates the relation of the\r\ncantonal to the national feeling,--“My shirt is nearer to me than my\r\ncoat.”\r\n\r\nSwitzerland, though not extensive in point of superficial surface,\r\nembraces such an extraordinary variety of climate, soil, race, and\r\noccupation as to render the rule of a single central democratic\r\ngovernment, in an especial manner, vexatious. It must of necessity\r\nadhere to a system of Federal Union in preference to that of a\r\ncentral and universally diffused authority; because in small states,\r\nhaving each the power of internal legislation, the interests of the\r\ninhabitants are nearly the same, and their influence can be felt and\r\ntheir wants receive due consideration.\r\n\r\nThe Cantons have deep-rooted and peculiar local institutions, in\r\nmany cases of great vitality; laws handed down traditionally from\r\ngeneration to generation, often without having ever been committed to\r\npaper, much less to print. Until 1848 there was not one written and\r\naccepted cantonal constitution. A country where self-government has\r\nlongest subsisted, and political institutions been most the subject of\r\npopular discussion and decision, it is at the same time a country in\r\nwhich innovations are with the most difficulty introduced. You might\r\nalter the whole political frame of government in the French republic\r\nwith more facility than you could introduce the most insignificant\r\nchange into the customs and fashions of the Swiss democracy. They seem\r\nas immovable as the mountains in which they were cradled. The French\r\ndirectory, in the ardor of their innovations, proposed to the peasants\r\nof the Forest Cantons a change in their league, and made the offer\r\nof fraternization, which had seduced the allegiance of so many other\r\nstates, but these sturdy mountaineers replied, “Words cannot express,\r\ncitizen directors, the profound grief which the proposal to accede\r\nto the new Helvetic League has occasioned in these valleys. Other\r\npeople may have different inclinations, but we, the descendants of\r\nWilliam Tell, who have preserved, without the slightest alteration, the\r\nconstitutions which he has left us, have but one unanimous wish, that\r\nof living under the government which Providence and the courage of our\r\nancestors have left us.”\r\n\r\nThe Confederation, in striving to make the general organization more\r\nsystematic and uniform, must tenderly regard cantonal susceptibilities.\r\nThe Swiss federal organization is firmly founded on cantonal\r\nprecedents, traits, and features; and their self-assertive vitality and\r\ntheir direct influence make them the central subject of Swiss politics.\r\nThe federal constitution designates the members of the Confederation\r\nas “sovereign Cantons;” and each of the cantonal constitutions says\r\nin effect, “This, under federal supremacy, is a sovereign Canton,”\r\nand each declares that the sovereignty within the Cantons rests on\r\n“the people as a whole.” “Sovereign state” is conspicuous in the\r\nconstitution, federal and cantonal. It expresses national instincts,\r\nnational experiences, and political education. All the elevating\r\nmemories of national history, all the inspiring traditions which\r\nhad bred into national sentiment, generation after generation, were\r\nconnected with a league of states of almost insulated independence.\r\nEach Canton has always jealously clung to its own individuality and\r\nancient customs. Every now and then the republic would be split up into\r\nsmaller confederations for the purpose of maintaining the rights of\r\nstate sovereignty; by these sectional strifes, the idea of isolation\r\nand individuality was handed on, gaining strength as it went, and\r\nbecoming more and more a political instinct of the Swiss people.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland is a microcosm. In these five and twenty little states we\r\nhave a miniature resemblance of all the phases of social and political\r\nlife; every Canton contributes with friendly emulation to improve\r\nthe domestic policy and strengthen the political relations of the\r\nConfederation; if they present no example worthy to be followed as a\r\nwhole, there is still much in their detail that will most abundantly\r\nrepay our study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE LANDSGEMEINDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the republics of the ancient world, where representative assemblies\r\nwere unknown, legislative power vested with the citizens, the sovereign\r\npower being exercised by the whole people, acting directly in their\r\nown persons. They met in what we should now call primary assemblies.\r\nThis early democracy found its most logical expression in the _Comitia_\r\nof Rome and the _Ecclesia_ of Syracuse. The _Ecclesia_ embraced all\r\ncitizens over twenty-one years of age, unless they had become liable to\r\nany loss of civic rights; it met so frequently, often once a week, that\r\nit would be inconceivable, if we did not remember that ordinary and\r\nprofessional labor was carried on not by the free citizens, but by the\r\nnumerous slaves. The same plan prevailed in the early Teutonic tribes.\r\nTacitus describes such an assembly, almost in the words of Homer: “In\r\nmatters of inferior moment the chiefs decide; important questions are\r\nreserved for the whole community. When a public meeting is announced,\r\nthey never assemble at the stated time; regularity would look like\r\nobedience; to mark their independent spirit, they do not convene at\r\nonce, but two or three days are lost in delay. Each man takes his\r\nseat, completely armed. The king or chief of the community opens the\r\ndebate; the rest are heard in their turn, according to age, renown in\r\nwar, or fame for eloquence. No man dictates to the assembly; he may\r\npersuade, but cannot command. When anything is advanced not agreeable\r\nto the people, they reject it with a general murmur; if the proposition\r\npleases, they brandish their javelins; this is the highest and most\r\nhonorable mark of applause; they assent in a military manner, and\r\npraise by the sound of their arms.”\r\n\r\nMontesquieu is of the opinion that, in this treatise on the manners of\r\nthe Germans, by Tacitus, an attentive reader may trace the origin of\r\nthe British constitution; a system which he claims was found in the\r\nforests of Germany. The Saxon _Witenagemot_ was beyond all doubt an\r\nimproved political institution, grafted on the rights exercised by the\r\npeople in their own country. The author of the “European Settlements in\r\nAmerica” writes: “The Indians meet in a house, which they have in each\r\nof their towns for the purpose, on every solemn occasion, to receive\r\nambassadors, to deliver them an answer, to sing their traditionary war\r\nsongs, or to commemorate the dead. These councils are public. Here they\r\npropose all such matters as concern the state, which have already been\r\ndigested in the secret councils, at which none but the head men assist.”\r\n\r\nDuring the Middle Ages these assemblies died out, and the right of\r\nmaking laws passed either to the sovereign or to a representative\r\nbody; the older method surviving only in some of the Swiss Cantons.\r\nIn Uri, in the half-Cantons composing Unterwalden and Appenzell,\r\nand in Glarus, the law-making body is the Landsgemeinde, the free\r\nassembly of all the qualified voters, the _folk-moot_. The whole people\r\ncome together to pass laws, to nominate magistrates, to administer\r\naffairs, just as was formerly the case with the Germans of Tacitus\r\nand the Achaians of Homer; with less pretensions, however, than the\r\nassembly of a Greek city, for it is rather an agricultural democracy,\r\nsuch as Aristotle commended. It is the direct government dreamed of\r\nby Rousseau, who in his dislike of representative systems wrote the\r\n“Contrat Social,” demanding that the entire community should meet\r\nperiodically to exercise its sovereignty. Rousseau suggests that he\r\nwas led to the opinions advanced in this work, by the example of the\r\nancient tribal democracies; yet at a later date he declared that he\r\nhad the constitution of Geneva before his mind; and he cannot but have\r\nknown that the exact method of government which he proposed still lived\r\nin the oldest Cantons of Switzerland; where by the raising of hands\r\noffices and dignities were distributed, and sanction given to the laws;\r\nwhere feudalism and royalty had never penetrated, and where the most\r\nperfect liberty reigned, without class struggles or social strife. The\r\nassemblies in the Cantons named are called Landsgemeinden,--that is,\r\n“National Communes.” It is a strictly precise term, implying that the\r\nwhole country forms, so to say, a single Commune. This was the case\r\noriginally. Later, as different villages were formed, they constituted\r\nseparate autonomic Communes; but the great Commune of the Canton, with\r\nthe General Assembly of all the inhabitants, the Landsgemeinde, was\r\nmaintained. Under the Helvetic republic of 1798 the Landsgemeinde was\r\nabolished, in order to make way for the representative system. It was,\r\nhowever, re-established under Napoleon’s act of mediation, promulgated\r\nin 1803. The sagacity with which the First Consul discriminated the\r\nmost important features in the condition of the Swiss Cantons, may be\r\nappreciated by the following extract from the speech he delivered on\r\nthe formation of the internal constitution of the Confederacy: “The\r\nre-establishment of the ancient order of things in the democratic\r\nCantons,” said he, “is the best course which can be adopted, both\r\nfor you and me. They are the states whose peculiar form of government\r\nrenders them so interesting in the eyes of all Europe; but for this\r\npure democracy you would exhibit nothing which is not to be found\r\nelsewhere. Beware of extinguishing so remarkable a distinction. I\r\nknow well that this democratic system of administration has many\r\ninconveniences; but it is established, it has subsisted for centuries,\r\nit springs from the circumstances, situation, and primitive habits\r\nof the people, from the genius of the place, and cannot with safety\r\nbe abandoned. When usage and systematic opinion find themselves in\r\nopposition, the latter must give way. You must never take away from a\r\ndemocratic society the practical exercise of its privileges. To give\r\nsuch exercise a direction consistent with the tranquillity of the\r\nstate, is the part of true political wisdom.”\r\n\r\nThrough a strange and happy combination of circumstances this ancient\r\ncustom may still be seen in the Cantons of Uri, Unterwalden, Glarus,\r\nand Appenzell. The homely peasants who tend their own cows and goats\r\nupon the mountain-side, and by patient industry raise their little\r\ncrops from the narrow patches of soil, hemmed in by rock and glacier,\r\nmeet to discuss the affairs of their Canton, to make its laws, and to\r\nswear to observe them; a parliament of Swiss peasants, differing little\r\nin manner or habits from their forefathers of the thirteenth century.\r\nIt affords a rare study in politics; an example of pure democracy\r\nsuch as poets might imagine, and speculative philosophers design.\r\nIt was my privilege to have seen one of these primitive assemblies,\r\nheld on the hill-side market-place of Trogen, the seat of government\r\nof Appenzell-ausser-Rhoden. Trogen is in the rolling, grassy, breezy\r\nAppenzell Alps, the home of primitive virtue, the stronghold of Swiss\r\nsimplicity, honesty, and courage, and the region of light hearts and\r\nmerry tongues. It was the first Sunday in May, from which day the\r\nAppenzellers date all the events of the year. Leaving St. Gallen for\r\nTrogen, some seven or eight miles distant, in a carriage, about nine\r\no’clock in the morning of a bright and beautiful day, the main road\r\nand the many branches that entered it, as far as the eye could reach,\r\nwere full of peasants making their way on foot to Trogen; every man\r\ncarrying in one hand the family umbrella, and in the other an old sword\r\nor ancient rapier, which, on this occasion the law at once commands\r\nhim to carry and forbids him to draw, and which is brought out for\r\nthis day only from its dignified seclusion; each one wearing a short\r\ngreen coat, with a stiff high collar, and a silk hat, both bearing\r\nunmistakable evidence of being venerable heirlooms. The convening of\r\nthe Landsgemeinde was announced at twelve o’clock M. by heralds, as\r\na drum and fife corps, with a wonderful uniform of black and white,\r\nthe cantonal colors. There were estimated to be present six to seven\r\nthousand voters. No provision was made for seating them, and all stood\r\nduring the proceedings, which lasted nearly three hours. The assembly\r\nopened with a silent prayer, the Landammann setting the example, and\r\ninstantaneously the thousands of heads were uncovered and bowed, with\r\nan indistinct but audible wave of sound from the speechless lips; then\r\na national song in which all joined; the Landammann and his colleagues\r\nof the council mounted a rough platform erected in the centre of the\r\nfield, draped with black and white, and with two ancient-looking swords\r\ncrossed before it. Close attention was given to the Landammann while he\r\naddressed them as “Trusty, faithful, and well-beloved confederates.” He\r\nsubmitted a report of the administration of affairs for the past year,\r\nand proposed a few new laws and some amendments to the old laws. These\r\nwere five in number, only two of which were accepted, by the raising\r\nof hands, the vote being taken without discussion; though each man had\r\nfull right to speak his own mind as long as he pleased. The President,\r\non behalf of the council, took from a bag, not of silk, but of plain\r\nhomespun material, the seal of state and surrendered it into the hands\r\nof those by whom it had been given; and in delivering up this official\r\ncharge he concluded with the statement, that he had not voluntarily\r\ninjured any one, and asked the pardon of any citizen who might think\r\nhimself aggrieved. The President and the members of the council then\r\nretired and took their places as simple citizens in the ranks of their\r\nfellows, leaving the Canton for the time being, without any executive\r\nofficial, an absolute interregnum. In a few moments some one in the\r\ncrowd placed in nomination for re-election the retiring President, and\r\nhe was unanimously chosen; the same process was repeated as to all the\r\nother members of the council; they then returned to the platform and\r\nresumed possession of the seal of state. Some subordinate officials\r\nwere chosen in a similar manner, all without opposition except in the\r\ncase of the _grossweibel_, for which place, owing to some charges of\r\nintemperance against the incumbent, there had arisen quite a contest,\r\nresulting in a half-dozen names being placed in nomination, each one\r\nof whom submitted his claims in a few remarks. The vote was taken for\r\nthe several candidates, in turn, by uplifted hands, and the executive\r\ncouncil found it impossible to decide who had received the most\r\nvotes, until five trials were had, when the old official was declared\r\nre-elected. Neither the voting nor the result of this unusual contest\r\nwas accompanied with the slightest manifestation of feeling. The entire\r\nproceeding was marked by an earnest, serious, reverent decorum, as\r\ncould be found in any church service. When the newly-chosen Landammann\r\nenters upon his office, he first binds himself by an oath to obey the\r\nlaw, and then administers to the multitude before him the same oath.\r\nThere was a heart-stirring solemnity in hearing the voice of these\r\nthousands of freemen, beneath the canopy of heaven, in firm, clear\r\naccent, pledging themselves to obey the laws which they themselves had\r\nmade. The Landammann’s oath was: “To promote the welfare and honor\r\nof his fatherland, and to preserve it from injury; to enforce the\r\nconstitution and laws of his country, to protect, defend, and assist\r\nwidows and orphans, as well as all other persons, to the best of his\r\npower, and as the law and his conscience teach him; and that neither\r\nthrough friendship, enmity, nor bribe, nor for any other reason will he\r\nbe moved to deviate therefrom. Likewise that he will accept no gifts\r\nfrom any prince or lord, except for the public purse.” The people\r\nswear: “To promote the welfare and honor of their fatherland, and to\r\npreserve it from injury, to protect its rights and liberties to the\r\nbest of their power, to obey the laws of the magistrates as well as to\r\ndefend the council and court, likewise to accept presents, bribes or\r\ngifts from no prince or lord, except for the public purse; and that\r\nevery one to whatever position elected shall accept it, and do as well\r\nas he is able and has the power to do.” The foregoing oath, after being\r\nread to the multitude, was sworn to in a loud, distinct voice in the\r\nfollowing form: “We have well understood what has been read to us. We\r\nwill keep it truly and steadfastly, faithfully, and without fear, so\r\ntruly as we wish and pray that God may help us.” The laws adopted by\r\nthe Landsgemeinde of Appenzell in reference to these official oaths are\r\nvery peculiar. They bear date 1634, and read: “Because an oath is a\r\nthing through which good law and order must be maintained, so for that\r\nreason it is highly necessary to consider it, in itself, seriously and\r\nwell, humbly praying to God, the heavenly Father, that through his Holy\r\nSpirit he may enlighten our hearts, so that we may know what a true\r\nand false oath is, and may in time with the chosen ones live up to it\r\neternally: Amen! A genuine oath is a considerate and solemn invocation\r\nand declaration to the true God, as the proper guardian of my heart,\r\nto be witness and judge of my sworn declaration or promise, to bless\r\nmy body and soul if I swear in truth and sincerity, and if, on the\r\ncontrary, I swear falsely, to punish my body and soul. At the same\r\ntime every Christian who swears an oath shall lift up three fingers,\r\nby which will be signified the supreme power of God the Father, God\r\nthe Son, and God the Holy Ghost; but the two last fingers shall remain\r\nbent back against the hand, and thereby will be represented the entire\r\nsubmission of soul and body to the supreme power of God. Now the man\r\nwho is so forsaken and so hostile to himself as to reject in his heart\r\nwhat he professes in such a way with his mouth, in the face of the\r\nall-seeing God, swears a false oath. He swears, as if he said, I will\r\nrather be shut out from the community and benefaction of Christendom;\r\nor as if he said, the name of God and of our Saviour Jesus Christ shall\r\nnever prove a help and comfort to me at the time when soul and body\r\nshall be separated; or as if he said, the grace of God, the redemption\r\nof Jesus Christ, and the strength of the Holy Ghost shall be entirely\r\nlost and thrown away on me, poor sinner. Finally, whoever swears\r\nfalsely speaks as if he said, as I swear false to-day, so do I make\r\nmyself guilty of this judgment, that my soul, which is indicated by the\r\nfourth finger, and my body, which is indicated by the fifth finger,\r\nshall be separated from every claim of the All Holy, and be deprived\r\neternally and forever of the refreshing sight of our Lord Jesus Christ.\r\nHereby can every Christian perceive and understand what is the meaning\r\nand effect of a false oath, and take heed against it, for the salvation\r\nof the soul. God guard us all eternally and forever from sorrow and\r\ngrief: Amen!”\r\n\r\nThe Landsgemeinde at Uri is attended with much more display and\r\nelaborate ceremonial than that of Appenzell, and a description of it\r\nis here taken from Mr. Freeman’s essay on the “Growth of the English\r\nConstitution:”\r\n\r\n“It is one of the opening days of May; it is the morning of Sunday;\r\nfor men there deem that the better the day the better the deed; they\r\ndeem that the Creator cannot be more truly honored than in using, in\r\nhis sphere and in his presence, the highest of the gifts which he has\r\nbestowed on man. From the market-place of Altdorf, the little capital\r\nof the Canton, the procession makes its way to the place of meeting at\r\nBözlingen. First marches the little army of the Canton, an army whose\r\nweapons never can be used save to drive back an invader from their\r\nlands. Over their heads floats the banner, the bull’s head of Uri, the\r\nensign which led men to victory on the fields of Sempach and Morgarten.\r\nAnd before them all, on the shoulders of men clad in a garb of ages\r\npast, are borne the famous horns[50] whose blast struck such dread into\r\nthe fearless heart of Charles of Burgundy. Then, with their lictors\r\nbefore them, come the magistrates of the commonwealth on horseback,\r\nthe chief magistrate, the Landammann, with his sword by his side. The\r\npeople follow the chiefs whom they have chosen to the place of meeting,\r\na circle in a green meadow, with a pine forest rising above their head,\r\nand a mighty spur of the mountain-range facing them on the other side\r\nof the valley. The multitude of freemen take their seats around the\r\nchief ruler of the commonwealth, whose term of office comes that day\r\nto an end. The assembly opens; a short space is first given to prayer,\r\nsilent prayer, offered up by each man in the temple of God’s own\r\nrearing. Then comes the business of the day. Thus year by year, on some\r\nbright morning of the springtide, the sovereign people, not intrusting\r\nits rights to a few of its own number, but discharging them itself in\r\nthe majesty of its corporate person, meets in the open market-place\r\nor in the green meadow at the mountain’s foot, to frame the laws to\r\nwhich it yields obedience as its own work, to choose rulers whom it can\r\nafford to greet with reverence as drawing their commission from itself.\r\nYou may there gaze and feel what none can feel but those who have seen\r\nwith their own eyes, what none can feel in its fulness more than once\r\nin a lifetime, the thrill of looking for the first time face to face on\r\nfreedom in its purest and most ancient form.”\r\n\r\nThe Landsgemeinde exercises two equally important functions. First, it\r\nelects the principal officers of the Canton, the Landammann and his\r\nsubstitute, the treasurer, and the chief of the cantonal militia; it\r\nalso appoints the deputies for the Federal Assembly. These cantonal\r\nfunctionaries are paid but nominally; their duties are light, and the\r\nsmall claim which they make on the individual causes them to appear\r\na universal duty of the citizen. It belongs to the Landsgemeinde to\r\nsanction all cantonal laws, and all treaties which are concluded with\r\nother Cantons or with foreign states. With the exception of Glarus,\r\nthe legislative power is exercised in this sense, that it accepts or\r\nrejects as a whole the propositions which are made to it, without the\r\npower to introduce changes in them. In Glarus the constitution invests\r\nthe Landsgemeinde with power to modify or reject the propositions\r\nwhich are made to it, or refer them to the triple council finally,\r\neither to report on them or to decide. The constitution of Glarus also\r\ncontains this provision: “The people are responsible only to God and\r\ntheir consciences for the exercise of their sovereignty in the May\r\nAssembly. What must guide the May Assembly is not, however, caprice\r\nwithout limit and without condition; it is justice and the good of\r\nthe state which are alone compatible with it. The people are obliged\r\nto vote according to these principles in taking annually the oath of\r\nthe May Assembly.” In all of the Cantons, having these assemblies,\r\nthe proposition to be submitted must be made public a certain time in\r\nadvance. The administrative power is ordinarily confided to quite a\r\nnumerous council, called Rath or Landrath. The functions of this body\r\nare extensive. It watches over the enforcement of the constitution,\r\nfederal and cantonal; regulates in their general organization public\r\ninstruction, financial, military, and sanitary administration, public\r\nworks, charity, except the legal provisions regarding the province\r\nand obligations of inferior authorities; receives the reports of the\r\nadministration of all the functionaries of the Canton; deliberates\r\nupon the proposed laws to be presented to the Landsgemeinde, through\r\nthe intermediary of the triple council; and watches over the execution\r\nof what the laws or decrees of the Landsgemeinde prescribe to it. In\r\nNidwald the council has, besides, judicial function. In Glarus, Uri,\r\nand Obwald there have been organized, side by side with the Landrath,\r\nspecial authorities to which have been transferred all the judicial\r\nfunctions formerly granted to the Landrath. About the Landrath are\r\ngrouped various bodies, evidently formed from it by addition or\r\nreduction. The double and the triple or Great Council are nothing but\r\nthe council of the Landrath itself, doubled or tripled by the addition\r\nof new members, whom the territorial divisions appoint in the same\r\nmanner and in the same proportion as the first. In Glarus, for example,\r\neach local assembly (_tagwen_) adds two members to the one which it\r\nappoints to form a simple council. Thus the triple council is composed\r\nthere of one hundred and seventeen members, as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) Of the nine members of the Commission of State.\r\n\r\n(2) Of thirty-five members appointed by the _tagwen_ following fixed\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\n(3) Of seventy members appointed by the same assemblies, following the\r\nsame proportions.\r\n\r\n(4) Finally, of three Catholic members, appointed by the same council,\r\nand of which one forms a part.[51]\r\n\r\nThe principal functions of the triple council are to watch over the\r\ncouncil and the tribunal, to establish the project of the budget\r\nof receipts and expenditures, and to convoke the Landsgemeinde in\r\nextraordinary assembly. The process of addition is applied in many\r\nways in Appenzell-interior; it is applied in particular to the little\r\ncouncil, which is charged with the principal judicial powers. This\r\nbody judges sometimes as a weekly council; it is then only a section\r\nof the little council; sometimes with a simple addition, again with\r\nthe reinforced addition. Finally, with a last reinforcement, it forms\r\nwhat is called the council of blood (_Blutrath_). As there are councils\r\nformed by addition, so there are others formed by reduction, as,\r\nfor example, the weekly council of Unterwald-lower. It is appointed\r\nby the Great Council (Landrath) and chosen from its body. It is the\r\nexecutive, administrative, and police authority, subordinated to the\r\nGreat Council. It is composed of the Landammann, as President, and\r\nof twelve members appointed for two years. It assembles in ordinary\r\nsession on Monday of each week, and in extraordinary session, when\r\nconvoked by the President, and as often as there is need. The third\r\nand remaining authority in this pure democracy is the Commission of\r\nState. It is appointed by the Landsgemeinde, and replaces the council,\r\nfor affairs of lesser importance. In Glarus this commission is divided\r\ninto two sections, to expedite business. The first is composed of\r\nall the members of the commission; and the second, of three members,\r\nthe President included, alternating among themselves after a manner\r\nof rotation, established by the commission. The first section (or\r\nthe commission _in pleno_) is charged with the correspondence of\r\nforeign states, the federal authority, and the Confederate states;\r\nwith giving preliminary advice upon questions referred to it, or even\r\nwith deciding them by the council. The second section is charged\r\nwith the ratification of deeds of sale and of wills, with decisions\r\nupon the prolongation of the terms for the liquidation of bankrupt\r\nestates, etc. The Commission of State of Appenzell-exterior has also\r\nthe surveillance of the administration of the Communes. The Landammann\r\npresides over the Landsgemeinde, the double or triple council, the\r\ncouncil or Landrath, and the Commission of State. He receives all the\r\ndespatches addressed to the authorities presided over by him, and he\r\nis bound to make them known at the next session. He keeps the seal of\r\nstate, signs and seals concordats and conventions. He watches over the\r\nexecution of the decrees of the Landsgemeinde, the Councils, and the\r\nCommission of State, in so far as the execution is not intrusted to a\r\nspecial authority. The re-election of the Landammann is universal; and\r\nthe office, though always filled by an annual selection, becomes almost\r\nhereditary in a single family.\r\n\r\nCustoms still exercise a considerable empire in these Cantons, and\r\nthe Landsgemeinde makes but few laws; there is none of the confusion\r\nand uncertainty that come from a multiplicity of laws; a source to\r\nwhich was imputed a great part of the miseries suffered by the Romans\r\nat the time when “the laws grew to be innumerable in the worst and\r\nmost corrupt state of things.”[52] The people of these Cantons fill\r\nthe idea of Bacon, as to innovation, “to follow the example of time\r\nitself, which indeed innovateth greatly, but quietly and by degrees\r\nscarce to be perceived.” Changes in established institutions must be\r\nconsidered in reference to existing interests, habits, manners, and\r\nmodes of thinking. In vain should we try to promote the common weal\r\nby introducing alterations, however well designed, which have no\r\nhold on the feelings of the people, or are at variance with them, or\r\nwhich shock their deeply-seated prejudices. There are two different\r\nconsiderations involved: the propriety of retaining institutions merely\r\nbecause they have been sanctioned by our ancestors, or transmitted\r\nto us through a series of ages; and the propriety of retaining them\r\nbecause they are strongly settled in the actual habits, tastes, and\r\nprejudices of the people. While it would argue extreme imbecility,\r\nto spare cumbrous or hurtful institutions on no better ground than\r\nthe former, it is absolutely indispensable to pay a cautious regard\r\nto the latter. The existing habits, tastes, and prejudices of the\r\ncommunity, equally with the universal properties of human nature,\r\nare material elements of the politician’s calculations. They are all\r\nsources of pleasure and pain, all springs of action which call, on\r\nhis part, for tender handling and accurate appreciation. There is\r\nscarcely a question in the whole compass of politics on which there\r\nis a greater unanimity among philosophers and statesmen than there\r\nis on the policy of cautious and gradual, in opposition to rash and\r\nsudden, reforms on the one hand, and to a pertinacious retention of\r\nincongruities and abuses on the other. As to the improvements which\r\nare to be introduced into a political system, their quantity and\r\ntheir period must be determined by the degree of knowledge existing\r\nin any country, and the state of preparation of the public mind for\r\nthe changes that are to be desired. A passage in the correspondence of\r\nMr. Jefferson contains a highly instructive exposition of his opinion\r\non this subject, expressed in his happiest manner: “I am certainly,”\r\nsays he, “not an advocate for frequent and untried changes in laws and\r\nconstitutions. I think moderate imperfections had better be borne,\r\nbecause, when once known, we accommodate ourselves to them, and find\r\npractical means of correcting their ill effects. But I know also that\r\nlaws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the\r\nhuman mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened; as new\r\ndiscoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions\r\nchanged with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance\r\nalso, and keep pace with the times.” It is well to stand fast in the\r\nold paths; but the old paths should be the paths of progress; to\r\nshrink from mere change for the sake of change; but fearlessly to\r\nchange, whenever change is really needed. All mountain races love the\r\npast, and suspect new things. Their fundamental laws are few and slowly\r\nformed; as slowly formed as they are stoutly held. The constitutions\r\nof the Swiss Cantons were originally of the simplest forms of ancient\r\ndemocracy. The old democracy, whether absolute or modified in form,\r\nwas always direct; modern democracy is, as a rule, representative. It\r\nis obvious that the former presupposes great simplicity of life and\r\noccupation, as in the small communities of mountain valleys; nothing\r\ncould render it consistent with the public peace, but the simple\r\nhabits of a people of shepherds and husbandmen among whom political\r\ndissensions do not prevail. This substitution of the many for the one\r\nor the few, of the totality of the community for a determinate portion\r\nof it, is an experiment perhaps of insuperable difficulty, except for\r\nvery small states, and especially for agricultural or pastoral peoples.\r\nThe Landsgemeinde is only able, at most, to announce the general\r\nopinion, to express its approval or its disapproval of a proposition\r\nalready known; but altogether incapable of deliberating seriously\r\non a projected law, or of solving the more complicated problems of\r\npolitics. On a wider field and with a more complex society, no such\r\npolity would be possible. To a great nation with extended territories\r\nand large population, the application of the federal principle is\r\nnecessary. Therefore in all but four Cantons of Switzerland this\r\nprimitive type of government has passed away. That it contains the\r\ngerms out of which every free constitution in the world has grown\r\ncannot be denied. A cognate influence, if well considered, will go far\r\ntowards accounting for that prodigious resolution and success with\r\nwhich the ancient commonwealths maintained their national rights. The\r\nwhole territories of the Athenian, Spartan, and Roman republics,\r\nwere originally but a single province; and the whole strength of the\r\nprovince was concentrated in a single city, the embryo of their future\r\ngreatness, the nucleus around which all their subsequent acquisitions\r\nwere formed. Within the sacred walls of Rome and Athens, all classes\r\nof citizens assembled like one great united family; they lived, they\r\nconsulted, they transacted business together, and together repaired\r\nfor public debate or religious devotion, for manly amusement, or\r\nphilosophical speculation, to the forum or the temple, the circus or\r\nthe portico. Virtuous emulation was roused, the force of public opinion\r\nincreased, and the importance of the individual in the general scale\r\nvisibly exalted. The Landsgemeinde is self-government in its noblest\r\nreach and simplest form, where every man is legislator, judge, and\r\nexecutive. What rare simplicity! No wrangling after power, no intrigue\r\nafter place, no lust for fame; one thought alone, to live just as their\r\nfathers did, in perfect liberty, and fearing none but God. These simple\r\ndemocracies in the Cantons of Switzerland, which have existed for a\r\nthousand years, little touched by the stream of European life, deserve\r\nour respect for their long history that is rich in many episodes, and\r\nfor the peaceful and happy existence of their people. They furnish\r\nus with a bit of realistic political education, a successful working\r\nexample of the purest democracy in the world. It throbs with a vital\r\nsense of government at first hands; every citizen a very live political\r\nentity, and the sense of government very individual. Obstinately\r\nconservative, with a profound disbelief in theory, they remind one\r\nof the ox, which walks straightforward with a slow, heavy, and firm\r\ntread. They take no stock in the fallacy, that a new system, political\r\nor social, can be ordered like a new suit of clothes, and would as\r\nsoon think of ordering a new suit of flesh and skin. With sincere\r\nsatisfaction and pride, they are given to exclaim, “Thanks to our\r\nsublime resistance to innovations; thanks to the cold sluggishness of\r\nour national character, we still bear the stamp of our forefathers:”\r\n\r\n  “So have old customs there, from sire to son,\r\n  Been handed down unchanging and unchanged;\r\n  Nor will they brook to swerve or turn aside\r\n  From the fixed, even tenor of their life.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE REFERENDUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe student of politics may always look with advantage to Switzerland\r\nfor the latest forms and results of democratic experiments. Federal\r\nlaws, decrees, and resolutions require the concurrence of both branches\r\nof the Federal Assembly; but the process does not always end at that\r\npoint. Such concurrence is not adequate in all cases for them to come\r\ninto force. Article 89 of the constitution declares that “federal laws\r\nare submitted to the people for adoption or rejection on the demand of\r\n30,000 active citizens, or eight Cantons; the same is the case with\r\nfederal decrees of a general bearing, and not of an urgent character.”\r\n\r\nThis is known as the Referendum, and is supposed to be derived from\r\nthe practice of the old Swiss Confederation, when the delegates of the\r\nthirteen independent states of which it was composed had to _refer_\r\nto their governments for confirmation the decisions of the Federal\r\nDiet. It is one of the most characteristic of Swiss institutions,\r\nand is by far the most original creation of Swiss democracy. “The\r\nReferendum looks at first sight like a French _plébiscite_, but no\r\ntwo institutions can be marked by more essential differences. The\r\n_plébiscite_ is a revolutionary or at least abnormal proceeding.\r\nIt is not preceded by debate. The form and nature of the question\r\nto be submitted to the nation are chosen and settled by the men in\r\npower, and Frenchmen are asked whether they will or will not accept a\r\ngiven policy. Rarely, indeed, when it has been taken, has the voting\r\nitself been either free or fair. Deliberation and discussion are the\r\nrequisite conditions for rational decision. Where effective opposition\r\nis an impossibility, nominal assent is an unmeaning compliment.\r\nThese essential characteristics, the lack of which deprives a French\r\n_plébiscite_ of all moral significance, are the undoubted properties\r\nof the Swiss Referendum. It is a real appeal to the true judgment of\r\nthe nation, and the appeal is free from the coercion, the unreality,\r\nand the fraud which taint or vitiate a _plébiscite_. The Referendum, in\r\nshort, is a regular, normal, peaceful proceeding, unconnected with any\r\nrevolution, any violence, or despotic coercion.”[53]\r\n\r\nThe Referendum is a kind of substitute for the veto; it gives no power\r\nto modify, no power to substitute; it is a pure negative. It does not\r\nenable the electors to pass laws at their own will; it is a mere veto\r\non such legislation as does not approve itself to the electorate. It\r\nis a veto lodged in the hands of a sovereign people. A question is\r\nsimplified as much as possible, and every citizen has the fullest\r\nopportunity, from the public platform, or in the columns of the press,\r\nor in private conversation, to advocate or deprecate its adoption;\r\nand the entire enfranchised portion of the community is asked to say\r\n“Aye” or “No,” as to whether the law shall become operative. It is a\r\nreference to the people’s judgment of a distinct, definite, clearly\r\nstated law. Under the Constitution of 1848, only such measures passed\r\nby the Assembly as clearly involved constitutional changes were subject\r\nto the Referendum. The jealousy of the Cantons, lest their own\r\ncivil and religious privileges should be invaded, and their fear of\r\ninfluences, in the central government, adverse to their own sovereign\r\nrights, demanded an unrestricted reference to the popular vote. This\r\nwas conceded in the revision of 1874, when the Referendum was extended\r\nto all federal laws and federal decrees, “of a general nature and not\r\nof an urgent character.” The matter now stands thus: no change can be\r\nintroduced into the constitution which is not sanctioned by the vote\r\nof the Swiss people. The Federal Assembly, indeed, may of its own\r\nauthority pass laws which take effect without any popular vote; but\r\nit is practically true that no enactment, important enough to excite\r\neffective opposition, can ever become a law until it has received the\r\ndeliberately expressed sanction of the people. The words “decrees of\r\na general nature and not of an urgent character” have never received\r\neven a quasi-judicial construction, either from the Federal Council or\r\nfrom the Federal Assembly, the two organs supervising its execution.\r\nThere doubtless has been conflicting and arbitrary action taken under\r\nit. The weight of opinion, as inferred from the line of precedence,\r\nappears to be that resolutions are of a general nature, when they fix\r\npermanent and obligatory rules, either for the citizens or the Cantons,\r\nbut not when they apply only to special cases. The whole detail of the\r\nexercise of the Referendum is placed by the constitution, under the\r\nregulation of the Assembly, and in June, 1874, soon after the adoption\r\nof the constitution, a federal law was passed for carrying it out. All\r\nlaws and resolutions, on which the popular vote may be demanded, are\r\nto be published immediately after their passage, and copies sent to\r\nthe governments of the several Cantons. Through the Cantons they are\r\nbrought to the attention of the Communes. The official publication\r\nexpressly calls attention to the “date of opposition,” or when the\r\nperiod for Referendum expires. This period is ninety days, running\r\nfrom the date of the publication of the law. The demand for a popular\r\nvote must be made by written petition, addressed to the Federal\r\nCouncil, all signatures must be autographic, and the chief officer of\r\nthe Commune must attest the right of each signer to vote. If, at the\r\nexpiration of the ninety days, the demand is found to have been made by\r\n30,000 voters, the Federal Council fixes a date for taking the popular\r\nvote; this date must be at least four weeks from the date of the notice\r\ngiven by the Federal Council. The vote is “Yes” or “No,” and a simple\r\nmajority of those voting is decisive. Unless, however, the demand\r\nfor such a reference is made within the ninety days, the people are\r\npresumed to have given a tacit assent, and the bill becomes a law, and\r\nits execution ordered by the Federal Council.\r\n\r\nUnder this peculiar institution, a condition exists, in which the\r\nsovereignty of the people is no longer a speculative doctrine, but a\r\nliving reality; it makes a very direct and thorough democracy, and its\r\napplication has proven neither ineffective nor unduly obstructive.\r\nSince the adoption of the Referendum, in 1874, there have been vetoed,\r\namong other laws passed by the Assembly, the following: “Modification\r\nof the right of voting,” “Bank-notes law,” “Indemnities payable to the\r\nConfederation by citizens dispensed from military service,” “Political\r\nrights,” “A law respecting certain epidemics,” “Appointment of a\r\nfederal secretary of education,” “Creation of a special secretary in\r\nthe federal department of justice and police,” “Granting an annual\r\nsalary of 10,000 francs for a secretary to the Swiss legation at\r\nWashington,” “Exempting native commercial travellers from taxation\r\nwhich those of other countries had not to pay,” “Power to Federal\r\nCouncil to remove criminal cases from a cantonal to the Federal\r\nTribunal, when there is reason to suspect the fairness of the former.”\r\nThe only important laws sanctioned under the Referendum, during the\r\nsame period, are the “Marriage law,” “Factories law,” “Subsidies to\r\nAlpine Railways,” and a general “Banking law.” Also three modifications\r\nof the federal constitution respecting “Patent law,” “Capital\r\npunishment,” and “Spirituous liquor monopoly.”\r\n\r\nAt the time of the introduction of the general Referendum, one of\r\nSwitzerland’s ablest public men declared that it would be “the greatest\r\ntrial to which a republic was ever subjected.” It was apprehended by\r\nsome that it would invite, on the part of the populace, interference\r\nwith a prudent and independent direction of affairs. Others held it to\r\nbe scarcely consistent with the true theory of representation; that it\r\nis of the very essence of representation that the representative body\r\nshould stand in the place of the people, possessing their confidence,\r\nexercising their plenary powers, speaking with their voice and acting\r\nwith their full consent; otherwise the legislative function is wanting,\r\nand it becomes a mere deliberative council. There is, however, nothing\r\nto show that the Swiss Assembly from this cause lacks weight or\r\nrespectability; it compares favorably enough with the law-making body\r\nin any country. It is the primary doctrine of the Swiss Confederation,\r\nthat the sovereignty of the people must be absolute, whether exercised\r\npersonally, as in some of the rural Cantons, or through their\r\nrepresentatives and the Referendum. This doctrine has been maintained\r\nin Swiss institutions from the earliest time until the present day. So\r\nelaborate a scheme for the passing of federal laws cannot be without\r\ninconvenience; but it is a fundamental principle of the nation, and at\r\nonce satisfies the democratic traditions of the people and the natural\r\njealousies of the several Cantons. It is a true check and safeguard in\r\nmaking the legislative power directly responsible to public opinion,\r\nand in giving the nation an easy and simple opportunity of marking\r\nthat opinion; of testifying their disavowal and rejection. If it, as\r\nalleged, produces a diminution of the feeling of responsibility in\r\nthe representative, that possible disadvantage is outweighed by the\r\neducative effect which it exercises on the great bulk of the citizens.\r\nIt tends to give them a keener interest in political questions. Through\r\nit the citizen becomes conscious of his individual influence, and\r\nthat his vote contributes appreciably both to the maintenance and\r\ndirection of the laws under which he lives, and he is impressed with\r\nthe necessity of a careful discharge of his political rights.\r\n\r\nTo the confusion and dismay of the strongest advocates of the\r\nReferendum, the measures which they most prized, when so put, have\r\nbeen negatived. Contrary to all expectations, laws of the highest\r\nimportance, some of them openly framed for popularity, have been vetoed\r\nby the people after they have been adopted by the federal and cantonal\r\nlegislatures. This result is sufficiently intelligible. It is possible,\r\nby agitation and exhortation, to produce in the mind of the average\r\ncitizen a vague impression that he desires a particular change, but\r\nwhen the agitation has settled down, when the subject has been threshed\r\nout, when the law is before him with all its detail, he is sure to find\r\nin it something that is likely to disturb his habits, his ideas, his\r\nprejudice, or his interest, and so he votes, “No.” Thus it serves as a\r\nguarantee against precipitate legislation in matters of vital concern\r\nto the community; and is considered thoroughly successful by those who\r\nwish that there should be as little legislation as possible. In short,\r\nthe Swiss experience with this popular veto on legislation is evidence\r\nthat, under certain circumstances, it produces good effects. It does\r\nnot hurry on a law, nor facilitate any legislation; it merely forms\r\nan additional safeguard against the hastiness or violence of party;\r\nit is a check on popular impatience. It secures the laws against any\r\nchange which the sovereign people do not deliberately approve. The\r\nobject of such safeguard is not to thwart the wishes of the democracy,\r\nbut to insure that a temporary or factitious majority shall not\r\noverride the will of the people. It tends to produce permanence in the\r\ntenure of office; it is a distinct recognition of the elementary but\r\nimportant principle, that in matters of legislation patriotic citizens\r\nought to distinguish between measures and men; and this distinction\r\nSwiss voters have shown themselves fully capable of drawing. It is an\r\ninstitution which admirably fits a system of popular government. It is\r\nthe only check on the predominance of party which is at the same time\r\ndemocratic and conservative, as it has demonstrated. It is democratic,\r\nfor it appeals to and protects the sovereignty of the people; it is\r\nconservative, for it balances the weight of the nation’s common sense\r\nagainst the violence of partisanship and the fanaticism of over-zealous\r\nreformers.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Referendum in Switzerland confirms the fact that,\r\nas a rule, the people are not favorable to legislation; and that\r\nthe necessity must be very great and the good ends aimed at very\r\nmanifest, to withstand a direct consultation of the constituencies.\r\nThe ancient republics hardly legislated at all. Their democratic\r\nenergy was expended upon war, diplomacy, and justice; putting nearly\r\ninsuperable obstacles in the way of a change of law. From fundamental\r\nand permanent causes springs this legislative infertility in republics.\r\nChanges are at once conservative and progressive; conservative because\r\nprogressive, progressive because conservative. The Referendum reserves\r\nto the people, as the old Swiss expression ran, _höchste und grösste\r\nGewalt_, the highest and greatest power. The foremost statesman in\r\nSwitzerland, a member at present of the Federal Council,[54] calls it\r\n_l’essai le plus grandiose qu’une République ait jamais tenté_, the\r\ngrandest attempt ever made by a republic. The constitutional provision\r\nthat when a certain number of voters demand a particular measure, or\r\nrequire a further sanction for a particular enactment, it shall be put\r\nto the vote of the whole country, certainly presents a considerable\r\nfuture before democratically governed societies. Peradventure the\r\nUnited States may realize the prophecy made by Mr. Labouchère in the\r\nHouse of Commons, in 1882, that the people, tired of the deluge of\r\ndebate, would some day substitute for it the direct consultation of the\r\nconstituencies.\r\n\r\nThe Referendum is practically in use in the United States for\r\nconstitutional amendments, but so far American publicists seem to\r\nregard it quite out of place for ordinary laws, and allege that its\r\nintroduction would obscure the distinction on which the whole American\r\nsystem rests. For this reason the growing tendency of the people, in\r\nthe several States, to take a direct part in legislation, even by\r\nmeans of constitutional amendments, is regarded by the same school of\r\nthinkers as a danger, which, if it goes too far, will be a serious\r\ninjury to the American theory of government.\r\n\r\nThe principle behind the Referendum is as old as the Swiss nation, the\r\nword coming from the usages of the old Federal Diets, in which the\r\ndelegates did not decide matters themselves, but voted _ad referendum_,\r\nand submitted their actions to the home governments. The power to veto\r\nan ordinary law made by representatives was established for the first\r\ntime in modern days, in 1831, in the Canton of St. Gallen. It was a\r\ncompromise between the party which wanted to establish pure democracy,\r\nand the party of representative government. It is, however, only the\r\nsame old Swiss voter of centuries ago, telling his member of the Diet\r\nto conclude nothing important without his consent. The demand of\r\n50,000 electors to amend the constitution, or to repeal or to modify\r\nan existing law, is called a “popular initiative,” and, when made,\r\nthe Federal Assembly must submit the question to a vote of the people\r\nand the Canton. In every cantonal constitution, except Freiburg, the\r\nright of the people to have all important legislation subjected in\r\nsome form to popular confirmation or rejection is recognized. While\r\ngeneral assemblies of the people in the Cantons to make the laws fell\r\ninto desuetude, popular franchise and complete freedom of election\r\nwere not enough to satisfy the democratic sensibilities of the Swiss.\r\nThey were still jealous of the plenary powers of their delegates,\r\nand insisted that their deliberations when formulated into laws,\r\nshould be referred to the sovereign people. Previous to the French\r\nrevolution, the governments of the different Cantons had largely fallen\r\ninto the hands of a limited number of aristocratic families. The\r\nlaboring classes were crushed under enormous burdens by the nobility\r\nin the rural districts, and by the rich _bourgeoisie_ in the cities.\r\nArtificial barriers were placed about the freedom of commerce and labor\r\nin the interest of these more powerful classes. The period of reaction\r\nfollowing the Napoleonic era was unfavorable to the development of\r\npopular institutions. Since the cantonal revolutions of 1830 there has\r\nbeen a general return to the principle known as the Referendum; and\r\nafter the federal Constitution of 1848, by which the constitution of a\r\nCanton could only be revised on the demand of an absolute majority of\r\nthe citizens, the policy of extending the principles of the Referendum\r\nto its fullest limits rapidly grew in favor. There are two forms of\r\nReferendum existing in the Cantons, _compulsory_ and _optional_; the\r\none requiring the reference of every law passed by the Great Council\r\nbefore it acquires validity; and in the other, a discretionary power of\r\nreference is reserved to the people. The first is regarded as the more\r\npractical and satisfactory; the chief objection to the latter being the\r\nagitation occasioned in procuring the necessary signatures, producing\r\nexcitement, diverting the thoughts of voters from the real question at\r\nissue, and thus giving an undue bias to public opinion, and a character\r\nof partisanship to the resulting Referendum.\r\n\r\nThe number of signatures required in the optional Referendum varies,\r\naccording to the size of the Canton, from five hundred to one thousand\r\nvoters, and the time within which it must be made, usually thirty\r\ndays from the passage of the law and its official publication. The\r\ncompulsory Referendum exists in the seven Cantons of Zurich, Bern,\r\nSolothurn, Grisons, Aargau, Thurgau, and the Valais, and in the rural\r\nhalf-Canton of Basel. In Schwyz and Vaud both forms obtain. In Zurich\r\na popular vote must be taken upon all changes in the constitution, new\r\nlaws, concordats, and the appropriation of an amount exceeding 250,000\r\nfrancs, or an annual expenditure exceeding 20,000 francs. The power of\r\nthe cantonal council in Zurich is further limited by the _initiative_.\r\nAny voter, if supported by one-third of the members present at its\r\nnext sitting, or any 5000 voters, may demand the passing, alteration\r\nor abolition of a law, or of a decision of the council. The optional\r\nReferendum exists in the seven Cantons of Luzern, Zug, Schaffhausen,\r\nSt. Gallen, Ticino, Neuchâtel, Geneva, and the urban portion of Basel.\r\nGenerally speaking, laws, concordats, and sometimes resolutions of\r\ncantonal councils are submitted to optional Referendum. It exists for\r\nfinancial matters, in different gradations in other Cantons, from\r\n500,000 francs in Bern to 50,000 francs in Schwyz. The _initiative_ as\r\nto revision of the constitution prevails in all of the Cantons upon\r\ncertain conditions, and the demand of voters varying in number from\r\n1500 to 5000; with the exception of Bern and Valais, where there is\r\nno _initiative_. As before stated, Freiburg is now the only Canton in\r\nwhich the sovereignty of the people is not thus directly exercised;\r\nall the others, with the exception of those where there is still\r\na _Landsgemeinde_, possess either a _compulsory_ or an _optional\r\nReferendum_; and in two instances both. A few Cantons have introduced\r\nan _imperative initiative_, by petition from a fixed number of voters,\r\ndemanding action upon a certain matter by the cantonal council;\r\nwhereupon the council must take a vote upon it, and then submit it\r\nto a popular vote, even if the action of the council upon it has been\r\nunfavorable.\r\n\r\nThis combination of representative institutions with the direct\r\nexercise of popular sovereignty is well calculated to promote the\r\nwelfare of the people, occupying the peculiar position in which the\r\nSwiss are placed. The discipline of self-government in the Commune,\r\nand the training afforded by an effective system of popular education,\r\nhave qualified them for the practice of direct democracy. With the\r\nSwiss legislature standing above the executive and judiciary, we might\r\ncall Switzerland a parliamentary republic, if it were not for another\r\npower, which stands not only in the final theory, but even in the daily\r\npractice, of the constitution, above the legislature. This power is\r\nthe people themselves. The Referendum shows clearly where the seat of\r\nsovereignty in Switzerland is located.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE COMMUNES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lowest unit in the political system is that which still exists\r\nunder various names, as the Mark, the Gemeinde, the Commune, or the\r\nParish, the analogue of the precinct or township in the United States.\r\nThe communal system of Switzerland is peculiar in many respects, and\r\npresents one of the most instructive lessons which modern political\r\nlife furnishes of the working of village communities.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss Commune, speaking comprehensively, is a political and\r\ncivil division, standing midway between a political body and a joint\r\nstock company: a corporation, in one sense, endowed with perpetuity,\r\nand holding landed and other property; also a political entity,\r\nembracing all the burghers for economical purposes,--that is, for\r\nthe administration and enjoyment of the usufruct of the communal\r\nproperty; and embracing all the inhabitants for legislative and\r\nadministrative purposes, with a great variety of local exceptions and\r\nlimitations. The right of the Cantons and the several Communes to\r\nmodify these features results in endless divergencies. Being an area\r\nof local self-government, and possessed, to a high degree, of freedom\r\nin self-direction, the Commune is not far from being an independent,\r\nautonomous entity, forming an _imperium in imperio_, both politically\r\nand economically. Forming the simplest division in the Confederation,\r\nstill it is of vital importance; its personality to the Canton being\r\nwhat the Canton is to the nation. It inspires with its common life,\r\nnot simply a life of political activity, but of common social and\r\neconomical interests. It is so intimately bound up with all existing\r\nrights that its wishes are largely paramount in federal and cantonal\r\naction. Having so genuine and vigorous a political, social, and\r\neconomical life of its own, in which the faiths, hopes, passions, and\r\nduties of the citizen are involved, the Commune may be considered a\r\nsmall republic with indefinite rights.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss Commune is of very ancient origin, and claims to have been\r\nfounded on the idea that civic rights and freedom were disconnected\r\nfrom mere birth or ownership of land, stress being laid instead on\r\nquasi-corporate union; one of the many forms of the _gens_ or clan, in\r\nwhich it is no longer a wandering or a merely predatory body; but when,\r\non the other hand, it takes the form of an agricultural body, holding\r\nits common lands, and forming one component element of a commonwealth.\r\nThe independence of the Swiss Commune has survived from the days of\r\nthe primitive village community; that gathering of real or artificial\r\nkinsmen, made up of families, each living under the rule, the _mund_,\r\nof its own father; that _patria potestas_ which formed so marked and\r\nlasting a feature of the Roman law, and is to-day respected by the\r\nConfederation, designedly preserved by legislation, and jealously\r\nguarded by the people.\r\n\r\nThe integer of Swiss political society is not the individual, not\r\nthe household; the Commune is the Switzer’s ideal of a social and\r\npolitical system. The Swiss Society of Public Usefulness, in a pamphlet\r\npublished in 1871, called “Souvenir de la Suisse,” with the purpose of\r\npresenting the Swiss republic as a model to the French soldiers, who\r\nat that time under Bourbaki had retreated into Switzerland, declares:\r\n“Our laws proceed from this great principle, that our institutions are\r\ntruly free and popular, only in so far as our Communes are free; we\r\nmove from low to high, the Commune is the centre of our life, and there\r\ncan be no true development of liberty, except so far as it proceeds\r\nfrom the Communes, from the centre to the circling lines, from the\r\nsimple to the composite.” Mr. Numa Droz, chief of foreign affairs in\r\nthe Swiss Cabinet, in his “Instruction Civique,” a text-book in the\r\nSwiss public school, says: “The Commune is almost the state in a small\r\ncompass; to employ an illustration from natural history, it is one of\r\nthe cells of which the social body is composed. It is certain that a\r\nmuch-developed local right contributes to the strength and prosperity\r\nof the state. The Communes must have perfect liberty in rivalling one\r\nanother in their efforts to satisfy and advance the interests they\r\nhave in charge. So, care must be taken not to reduce them to a uniform\r\nlevel, which would stifle all spirit of initiative, every desire for\r\nimprovement. The Communes were the first and principal nurseries of\r\ndemocracy, and are still so in many countries. In their bosom the\r\ncitizens are best able of training themselves for public life, of\r\nfamiliarizing themselves with administrative questions, and learning\r\nhow to deal with them. They are the natural nursery grounds, whence the\r\nstate legislators and public servants come. A citizen, reared in the\r\npractical school of communal life, will always understand better the\r\npopular wants than one whose political education has been obtained in\r\nthe offices of federal administration.”\r\n\r\nThe commission appointed by the National Council to prepare a revised\r\nconstitution for the Confederation, in their report, May, 1871, say:\r\n“The liberty of the Swiss Commune is justly considered as the school\r\nand cradle of our political liberties.”\r\n\r\nThe Swiss constitution expressly recognizes communal citizenship and\r\nrights. In declaring that every Swiss citizen shall enjoy at his place\r\nof residence all rights of the citizens of the Canton, as also, all\r\nrights of the citizens of the Commune, it makes this reservation: “He\r\nshall, however, have no share in the common property of citizens or of\r\nthe corporation, nor shall he exercise the right to vote in matters\r\npertaining purely to such affairs, unless the cantonal laws determine\r\notherwise.” It further provides that “No Canton shall deprive any of\r\nits citizens of his rights, whether acquired by birth or settlement,”\r\nreferring to the citizenship derived from his “Commune d’Origine.”\r\nEvery child born of registered citizens becomes, by birth, a citizen\r\nof the Commune, and thereby also a citizen of the Canton, and of\r\nthe Confederation. He shares all political rights, exercises them\r\naccording to established rule, is supported by the communal funds\r\nwhen in distress, and assists in bearing all Communal burdens. He\r\nis therefore fully entitled to every Swiss privilege, when his name\r\nonce stands in the communal register, and of these sacred rights he\r\ncannot be alienated. All whose names are not thus registered are of\r\nthe “homeless” (“Heimathlosen”), a word of melancholy significance in\r\nSwitzerland.\r\n\r\nMembership of a Commune comes by descent or purchase; and marriage\r\nconfers on the wife the communal citizenship of her husband. In the\r\nfirst, that of descent, the right of the Commune depends not on place\r\nof birth or domicile, but on descent from parents who are citizens\r\nof the Commune, even though they live outside of it. It is not unlike\r\nthe old Roman municipal law, which was also based on _origo_ from a\r\nparticular _municipium_. In the second, that of purchase, it is of the\r\nessence of a Commune that the stranger should be admitted to membership\r\nonly on such terms as the Commune itself may think good. In every case\r\nit is regarded as a privilege and an affair of sale. A man of any craft\r\nor creed may apply for admission, but the Commune is the judge of\r\nwhether his prayer will be granted or not. More or less inquiry will\r\nbe made as to his antecedents, his ability to support himself, and\r\nhis belongings; but, at all events, it is a business transaction, and\r\nthe price varies according to the value of the communal property, the\r\nage, condition in life, and number in the family of the applicant. So\r\nmuch for a wife and each child; a boy is taxed more than a girl, for\r\nin the course of time the one may add by marriage to the burden of the\r\nCommune, and the other may lessen it by marrying into another Commune.\r\nIn some, the craft and calling are regarded; in a few, where they\r\nare in part a congregation with a common faith in charge, religious\r\nconsiderations may weigh more than any thought of worldly goods. A\r\nforeigner is usually charged more than a native. In olden time this\r\ndiscrimination extended to citizens of other Cantons, and the last\r\ntrace of this distinction was only abolished in 1871 by the Commune of\r\nLausanne. Some Communes are closed, but many remain open for additional\r\nmembers. Under any circumstances, it is a privilege to be bought, and\r\nthe tariff varies from 50 to 5000 francs, or from ten to one thousand\r\ndollars. This operates as a tax on Swiss citizenship, of which the\r\nCommune is the necessary basis.[55]\r\n\r\nOriginally, entrance into the Guilds, or _Zünfte_, was the only road to\r\ncitizenship in the Commune. These corporations or guilds had certain\r\nmonopolies and political privileges. It was a prominent feature of the\r\ntime that every mass of men, in any way whatever associated, was also\r\nincorporated. They were necessary for the protection of the humble\r\nburgher and infant industry against an unruly aristocracy, as well as,\r\nin some cases, for the transmission of knowledge and skill. Without\r\nthem the cities would never have performed their high service in the\r\npromotion of civilization, and the acknowledgment of the burgher’s\r\nrights. The various trades were separated by these guilds, but within\r\nthem the employer and the employed had a common interest. Their effect\r\nwas to strengthen the rights of their members and to raise the dignity\r\nof their masters. Under the reign of Henry I., surnamed the Fowler,\r\nwhen that awful catastrophe came over all the central part of Europe,\r\nthe irruption of the terrible and ferocious Magyars, who swarmed\r\nwestward from Hungary, spreading horror and desolation wherever they\r\nwent, and Helvetia, being exactly in their course and unfortified\r\nagainst such an invasion, suffered fearfully, he compassionated its\r\nhelpless condition and took pains to fortify the cities and towns.\r\nThe peasantry, however, were so attached to their free mountain lives\r\nthat often, in spite of all danger, they could not be persuaded to\r\ncome into the towns. So, in order to induce them to do so, Henry\r\nconferred very many privileges on the citizens of the towns, and in\r\nthis way laid the foundation of the guild and burgher class. All the\r\nmembers of the guilds had to be burghers of the particular Commune.\r\nThe systematic education and gradual development of the artisan class,\r\ntheir progress in technical skill and in wealth, their privilege of\r\ncarrying arms under the banner of their corporation or guild, their\r\npermanent connection with the interests and prosperity of the town,\r\nall tended to awaken in the artisans a sense of their importance.\r\nAs the administration of justice became general, government became\r\nnational, and skill and knowledge were so diffused that no special\r\nprotection, by way of monopolizing guilds, was any longer deemed\r\nnecessary. In order to check the tendency of members of poor Communes\r\nto establish themselves in more prosperous ones, a practice prevalent\r\nwhen the property was held in common by all the inhabitants, there\r\nwas a close corporation constituted, called the Burgher Commune, to\r\nthe members of which the communal property was limited; the remaining\r\ninhabitants being excluded from participation in it, as well as in the\r\nlocal administration. It soon came to pass, with increased facility of\r\ncommunications, that in most Communes the majority of the inhabitants\r\nwere not burghers. It was necessary to raise taxes to meet the public\r\nexpenditure, and it was not admissible that the burghers alone should\r\nadminister the Commune to the exclusion of all others who dwelt within\r\nits limits. Hence in many Cantons there came to be a double Commune;\r\nthat of the burghers who kept their property and only looked after the\r\ninterests of their own members, especially of those who were poor; then\r\nthere was that of the inhabitants forming a municipality, embracing\r\nthe whole of the population and providing for the public service. The\r\nformer is known as the _Commune des bourgeois_ or _Bürgergemeinde_;\r\nthe latter, _Commune des habitants_ or _Einwohnergemeinde_. This dual\r\ncommunal organism has given rise to much political contention, the\r\nRadicals desiring to abolish all Burgher Communes and to establish what\r\nis termed a “unique” Commune of all the inhabitants; but to this the\r\nConservatives of all shades are strongly opposed.\r\n\r\nThere is no limit as to the area or population of the Commune. In\r\nthe Canton of Bern there are 509 Communes, the largest embracing a\r\npopulation of 44,000, and the smallest 35; many have less than 200\r\ninhabitants. Some are rich and extensive, others are poor and small.\r\nRules and regulations differ, but each Commune is free and independent\r\nin itself, subject only to the supervision of the Canton.\r\n\r\nEvery Commune owns some land, some wood, and some water-right, in\r\ncommon fee. These constitute the communal fund, in which each member\r\nhas an equal share. The allotment of land is so made that every one may\r\nhave a part in the different kinds, forest, pasture, and arable. Each\r\nCommune manages its common property very much its own fashion, but from\r\nthe general similarity of their circumstances and conditions, certain\r\nuniform methods pervade their management. It is with these general\r\nfeatures we will deal. All the Communes which have arable lands, allot\r\nthem among their members upon an equitable basis; consequently one will\r\nsee a large number of small squares of land growing different crops,\r\nand resembling a checker-board; each one constitutes the share of a\r\nmember of the Commune; and one hundred and twenty-nine gleaners have\r\nbeen counted in a field, thus subdivided, of less than six acres. A\r\nlarge part of the land of each Commune is preserved as a common domain,\r\ncalled _Allmend_, signifying the property of all. It means land which\r\nis held and used, as the word itself indicates, in common; and by\r\ncommon usage the name _Allmend_ is restricted in some Communes to that\r\nportion of the undivided domain situated near the village, and which\r\nis under cultivation. These common lands may be divided into three\r\ngeneral classes, forest, meadow, and cultivated land (_Wald_, _Weide_,\r\nand _Feld_). Some Communes have in addition lands where rushes are\r\ncut for litter (_Riethern_), and others where turf is cut for fuel\r\n(_Torfplätze_). The economic corporation, which owns the _Allmends_,\r\nis distinct from the political body which constitutes the Commune.\r\nThe right exercised by the Communes over their domain is not a right\r\nof “collective ownership,” it is a right of “common ownership.” The\r\ndomain does not belong to a collection of individuals, it belongs to\r\na perpetual corporation. The individual has no share in the landed\r\nproperty, but merely a right to a proportional part of the produce.\r\nThen in some are the old burghers and the new burghers. The former\r\nare the lineal descendants of those who were burghers for hundreds of\r\nyears, and they only own these lands in common; the latter are those,\r\nor the descendants of those, who, having come in from other Cantons\r\nor Communes, settled in the place, and have no rights of any kind in\r\nthe common land. The land may be common to all the old burghers of a\r\nCommune equally; it is then said to belong to the Commune; or it may\r\nbelong to sections of the old burghers, as, for instance, to those who\r\nreside in a particular class of families; and again these may hold it\r\neither simply for their own use or for the promotion of some defined\r\nobject. The right of common, with rare exception, cannot be assigned,\r\ntransferred, or let, except to Communers; it is a right inherent in\r\nthe person. As a rule, the right belongs to every separate couple of\r\nhereditary usufructuaries, who have had “fire and light” within the\r\nCommune during the year or at some fixed date. The girls and young men\r\ntherefore very commonly keep their own little _ménage_, even though\r\nthey have to go to their daily work at other people’s houses; and if\r\nthey have remained the whole week away from their home, they come back\r\non Sunday evening to make “fire and light” in their habitations. A\r\nyoung man when he marries can claim the right; this rule is extended\r\nto a widow or orphans living together, and sometimes to every son who\r\nattains the age of twenty-five, provided he lives in a separate house.\r\nNatural children, whose parentage is known, may also claim their share.\r\nTo the communer, his native soil is a veritable _alma parens_, a good\r\nfoster-mother. He has a share in it by virtue of a personal inalienable\r\nright, which no one can dispute, and which the lapse of centuries has\r\nconsecrated. It does not simply give its members abstract rights; it\r\nprocures them also in some measure the means of existence. It provides\r\na valuable resource for indigent families, and preserves them at least\r\nfrom the last extremity of distress. It supplies the expenses of the\r\nschool, the church, the police, and the roads, besides securing to\r\nits members the enjoyment of property. In a few Communes the wine and\r\nbread, which is the fruit of their joint labor, forms the basis of an\r\nannual banquet, at which all the members of the Commune take part, and\r\nis known as the _Gemeinde-trinket_.\r\n\r\nIn 1799 the Swiss republic forbade all partition of communal land,\r\ndeclaring, “these lands are the inheritance of your fathers, the fruit\r\nof many years of toil and care, and belong not to you alone, but also\r\nto your descendants.” There are, however, indications of a tendency\r\nin Switzerland--which stands alone in the world as a land that has\r\nmaintained both the free political institutions and the communal system\r\nof property, of the times before feudalism--towards a disintegration\r\nof the _Allmend_. Thus, in the Canton of Glarus, the commonable Alps\r\nare let by auction for a number of years, and, in complete opposition\r\nto the ancient principles, strangers may obtain them. A project\r\nwas recently submitted to the Grand Council of Bern, to facilitate\r\nthe dissolution of the Communes, and to allow of the realization\r\nof their property by the members. It received little support, but\r\nwas significant of the existence of a sentiment that may some day\r\nbecome formidable and aggressive. Common property still plays a very\r\nimportant part in the economic life of the Alpine Cantons, but private\r\nproperty is spreading considerably. Facilities for transportation,\r\nthe substitution of machinery for manual labor, the accumulation of\r\ncapital, and all the marvellous revolution and progress of industrial\r\nlife, have brought about conditions which render the system of\r\ncommonable lands no longer the best. Families can be supported without\r\nthis common use, and, in most cases, better without it than with it.\r\nIt might be shown that, when capital exists in abundance, this common\r\nuse is a hinderance to the greatest possible production of food for\r\nthe people. No system that has been assailed by such conditions has\r\never been able to maintain itself. It will be no defence of it, to say\r\nthat it has hitherto been a good and workable system, and that the\r\nlong ages of its existence have proved it to be so. This is what might\r\nhave been said, and doubtless was said with truth, but without effect,\r\nof every system, not only of agronomy, but of everything else that\r\nwas ever established in the world. This is the logic of sentiment, of\r\nhabit, of custom, of tradition, and of those who think that they have\r\ninterests distinct from and superior to the interests of the rest of\r\nthe community, and of those who cannot understand what is understood\r\nby the rest of the world. It is, however, no match for the logic of\r\nfacts, and of the general interest, the public good. That must ever be\r\nthe strongest logic, as well as the highest law. If, then, this common\r\nuse of land should be overturned by capital, notwithstanding its long\r\nhistory and all that may be said on its behalf, we may infer that it\r\nwas the absence of capital which brought it into being and maintained\r\nit. The abolition of common lands, or _Allmends_, the disappearance\r\nof communal property into private ownership, would not involve the\r\nexistence of the Commune or impair the value of its most salient\r\nfeatures. The Commune forms a distinct part of the state organism, as\r\nconstituted by the cantonal power; it is a society of citizens for\r\nthe purpose of exercising the rights of election, legislation, and\r\nadministration; it has functions, as to certain affairs, in which it\r\nis vested with a certain autonomy; its institutions, estates, and\r\ndonations, within the limits of the cantonal constitution, being under\r\nits exclusive authority and direction. It is as administrative units,\r\npresenting an orderly and systematic arrangement, giving the population\r\nan opportunity to exercise an immediate influence on affairs, and\r\nquickly awakening the public spirit, that the Communes possess their\r\nmost essential importance. The reason that the republican system is\r\nso firmly established in Switzerland is, that it has its roots in\r\nthese minute districts forming the principal forces of political\r\nand administrative life. Freedom is best served by breaking up\r\ncommonwealths into small self-governing communities. They decentralize\r\nthe government. A free state is free, not so much because its executive\r\nor even because its legislature takes a certain shape, as because its\r\npeople are free to speak their minds and to act as they choose, within\r\nthe limits of the law, in all matters, public and private. That is the\r\nbest form of government that best secures these powers to its people.\r\nIn Switzerland national freedom has grown out of personal and local\r\nfreedom. The Confederation is a union of independent Cantons, the\r\nCantons a union of autonomous Communes. Political life is localized,\r\ncentripetal, intense, expressing itself in social and civic forms.\r\nThe parts come before the whole, the smaller units are not divisions\r\nof the whole, but the whole is made up by the aggregation of the\r\nsmaller units. Each stage--Commune, Canton, Confederation--is alike\r\nself-acting within its own range. Many of the Cantons changed from\r\noligarchies to democracies, many rose from the rank of subjects to\r\nthe rank of confederates; in all, their institutions rested on an\r\nancient and immemorial groundwork of Communes; and whatever is new\r\nin them has grown naturally and consistently out of the old. During\r\nthe time when the greater Cantons were aristocratically governed,\r\nsome by a hereditary class of patricians, others by the exclusive\r\ncorporation of burghers, communal liberty was retained as the basis of\r\nthe cantonal organization, and through its influence, the republic,\r\nthe political ideal of the people, had its deep root in the popular\r\ncharacter and customs; therefore the transition from an aristocratic to\r\na representative republic was easy and natural, when, in harmony with\r\nmodern theories, civil liberties were extended to all classes.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland has 2706 Communes, divided as to nationality, 1352\r\nGerman, 945 French, 291 Italian, and 118 in the Grisons, where the\r\nRomansch language is used. These Communes as an area of general state\r\nadministration serve for electoral districts, and as voting districts\r\nfor the Referendum. Their powers are numerous. They provide for all the\r\npublic services within their limits, much after the manner of a Canton;\r\nthey possess a sort of local police, which keeps order day and night\r\nin their territory, is present at fairs and markets, having an eye to\r\nthe public houses, and watches over rural property. Other communal\r\nofficials maintain the public buildings, roads, fountains, look after\r\nthe lighting, take measures against fires, superintend schools and\r\nreligious matters, and supply aid to the poor both in sickness and\r\nhealth. In the small Communes there is only a municipal council,\r\ncomposed of not less than four, elected directly by the members of the\r\nCommune in a general assembly (_Gemeinde-Versammlung_), one of whom\r\nis made presiding officer and called the _Syndic_ or _Maire_. In the\r\nlarge Communes there are two councils, one legislative and the other\r\nexecutive. A greater or less number of Communes in each Canton form\r\na district, presided over by a _Prefect_ (_Regierungsstatthalter_)\r\nwho represents the cantonal government. The functions of the communal\r\nassemblies extend to: voting the budget, receipts and expenses; the\r\ndetermination and apportionment of taxes; the choice of president\r\nand functionaries of every kind, with the right of controlling and\r\ndismissing them; administration of property belonging to the Commune;\r\nacceptance or modification of all communal regulations; foundation\r\nof churches, charitable institutions, hospitals, school-houses and\r\nprisons. The assembly or legislative council elects the communal or\r\nexecutive council, and the president of this body is the chief official\r\nof the Commune. Every citizen is eligible to the communal council, who\r\nis domiciled in the Commune, and a qualified voter in the communal\r\nassembly. The qualifications which entitle every citizen in the Commune\r\nto vote in the communal assembly require that he must have attained\r\nhis twentieth year, be _sui juris_, in full enjoyment of the general\r\ncivil and political rights of the citizen, and be under no temporary\r\ncivil or criminal disability. Paupers and those who have not paid\r\ntheir taxes cannot vote; those, too, who from intemperate habits have\r\nbeen prohibited from frequenting public houses are not allowed to vote\r\nduring that probationary period. The principal matters assigned to the\r\nsupervision of a communal council embrace: the local police, including\r\nresidents and establishments in the Commune; guardianship, embracing\r\norphans and those not capable of managing their own property (for any\r\nimprovident citizen may be made a ward, and the control of his property\r\ntaken away from him); the poor, relieving them as far as possible from\r\nthe communal funds, and when this is insufficient, to seek voluntary\r\ncontributions; public instruction, appointing the teachers in the\r\nprimary schools and paying their salaries; levying taxes upon the\r\nlanded property, capital and revenue, for the administration of the\r\nCommune, when revenues of communal property are insufficient. The habit\r\nof borrowing money on the security of communal credit has obtained but\r\nlittle footing; far from being disposed to spare themselves by throwing\r\nburdens on their successors, they rather think it necessary to get\r\ntogether and keep together a capital which shall produce interest, a\r\nschool fund, a poor fund, so the weight of annual taxation for these\r\npurposes may be lightened. In general, every citizen of a Commune\r\nmust serve his two years in any office to which he is elected, unless\r\nexcused, from the fact that he is already filling some public position,\r\nor that he is sixty years old or in bad health; every one takes his\r\nturn of office, as he takes, in earlier days, his spell of school, and\r\nin his later days, his spell of camp. Non-members of the Commune, if\r\nSwiss citizens, by virtue of a constitutional provision, have within it\r\nequal rights, excepting in respect of the communal property; nor can\r\nthey be subjected to taxes or other contributions than those imposed\r\non their own citizens. Every inhabitant of a Commune must be inscribed\r\nat the police office, and be prepared at all times to show that he is\r\nreally a member of the Commune; if he removes to another Canton he\r\nmust be fortified with this evidence of his communal citizenship, or\r\nhe will not be allowed to remain. This regulation is strictly enforced\r\nin every case, specially where the party is in any danger of becoming\r\na public burden. Every Commune, under this strict police surveillance,\r\nis absolutely protected against being compelled to support the vagrants\r\nor beggars of other Communes. The idea that it is the duty of the\r\nCommune to take care of its poor, the unfortunate, and incapable is\r\nfirmly planted in the mind and breast of every member. They will try to\r\nprevent an hereditary or professional pauper from acquiring a domicile\r\nin the Commune, and to return to their own Communes shiftless persons\r\nthat are apt to need aid, but are ready to relieve every case of\r\ndestitution which fairly belongs in the Commune.\r\n\r\nThe control of the Canton over the Communes in early times was only\r\nnominal; it consisted in finding fault and proposing amendments that\r\nwere not adopted; any semblance of cantonal interference, in the way\r\nof inspection and suggestions, being resented by the Communes. Of\r\nlater years there has been a gradual and systematic improvement in\r\nthe relation of the Canton and the Commune; and increased activity\r\nof cantonal superintendence has effected a better management of the\r\nCommune. The common funds as well as the common obligations have\r\nbeen subjected to more efficient rules, without at all extinguishing\r\nthe principle of distinct communal management. Communal accounts are\r\nreferable to the Canton for investigation and correction. Where great\r\nirregularities are discovered (which occurred once), the Canton has the\r\nright to put a Commune under guardianship; a Commune might, indeed,\r\nunder certain circumstances be forced into bankruptcy. The Constitution\r\nof 1874 largely extended this cantonal supervision over the Commune,\r\nand modified many extraordinary powers hitherto exercised by it. Some\r\nwriters look upon the Commune as representing an “antiquated form of\r\ncorporation,” to which the modern era is opposed; a sort of mediæval\r\nfraternity for the existence of which no plausible ground can be\r\nfound. Others still contend that the Communes form the true unities,\r\nthrough which, by equilibration of the interests of each, the wants\r\nof the whole are more wisely and effectively served. The republic of\r\nSwitzerland can largely trace its foundation, historically, to a free\r\ncommunal constitution. It forms the solid foundation of the whole\r\norganization. In the Commune, the citizen himself feels that he is\r\nconnected with his fellow-members by the bonds of a common ownership;\r\nand with his fellow-citizens, by the common exercise of the same\r\nright. With him the fair motto of the French, “Liberty, Equality, and\r\nFraternity,” is no empty formula inscribed on the tablets of public\r\ndocuments. His liberty is complete, and has been handed down from\r\nremote antiquity; equality is a fact sanctioned by all his laws;\r\nfraternity is not mere sentiment, it is embodied in institutions which\r\nmake the members of the same Commune members of one family, partaking,\r\nby equal right, in the hereditary patrimony. It would be unnatural\r\nif he was not deeply attached to an administration in which he takes\r\nso constant and essential a part. It is to him, also, the nursery\r\nof independence, and the training-school for higher politics; not\r\ncontroversial, office-seeking, electioneering politics, but politics\r\nas including in one and the same comprehensive signification, as in\r\nthe vocabulary of a free country it should be, all the relations and\r\nobligations of the citizen to the state. The rights and duties of a\r\ncitizen are themes of daily interest and discussion in the Commune,\r\nand are taught in all its secondary and superior schools; every one is\r\ninstructed and encouraged to take a personal and intelligent interest\r\nin what concerns the public weal, to be familiar with the public\r\nbusiness, to the interchange of ideas, and to the give-and-take of\r\ncivic life generally. He is taught that no man liveth to himself in a\r\nrepublic, but every man has public duties, every man is a public man,\r\nevery man holds one high, sacred, all-embracing office, the office of a\r\nfree citizen.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland, with its Communes, fully answers Aristotle’s definition\r\nof a state, as “the association of clans and village communities in a\r\ncomplete and self-sufficing life.” Small bodies are more closely united\r\nand more vigorous in the pursuit of their end than large communities;\r\nthis results from their leading more easily to personal friendships,\r\nand from the circumstance that, in a limited circle, men are brought\r\nmore frequently and immediately into contact with one another. By this\r\nmeans their sympathetic feelings become more deeply interested in the\r\ncommon welfare; they see more clearly that they are pursuing a common\r\nobject, and perceive the importance of vigorous co-operation on the\r\npart of each member of the association. Amid so small a number, each\r\nperson feels that his single vote and exertions are of consequence,\r\nand the thought of this excites in him a sense of responsibility, and\r\ninspires him with a more lively interest in that government of which\r\nhe himself is an efficient member. Every man who fills a communal\r\nstation, however humble, is conscious that he is playing his part in\r\nthe presence of the whole miniature republic, and that his conduct is\r\nevery moment exposed to a minute and jealous scrutiny. By all these\r\ncircumstances public virtue is stimulated, corruption checked, mutual\r\nsympathy heightened, patriotic zeal inflamed, and the union of public\r\nwith private interests clearly and substantially demonstrated. “It\r\nis not by the consolidation or concentration of powers, but by their\r\ndistribution, that good government is effected. Were not this great\r\ncountry already divided into States, that division must be made,\r\nthat each might do for itself what concerns itself directly, and what\r\nit can so much better do than a distant authority. Every State again\r\nis divided into counties, each to take care of what lies within its\r\nlocal bounds; each county again into townships or wards, to manage\r\nminuter details; and every ward into farms, to be governed each by\r\nits individual owner. It is by this partition of cares, descending in\r\ngradation from general to particular, that the mass of human affairs\r\nmay be best managed for the good and prosperity of all.”[56]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nCITIZENSHIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the old days of the Swiss Confederation, the days of the\r\n_Staatenbund_, when no part of the internal sovereignty had been given\r\nover to any central power, the citizen of any Canton was regarded\r\nand treated as a foreigner in any other Canton; he was as strictly\r\na _metoikos_ as a Corinthian who had settled at Athens, having no\r\nvoice in the government either of the Canton or Commune into which he\r\nremoved. All Swiss citizens who settled in _Gemeinden_, or Communes,\r\nof which they had not the hereditary burghership, answered exactly\r\nto the Greek _metoikos_; being in every important respect strangers\r\nin the places where they themselves dwelt, and where, perhaps, their\r\nforefathers had dwelt for generations. Down to 1815, it was left to\r\neach Canton to determine for itself the conditions under which persons\r\nfrom without could settle and gain citizenship; and for the first\r\ntime, under the Constitution of 1848, a general law governing this\r\nmatter was adopted; and it was still further extended and elaborated\r\nby that of 1874.[57] The good example of the United States, where it\r\nhad already been constitutionally provided that “the citizens of each\r\nState shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in\r\nthe several States,” was followed in the present Swiss constitution;\r\ngiving every Swiss citizen equal federal and cantonal rights, in\r\nwhatever part of the Confederation he may settle. The two higher\r\nfranchises, those of the Confederation and the Canton, are assured to\r\nhim at his place of domicile as fully as to a native thereof; but to\r\nthe lower franchise of the Commune he can be admitted only by a special\r\ngrant, or by the effect of some special cantonal enactment. Communal\r\nquestions, even including citizenship, are left to the legislation of\r\nthe Canton and of the Commune itself, the federal constitution only\r\nproviding that one domiciled in the Commune shall not be discriminated\r\nagainst as to taxation. The mere fact of indefinite residence and\r\ncontribution to the local taxes no more gives one a right to communal\r\nthan it would to American citizenship. Membership in the Commune is\r\nthe determining factor of Swiss citizenship. Modern states generally\r\nrecognize nationality as a personal relation not mainly dependent\r\non place of birth or domicile, but on descent from members of the\r\nnation and personal reception into its membership, place of birth and\r\ndomicile coming in to complete the notion. Midway between these comes\r\nthe Swiss principle of membership in the Communes, which forms the\r\nbasis of membership of the Canton (_Cantonsbürgerrecht_), and that, in\r\nturn, of the Swiss Confederation (_Schweizerbürgerrecht_). Citizenship\r\nin Switzerland is primarily an affair of the Commune, from which the\r\nbroader conception of citizenship in the Canton and the Confederation\r\nmust be reached. The “right of origin” is the great imprescriptible\r\nright and muniment of Swiss citizenship, and the production of a\r\ncertificate of _Commune d’Origine_ secures the constitutional right\r\n“to establish residence at any point in Swiss territory.” The lines\r\nof distinction between these several conceptions are not clearly\r\npresented, even to the minds of the Swiss themselves.\r\n\r\nUnder Article XIV., amendment of the Constitution of the United States,\r\n“All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to\r\nthe jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of\r\nthe State wherein they reside.” The two methods indicated in which\r\none may become a citizen of the United States are very simple and\r\nintelligible; first, by birth in the United States;[58] and, second,\r\nby naturalization therein. The only qualification as to either method,\r\napplies to the first, requiring that a citizen by birth must not only\r\nbe born within the United States, but he must also be “subject to the\r\njurisdiction thereof,”--meaning that whole and complete jurisdiction\r\nto which citizens generally are subject, and not any qualified and\r\npartial jurisdiction, such as may consist with allegiance to some\r\nother government. The process of naturalization, whereby one renounces\r\nany foreign allegiance and takes upon himself the obligations of\r\ncitizenship, is equally simple, being effected by proceedings\r\nunder general laws prescribed by Congress; which is empowered by\r\nthe constitution “to establish an uniform rule of naturalization.”\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment, in the clause above quoted, certainly\r\nrecognizes that there is a citizenship of the United States, and also\r\na citizenship of the several States; and that the two coexist in the\r\nsame persons. It is no longer possible to conceive of such a status\r\nas citizenship of a State unconnected with citizenship of the United\r\nStates, or of citizenship of the United States, with a residence in a\r\nState, unconnected with citizenship of the State. The States cannot\r\nnaturalize; the act of naturalization by the United States is the grant\r\nof citizenship within the State where the naturalized person resides.\r\nIt is only in the Territories and other places over which the State has\r\nceded exclusive jurisdiction to the United States that there can be\r\na citizenship of the United States unconnected with citizenship of a\r\nState. There are in the United States system:\r\n\r\n1. The several bodies of electors which compose the several States, in\r\ntheir character of sovereign and independent political communities,\r\nunited as such by the constitution, and which are alone invested with\r\npolitical rights and charged with political duties.\r\n\r\n2. The several bodies of citizens, which compose the several States in\r\ntheir character of separate civil societies, each of which bodies is\r\nimmediately subject to the government and entitled to the protection of\r\nthe particular State to which it belongs, but does not necessarily have\r\na voice or share in the government, state or federal.\r\n\r\n3. The common body of citizens of the United States, that is to\r\nsay, the citizens of each State and Territory, as “entitled to all\r\nprivileges and immunities of citizens in the several States.”\r\n\r\nThese privileges and immunities have always been construed to mean\r\nsuch rights and privileges as are in their nature fundamental, such\r\nas belong of right to the citizens of all free governments, such as\r\nat all times have been enjoyed by the citizens of the several States\r\nfrom the time of their becoming free, sovereign, and independent.\r\nRecognizing the distinction between the inhabitants of a State and\r\nits citizens, Mr. Caleb Cushing defines the latter as the “sovereign,\r\nconstituent ingredients of the government.” To the same effect speaks\r\nMr. Chief-Justice Waite in the United States vs. Cruikshank: “Citizens\r\nare members of the political community to which they belong. They are\r\nthe people who compose the community, and who in their associated\r\ncapacity have established or submitted themselves to the dominion\r\nof a government for the promotion of their general welfare, and the\r\nprotection of their individual as well as their collective rights.”\r\n\r\nThe political community in a State differs from the civil community; it\r\nis less numerically, but it comprehends special privileges. Membership\r\ntherein implies the possession, not only of the civil rights, but of\r\nthe privilege of participating in the sovereignty. Whereas membership\r\nin the civil community alone implies merely the possession of the civil\r\nrights,--_i.e._, the rights of personal security, of personal liberty,\r\nand of private property.[59] Under the Articles of Confederation,\r\nthe States constituting only a league, citizenship of the so-united\r\nStates was a thing inconceivable; accordingly the only citizenship\r\nthen possible, as a legal fact, was citizenship of the State. National\r\ncitizenship was introduced for the first time by the Constitution of\r\n1787. Still that constitution contained no definition of citizenship\r\nof the United States. Under the provision that “the citizens of each\r\nState shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of\r\ncitizens in the several States,” a person going from one commonwealth\r\ninto another, acquired no other status than that held by the race or\r\nclass to which he belonged in the commonwealth into which he went.\r\nThe only sense in which a citizenship of the United States existed\r\nwas in the provisions where it appears as a qualification for office.\r\nThe phrase “citizen of the United States” is employed three times, as\r\nto eligibility for the several positions of President, Senator, and\r\nRepresentative in Congress. From the adoption of the constitution to\r\nthe time of the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment thereto, the\r\nexistence of such a thing as citizenship of the United States, in the\r\nsense of a citizenship independent of the citizenship of the several\r\nStates, was hardly admitted. Then citizenship of the United States was\r\nnot primary and paramount, but secondary and subordinate; it was only\r\nan incident of State citizenship. Story wrote in his Commentaries: “It\r\nhas always been well understood among jurists in this country that the\r\ncitizens of each State in the Union are _ipso facto_ citizens of the\r\nUnited States.” Said Mr. Calhoun, in his speech on the “Force Bill,”\r\ndelivered in 1833, “A citizen at large, one whose citizenship extends\r\nto the entire geographical limits of the country without having a local\r\ncitizenship in some State or Territory, a sort of citizen of the world,\r\nsuch a citizen would be a perfect nondescript; not a single individual\r\nof this description can be found in the entire mass of our population.”\r\nMr. Justice Curtis, in his dissenting opinion in the Dred Scott case,\r\ntook the position that citizenship of the United States was dependent\r\nentirely upon citizenship of some one of the several States as such.\r\nMr. Calhoun and Mr. Curtis agreed that the power of Congress, under the\r\nconstitution, “to establish an uniform rule of naturalization,” was\r\nsimply the power “to remove the disabilities of foreign birth.” On the\r\nother hand, Mr. Justice Marshall, in 1832, held, in the case of Gassies\r\nvs. Ballon, that a naturalized citizen of the United States, residing\r\nin any State of the Union, was a citizen of that State. Marshall and\r\nCurtis, in their respective views, represented the difference which\r\nobtained between the advocates of State rights and their opponents,\r\non the question of citizenship of the United States. By the adoption\r\nof the Fourteenth Amendment this was all changed, and is now placed\r\nbeyond controversy. The principle is inverted.[60] Citizenship of the\r\nUnited States now depends in no way upon citizenship in any State or\r\nTerritory, but merely upon birth in the United States, coupled with\r\nsubjection to the jurisdiction thereof, or upon naturalization. The\r\nterm “subject to jurisdiction,” must be construed in the sense in which\r\nthe term is used in international law, as accepted in the United States\r\nas well as in Europe; and by this law the children born abroad of\r\nAmerican citizens are regarded as citizens of the United States, with\r\nthe right, on reaching full age, to elect one allegiance and repudiate\r\nthe other, such election to be final. If the Fourteenth Amendment\r\nfurnished an exhaustive and comprehensive definition of citizenship,\r\nsuch children would not be citizens. That it does not furnish such\r\ndefinition is intimated by Mr. Justice Miller in the Slaughter-House\r\ncases, and by Mr. Justice Field in his dissenting opinion. In the same\r\ncases it was decided that the privileges and immunities appurtenant\r\nto citizenship of the United States were different and distinct from\r\nthose appurtenant to State citizenship; being merely those special and\r\nlimited privileges and immunities arising from the special and limited\r\nscope under the constitution of the federal or United States authority.\r\nThe theory laid down in the Slaughter-House cases suggests a query as\r\nto the converse. Cannot a person in a substantial sense be a citizen\r\nof a State and at the same time not be a citizen of the United States,\r\nthe Fourteenth Amendment to the contrary notwithstanding? Is it not\r\nwithin the power of a State to grant to an alien, residing within its\r\nlimits, all the rights and privileges enjoyed by its native-born or\r\nnaturalized citizens, so far as such rights and privileges are under\r\ncontrol of the State?--that is, to naturalize an alien to the extent\r\nof its own exclusive jurisdiction, even to the extent of voting for\r\nUnited States officials, thus practically making him a member of the\r\npolitical community in the United States. Said the Supreme Court,\r\nthrough Chief-Justice Taney, in the Dred Scott case: “We must not\r\nconfound the rights of citizenship which a State may confer within its\r\nown limits and the rights of citizenship as a member of the Union;” and\r\nMr. Pomeroy, in his “Constitutional Law,” writes: “While it is settled\r\nthat the Congress of the United States has exclusive authority to make\r\nrules for naturalization, it must not be understood that the States\r\nare deprived of all jurisdiction to legislate respecting the rights\r\nand duties of aliens. They may permit or forbid persons of alien birth\r\nto hold, acquire, or transmit property; to vote at State or national\r\nelections, etc. These capacities do not belong to the United States\r\ncitizenship as such.” It is true that the constitution of the United\r\nStates makes no one a member of the _political_ body, a capacity which\r\ncomes only with citizenship of the State; and therefore it confers\r\nthe right to vote upon no one. That right comes even to the “citizens\r\nof the United States,” when they possess it at all, under State laws,\r\nand as a grant of State sovereignty. The amendment, Article XV.,\r\nconfers upon citizens of the United States a new exemption; namely,\r\nan exemption from discrimination in elections on account of race,\r\ncolor, or previous condition of servitude; and to the extent that,\r\nshould it be needful to protect this exemption, Congress may provide by\r\nappropriate legislation. The Fifteenth Amendment endows the individual\r\nwith the potentiality of enfranchisement, not its actuality, and did\r\nnot absolutely make him an elector. It did not deprive the people of\r\nthe States of the discretion, in their primary capacity, to decide who\r\nof their number should enjoy the political franchise. It simply forbade\r\nthem to adopt a particular rule of discrimination.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss constitution goes far beyond that of the United States in\r\ndealing with citizenship, and the rights, civil and political, thereto\r\ncommonly appertaining. It practically reverses the system as it exists\r\nin the United States. There are no citizens of Switzerland and _ipso\r\nfacto_ citizens of the Canton “wherein they reside.” To the contrary,\r\n“every citizen of a Canton,” the constitution declares, “is a Swiss\r\ncitizen.” In the words of an eminent Swiss writer, “The national\r\ncitizenship proceeds from below.” As to the electoral body, while in\r\nthe United States it is determined by the State, within the limitations\r\nof the Fifteenth Amendment, in Switzerland, with the exceptions as to\r\ncommunal corporate matters, it is fixed by the Confederation in its\r\norganic law, with provisions clear and full. Swiss political active\r\ncitizenship is derived from above, proceeding from the Confederation,\r\nand from this source descending to the Canton and the Commune. The\r\nindividual once admitted to cantonal citizenship, the Confederation\r\nsteps forward and invests him with its nationality, and asserts its\r\nexclusive dominion over him as an elector, declaring he may take part,\r\nin any place where he has acquired residence, in all federal elections\r\nand votes. Coming from any part of the Confederation and taking up his\r\nresidence in a Canton, he may, after a residence of three months there,\r\nenjoy in his place of settlement all the rights of a citizen of the\r\nCanton; and with these, also, the rights of a citizen of a Commune,\r\nexcept as to the common property and corporation. The Confederation,\r\nunder the constitution, is charged with fixing, by law, “the limits\r\nwithin which a Swiss citizen may be deprived of his political rights.”\r\nSwiss citizenship, as defined in the constitution,--“Every citizen of\r\na Canton is also a Swiss citizen,”--is far from being so accessible\r\nas the simple terms of its definition might imply. It is a difficult,\r\ntedious, and expensive process. As the cantonal citizenship precedes\r\nthe federal, so the communal citizenship precedes the cantonal. Every\r\nSwiss citizen must belong to some Commune. He must possess a Commune\r\nof origin, which in French is called “_Bourgeoisie_,” and in German\r\n“_Bürgergemeinde_.” If not obtained by inheritance, then he must\r\npurchase it at what the Commune sees proper to charge; only a few\r\npoorer Communes having free admission, or at least with trifling fees.\r\n\r\nThe foreigner, seeking Swiss citizenship, must first show that he has\r\nresided in Switzerland during the two years preceding his application,\r\nand that there is nothing in his relations to his native country\r\nthat will involve prejudice to the Confederation by his admission to\r\nSwiss citizenship. These conditions being satisfactorily complied\r\nwith, he is granted by the Federal Council authority to be received\r\nas a citizen of a Canton and of a Commune; and for which permit he\r\npays the Confederation thirty-five francs. The Federal Council, with\r\nconsiderate regard for the serious undertaking of the applicant,\r\nallows two years within which the permit may be used, and if, at\r\nthe expiration of that period, it be desired, will renew it upon\r\nthe payment of a small additional tax. On receiving the permit the\r\nholder sets out to find communal citizenship, as the first essential\r\nstep. This, as described, is practically a matter of purchase. With\r\nthis acquired, he must supplement it with cantonal citizenship, and\r\nof that Canton in which the Commune is located, otherwise it is of\r\nno avail. The agreement for communal membership is always predicated\r\nupon the favorable action of a Canton, and the consideration is not\r\npaid until its action is had. The cantonal citizenship is the _pons\r\nasinorum_,--it is the cap-stone, and the most difficult to secure.\r\nThe permit from the Federal Council is freely given; the communal\r\nadmission a question largely of francs, with some slight inquiry as to\r\ncharacter and condition; but the Canton considers the petition from\r\na different and higher stand-point. The Canton is not particularly\r\nconcerned about the applicant being able-bodied and possessed of those\r\nqualities and conditions which insure contribution from him rather\r\nthan distribution to him from the common property of the Commune. The\r\nCanton has regard to whether the applicant will be a desirable citizen,\r\nand not to the material aspects which are paramount with the Commune.\r\nIt occurs, not infrequently, that a successful purchaser of communal\r\nmembership fails as a petitioner to pass the cantonal ordeal.[61] The\r\ngranting of a cantonal or communal naturalization without the previous\r\napproval of the Federal Council is void; and the federal authority to\r\nacquire citizenship is equally futile, until followed up by cantonal\r\nand communal naturalization according to the laws of the Canton. This\r\ninvolved process that hedges Swiss citizenship, and the cost of its\r\nselection in a desirable Commune, have deterred many foreigners who\r\nhave taken up their permanent residence in Switzerland, from making\r\nany attempt for its acquisition. The number of this class at present\r\nis estimated to be nearly ten per cent. of the whole population; and\r\nthe Federal Council is considering the policy of amending the law, so\r\nthat naturalization may be more easily effected, in order to convert\r\na great portion of these strangers into Swiss citizens. When Swiss\r\ncitizenship is once obtained, by birth or naturalization, it is not\r\neasily lost or set aside. In this the federal constitution determines\r\nthe conduct of the Canton, and does not permit it “to banish one\r\nof its citizens from its territory, or deprive him of the right of\r\ncitizenship.” The “right of township or origin,” the highest and\r\nfirmest right of citizenship, is a sacred and imprescriptible right,\r\nwhich the constitution places above any power to take away or impair.\r\nBy virtue of the constitutional authority of the Confederation, “to\r\nfix the conditions upon which foreigners may be naturalized, as well\r\nas those upon which a Swiss may give up his citizenship in order\r\nto obtain naturalization in a foreign country,” a federal law was\r\nenacted in 1876. It provides that “a Swiss citizen may renounce his\r\ncitizenship if he has no domicile in Switzerland, and if he is enjoying\r\nfully all civil rights according to the laws of the country where\r\nhe resides, and that he has already acquired citizenship in another\r\ncountry, or the assurance of its being granted for himself, his wife,\r\nand minor children. The declaration of renunciation is to be submitted\r\nin writing, accompanied by the required statement, to the cantonal\r\ngovernment, which will notify the respective communal authorities,\r\nin order to inform such parties as are interested, and a term of\r\nfour weeks is fixed for presenting objections.” The Federal Tribunal\r\ndecides in such cases, where objection is made to the renunciation;\r\nand in event of no objection being made, or if made and judicially\r\noverruled, then the discharge from cantonal and communal citizenship\r\nis pronounced and entered on record. This discharge includes Swiss\r\ncitizenship or denationalization, and dates from its issue and delivery\r\nto the applicant; it also extends to the wife and minor children, when\r\nthey are domiciled or living together, and if no special exceptions\r\nbe made in regard to them. The widow or the divorced wife of a Swiss\r\ncitizen, who has renounced his nationality, and such children of a\r\nformer Swiss citizen, as were minors at the time of such renunciation,\r\nmay request of the Federal Council to be readmitted as citizens.\r\nThis privilege will not be granted to the widow or divorced wife,\r\nunless the application be made within ten years after the dissolution\r\nof the marriage; nor to the children, unless made within ten years\r\nafter attaining their majority. After the expiration of these\r\nperiods, the parties in either case must acquire citizenship in the\r\nmanner prescribed for aliens. The substance, indeed, the identical\r\nphraseology, of this law was anticipated by the Federal Council in\r\nits answer, made in 1868, to an appeal from the British government,\r\nrelating to expatriation and naturalization. The Council closed its\r\nanswer in these words: “The right of Swiss citizenship ceases only\r\nwith the death or by the voluntary renunciation, by the person who\r\npossesses it, of his cantonal and communal right of citizenship, and by\r\nthe release which a competent authority, cantonal and communal, gives\r\nhim. But this emancipation from the ties which bind him to the state\r\nis not granted until the proof exists, in due form, of the acquisition\r\nof citizenship in a foreign country.” It is manifest that the entrance\r\nto and exit from Swiss citizenship is by no means through a broad and\r\nopen door. The firm tie which binds him with “hoops of steel” to his\r\ncountry is not loosed by the mere acquisition of citizenship in another\r\ncountry; but proof must be submitted that he was under no disability\r\nat the time of doing so, and that he is in the full enjoyment of all\r\nthe civil rights of his adopted country. In the event of a member of a\r\nCommune moving to another Canton, who does not thereby divest himself\r\nof his original communal citizenship, and fails to secure membership in\r\nthe Commune where he settles (for one may become a member of several\r\nCommunes), he assumes a citizenship of a twofold nature, and therefore,\r\nas explained in the chapter on “Communes,” there exist in many Communes\r\ntwo governments,--a citizens’ government and a political government,\r\ndistinguished as the community of citizens and the community of\r\ninhabitants or settlers. This principle also results in a dual national\r\ncitizenship, and consequently conflicting claims of correlative rights\r\nand duties. To provide against embarrassing contingencies that might\r\narise from this situation on the part of Swiss who have acquired\r\ncitizenship in a foreign state,--without the required formal and\r\nexpressed voluntary declaration of renunciation, with its equally\r\nformal and expressed acceptance to render it valid,--the federal law of\r\n1846 declares that “persons who, in addition to Swiss citizenship, are\r\ncitizens of a foreign country, are not entitled to the privileges and\r\nthe protection accorded to Swiss citizens, during their residence in\r\nsuch a foreign state.”\r\n\r\nIt is this imprescriptible feature of Swiss communal citizenship, so\r\ndeeply embedded in the public sentiment of the country and engrafted in\r\nthe organic law, that has stubbornly blocked the way to all efforts,\r\non the part of the United States, to negotiate with that country a\r\nnaturalization treaty. Such treaties of reciprocal naturalization\r\nexist between the United States and all the European nations, except\r\nthe two absolute monarchies of Russia and Turkey, whereby it is\r\nstipulated that domicile of certain duration and naturalization shall\r\nbe recognized by both parties as terminating the previous relation. To\r\nrepeated invitations from the United States to Switzerland looking to\r\nthe conclusion of a similar treaty, the same answer always came from\r\nthe Federal Council,--“The conception of the imprescriptibility of the\r\nSwiss citizenship, closely interwoven as it is with the views of the\r\nSwiss people, and recognized by various cantonal constitutions as a\r\nfundamental right, would make it impossible for Switzerland to conclude\r\na treaty, whereby a citizen, after a longer or shorter absence, would\r\nlose his Swiss nationality.” In fact, to accede to this request, it\r\nwould be necessary to obtain an amendment to the Swiss constitution,\r\nasserting federal control over the question. At present there is no\r\nSwiss citizenship except as it is derived from the Canton and Commune;\r\nand the Confederation is powerless to deal internationally with it.\r\nThe Swiss contention that a Swiss who becomes a citizen of any other\r\ncountry, without specific exemption under the law, is held to the\r\nobligations of Swiss citizenship, does not distinctly embrace the\r\ndoctrine of return and domicile _animo manendi_ in Switzerland. The\r\nSwiss Federal Tribunal has even asserted jurisdictional powers with\r\nrespect to Swiss naturalized and resident in a foreign country.\r\n\r\nThe latitude given cantonal and communal officials in the construction\r\nof the federal law of 1876, and the survival of a great body of\r\nantiquated cantonal enactments and communal ordinances, which slowly\r\nand reluctantly yield to federal legislation, complicate and render\r\nalmost impossible a compliance with its provisions. It has been held\r\nthat a renunciation, though presented in proper form, could not\r\nbe entertained, because the party was under “guardianship.” Not a\r\nguardianship under which the law places a minor, but a guardianship\r\nauthorized by cantonal and communal laws; under which any improvident\r\nadult citizen may be placed,--and these local officials are disposed to\r\nclassify under this head those who emigrate, and propose subsequently\r\nto make a renunciation of Swiss citizenship, specially should any\r\ninheritance fall to them in the Cantons or Communes. These persons are\r\ncoerced to return to Switzerland to obtain the possession and enjoyment\r\nof such property; or by prolonged absence permit it to escheat, and\r\nswell the common fund. Again, a very common ground of objection to\r\nrenunciation is the alleged fear that the party may at some time, in\r\nthe future, return to his native country and become a public charge;\r\nand this is persisted on in spite of the assurance that he has become\r\na citizen, say, of the United States, a _bona fide_ resident therein,\r\ninvested with all the privileges and subject to all the obligations\r\npertaining thereto, and if from indigence, sickness, or other cause\r\nhe should become unable to maintain himself, he has a claim in common\r\nwith and to the same extent as other citizens of the United States in\r\nthe provisions made by law for persons reduced to that unfortunate\r\ncondition, in the State in which he might happen to reside at the time\r\nof such contingency. In a recent case (1889), that of “Carl Heinrich\r\nWebber (of Philadelphia) vs. The City Council of Zurich,” the plaintiff\r\nhad left Switzerland during his minority, and in due course of time\r\nwas naturalized in pursuance of the statute, and desired to secure\r\npossession of his property in Zurich for purpose of transfer to the\r\nUnited States. This was resisted by his guardian, on the ground that\r\nwhile his renunciation in its preparation and presentation met the\r\nrequirements of the law, still he had left Switzerland without the\r\nconsent of his guardian, and therefore could not legally acquire the\r\ndomicile in the United States necessary for naturalization there.\r\nThis plea of the guardian was sustained by the Council of Zurich, and\r\nWebber denied his property. On an appeal to the Federal Tribunal, this\r\ndecision was overruled, only on the ground that the guardian had given\r\nan implied assent to the young man’s change of domicile; the court\r\nadding that otherwise the plea, as made and sustained by the lower\r\ncourt, would have been affirmed.[62] The judicial doctrine, which so\r\nlong obtained, that no one could expatriate himself without express\r\nauthority of law, has given way, in principle and practice, to the\r\nnatural and fundamental right to transfer allegiance, and that every\r\nman should be allowed to exercise it with no other limitation than the\r\npublic safety or interest requires. The sound and prevalent doctrine\r\nnow is that a citizen or subject, having faithfully performed the past\r\nand present duties resulting from his relation to the sovereign power,\r\nmay at any time release himself from the obligation of allegiance,\r\nfreely quit the land of his birth or adoption, search through all\r\nthe countries a home, and select anywhere that which offers him the\r\nfinest prospect of happiness for himself and posterity. This right\r\nrests on as firm a basis and is similar in principle to the right\r\nwhich legitimates resistance to tyranny. Two elements, each equally\r\nimportant, enter into expatriation,--the one is emigration out of\r\none’s native country, and the other is naturalization in the country\r\nadopted. All lexicographers and all jurists define naturalization in\r\none way. In its popular etymological and legal sense, it signifies the\r\nact of adopting a foreigner and clothing him with all the privileges of\r\na native citizen or subject. This naturalization cannot do under the\r\nSwiss contention; for the national allegiance of the Swiss cannot be\r\nthrown off and another substituted in its place without the assent of\r\nthe sovereign holding the former. Naturalization in a foreign country\r\nshould operate, from the time of its completion, as an extinguishment\r\nof the original citizenship; it should work absolute expatriation in\r\nlaw as it does in fact. A citizen who has in good faith abjured his\r\ncountry and become a subject of a foreign nation should to his native\r\ngovernment be considered as denationalized; leaving it to the law of\r\nthe land of his birth, whether or how he shall become repatriated. As\r\nforcibly expressed by a former Secretary of State at Washington: “The\r\nmoment a foreigner becomes naturalized, his allegiance to his native\r\ncountry is severed forever. He experiences a new political birth,--a\r\nbroad and impassable line separates him from his native country.”\r\n\r\nThe right of expatriation is fully and positively established in the\r\nUnited States, by an act of Congress, in these words: “Whereas, the\r\nright of expatriation is a natural and inherent right of the people,\r\nindispensable to the enjoyment of the rights of life, liberty, and\r\nthe pursuit of happiness; and, whereas, in the recognition of this\r\nprinciple, this government has frequently received emigrants from all\r\nnations, and invested them with the right of citizenship; and, whereas,\r\nit is claimed that such American citizens, with their descendants,\r\nare subjects of foreign states, owing allegiance to the governments\r\nthereof; and, whereas, it is necessary to the maintenance of public\r\npeace that this claim of foreign allegiance should be promptly and\r\nfinally disavowed; therefore any declaration, instruction, opinion,\r\norder, or decision of any officer of the United States, which denies,\r\nrestricts, impairs, or questions the right of expatriation is declared\r\ninconsistent with the fundamental principles of the republic.”\r\n\r\nNaturalization in the United States is a valuable privilege, which\r\nis considerately granted to those who desire its advantages and are\r\nwilling to undertake its duties. The process is a decree of a court of\r\nrecord, upon the satisfactory establishment by the applicant of his\r\nlawful eligibility to the privilege of their nationality. The United\r\nStates cannot admit of qualified naturalization, subject to the consent\r\nof the country of origin; nor can the United States Courts, in which\r\nthe judicial power of naturalization is vested, take cognizance of the\r\nconsent of a foreign state as a precedent condition to naturalization.\r\nThe admissibility of a change of allegiance in the United States,\r\nwithout any co-operation or consent of the country of origin, is\r\nplainly implied from the very statute itself; which requires conditions\r\nof residence, of personal character, of publicity, and of abjuration\r\nunder oath of allegiance to every other government, and especially\r\nto that of the country of birth, with sworn allegiance to the United\r\nStates. These are all indispensable for the completion of an act of\r\nexpatriation, and no more; and he who is in this manner endowed with\r\nthe nationality of the United States, thereby dissolves all ties of\r\nnative allegiance, and is clothed with all the rights and privileges\r\nthat pertain to a native citizen, and entitled to the same degree of\r\nprotection whether at home or abroad.\r\n\r\nCitizenship is an attribute of national sovereignty, and not merely\r\nof individual or local bearing. It is a sacred right, full of grave\r\nconsequences, granted with solemn formalities, and its existence should\r\nalways be well defined and indisputable. Between friendly States,\r\nnaturalization and expatriation should be reciprocal; and with an equal\r\nmeasure of obligation. Conventional adjustment is alone adequate to the\r\nremoval of the most prolific source of constantly-recurring friction\r\nand tension, inevitable, in the absence of treaty stipulation.\r\n\r\nThe persistency of Switzerland upon this question in a policy so much\r\nat variance with all the liberal views of civilized nations, exhibiting\r\na stubborn conservatism and irrational disinclination to change her\r\nlaws to meet generally accepted principles and the requirements\r\nof her external relations, might well subject the Swiss to the\r\ncharacterization, applied at one time by Cobden to the English people,\r\nas “the Chinese of Europe.”\r\n\r\nAll laws controlling States in their relations with one another are the\r\nslow result of growth, coming from an ever-increasing and ever-varying\r\nnecessity; rendering any assumption of logical consistency not only\r\nimpossible, but in many instances wrong, if not dangerous, to the\r\ninevitable concurrence of doctrines demanded by general usage and\r\ninternational amity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nLAND LAW AND TESTAMENTARY POWER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere can be no better security for the stability of the institutions\r\nof a country than by enlisting a large number of the people in their\r\nsupport, by giving them a stake in the prosperity of the soil. It is\r\nthe highest public interest that landed property should easily get\r\ninto those hands by which it can be turned to the best account; that\r\nthe title to property in land should be sure and incontestable; and\r\nthat there should be no legal obstacle to the subdivision of land,\r\nwhen the natural economy tends to it, so that the number of small\r\nland-owners shall not be artificially reduced by imperfection in the\r\nlaw. The larger the number of land-owners in a country, the more who\r\nhave an interest in the soil they till, the more free and independent\r\ncitizens there are interested in maintenance of public order. There\r\nis no ballast for a man like that of having a little earth, his own,\r\nabout his feet. Cultivating his own field, growing a part of his\r\nfood-supply, lodged under his own roof,--these make life pleasanter\r\nand labor lighter. The thoughts, feelings, lives of those who live\r\nunder these conditions are of a higher order than the thoughts, the\r\nfeelings, the lives of those who do not. Property is the essential\r\ncomplement of liberty. Without property man is not truly free. Whatever\r\nrights the political constitution may confer upon him, so long as he\r\nis a mere tenant he remains a dependent being; a free man politically,\r\nhe is socially but a bondsman. There is no country in Europe where\r\nland possesses the great independence, and where there is so wide a\r\ndistribution of land-ownership, as in Switzerland. The 5,378,122 acres\r\ndevoted to agriculture are divided among 258,639 proprietors, the\r\naverage size of the farms throughout the whole country being not more\r\nthan twenty-one acres.[63] The facilities for the acquisition of land\r\nhave produced small holders, with security of tenure, representing\r\ntwo-thirds of the entire population. There are no primogeniture,\r\ncopyhold, customary tenures, and manorial rights, or other artificial\r\nobstacles to discourage land transfer and dispersion. No entails\r\naggregating lands and tying them up, so that no living person shall\r\nbe full owner, but a mere tenant for some unborn child. No family\r\nsettlements with “tenants in common in tail,” with “cross-remainders in\r\ntail,” till some tenant-in-tail reaches the age of twenty-one years,\r\nwhen he may be able with the consent of his father, who is tenant for\r\nlife, to bar the entail with all the remainders. There is no belief,\r\nin Switzerland, that land was made to minister to the perpetual\r\nelevation of a privileged class; but a wide-spread and positive\r\nsentiment, as Turgot puts it, that “the earth belongs to the living,\r\nnot to the dead;” nor, it may be added, to the unborn. The natural\r\nforces of accumulation and dispersion are not hampered by ninety-nine\r\nyears building leases, perpetual and irredeemable rent, or heavy\r\nexpense of conveyance; but are in every way encouraged, simplified, and\r\nfacilitated by the laws federal and cantonal. The wars of the fifteenth\r\nand sixteenth centuries exercised, indirectly, considerable influence\r\non Swiss land tenure, by breaking up the large properties--monastic,\r\nconventual, and private--which had for some time been steadily\r\naugmented; and produced a reaction in favor of gradual redistribution.\r\nThis wider dissemination of land among the people was carried on\r\nwithout rudely shocking or violating proprietary rights, as far as the\r\nfew recalcitrant owners permitted it to be done; certainly with not a\r\ntithe of the legislative injustice or coercion, with which a greater\r\npart of these accumulations had been made. It is from this period that\r\nthe existing system of land tenure in Switzerland may be said really\r\nto date. The feudal rights asserted by certain Cantons over others,\r\nwhich took the form of landed charges, were all swept away at the\r\ntime of the setting up of the Helvetian Republic, in 1798. Since the\r\ncommencement of this century, and especially since the constitutions\r\nof 1830 were framed, the land throughout the whole of Switzerland has\r\nbeen completely emancipated,--the system of peasant proprietorship\r\nworking side by side with that of small tenant farmers. The survival\r\nof the Commune, intact with its various property rights in fee-simple\r\nand usufruct, does not conflict with or impede the general tendency to\r\ndiscourage the centralization of landed property in the hands of the\r\nfew. For it has come to be axiomatic with the Swiss that the effort to\r\nacquire land is the mainspring of the life of the peasant, the root\r\nof his industry, of his painstaking, frugal, and saving life. The\r\nsolid, sterling elements of the Swiss peasant’s character are traced\r\nby all the native writers to their source in the educative power of\r\nproperty,--property in land.\r\n\r\nThere exists no federal land code in Switzerland. Contracts relating\r\nto the sale and purchase of lands, easements, and mortgages are\r\ngoverned by the law of each Canton. In general, all questions as to the\r\ndevolution of property, by will or upon intestacy, are regulated by the\r\nCantons, and not within the competence of the Confederation. There is\r\nan official survey containing a plan of each Commune, with the parcels\r\nof land, their areas, annual values, and peculiarities indicated, of\r\nwhich any one may have a copy under a fixed schedule of charges. The\r\nfederal code of obligations, adopted in 1861, contains twenty-five\r\narticles relating to leases of land. It was claimed at the time of the\r\npassage of this law, by some of the ablest lawyers, to be an assumption\r\nby the government of a very doubtful power, an interference with the\r\nownership of the soil, and the infringement of an exclusive right\r\nguaranteed to the Cantons. The friends of the measure contended that\r\nits provisions did not involve the title or ownership of realty, but\r\nonly had to do with the rights of persons, which clearly fell within\r\nthe competency of the Federal Assembly. This view obtained. While\r\nit is difficult to examine this elaborate act and its far-reaching\r\nprovisions, without a conviction that it bears a very close and strong\r\nrelation to the ownership of soil, in the popular apprehension of that\r\nterm, still its satisfactory operation has silenced all opposition,\r\nand it is now believed to be accomplishing desirable ends that could\r\nnot otherwise be so efficiently done. It may be of interest to note\r\nsome of the leading provisions of this law. All contracts for leases\r\nare required to be written. If the farm be delivered to the tenant\r\nin a condition unsuitable for the purpose for which it was rented,\r\nthe tenant may renounce the lease. If deteriorations or restrictions\r\nnot mentioned in the covenant take place, without the tenant’s fault,\r\nhe may demand proportionate reduction of rent or renounce the lease,\r\nif proper restitution is not made within a reasonable time. Urgent\r\nrepairs of any kind, required during the lease, are to be made by the\r\ntenant. The lessor has the right to retain all the movables belonging\r\nto the farm, as security for the payment of his rent, for the past\r\ncurrent year. This, however, does not include effects, which, under\r\nthe laws relating to debt and bankruptcy, are exempt from execution.\r\nThe lessor has the right to appeal to the authorities to compel a\r\ntenant, who threatens to abandon the farm before paying the rent, to\r\nleave property behind him on the place in value sufficient to cover the\r\namount due. A tenant cannot be relieved from rent when, through his own\r\nfault or even from any accident in which he was directly concerned,\r\nhe is unable to enjoy the use or benefit of the lease. If implements,\r\nstock, etc., are included in the lease, each party must furnish the\r\nother with a specific inventory duly subscribed, with an estimate of\r\ntheir value. The lessor must bear the expense of any repairs, on a\r\nlarge scale, which may become necessary during the lease, as soon as\r\nhe receives notice of such from the tenant. The tenant must make a\r\nconscientious use of the land, according to the stipulations of the\r\nlease, and especially to keep it in a good state of cultivation. The\r\ntenant cannot alter the existing mode of cultivation or cropping to\r\nthe damage of the land or the prejudice of a subsequent lease. He must\r\nconform with all local laws and customs as to paths, foot-bridges,\r\nditches, dikes, hedges, roofs, aqueducts, etc., and must replace all\r\nimplements and tools of small value which may have become worn out.\r\nThe tenant cannot underlet without consent of landlord, regardless of\r\nduration of lease. In absence of special agreement as to payment of\r\nrent, it must be paid according to the local custom, and in event of\r\nextraordinary accident by which he loses a considerable portion of\r\nhis year’s product, if in no way due to any fault on his part, and\r\nif not covered by insurance, or taken into consideration in fixing\r\nthe rent, he may demand a proportionate reduction. In the absence of\r\nagreement or well-defined custom, each party has the right to give the\r\nother notice, which as to the land must be at least six months before\r\nthe 11th of November. With this notice in cases of long leases, where\r\ncircumstances arise to render its continuance intolerable to either\r\nparty, it may be terminated, with an equitable indemnity to the other\r\nparty; this indemnity, even when referred to the courts for adjustment,\r\nmust not be less than one year’s rent. If, on the expiration of the\r\nlease, the tenant remains in possession with the landlord’s knowledge\r\nand without his objection, the lease will continue in force from year\r\nto year, until the six months’ notice is given by one of the parties.\r\nWhen a tenant fails to pay his rent at the time it falls due, the\r\nlessor may give him notice that if not paid within sixty days the lease\r\nwill be cancelled; in that event the tenant loses his right to the\r\ngrowing crops, but he must be reimbursed for the expenses incurred in\r\ntheir cultivation, to be credited on arrears of rent. The lessor has\r\nthe right to cancel a lease when the tenant neglects to keep the farm\r\nin good order; or if, after receiving notice, he fails to execute any\r\nnecessary repairs within the period designated by the landlord. In\r\nevent of a tenant’s bankruptcy, the lease expires _ipso facto_, when\r\nsuch bankruptcy is declared. At the expiration of a lease the tenant\r\nmust hand over the farm and everything specified in the inventory, just\r\nas they are at the time of delivery, with indemnity for any injury\r\nresulting from want of proper care on his part; and no compensation is\r\ndue him for improvements merely the result of ordinary care. The tenant\r\nmust leave on the land the straw and manure of the preceding year; if,\r\nhowever, it exceeds what he received when taking possession, he can\r\nclaim compensation for the difference. The outgoing tenant, at the\r\nexpiration of the lease, has the right to compensation for any increase\r\non the original valuation of the farm which is the fruit of his labor\r\nand outlay; this is sometimes ascertained to a nicety by means of a\r\nsystem of chemical testing of the soil.\r\n\r\nIt seems almost incredible that a federal law should be so\r\ncircumstantial, rather than lay down the general principles upon\r\na question of the lease of land and leaving it to the Cantons or\r\nCommunes to supply the details, in conformity with the varying local\r\nelements that must enter into it, from the great diversity of soil,\r\nproducts, and customs. This law is but another illustration of that\r\npatient and minute exactness which distinguishes all Swiss federal\r\nlegislation, aiming to cover every possible contingency that may arise\r\nof construction or enforcement.\r\n\r\nIt is to the cantonal civil codes we must turn for the body of the land\r\nlaws. These codes appear to be derived from three distinct sources,\r\ncorresponding with the ethnical division of the people,--the Roman,\r\nthe Old Germanic, and the Napoleonic codes. The Cantons of Geneva,\r\nNeuchâtel, and the western portion of the Canton of Bern, known as\r\nthe Jura-Bernois, have the code Napoleon almost in its entirety. The\r\ncodes of Vaud, Freiburg, Valais, and Ticino are based on the old Roman\r\nlaw, harmonized in some features with the code Napoleon. The Cantons\r\nof St. Gallen, Appenzell, Uri, Schwyz, Obwald, Glarus, and Basel-Stadt\r\nare still governed by ancient statutes or customs, without any defined\r\ncodes. The remaining Cantons, constituting what is known as German\r\nSwitzerland, have their land laws framed on the old Germanic code, with\r\nan admixture of the code Napoleon. There were no cantonal land codes\r\nprevious to 1819; the oldest one, that of Vaud, dates from that year.\r\nA summary of the law, in a few of the representative Cantons, will be\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\nBern has two separate codes; the western or Jura district having\r\nadopted the code Napoleon, while the other portion of the Canton\r\nstill adheres to the old Germanic code, with some alterations and\r\nimprovements grafted on to it. The sale of land is absolutely free and\r\nunrestricted; the only formality consisting of a contract drawn up and\r\nsigned by both parties and deposited at the cantonal registry office,\r\nfor which there is a small registration fee, divided between the Canton\r\nand Commune. The ordinary duration of an original lease is from five to\r\nten years. The lessee is in no way bound to any particular rotation of\r\ncrops, and any attempt to exhaust the soil unfairly is very unusual.\r\nThe outgoing tenant must deliver to his successor the farm in no worse\r\ncondition than that in which he found it; and if the requisite amount\r\nof manure, etc., is not forthcoming, he must replace the deficiency.\r\nOnly one-third of the landed property is at the absolute disposal\r\nof the testator, the remaining two-thirds must be divided in equal\r\nportions among the children. The only way a testator may favor a child\r\nis to bequeath to him that portion (one-third) which the law allows him\r\nto dispose of _ad libitum_, as an addition to his distributable share.\r\nShould, however, the wife survive her husband, she enjoys the absolute\r\nuse of all of his property for her life, with no power to alienate or\r\ndeal with it in any way, save with the consent of the Committee of\r\nWards, a body to be found in every Bernese Commune. Failing of wife\r\nor children, the property is divided equally among the heirs at law,\r\nshould there be no will disposing of the available one-third. There is\r\nan exception, not embodied in the code, but founded in an immemorial\r\ncustom, which prevails in the extensive valley of the Emmenthal, where\r\nthe youngest son inherits by right all the landed property at the\r\ndecease of both parents, subject to an annual indemnity paid to his\r\nbrothers and sisters, who in this way hold a preferred lien on the\r\nland. The origin of this custom is thus explained: Motives of safety\r\nformerly induced the proprietors of land to live within the walls of\r\nBern, where they had their house and establishment, which passed to\r\nthe eldest son, instead of land. The custom has held together the\r\nexceptionally large farms in this valley, some running up to a hundred\r\nand fifty acres each.\r\n\r\nIn the Canton of Vaud the sale and acquisition of landed property are\r\nas unrestricted as in that of Bern. One-half of it is at the disposal\r\nof the testator, the other half must go to the children in equal\r\nproportions. Failing of issue, and if the deceased dies intestate, and\r\nbe unmarried or a widower, his brothers and sisters succeed to half\r\nof the property and his parents to the other half. If none of these\r\nmembers of the family survive, the property is divided equally among\r\nthe ascendants in the paternal and maternal line. In this Canton,\r\nwhere the breeding of cattle forms so important an industry, certain\r\nlegislation closely allied to the occupation of the soil is worthy of a\r\npassing notice. This is known as _Cheptel_,--the contract by which one\r\nparty undertakes to supply another with a certain number of cattle to\r\ntend and feed under specified conditions. The _Cheptel_ is of several\r\nkinds. In one, the hirer has the right to the milk, work, and manure of\r\nthe cattle, the increase and loss being equally divided. It is illegal\r\nfor the two parties to enter into any contract by which the hirer\r\nundertakes to bear all losses. Then there is _Cheptel à moitié_,--where\r\ntwo owners of cattle, who do not possess a sufficient number to lease\r\nthem, each on his own account, join together and lease their stock to a\r\nthird party, sharing the profit and loss with him on the same condition\r\nand terms as in the case first described. The third class of _Cheptel_\r\nis where the tenant farmer rents the landlord’s cattle in conjunction\r\nwith the farm, on the condition of his taking all risks, and that\r\nwhen the lease expires he shall leave behind a herd of cattle of the\r\nsame value as that at which the original herd was estimated; all the\r\nprofits from these cattle go to the farmer until the lease expires;\r\nthe manure, however, belongs to the farm, and must be used for its\r\nexclusive benefit.\r\n\r\nIn the Canton of Basel the testator can only dispose of that part of\r\nhis estate which falls to his heirs. If those heirs be children, he may\r\nby will deprive them of at most one child’s interest or share, not in\r\nany case to exceed the fourth part of the entire estate. If the heirs\r\nbe parents, he can dispose of one-half of the estate, or more by the\r\nassent of the latter, written and properly authenticated. If the wife\r\nsurvives, she is entitled, in the absence of a marriage settlement,\r\nto two-thirds of the estate. A marriage settlement may entirely annul\r\nthe operation of the community of property which otherwise prevails.\r\nIn this case the entire estate of the deceased husband or wife falls\r\nto the heirs. Sons and daughters share alike. Brothers and sisters are\r\nregarded alike whether both or only one of the parents are the same.\r\nIn the absence of descendants, parents share equally as heirs; if one\r\nof the latter is deceased, the survivor takes the whole. Descendants\r\nof a deceased heir, who are within the fifth degree of consanguinity,\r\nshare equally the part which would have fallen to their ancestors.\r\nIllegitimate children inherit from the mother, but not from the father,\r\nunless legitimated by marriage of the parents.\r\n\r\nIn the Canton of St. Gallen a testator, in case he leaves but one\r\nchild, can dispose, by a will or otherwise, of one-half of the\r\nproperty; if two children, only one-third; and if three or more, not\r\nmore than one-fourth. In event of having no legal heirs, he may dispose\r\nof three-fourths of his property, the remaining one-fourth passing to\r\nthe Canton. If the heirs be father, mother, or other near relations,\r\nhe is not permitted to dispose by will of more than one-half. If there\r\nare relations beyond that degree, and within the tenth degree, he\r\nmay dispose of two-thirds. If the wife survives, she is entitled to\r\none-half the estate; however, if there be children also, then the wife\r\ntakes only a child’s part. Sons and daughters share alike, with this\r\nmodification: the sons have the preference of the real estate; tools\r\nand implements, if they are mechanics; books or libraries, if they are\r\nprofessional men; for which, however, they must pay a fair price to the\r\nother heirs. Two per cent. of all property disposed of by will goes to\r\nthe Canton. Any person eighteen years old and of disposing mind may\r\nmake a will. Every will must be attested by three witnesses, two of\r\nwhom must be able to write their names. A woman’s property brought into\r\nthe marriage remains her property; the interest only to be appropriated\r\nby the husband for the benefit of the family.\r\n\r\nIn the Canton of Zurich there is no limitation as to right of testator\r\nto dispose of his property by will, except as to interest of surviving\r\nwife. When the wife survives she is first entitled to withdraw the\r\nproperty she brought into the marriage, also the household furniture,\r\nin case it does not exceed one-fourth of the net estate; and if there\r\nbe children, she takes the usufruct of one-half of the estate, or the\r\nfee-simple of one-eighth; if there be no children, but parents of\r\nthe deceased living, she takes the usufruct of the whole estate, or\r\nfee-simple of one-fourth; if only grand-parents living, the fee-simple\r\nof one-half and the usufruct of the other half. If the wife marries,\r\nthe usufruct is reduced one-half. As to sons and daughters,--in\r\nthe father’s estate the sons have a preferred right to take the\r\nreal estate, with the appurtenances, against payment of a moderate\r\nvaluation; sons also have a preferred right to take the property\r\npertaining to the paternal industry, such as tools, professional\r\nimplements, cattle, etc., without, however, any deduction from the\r\nactual value thereof; sons take without compensation the paternal\r\nwardrobe, arms, outfit, and seal. Family records go to the oldest son\r\nwithout charge. The common paternal inheritance is divided equally\r\namong sons and daughters. In the maternal estate the clothing, house\r\nlinen, and washing utensils go to the daughters without charge; also\r\nthe jewelry, valuables, and savings of the mother, if they do not\r\nexceed in value five-one-hundredths of the estate, any excess over that\r\nmust be paid for by them. The common maternal inheritance is divided\r\nequally, but the sons have the preference of the real estate, against\r\npayment of its full value.\r\n\r\nIn the Canton of Geneva the code Napoleon, or _Code Civil Français_,\r\nsubstantially exists, that Canton having been a part of the French\r\n_Département du Léman_ from 1798 to 1814.\r\n\r\nThe notion of family co-proprietorship prevails extensively in the\r\nGerman Cantons, and testamentary power is much limited. In 1865 the\r\nCanton of Appenzell relaxed so far as to decree that it was an anomaly\r\nin this day of advanced civilization that a free citizen who enacted\r\nlaws for himself (referring to the Landsgemeinde of the Canton)\r\nshould be fettered, as in the benighted times of the past, in his\r\ntestamentary powers, and that, therefore, he should thenceforward have\r\nthe right to dispose by will of _one-fiftieth_ of his property, if he\r\nhad children, and of _one-twentieth_ if he had none. In the Canton\r\nof Zurich, previous to the Bluntschli’s code, those who had children\r\nwere obliged to leave them all their property, and, failing of issue,\r\nthe relations, of whatever degree, had a right to their legitimate\r\nshare. In Glarus the consent of the heirs is necessary before the\r\nsmallest legacy can be made by the testator. In the Canton of Nidwald\r\nthe question of the validity of a legacy is submitted to a jury, who\r\nare empowered to decide whether such legacy is just and in conformity\r\nwith the position of the testator, the testator’s children, and the\r\nlegatee. The three Cantons of Schaffhausen, Thurgau, and the Grisons,\r\nwhich place restrictions on the free disposal of inherited property,\r\nare more liberal as to acquired property. In Southern Switzerland,\r\nexcept in the Cantons of Freiburg and Valais, the law goes so far\r\nas absolutely to forbid special contracts made with regard to\r\nsuccessions,--except in the case of husband and wife,--so that the\r\ntestamentary power may remain free and untrammelled as to all property\r\nat the disposal of the testator when he comes to die. There is a\r\nmanifest tendency to facilitate the disposal by will of property in\r\ngeneral, in view of the more extended movements of the population, and\r\nthe consequent dispersion of family. The laws of enforced succession\r\nare being gradually modified or repealed. In point of fact, the Swiss\r\nlaws make little or no distinction between real, personal, and mixed\r\nproperty in connection with testamentary power, and there is a vast\r\ndissimilarity in the legislation and practice of the several Cantons.\r\nThrough all the varying degrees, in almost every Canton, there will\r\nbe found some limitation to parental freedom of bequest intervening\r\nfor the protection of the child. In some a distinction is made\r\nbetween inherited and acquired property, but it is the same principle\r\nasserting itself, the “_légitime_,” the portion secured by law to the\r\nheir,[64] over which the testator is forbidden to exercise the power of\r\ndisposition, and under the term “children,” by some cantonal codes, are\r\nincluded descendants of whatever degree, who, however, take together\r\nas representatives of the stock from which they spring. No such\r\nthing as a law of entail exists in any Canton. In reference to these\r\nrestraints on the power of bequeathing property by will, which at one\r\ntime existed in all the continental states, and in France restricted\r\nwithin the narrowest limits, Adam Smith wrote: “By interfering to so\r\nextreme an extent in the disposal of a man’s property, it lessens the\r\nmotives to accumulation; while, by rendering the children in a great\r\nmeasure independent, it weakens the parental authority, and has the\r\nsame mischievous operation over an entire family that the law of entail\r\nhas over a single child. This, however, is not its worst effect. This\r\nand every similar system inevitably tends to occasion too great an\r\nincrease of agricultural population, and to reduce landed property into\r\nportions so minute that they neither afford sufficient employment to\r\nthe families occupying them nor allow of their being cultivated and\r\nimproved in the best and most efficient manner.” A few Cantons have\r\nbecome alarmed at this infinitesimal subdivision of their soil, as\r\nprejudicial to agricultural enterprise and causing emigration to take\r\nplace from the pastoral districts. The Cantons of Aargau, Thurgau,\r\nand Solothurn have passed laws fixing the limit to the subdivision\r\nof land at a minimum ranging from five thousand to twenty thousand\r\nsquare feet. The excess to which subdivision may run is illustrated in\r\nthe Canton of Bern, where a case is reported of a cherry-tree in the\r\nOberland found to belong to seven different proprietors; and it is also\r\nrelated that the people of that section are distinguished for being so\r\nstiff-necked in sticking for their rights that an article of furniture\r\nhas been known to be sawed into so many parts that each member of a\r\nfamily might have his share. Notwithstanding the opinion of political\r\neconomists, the Swiss know that this subdivision has worked as an\r\nefficient auxiliary in making their soil a source of national comfort\r\nand well-being, and a barrier against land accumulation to prop up a\r\nruling class, so common in many of her neighbors. No sort of social\r\ndistinction or political privilege is associated with land-ownership in\r\nSwitzerland. The cultivator, who, as a rule, is the proprietor,--for it\r\nis rare to find a farm which is not worked by the owner,--is shorn by\r\nneither rent nor taxes. The land fulfils its duty and guarantees the\r\ntiller a fair enjoyment of the produce, a fair share in the sheaves\r\nhe reaps. Poets, historians, and philosophers, who love to dwell on\r\nthe simple virtues of the children of nature, find their Utopia in\r\nSwitzerland, where the households, each with its little tract of land,\r\nrepresent a larger proportion of the population than can be found\r\nin any other country. This distribution of small properties among\r\nthe peasantry forms a kind of rampart and safeguard for accumulated\r\nproperty in other forms. It may be called the lightning conductor that\r\naverts from society dangers which might otherwise lead to violent\r\ncatastrophes. The concentration of land in large estates among a small\r\nnumber of families, is a sort of provocation of levelling legislative\r\nmeasures. There are no influences more conservative, or more conducive\r\nto the maintenance of order in society, than those which facilitate\r\nthe acquirement of property in land by those who cultivate it,--“’Tis\r\nwonderful sweet to have something of one’s own.”\r\n\r\nThere is no influence fraught with more danger than that which\r\nconcentrates the ownership of the soil in the hands of the few, by\r\nimpediments, legal or fiscal, to prevent lands freely passing from\r\nthe hands of the idle into those of the industrious. Neither extreme\r\npoverty nor extreme opulence is the thing to be desired. Pauperism and\r\nplutocracy alike are the parents of vice in private and revolution\r\nin public life. The genius of revolution truly exclaims, “With\r\nwings twain do I fly;” of these wings one is discontented labor,\r\nthe other is over-reaching wealth. The system of the subdivision\r\nof the soil among a multitude of small proprietors, for the most\r\npart energetic, industrious cultivators of their own holdings, is\r\neminently conservative in its influence, and contributes in no small\r\ndegree towards maintaining the national spirit of independence and\r\nself-reliance, the happy and contented condition of the Swiss peasant\r\nproprietors; at once the strength and the safety of the Confederation.\r\nThis Swiss peasant has not only the responsibilities of a capitalist\r\non a small scale, but also those qualities of foresight, thrift, and\r\nsobriety that such responsibility inspires. He has his home with the\r\ndignity, stimulus, and all the civilizing influence of ownership.\r\n\r\n“A great proprietor is seldom a great improver.” Private appropriation\r\nof land is deemed to be beneficial; because the strongest interest\r\nwhich the community and the human race have in the land is that it\r\nshould yield the largest amount of necessary or useful things required\r\nby the community. The spectre of “excessive subdivision” of the soil,\r\nonce so potent an influence, has lost all its terror. It was Cobden\r\nwho wished to remove all remonstrances to the easy and economical\r\ntransfer of land, and to develop a process by which, under the natural\r\noperation of a free exchange, the laborer might be re-settled on the\r\nsoil from which, in his energetic and suggestive phrase, the “laborer\r\nhad been divorced.” It was Mill who, in his powerful chapters on\r\npeasant proprietors, clearly showed that “free trade in land” was the\r\ncondition under which the economic good of man can be best effected;\r\nthat a small or peasant proprietary is the most thriving, the most\r\nindustrious, the most thrifty of cultivators, and that under small\r\nfree holdings the capacities of the soil are developed to the fullest\r\npossible extent, and the rate of production raised to the very largest\r\namount. Those who fancied that peasant proprietors must be wretched\r\ncultivators have seen that some of the best agriculture in the world\r\nis to be found in Switzerland, where such properties abound.[65]\r\nThese peasant proprietorships have neither bred over-population nor\r\nconverted the country into a “pauper warren.” The existence of peasant\r\nproperties has come to be regarded by philanthropists as eminently\r\ndesirable, and the removal of all obstacles to it has become an aim of\r\nadvanced politicians. Daniel Webster, in an address delivered before\r\nthe Massachusetts Constitutional Convention in 1821, referring to the\r\nrelation of civil liberty to property, as regards its security and\r\ndistribution and that the degree of its distribution settles the form\r\nof government,--aristocratic, if the property is held by the few, and\r\npopular, if held by the many,--said in reference to France: “A most\r\ninteresting experiment, on the effect of a subdivision of property,\r\nis now making in France. It is understood that the law regulating the\r\ntransmission of property in that country now divides it, real and\r\npersonal, among all the children equally, both sons and daughters;\r\nand that is, also, a very great restraint on the power of making\r\ndispositions of property by will. It has been supposed, that the effect\r\nof this might probably be, in time, to break up the soil into such\r\nsmall subdivisions, that the proprietors would be too poor to resist\r\nthe encroachments of executive power. I think far otherwise. In respect\r\nto this recent law of succession in France, I would, presumptuously\r\nperhaps, hazard a conjecture, that if the government do not change\r\nthe law, the law in half a century will change the government; and\r\nthat this change will be, not in favor of the crown, as some European\r\nwriters have supposed, but against it. These writers only reason\r\nupon what they think correct general principles in relation to this\r\nsubject. They acknowledge a want of experience. Here we have had the\r\nexperience; and we know that a multitude of small proprietors, acting\r\nwith intelligence, and that enthusiasm which a common cause inspires,\r\nconstitute not only a formidable, but an invincible power.”\r\n\r\nJust fifty years from the date of Mr. Webster’s prophecy the present\r\nrepublic was set up,--the government not having changed the law, the\r\nlaw changed the government. It is this race of peasant proprietors\r\nthat has given France her wonderful recuperative power, enabling\r\nher to emerge again and again _per varios casus, per tot discrimina\r\nrerum_. From them her national life receives a vigor and unity which no\r\nreverses seem to dominate and no blunders to ruin. Upon them she must\r\nrely for the maintenance of her liberties, so gloriously conquered in\r\nthe past and embodied in her present institutions.\r\n\r\nIf men have but some share of comfort and property in the country,\r\nthey will abide there, for that is really the place provided for them.\r\n“Towns, the haunt of pride, luxury, and inequality, foster the spirit\r\nof revolt: the country begets calm and concord, the spirit of order and\r\ntradition.” Under the old Roman system the city was the important unit;\r\nunder the Teutonic element the land was brought into prominence and\r\nthe possessor of it into power. The dominant member of society was the\r\nlandowner and not the citizen. In ancient society the “citizen” need\r\nown no land; in the modern society of the feudal age the “gentleman”\r\ncould not be such without owning land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nMILITARY SERVICE AND ORGANIZATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttached alike to liberty and to arms, the Swiss are no less famous\r\nfor their undaunted intrepidity than their simple and pure democracy.\r\nFrom early times the hardy mountaineers of the Alps were eminently and\r\nsplendidly martial. History is full of their steadiness and bravery on\r\nthe field of battle. When Rome was in its highest military glory, its\r\narmies under the Consul Lucius Cassius were routed by the Helvetians\r\non the shores of Lake Leman, 111 B.C. The two armies are supposed to\r\nhave met about where the Rhone falls into the lake, and the conquerors\r\nof all Italy, the masters of Greece and Macedonia, who had carried\r\ntheir victorious armies over Asia and Africa, were overcome by a people\r\nhitherto unknown. Julius Cæsar speaks of their “military virtue and\r\nconstant warfare with the Germans.” Livy and Tacitus refer to them as\r\na people originally of the Gallic nation, “renowned for their valor\r\nand their exploits in war.” About the middle of the fourteenth century\r\nattention began to be attracted towards these mountaineers, and great\r\nwas the wonder that cavalry, which made the only effective part of the\r\nfederal armies of those ages, should be routed by men on foot; that\r\nwarriors sheathed in complete steel should be overpowered by naked\r\npeasants who wore no defensive armor, and were irregularly provided\r\nwith pikes, halberds, and clubs, for the purposes of attack; above all,\r\nit seemed a species of miracle that knights and nobles of the highest\r\nbirth should be defeated by mountaineers and shepherds. The repeated\r\nvictories of the Swiss over troops having on their side numbers and\r\ndiscipline, and the advantage of the most perfect military equipment\r\nthen known and confided in, plainly intimated that a new principle\r\nof civil organization as well as of military movements had arisen\r\namid the stormy regions of Helvetia. The signal victory over Charles\r\nthe Bold of Burgundy, in which they routed the celebrated Burgundian\r\n_ordonnance_, constituting the finest body of chivalry of Europe,\r\ndemonstrated their capacity as infantry. This, no doubt, contributed\r\nto the formation of that invincible Spanish infantry which, under the\r\nGreat Captain and his successors, may be said to have decided the fate\r\nof Europe for more than half a century. The “Swiss whiskered Infantry”\r\nbecame distinguished in all the continental wars by pre-eminent valor\r\nand discipline. Their principal weapon was a pike about eighteen feet\r\nlong; and, forming in solid battalions, which, bristling with spears\r\nall around, received the technical appellation of the _hedgehog_, they\r\npresented an invulnerable front on every quarter, and received unshaken\r\nthe most desperate charges of the steel-clad cavalry on their terrible\r\narray of pikes. In the Granadine war (1484), among the volunteers that\r\nflocked to the Spanish camp was a corps of Swiss infantry, who are thus\r\nsimply described by Pulgar: “There joined the royal standard a body of\r\nmen from Switzerland, a country in upper Germany; these men were bold\r\nof heart and fought on foot. As they were resolved never to turn their\r\nbacks upon the enemy, they wore no defensive armor except in front,\r\nby which means they were less encumbered in fight.” The astonishing\r\nsuccess of the French in the Italian wars (1494) was largely imputable\r\nto the free use and admirable organization of their infantry, whose\r\nstrength lay in the Swiss soldiers they had. Machiavelli ascribes\r\nthe misfortunes of his nation chiefly to its exclusive reliance on\r\ncavalry; this service, during the whole of the Middle Ages, being\r\nconsidered among the European nations so important that the horse\r\nwas styled by way of eminence “the battle.” The arms and discipline\r\nof the Swiss were necessarily different from those of other European\r\nnations. The hill-sides and the mountain-tops and the deep valleys of\r\nSwitzerland have felt as frequently as any part of Europe the mailed\r\nfootstep of the warrior, and run as red with his blood. Zschokke, in\r\nhis history, remarks that, in its wars of the last five hundred years,\r\nbut particularly those growing out of the great French revolution,\r\n“battle-field touched battle-field.” During the long struggle for their\r\nliberties, they found that their poverty, with at that time a barren\r\nand ill-cultivated country, put it out of their power to bring into\r\nthe field any body of horse capable of facing the enemy. Necessity\r\ncompelled them to place all their confidence in infantry. With\r\nbreastplates and helmets as defensive armor, together with long spears,\r\nhalberds, and heavy swords as weapons of offence, they formed into\r\nlarge battalions, ranged in deep and close array, presenting on every\r\nside a formidable front to the enemy. They repulsed the Austrians,\r\nthey broke the Burgundian Gendarmerie, and, when called to Italy, bore\r\ndown with irresistible force every enemy that attempted to oppose\r\nthem. Bacon, in his “History of King Henry VII.,” says: “To make good\r\ninfantry, it required men bred not in a servile fashion but in some\r\nfree manner. Therefore, if a state run most to noblemen and gentlemen,\r\nand that the husbandmen and ploughmen be but as their workfolks or\r\nlaborers, you may have a good cavalry, but never good, stable bands\r\nof foot, in so much as they are enforced to employ bands of Swiss for\r\ntheir battalions of foot.” It was a trusty sword these brave and hardy\r\npeasants offered. Some thought that nature certainly only meant the\r\nSwiss for two classes, soldiers and shepherds. It is easy to convert\r\nhusbandmen into good soldiers. According to the institutions of the\r\nLacedæmonians, the employments of husbandmen and soldiers were united,\r\nas alike the highest training-schools for the qualities that make the\r\nbest citizen and the best soldier. The plough was readily exchanged\r\nfor the sword by those engaged in peaceful occupations that seemed\r\nto place them at an immeasurable distance from the profession of a\r\nsoldier. Happy had it been for Switzerland had she gained nothing\r\nbeyond simple liberty in her contest with her ancient masters, and\r\nhad continued to cherish pure and healthful feelings. When peace had\r\ncrowned their heroic struggles, their warlike spirit sought in foreign\r\nstates the excitement and military glory which were denied them at\r\nhome. The cravings of avarice and the thirst of plunder are inseparable\r\nfrom the pride of victory. While the hardy mountaineers exulted in\r\nthe defeat and humiliation of Austrian chivalry, they purchased their\r\ntriumph, for a time at least, at the expense of the simplicity of their\r\nnature. They accepted the dangers and privations of soldiers fighting\r\nbattles in which their own country bore no part. They became the ready\r\nagents of the highest paymaster. These military capitulations dated\r\nfrom the period of the Burgundian war. Treaties were often concluded\r\nbetween foreign governments and one or more Cantons.[66] They made a\r\ntrade of war, letting themselves out as mercenaries. The Holy Father\r\nhimself entered the list of bargainers, and in 1503 Pope Julius III.\r\nengaged the first of those Swiss life-guards whose name became famous\r\nin Europe. From Louis XI. to Louis XV. the Swiss are said to have\r\nfurnished for the French service over half a million men. In the wars\r\nbetween the French king and the Emperor Maximilian, in 1516, the\r\nSwiss fought on both sides. In its last extremity, it was neither\r\nin its titled nobility nor its native armies that the French throne\r\nfound fidelity, but in the free-born peasant soldiers of Luzern. Of\r\nthe undaunted ranks of the Swiss guard, defending the French royal\r\nfamily at the Tuileries on the 10th of August, 1792, seven hundred and\r\neighty-six officers and soldiers fell in the place where they stood,\r\nunconquered even in death; and for two days their bodies lay in the\r\ngardens of the palace and the streets near by, exposed to the derision\r\nand insults of the frantic populace.\r\n\r\n  “Go, stranger! and at Lacedæmon tell\r\n  That here, obedient to her laws, we fell.”\r\n\r\nTo their memory a colossal lion, twenty-eight feet long by eighteen\r\nfeet high, carved by Thorwaldsen out of the face of a solid sandstone\r\nrock, in high relief, was dedicated in 1821 at Luzern. The lion is\r\nholding the _fleur-de-lis_ in his paws, which he is endeavoring to\r\nprotect, though mortally wounded by a spear which still remains in\r\nhis side. Above the figure is the inscription: “_Helvetiorum fidei\r\nac virtuti_.” When the afternoon sun falls upon this effigy, it is\r\nreflected beautifully in the dark pool close below; the gray rock rises\r\nperpendicularly some little height above and ends in a crown of acacias\r\nand drooping bushes and creepers.\r\n\r\nThe fame of the Swiss, in every war which desolated Europe from the\r\nfifteenth century down, rose to an extraordinary pitch; but this\r\ninfluence, which, as the hired soldiers of belligerent powers, they\r\nexercised in the affairs of Europe, was neither conducive to the weal\r\nof the state nor worthy of the Swiss people. Addison wrote in 1709 of\r\nthem: “The inhabitants of the country are as great curiosities as the\r\ncountry itself; they generally hire themselves out in their youth, and\r\nif they are musket-proof till about fifty, they bring home the money\r\nthey have got, and the limbs they have left, to pass the rest of their\r\ntime among their native mountains.” He also relates that “one of the\r\ngentlemen of the place told me, by way of boast, that there were now\r\nseven wooden legs in his family; and that for these four generations\r\nthere had not been one in his line that carried a whole body with him\r\nto the grave.”\r\n\r\nFrom their being so frequently in the personal service of foreign\r\npotentates, the name of Switzer with some writers became synonymous\r\nwith guards or attendants on a king. The king in “Hamlet” says: “Where\r\nare my Switzers? Let them guard the door.” In 1594, Nashe, in his\r\n“Christ’s Tears over Jerusalem,” states that “Law, Logicke, and the\r\nSwitzers may be hired to fight for anybody.” Even the French were\r\nso ungrateful as to chide the Swiss by saying, “We fight for honor,\r\nbut you fight for money;” to which the Switzer rejoined, “It is only\r\nnatural that each of us, like the rest of the world, should fight for\r\nwhat he has not got.” These Swiss soldiers were in great demand and\r\nliberally paid. They were not only hardy and patient of fatigue, but\r\nbold in action and obedient in discipline. The very sight of them\r\nalarmed the enemy, suggesting a passage in Tacitus of which every\r\nsoldier will probably feel the truth, “The eye is the first to be\r\nvanquished in battle.”[67] Then these troops were as noted for their\r\nfidelity to the service they engaged in as for their courage; and in\r\nall their history there is scarce to be found any example of treachery.\r\n\r\nFrom the dawn of the Reformation there was produced a material\r\nchange, and its effects were chiefly visible in the improvement of\r\nmoral feeling and the growing aversion to this mercenary service. The\r\nConstitution of 1848 altogether swept away this system of military\r\ncapitulations. At the time of the adoption of the constitution there\r\nwas only one such convention in force, being that of the King of\r\nNaples and several of the Cantons; but public sentiment was so greatly\r\naroused by their participation in the defeat of the revolution, that\r\nthe Cantons were compelled to recall them, and thus the last of these\r\ncapitulations came to an end. There were certain bodies of troops who,\r\nbearing the Swiss name or composed for the most part of Swiss soldiers,\r\nstill continued to fight for foreign governments; and to prevent this,\r\nas far as possible, a federal law in 1859 prohibited every Swiss\r\ncitizen from entering, without the consent of the Federal Council,\r\nthose bodies of foreign troops which were not regarded as national\r\ntroops of the respective states. This did not hinder individual\r\ncitizens from enrolling themselves in the national troops of a foreign\r\nstate. To further avoid any complication of foreign relations through\r\nsuch military connection, the cantonal constitutions first forbade the\r\nreception of pensions and titles from foreign states; and a similar\r\nprovision was embodied in the federal Constitution of 1874, whereby\r\n“members of the federal government, civil and military officials of the\r\nConfederation, and federal representatives or commissioners, shall not\r\naccept from foreign governments any pension, salary, title, present,\r\nor decoration. Decorations shall not be worn in the Swiss army, nor\r\nshall titles conferred by foreign governments be borne. Every officer,\r\nunder-officer, and soldier shall be forbidden to accept any such\r\ndistinction.”\r\n\r\nThe first approach towards the establishment of a federal army\r\nwas after Swiss independence had been recognized at the peace of\r\nWestphalia, when the Confederation in 1648 adopted an arrangement\r\ncalled the “_Defensional_,” by which, in case of urgent danger, the\r\nFederal Diet could call upon the several Cantons to supply troops for\r\nthe general defence, in such numbers as were stipulated. In 1848 it\r\nwas proposed that the Confederation should be charged with the entire\r\nmilitary administration. This was rejected. In 1874 the effort was\r\nrenewed, and this most important power was substantially vested in the\r\nConfederation by the constitution adopted that year, which contains the\r\nfollowing provisions:\r\n\r\nEvery Swiss is subject to military service. Each soldier receives\r\nwithout expense his first equipment, clothing, and arms. The arms\r\nremain in possession of the soldier, under conditions prescribed by\r\nfederal legislation. The Confederation enacts uniform laws on fees for\r\nexemption from military service:\r\n\r\nThe federal army consists:\r\n\r\n1. Of the cantonal military corps.\r\n\r\n2. Of all Swiss who, though not belonging to such military corps, are\r\nyet subject to military service.\r\n\r\nThe Confederation exercises control over the federal army and the\r\nmaterial of war provided by law.\r\n\r\nIn cases of danger, the Confederation has the exclusive and direct\r\ncontrol over all troops, whether incorporated in the federal army or\r\nnot, and over all other military resources of the Cantons.\r\n\r\nThe Cantons may exercise control over the military forces of their\r\nterritory, so far as this right is not limited by the federal\r\nconstitution or laws.\r\n\r\nLaws on the organization of the army are an affair of the\r\nConfederation. The execution of the military laws within the Cantons is\r\nintrusted to the cantonal authorities, within limits fixed by federal\r\nlegislation, and under the supervision of the Confederation.\r\n\r\nThe entire military instruction and arming of the troops are under\r\nthe control of the Confederation. The clothing and equipments and\r\nsubsistence of the troops are provided by the Cantons; but the Cantons\r\nare credited with the expenses therefor, in a manner to be determined\r\nby federal law.\r\n\r\nSo far as military reasons do not prevent, bodies of troops are\r\nformed out of the soldiers from the same Canton. The composition of\r\nthese bodies of troops, the maintenance of their effective strength,\r\nand the appointment and promotion of the officers are to be reserved\r\nto the Cantons, subject to general rules to be established by the\r\nConfederation.\r\n\r\nOn payment of reasonable indemnity, the Confederation has the right\r\nto use or acquire drill-grounds and buildings intended for military\r\npurposes within the Cantons, together with the appurtenances thereof.\r\nThe terms of the indemnity shall be fixed by federal law. The Federal\r\nAssembly may forbid public works which endanger the military interests\r\nof the Confederation.\r\n\r\nNo decoration or title conferred by a foreign government shall be\r\nborne in the federal army. No officer, nor non-commissioned officer or\r\nsoldier, shall accept such distinction.\r\n\r\nThe Confederation has no right to keep up a standing army.[68]\r\nNo Canton or half-Canton, without the permission of the federal\r\ngovernment, shall keep up a standing force of more than three hundred\r\nmen; the mounted police (_gendarmerie_) is not included in this number.\r\n\r\nBy these provisions, while the military system, as a whole, has fallen\r\nunder the authority of the Confederation, many important details are\r\nleft to be exercised by the Cantons. Upon them devolves the responsible\r\nduty of carrying the federal laws into execution. They appoint all\r\nofficers below the rank of colonel, keep the military registers,\r\nprovide the equipments, uniforms, and necessary stores for the troops\r\n(to be reimbursed by the Confederation), recruit and maintain the\r\neffective strength of the body of troops formed within their respective\r\nlimits. The infantry, field artillery, and cavalry are all recruited by\r\nthe Cantons and called cantonal troops; the engineers, guides, sanitary\r\nand administrative troops, and the army train are recruited by the\r\nConfederation and called federal troops. The enrolling of men belonging\r\nto the same Canton, as far as practicable, in the same corps is known\r\nas the _système territorial_. Every man fights under the banner of\r\nhis own Canton, follows the regiment of his own Commune, keeps step\r\nwith the company of his own hamlet, or dies beside his brother,\r\nson, or neighbor. These were the tactics of nature, and probably of\r\nheroism, with mutual enthusiasm and reciprocal attachments, with common\r\ninterests and similarity of manners; like the children of Israel who\r\nwent out to battle, each “under the colors of the house of his father.”\r\n\r\nFor the proper execution and furtherance of the constitutional\r\nprovisions, several federal laws have been enacted, establishing these\r\ngeneral rules:\r\n\r\nEvery Swiss citizen is subject to military service from the time he\r\nenters his twentieth year to the close of his forty-fourth year of age.\r\nThere are seven classifications of officials who are exempted, during\r\nthe time they are in office or employed:\r\n\r\n1. Members of the Federal Assembly during the session of the Assembly.\r\n\r\n2. Members of the Federal Council, the Chancellor of the Confederation,\r\nand the clerks of the Federal Tribunal.\r\n\r\n3. Those employed in the administration of the post and telegraph (the\r\nlatter now includes the telephone); employés in government arsenals,\r\nworkshops, and powder magazines; directors and wardens of prisons;\r\nattendants in public hospitals; members of cantonal and communal\r\npolice, and frontier guards, or _Landjäger_.\r\n\r\n4. Ecclesiastics who do not act as army chaplains.\r\n\r\n5. Those employed in the public schools, only so far as it would\r\ninterrupt their school duties.\r\n\r\n6. Railroad officials and employés of the steamboat companies that have\r\nreceived concessions from the government.\r\n\r\n7. All those who have been deprived of their civil rights by sentence\r\nof court are excluded from the service.\r\n\r\nThe omission of the members of the Federal Tribunal from the list of\r\nexempts, while the executive and legislative officials, together with\r\nthe clerks of the Tribunal, are embraced, can be accounted for only\r\nupon the principle of _inter arma silent leges_.\r\n\r\nWhen a Swiss citizen reaches his twentieth year he must present himself\r\nat the levy of troops of the Canton of his domicile and be enrolled.\r\nThis must be done before an application for exemption can be made. The\r\nraw recruits are sent direct to one of the _Écoles des Recrues_, for\r\nwhich the Confederation is divided into eight territorial departments,\r\nfor infantry, for cavalry and artillery, three each, and two for\r\nengineers. The federal military forces, or _Bundesauszug_, are divided\r\ninto three distinct classes:\r\n\r\n1. The _Élite_ or active army, in which all citizens are liable to\r\nserve from the age of twenty to thirty-two.\r\n\r\n2. The _Landwehr_ or first reserve, composed of men from the age of\r\nthirty-two to forty-four.\r\n\r\n3. The _Landsturm_, consisting of men from seventeen to fifty, not\r\nincorporated in the _Élite_ or _Landwehr_. This last reserve cannot,\r\nas a rule, be called upon for service beyond the frontier. Men are not\r\ndischarged from the _Élite_ until their successors have been enrolled,\r\nand in case of war the Federal Council is authorized to suspend\r\ndischarges both from the _Élite_ and the _Landwehr_. The recruits at\r\nthe _Écoles des Recrues_ undergo a course of instruction for periods\r\nranging from forty-five to eighty days, after which they are drafted\r\ninto the different arms of the service, and (with the exception of the\r\ncavalry, who turn out annually) are called out on alternate years for a\r\ncourse of training (_cours de répétition_), continuing from sixteen to\r\ntwenty days. Periodically, once or twice a year, the troops of a number\r\nof Cantons assemble for a general muster. The infantry soldier has five\r\nperiods of training during the ten years he remains in the _Élite_ or\r\nactive service:\r\n\r\nFirst year, forty-five days as a recruit.\r\n\r\nThird year, sixteen days as a trained soldier.\r\n\r\nFifth year, sixteen days as a trained soldier.\r\n\r\nSeventh year, sixteen days as a trained soldier.\r\n\r\nNinth year, sixteen days as a trained soldier.\r\n\r\nTotal, one hundred and nine days.\r\n\r\nThe cavalry is called out annually instead of biennially, and as a\r\ncompensation for this additional drill service, the men are discharged\r\nfrom the _Élite_ two years sooner than the infantry, or at the age of\r\nthirty.\r\n\r\nThe standard of height required of the recruit is five feet one\r\nand a half inches, and the chest measurement in no case less than\r\nthirty-one and a half inches.[69] Men not of the required height,\r\nif specially fitted, by profession or business, for service in the\r\nadministrative troops or as drummers, trumpeters, armorers, or other\r\nmilitary handicraftsmen, may be recruited to serve in these capacities\r\nif their height is not less than five feet five-eighths of an inch. The\r\nnumber of recruits examined annually--that is to say, the number of\r\nyoung men who become subject every year to military service--is about\r\nthirty thousand. A permanent corps of one hundred and eighty-seven\r\ninstructors of various grades, and representing all the arms of the\r\nservice, is maintained. The members of this corps are about the only\r\npermanently paid officers of the Swiss army. But they must have\r\nundergone a thorough course of education and passed an examination at\r\none of the training establishments erected for the purpose. The centre\r\nof these is the military academy at Thun, near Bern, maintained by the\r\nConfederation, and which supplies the army both with the highest class\r\nof officers and with teachers to instruct the lower grades.\r\n\r\nBesides this academy or _Central Militär-Schule_ there are special\r\ntraining-schools for the various branches of the service, especially\r\nthe artillery and the _Scharfschützen_ or picked riflemen. During the\r\nperiod of instruction eight hours is laid down as the minimum of daily\r\ndrilling. The arms, clothing, and personal accoutrements remain in the\r\npossession of the soldier, and he is expected to keep each article\r\nin good condition and in readiness for inspection at any moment; and\r\nhe is not permitted to wear his uniform except when on active duty.\r\nThe inspection of arms, accoutrements, etc., is made annually, and is\r\nconducted with much strictness; any repairs needed are ordered to be\r\ndone at the owner’s expense; and negligence in complying with the law\r\nsubjects the party to a fine, and in some instances to imprisonment. At\r\nthe termination of the _Élite_ service, the uniform is retained by the\r\nrecruit, but the arms and accoutrements are surrendered to the Canton.\r\nHorses are provided for the cavalry in this manner: the horses are\r\nfirst purchased by the government through officers designated for that\r\npurpose; these are sent to the government cavalry stable, thoroughly\r\nbroken, then sold to such cavalry recruits as may require them. The\r\nsale is made at public auction to the recruits, and one-half of the\r\nprice at which the animal is knocked down is paid by the Confederation\r\nand the other half by the recruit. One-tenth of the recruit’s share,\r\nhowever, is refunded to him at the end of each year’s service, so that\r\nafter ten trainings the horse becomes his personal property. During the\r\nyears of service the horse remains at the disposal of the government,\r\nbut in fact is only required during the annual drill, and in the\r\ninterval remains in the possession of its part owner, at his own cost.\r\nHe may work the animal, but it cannot be let out for hire or lent,\r\nand he is responsible for its care and good condition. If the horse\r\ndies in the service, one-half of the value of the recruit’s share is\r\nrefunded to him; if, on the other hand, the horse dies when not in the\r\nservice, the recruit pays the government a corresponding amount, unless\r\nhe can show that the death was in no way occasioned by carelessness or\r\nculpable negligence. The same liability is incurred in case of injury\r\nto the animal, unless it occurred from ordinary fair usage. In either\r\ncase, if the recruit be found in fault he is compelled to provide\r\nhimself with another horse. These horses are inspected at least once\r\na year by military veterinary surgeons. Mounted officers must provide\r\ntheir own horses. In time of war the _Piketstellung_ can be declared\r\nby the Federal Council, by which the sale of horses throughout the\r\nConfederation is forbidden.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the several lines of the army in 1888, as obtained\r\nfrom an official of the military department, was--_Élite_, 117,179,\r\n_Landwehr_, 84,046, which, with the _Landsturm_, reckoned at 200,000,\r\ngave in case of extreme emergency an available force of 401,225.\r\n\r\nThe _Landsturm_ has recently been divided into two classes, the _armed\r\nLandsturm_ and the _auxiliary forces_; the latter is composed of\r\npioneers, administrative troops, guides, and velocipedists: both of\r\nthese classes, under a federal law of 1887, when called out, are placed\r\non the same footing, with reference to the rights of combatants, as\r\nthe _Élite_ or the _Landwehr_. The first line, or _Élite_, must be\r\nregarded as the only active force homogeneous in its parts and complete\r\nin its equipment. Preference for infantry is still preserved among the\r\nSwiss, the cavalry representing only one twenty-seventh of the force.\r\nThis disproportion may be somewhat ascribed to two facts: first, on\r\naccount of the expense involved in the advance payment to be made on\r\nthe purchase of a horse, and then that in Switzerland cavalry would\r\nhardly ever be required except for reconnoitring or vedette duties. The\r\nelection on the part of recruits to join the cavalry is voluntary; but\r\nhaving selected that branch they must remain in it.\r\n\r\nThe Vetterli rifle, with a magazine containing eleven cartridges,\r\nhas been used by the army; but after long and thorough experiments\r\nunder government expert commissions with the Rubin rifle, a later and\r\nimproved patent, in June, 1889, it was accepted, and is being rapidly\r\nsubstituted. The budget for 1890 contains an appropriation of 5,734,600\r\nfrancs for the purchase of these rifles and 3,000,000 francs for\r\nammunition.\r\n\r\nThe highest rank in the Swiss army is that of colonel. In the event of\r\nwar the Federal Assembly nominates a general, who takes command till\r\nthe troops are disbanded. The only officer at present in the service\r\nwho has held that temporary rank is General Herzog, the commander of\r\nthe troops in 1871, and who is now doing regular duty as a colonel.\r\nThen come lieutenant-colonel, major, captain, and first lieutenant;\r\nthese constitute the commissioned officers. The non-commissioned\r\nofficers are sergeant-major, quartermaster-sergeant, sergeant, and\r\ncorporal. Colonels command divisions and brigades; lieutenant-colonels,\r\nregiments; majors, battalions; and captains, companies. The Cantons\r\nnominate officers up to the rank of _commandant de bataillon_, subject\r\nto the approval of the federal military authorities. Officers of\r\nhigher rank than _commandant de bataillon_ hold their commissions from\r\nthe Federal Council. Then there is a general staff or _État major_,\r\nappointed by the Federal Council, consisting of three colonels, sixteen\r\nlieutenant-colonels or majors, and thirty-five captains. The chief of\r\nthis staff is appointed by the Council for a term of three years, and\r\nis practically in charge of the forces during peace.\r\n\r\nThe pay of the army, like all branches of public service in\r\nSwitzerland, is on a very economical scale. With the exception of\r\nthe members of the general staff and corps of instructors (the\r\nformer substantially constitutes the latter), who are permanently in\r\nthe service, officers and privates only receive pay during active\r\nservice,--that is, during the short drill periods or in time of war.\r\nThe commander-in-chief (who only serves in time of war) receives fifty\r\nfrancs per day.\r\n\r\n                                             Francs.\r\n  Colonel commanding division receives         30\r\n  Colonel commanding brigade     ”             25\r\n  Colonel                        ”             20\r\n  Lieutenant-Colonel             ”             15\r\n  Major                          ”             12\r\n  Captain                        ”             10\r\n  First Lieutenant               ”              8\r\n  Second Lieutenant              ”              7\r\n\r\nPersonal allowance for uniform and equipments:\r\n\r\n                                            Francs.\r\n  For officers not mounted                    200\r\n  For officers mounted                        250\r\n  For equipment of horses                     250\r\n\r\nThe private soldiers are paid eighty centimes per day, and from this a\r\nsum, to be fixed by the chief of the corps, is deducted to meet certain\r\ncontingent personal expenses of the private. Rations in the field\r\ndaily embrace 750 grammes of bread; 375 of fresh meat; 150 to 200 of\r\nvegetables; 20 of salt; 15 of roasted coffee; 20 of sugar. Commutation\r\nto officers is one franc per day. If a private furnishes his own\r\ncoffee, vegetables, and wood, a proportionate allowance is fixed by the\r\nFederal Council. The rations are the same during the drilling terms,\r\nbut the pay is reduced to fifty centimes per day. The constitution\r\ndeclares that “soldiers who lose their lives or suffer permanent injury\r\nto their health in consequence of federal military service shall be\r\nentitled to aid from the Confederation for themselves or their families\r\nin case of need.”\r\n\r\nA federal law grants pensions:\r\n\r\n1. Up to 1200 francs in case of complete blindness, the loss of both\r\nhands, or both feet, or other injury causing absolute incapacity to\r\nearn a living.\r\n\r\n2. Up to 700 francs in case of partial incapacity for work.\r\n\r\n3. Up to 400 francs in case where business or calling must be changed\r\nto one less profitable, in consequence of injury.\r\n\r\n4. Up to 200 francs when this change is necessitated in a modified\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nPensions to widow, children, or parent:\r\n\r\n1. Widow without children up to 350 francs; with children up to 650\r\nfrancs.\r\n\r\n2. Children one or two, each 250 francs; more than two, total of 650\r\nfrancs.\r\n\r\n3. Father or mother (where no widow or children), 200 francs; if both\r\nliving, total of 350 francs.\r\n\r\n4. Each brother or sister (when neither widow, children, nor parent\r\nsurvive), 100 francs each.\r\n\r\n5. Grandfather or grandmother (where neither widow, children, parents,\r\nnor brother or sister survive), 150 francs; if both living, 250 francs\r\ntotal.\r\n\r\nThese amounts may be increased in special and meritorious cases. Women\r\ndivorced or living apart from their husbands, and children eighteen\r\nyears of age, are not entitled to receive pensions.\r\n\r\nEvery Swiss citizen subject to military service, whether he resides\r\nin the Confederation or not, who does not personally perform it, is\r\nsubject in lieu thereof to the payment of an annual tax in money.\r\nForeigners established in Switzerland are likewise subject to this tax,\r\nunless they are exempt therefrom by virtue of international treaties or\r\nbelong to states in which the Swiss domiciled there are neither liable\r\nto military service nor to the payment of any equivalent tax in money.\r\nThis is the only direct tax levied in the Confederation; and the gross\r\nsum realized is shared proportionately between the Confederation and\r\nthe Canton.\r\n\r\nExempt from this tax are:\r\n\r\n1. Paupers assisted by the public charity fund, and those who by\r\nreason of mental or physical infirmity are incapable of earning their\r\nsubsistence, or who have not a sufficient fortune for the support of\r\nthemselves and family.\r\n\r\n2. Those rendered unfit through previous service.\r\n\r\n3. Swiss citizens in foreign countries, if they are subject to a\r\npersonal service or to an exemption tax for the same in place of\r\ndomicile.\r\n\r\n4. The railway and steamboat employés during the time when they are\r\nliable to the military service organized for the working of the\r\nrailways and steamboats in time of war.\r\n\r\n5. Policemen and the federal frontier guards.\r\n\r\nThis military tax consists in a personal tax of six francs, and of\r\nan additional tax on property and income; the amount exacted from any\r\none tax-payer not to exceed 3000 francs per annum. The additional tax\r\nis one franc and a half for each one thousand francs of net fortune,\r\nand one franc and a half for each one hundred francs of net income.\r\nNet fortunes less than 1000 francs are exempt, and from the net income\r\nare to be deducted 600 francs. Net fortune is the personal and real\r\nproperty after deducting debts of record, chattels necessary for\r\nhousehold, tools of trade, and agricultural implements. Real estate and\r\nimprovements are assessed for this tax at three-fourths of their market\r\nvalue. In computing the property of a person for this tax, half of the\r\nfortune of the parents, or if not living, then of the grand-parents, is\r\nincluded, proportionately to the number of children or grandchildren,\r\nunless the father of the tax-payer shall himself perform military\r\nservice or pay the exemption tax.\r\n\r\nNet income embraces:\r\n\r\n1. The earnings of an art, profession, trade, business, occupation,\r\nor employment. The expenses incurred to obtain these earnings are\r\ndeducted, also necessary household expenses, and five per cent. of the\r\ncapital invested in the business.\r\n\r\n2. The product of annuities, pensions, and other similar revenues.\r\n\r\nFrom the age of thirty-three to the completion of the military age,\r\nonly one-half of the tax is exacted. The Federal Assembly has the\r\nright to increase the tax to double the amount for those years in\r\nwhich the greater part of the _Élite_ troops are called into service.\r\nThe military tax for Swiss citizens residing abroad is calculated\r\nevery year by special rolls, and the persons advised by the officials\r\nof the Canton of their birth, if their address be known, otherwise\r\nby public advertisement. The tax for exemption is paid in the Canton\r\nwhere the tax-payer is domiciled when the rolls are prepared. Parents\r\nare responsible for the payment of the tax for their minor sons, and\r\nfor those sons who, though of age, remain a part of the household. The\r\nperiod for prescription is five years for tax-payers present in the\r\ncountry, and ten years for those absent from the country. The Cantons\r\nare charged with making out the annual rolls and collecting the tax.\r\nBy the end of January following the year of the tax the Cantons must\r\nremit to the proper federal official the half of the gross product\r\ncollected. A portion of this is assigned by the Federal Assembly to\r\nthe fund for military pensions. In each Canton there is a tribunal\r\nto pass upon appeals on the correctness of the rolls of tax-payers.\r\nAll disputes arising as to the tax are referred to and decided by\r\nthe Federal Council. With a view of insuring a uniform application\r\nof the law of military service, the Confederation reserves supreme\r\nsupervision; and the ultimate decision upon all questions arising out\r\nof the operation of it, and likewise upon decrees relating to the\r\nimposition and collection of the tax, rests with it. The estimated\r\nreceipts from this tax for the share of the Confederation are placed in\r\nthe budget for 1889 at 1,330,000 francs. An eminent Swiss publicist,\r\nDr. Dubs, in criticising this tax-law, asserts “that in many points it\r\nis equally irrational, and, in the construction of its details, leads\r\nmoreover to further absurdities of all kinds, of which undoubtedly the\r\nclaiming to tax those in foreign countries and the taxation of the\r\nheir’s possible expectations form the highest point.” He might have\r\nadded that this tax, so far as levied upon incomes of persons liable\r\nto military service but exempted therefrom by reason of disability\r\nor other cause, partakes rather of the character of a law to raise\r\nrevenue than as providing a penalty for the non-performance of military\r\nservice. The failure to render such service on the part of one enjoying\r\na specified income is not more heavily punished than the failure of\r\none with less or no income. The operation of this tax has caused much\r\ncomplaint on the part of citizens of the United States “established”\r\nin Switzerland. Nearly all of the European states have concluded\r\ntreaties with Switzerland, since the enactment of this “military\r\ntax-law,” bringing themselves within the conditions it prescribes for\r\nthe exemption of their citizens “established” in Switzerland, from any\r\npersonal service or any tax in lieu thereof.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of the United States residing in Switzerland, of whom\r\nthere are quite a number engaged in prosperous and large industries,\r\nstill come under the treaty concluded between Switzerland and the\r\nUnited States in 1850, long previous to the passage of the tax-law\r\n(1878), Article II. of which reads: “The citizens of one of the two\r\ncountries, residing or established in the other, shall be free from\r\npersonal military service, but they shall be liable to the pecuniary or\r\nmaterial contributions which may be required by way of compensation,\r\nfrom citizens of the country where they reside, who are exempt from\r\nthat service.” This article seems to contemplate the imposition of\r\na penalty for the non-performance of a duty from which the party is\r\nspecially exempted. It is susceptible of a plausible argument, that a\r\nproper construction of this article does not warrant the collection\r\nof the tax imposed by the Swiss law of 1878, from the United States\r\ncitizens residing there. For this tax is not in fact a “pecuniary\r\ncontribution” required from citizens of Switzerland who are exempt from\r\npersonal military service, but is a tax required only from citizens\r\nwho by reason of their age are subject to military service, but who in\r\nconsequence of physical or other disability cannot perform it. That\r\nthe words, “by way of compensation,” were not intended to qualify the\r\nphrase, “pecuniary or material contribution,” but refer to, “shall be\r\nfree from personal military service.” Should a citizen of the United\r\nStates residing in Switzerland prefer to render personal military\r\nservice rather than pay the tax, his service would not be accepted; he\r\nwould be informed that by virtue of the treaty with his country he\r\nis “free from personal military service, but liable to the pecuniary\r\nor material contribution,” and he must pay his tax,--“your money and\r\nnot your service is what we wish.” If his service was accepted, it\r\nwould carry an implication of the right to enforce either personal\r\nservice or in lieu thereof the payment of a commutation tax for\r\nexemption. The language of the treaty obviously contemplated only such\r\ngeneral contribution as might be required of all classes of citizens,\r\nand excludes the idea of a special tax levied upon an exceptional\r\nclass. During the last war in the United States the tax exemption or\r\ncommutation, to which a certain class of citizens were subjected by the\r\ndraft law, did not interfere with domiciliary rights. There is to-day\r\nno exaction on the part of the United States government from foreign\r\ncitizens domiciled or established within them, of any pecuniary or\r\nmaterial contributions of a military nature; nor is it believed that\r\nthere is any such exaction on the part of any of the States.[70] The\r\nSwiss construction of the treaty, as to the liability of the United\r\nStates citizens residing therein to this tax, was substantially\r\nconceded by our Department of State in 1876, and left the remedy to be\r\nsought by an international treaty. The Swiss government has indicated\r\nits willingness to enter upon the negotiation of such a conventional\r\nagreement to effect the relief of United States citizens from this tax,\r\nafter the manner prescribed by the law of 1878, and which was promptly\r\nacted upon by all the European powers. The government of the United\r\nStates has not found it expedient to do this. Many difficulties are\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\nIn parts of Switzerland there has appeared some dissatisfaction with\r\nthe military service and tax. It is alleged to be an unnecessary\r\nwaste of money expended on the country’s armed forces, draining its\r\nlimited resources to no practical purpose, and that an unprofitable and\r\nirksome task is imposed upon them by this assessment. The statesmen of\r\nSwitzerland stand united in the expression that it is the only way to\r\nbe sure of their neutrality being respected; as was abundantly proven\r\nby the prompt presence of the federal troops compelling Bourbaki’s\r\ncorps of 80,000 men, when in 1871 they were driven into the Swiss\r\nterritory, the moment they crossed the line, to lay down their arms;\r\nand thereby saved the German army from crossing the frontier of the\r\nConfederation and engaging the French on Swiss soil. The President of\r\nthe Confederation, in his address to the _Tir fédéral_ of 1887, voiced\r\nthe prevailing sentiment when he said: “The government of Switzerland\r\nwould remain foremost in maintaining peace and pride in its arts as\r\nthe supreme glory of the republic; and would constantly endeavor to\r\npreserve her neutrality, but to do this she must not rely altogether\r\non treaties, but also look to her own strength and energy; to keep her\r\nsoldiery in condition to show that the adequacy of the Confederation\r\nto all the needs of national life is, in no single department, taken\r\non trust. He therefore would urge them to be assiduous in improving\r\nmilitary training, to add such training to the education of the youth,\r\nto hold rifle contests and to perfect drills, all of which should be\r\nanimated by a free fraternal spirit.” Notwithstanding the constitution\r\nforbids the Confederation to keep a standing army, or any Canton to\r\nhave more than three hundred men as a permanent military body, every\r\nable-bodied Swiss is a soldier of the republic; not on paper merely or\r\nby legal and constitutional fiction, but _actually_. The necessity of\r\nself-defence forced Switzerland to be the very first power in which\r\nuniversal liability to military service was introduced in Europe, many\r\nyears and even centuries before other countries had recognized the\r\nprinciple, which is now almost universal. The Swiss army is based\r\nupon a “voluntary-compulsory” system. It is essentially a force of\r\nmilitia intended for defensive purposes only. Admirable as it is in\r\na military and economic sense, it is scarcely more than a summer\r\nholiday, compared with the rigid and grinding martial duties under the\r\nother European systems. Two things make it a light burden, if not a\r\ndiversion, for the Swiss. They have a strong natural military instinct\r\ncoming down through generations.[71] Then this instinct is in every\r\npossible manner encouraged and developed by the government, the Canton,\r\nand the Commune. The elements of drill begin with the very first week\r\nof a boy’s schooling, as soon as he can stand erect or poise a stick.\r\nAll kinds of games are practised that tend to open and expand the\r\nchest, to nerve the limbs, give carriage to the form, and serve to\r\nstrengthen, temper, and adjust it. All these exercises fit him and, in\r\nfact, contemplate his becoming in time a soldier. He not only learns\r\nin his youth the elements of drill and the use of arms, but habits of\r\nobedience, order, and cleanliness; and even those yet higher duties of\r\na camp, the will to mingle class with class, to put down personal hopes\r\nand seek no object but the public good.\r\n\r\nThe _Schützenfest_, liberally encouraged by the government, is held\r\nbiennially. This is in many respects the parallel of the ancient Greek\r\nfestival game, which served the purpose of keeping alive the national\r\nspirit. It is the most important and popular public gathering in\r\nSwitzerland; the entries for the various prizes running as high as\r\n100,000. It is uniformly opened by a formal address from the President\r\nof the Confederation and attended by all the leading men of the\r\ncountry. It is a national fête day. Then there are the _Sociétés de\r\ntir_, cantonal and communal shooting societies, which number about\r\n1600, with over 100,000 members. These societies compete one with the\r\nother, and in event of their conforming to certain regulations receive\r\nsubsidies from the Confederation. These regulations require:\r\n\r\n1. Every member of the _Élite_ or _Landwehr_ must, on application, be\r\nadmitted to the club, if he is able and willing to pay his share of the\r\nexpense for targets, markers, etc.\r\n\r\n2. The club must number at least twenty members.\r\n\r\n3. The firing exercises must be done with the regulation arms and\r\nammunition; each soldier must use his own gun; regulation targets must\r\nbe had, and at least ten shots fired at every meeting, at each of the\r\ndistances named.\r\n\r\n4. To receive the subsidy, every member of the club must annually take\r\npart in at least three firing exercises, and must fire a total of fifty\r\nshots, of which at least ten must be at one of the regulation distances\r\nand regulation targets.\r\n\r\nEvery Swiss man therefore is drilled, armed, and ready to turn out\r\nand fight; in his house, within arm’s reach, must hang his gun, his\r\nuniform, and sword. The _concierge_ who accepts your _pourboire_ may\r\nbe a captain in the line, and the driver of your _voiture_ a corporal.\r\nSome one, writing of the universal fusion between the military and\r\ncivic elements, tells this incident: A gentleman called to see a lawyer\r\non business; asking the servant if the lawyer was in, he answered, “The\r\ncolonel is not here, sir, but you can see the major.” So the visitor\r\nwas shown in, and saw the major, who was the lawyer’s partner, and when\r\nhe made a statement of his business, he was told, “That is not in my\r\ndepartment, the captain will look after it.” The captain was the firm’s\r\nclerk, and while talking to him, a second clerk came into the office,\r\nwhom the captain saluted, saying, “Good day, lieutenant.”\r\n\r\nIn the public schools even the girls receive some training which fits\r\nthem to be useful auxiliaries in the army. They learn to stanch the\r\nflow of blood, to dress a gunshot wound, and to nurse the sick; they\r\nknow some chemistry and are quick at sewing, binding, dressing, and\r\nsuch medical arts. And if need, they would march in line with knapsacks\r\non their backs, as their mothers did in times past. The Helvetic women\r\nfought against the army of Octavianus Augustus in 16 B.C., and when\r\nall was lost, hurled their young children at the Roman soldiers and\r\nrushed forward to meet their own death. In the old days of trial by\r\njudicial combat, _assumere duellum_, the chronicles of 1288 contained\r\nthis curious entry: _Duellum fuit in Bern inter virum et mulierem,\r\nsed mulier prevaluit_. Not only men but women fought at the battle\r\nof Stantz, and among the killed were counted one hundred and thirty\r\nwomen. During the French invasion of 1798, upward of eight hundred\r\nwomen took up arms in the _Landsturm_, and bore all the fire of the\r\nenemy in the last actions. At Fraubrunnen two hundred and sixty women\r\nreceived the enemy with scythes, pitchforks, and pickaxes; one hundred\r\nand eighty were killed, and one of them, whose name was Glar, had two\r\ndaughters and three granddaughters who fought by her side,--these six\r\nheroines all were found among the dead. In the Swiss Reformed Church,\r\nin administering the sacraments of the Lord’s Supper, the men go up\r\nfirst and the women afterwards, with the single exception of Geiss, in\r\nAppenzell, where, on account of their service at the battle of Amstoss,\r\nthe women go up first.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss owe their reputation to their freedom, and their freedom\r\nto their valor. Their military spirit is entirely free from greed\r\nof territory, lust of power, “the pride, pomp, and circumstance of\r\nglorious war,” and other forces far from admirable in their motive,\r\nwhich give prominence and predominance to modern armaments; it is\r\ninspired by motives of civic manhood and manly self-assertion. A small\r\nand by no means rich nation that relaxes not from its attitude of\r\ndefence is less likely to be attacked, though surrounded by powerful\r\nand ambitious neighbors, than another nation which possesses wealth,\r\ncommerce, population, and all the sinews of war in far greater\r\nabundance, but is unprepared. The more sleek the prey, the greater\r\nis the temptation, and “no wolf will leave a sheep to dine upon a\r\nporcupine.”\r\n\r\nThe spirit which animated the brave old Swiss was not that of revenge,\r\nor plunder, or bloodshed. They fought simply when and because it was\r\nnecessary to insure the liberty of their native land. It was a sense\r\nof duty rather than love of glory that strengthened and filled them\r\nwith an invincible heroism and inspired them with the sentiment so\r\noften heard on the battle-field, _Wir müssen unsere Pflicht thun_ (“we\r\nmust do our duty”). The set of military regulations drawn up after the\r\nbattle of Sempach, more than five hundred years ago, might furnish a\r\nmodel for to-day; a few taken at random will show their tenor:\r\n\r\n1. Not to attack or injure any church or chapel unless the enemy have\r\nretired into it.\r\n\r\n2. Not to insult any females.\r\n\r\n3. It is forbidden to any man to straggle for the sake of plunder, or\r\nto appropriate to himself any part of the booty, which must all be\r\nreported and be divided equally in good faith.\r\n\r\n4. Every Swiss engages to sacrifice his life or property, if required,\r\nfor the defence of his countrymen.\r\n\r\n5. No Swiss shall abandon his post even when wounded.\r\n\r\n6. No Swiss shall take away anything from any of his countrymen either\r\nin peace or war.\r\n\r\nWar has been the great training school of hardihood, endurance,\r\ncourage, self-sacrifice, and devotion to public duty. There is no\r\nprofession more favorable to the growth of noble sentiment and manly\r\naction than that of the soldier; and to its beneficial action in the\r\nformation of States, every page of history bears flaming testimony. A\r\ngreat German professor declares: “Our army is not simply the organized\r\npower of the state; it is also a great school, nay, our greatest\r\nschool for the masses, of intellectual culture, morals, politeness and\r\npatriotism.” Let the Swiss ever cherish and imitate the simple lives,\r\nthe undaunted courage, the obstinate and enduring spirit, and the lofty\r\npatriotism of their ancestors who, in the great contests which rolled\r\nround the fort of their mountains, died on the fields of Morat and\r\nMorgarten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo inquiry can be more important than that which proposes to discover\r\nthe legitimate purpose and the best course of general education. All\r\nmen, how much soever they may be distinguished from each other by a\r\nvariety of circumstances, connections, and pursuits, have yet one\r\ncommon set of duties to perform; and it is in forming this character,\r\nand imparting the ability to discharge these duties, that the business\r\nof what may be called, in the most general sense, a good education,\r\nproperly consists. Such an education may, therefore, fitly be described\r\nto be that course of discipline which is accommodated to man, as he is\r\nman; which is to lay the firm foundation of excellence in future life;\r\nand by which it is designed to effect the highest preparatory culture\r\nof his whole nature. It happens, however, that the foundation of those\r\nvirtues which are to render us useful and happy must be laid at a time\r\nwhen we are least willing to receive instruction,--when we are in\r\nsearch rather of amusement for our imagination than of employment for\r\nour reason. Aware of these difficulties, the instructors of mankind\r\nhave been in all ages solicitous to discover popular and efficacious\r\nmethods for their admonitions. Theories once embraced as judicious\r\nand complete are succeeded by others which, in turn, are declared\r\nas erroneous and defective. Plans at present deemed ill-concerted\r\nor impracticable are the same which it was once thought reasonable\r\nto adopt. Where government, national or state, insists upon having\r\nevery child given over to it for the first and formative educational\r\nperiod, it assumes an infinite responsibility for the judicious and\r\nreasonable training of the young committed to its care. And they have,\r\nin turn, the right to conclude that the instruction given is that, of\r\nall others, which the wisdom and wit of the age have pronounced to\r\nbe the most beneficial and important for them to receive. The system\r\nof education is proportionately more enlightened and liberal as the\r\nliberty of the subject is the basis and aim of the constitution. The\r\ninterested caution of a despotic government cares not to open too wide\r\nevery avenue to science. The state of public instruction is one of the\r\ngreatest glories of Switzerland. There is no country where primary\r\ninstruction is more developed and more wide-spread. A Switzer will tell\r\nyou that every child in the Confederation, unless under the school age\r\nor mentally incapacitated, can read and write. This is true to the\r\nextent that the exceptions to the rule are not sufficient to constitute\r\nan illiterate class. Keeping school is the permanent business of\r\nthe state, and the attention to it is not merely a fixed and formal\r\nbusiness, but an unceasing and engrossing duty. A school is one of the\r\nfirst things present to the eyes of a Swiss child, and one of the last\r\nthings present to the mind of a Swiss man. On reaching a certain age,\r\nthe right to stay at home and play ceases; the school seizes the child,\r\nholds him fast for years, and rears him into what he is to be. The two\r\ngreat items of expense which figure in the budget of a Swiss Canton\r\nare the roads and public instruction. The sum bestowed on the latter\r\nis immense, relatively to the total means of the Canton, standing far\r\nahead of the disbursements for military service, which, in Europe, is\r\na startling fact. On the continent, with the exception of Switzerland,\r\nthe cost of the public forces, even in times of absolute peace, is\r\nestimated to be nearly fourteen times that of the public schools.[72]\r\nThe passion for public education, and the large expenditure so\r\ncheerfully made for its support, are but natural in the land that gave\r\nbirth to Rousseau, Pestalozzi, and Fellenberg. John Henry Pestalozzi,\r\nborn at Zurich in 1746, was the most celebrated of Swiss educational\r\nreformers and philanthropists. His system furnished the basis and gave\r\nthe first impetus to the public school organization; it furnished also\r\na model for the rest of Europe, and especially for Germany. The main\r\nfeatures of this system, with the improvements made upon it, are to-day\r\nregarded in Switzerland as the chief corner-stone of their superb\r\neducational condition. His whole school apparatus consisted of himself\r\nand his pupils; so he studied the children themselves, their wants and\r\ncapacities. “I stood in the midst of them,” he explains, “pronouncing\r\nvarious sounds and asking the children to imitate them. Whoever saw\r\nit was struck with the effect. It is true, it was like a meteor which\r\nvanishes in the air as soon as it appears. No one understood its\r\nnature. I did not understand it myself. It was the result of a simple\r\nidea, or rather of a fact of human nature, which was revealed to my\r\nfeelings, but of which I was far from having a clear consciousness.\r\nBeing obliged to instruct the children by myself, without any\r\nassistance, I learnt the art of teaching a great number together;\r\nand as I had no other means of bringing the instruction before them\r\nthan that of pronouncing everything to them loudly and distinctly,\r\nI was naturally led to the idea of making them draw, write, or work,\r\nall at the same time.” Combining the experience with the ideas he had\r\nreceived many years before from Rousseau, he invented his system of\r\nobject-lessons. The Yverdon Institute had soon a world-wide reputation.\r\nMany came to wonder, many to be educated, many to learn the art of\r\neducation. Pestalozzian teachers went from it to Madrid, to Naples, to\r\nSt. Petersburg. Kings and philosophers joined in doing it honor. While\r\nPestalozzi did not invent the principle that education is a developing\r\nof the faculties rather than an imparting of knowledge, he did much to\r\nbring this truth to bear on early education, and to make it not only\r\nreceived, but acted on. We must, at least, concede to him the merit,\r\nwhich he himself claims, of having “lighted upon truths little noticed\r\nbefore, and principles which, though almost generally acknowledged,\r\nare seldom carried out in practice.” The motive power of his career\r\nwas the “enthusiasm of humanity.” He never lost faith in the true\r\ndignity of man, and in the possibility of raising the Swiss peasantry\r\nto a condition worthy of it. “From my youth up,” he says, “I felt what\r\na high and indispensable human duty it was to labor for the poor and\r\nmiserable, that he may attain to a consciousness of his own dignity\r\nthrough his feeling of the universal powers and endowments which he\r\npossesses awakened within him, so that he may be raised not only above\r\nthe ploughing oxen, but also above the man in purple and silk who lives\r\nunworthily of his high destiny.” It is claimed of him that he was the\r\nfirst teacher to announce convincingly the doctrine that all people\r\nshould be educated; that, in fact, education is the one good gift to\r\ngive to all, rich or poor, and, unlike any other giving, it helps and\r\ndoes not hinder self-help. Pestalozzi was no friend to the notion of\r\ngiving instruction always in the guise of amusement, contending that\r\na child should very early in life be taught the lesson that exertion\r\nis indispensable for the attainment of knowledge. At the same time\r\nhe held that a child should not be taught to look upon exertion as an\r\nevil; he should be encouraged, not frightened, into it. “An interest,”\r\nhe claims, “in study is the first thing which a teacher should endeavor\r\nto excite and keep alive. There are scarcely any circumstances in which\r\na want of application in children does not proceed from a want of\r\ninterest; and there are, perhaps, none in which the want of interest\r\ndoes not originate in the mode of teaching adopted by the teacher. I\r\nwould go so far as to lay it down as a rule that, whenever children are\r\ninattentive and apparently take no interest in a lesson, the teacher\r\nshould always first look to himself for the reason. Could we conceive\r\nthe indescribable tedium which must oppress the young mind while the\r\nweary hours are slowly passing away, one after another, in occupations\r\nwhich it can neither relish nor understand, could we remember the\r\nlike scenes which our own childhood has passed through, we should no\r\nlonger be surprised at the remissness of the school-boy, creeping\r\nlike a snail unwillingly to school. We must adopt a better mode of\r\ninstruction, by which children are less left to themselves, less thrown\r\nupon the unwelcome employment of passive listening, but more roused by\r\nquestions, animated by illustrations, interested and won by kindness.”\r\n\r\nThe efforts of Pestalozzi went down in clouds, and when he died, at the\r\nage of eighty-one, in 1827, he had seen the apparent failure of all his\r\ntoils. He had not, however, failed in reality. And when twenty years\r\nlater the centenary of his birth was celebrated by school-masters,\r\nnot only in his native country but throughout Germany, it was found\r\nthat Pestalozzian ideas had been sown, and were bearing fruit, over\r\nthe greater part of central Europe. Even to-day school-masters might\r\nlearn much from Pestalozzi, in aiming more at a plan of education\r\nfounded on a knowledge of human nature, and its modes of instruction\r\nwhich shall better develop their pupils’ faculties. The true functions\r\nof Pestalozzi, it is alleged, were to educate ideas, not children.\r\nEven those who are most averse to theoretical views, which they call\r\nunpractical, will admit, as practical men, that their methods are\r\nprobably susceptible of improvement, and that even a theorist might\r\nlead them to make many observations which would otherwise have escaped\r\nthem; might teach them to examine what their aim really was, and\r\nthen whether they are using the most suitable methods to accomplish\r\nit. Such a theorist is Pestalozzi. He points to a high ideal, and\r\nbids us measure our modes of education by it. When Switzerland would\r\nhonor Pestalozzi’s name, the monument she built was more than brass\r\nor bronze. It was a school,--a school where the memoirs of the man\r\nwere carved, not on wood or stone, but in the minds of happy, growing\r\nyouths, the fortunate beneficiaries of a system whose foundation he\r\nlaid.[73] Down to 1848 all the public schools in Switzerland had been\r\nin the hands of the Cantons; in the federal constitution, adopted at\r\nthat time, it was provided that the Confederation might establish a\r\nuniversity and a polytechnic school. A proposition for a university was\r\nsoon thereafter submitted and rejected. Subsequently a law was passed,\r\nin 1854, establishing a federal polytechnical school. In view of the\r\nantagonism existing between the German, French, and Italian Cantons,\r\nand the social friction that followed between the adherents of the\r\ndifferent creeds, it was found important that the Confederation should\r\nbe in a position to strengthen and direct the forces which make for\r\nunity, and attention was directed to the vital forces which proceed\r\nfrom a wisely-arranged system of public instruction. This resulted\r\nin more extensive power being conferred upon the Confederation, in\r\nthe revised Constitution of 1874, with respect to education. The\r\n27th Article of the Constitution declares: “The Confederation has\r\nthe right to establish, besides the existing polytechnical school,\r\na federal university and other institutions for higher instruction,\r\nor may assist in the support of said institutions. The Cantons shall\r\nprovide for primary education, which must be adequate, and shall be\r\nplaced exclusively under the direction of the civil authorities. It is\r\ncompulsory, and in the public schools free. The public schools shall\r\nbe open to the adherents of all religious sects without any offence\r\nto their freedom of conscience or of belief. The Confederation shall\r\ntake the necessary measures against such Cantons as shall not conform\r\nto these provisions.” Primary instruction was first made compulsory\r\nunder this Constitution of 1874. The promotion and organization of the\r\nelementary education are left in the hands of the Cantons, subject to\r\nthe control of the Confederation; but it must be exclusively under the\r\ncivil authority. This does not exclude the clergy--if not Jesuits--from\r\nthe position of teachers and other school officers, but simply\r\nrequires, if occupying these positions, they must stand on the same\r\nfooting as laymen. No person who belongs to a religious order, claiming\r\nallegiance paramount to the state, can be a teacher in the public\r\nschools. The provision guaranteeing freedom of conscience and belief\r\nis complied with by the Cantons in a way suitable to their wants.\r\nReligious instruction is usually given on fixed days, at stated hours,\r\nso that every facility for absenting themselves is afforded to children\r\nwhose parents wish them only to receive secular instruction. In many\r\ninstances the religious instruction is confined to truths common to\r\nall Christians, and to readings from the Bible. In reference to the\r\nrelation of the schools to religion in Switzerland, Matthew Arnold\r\nreported: “Whoever has seen the divisions caused in a so-called logical\r\nnation like the French by this principle of the neutrality of the\r\npopular school in matters of religion might expect differently here.\r\nNone whatever has arisen. The Swiss communities, applying the principle\r\nfor themselves and not leaving theorists and politicians to apply it\r\nfor them, have done in the matter what they consider proper, and have\r\nin every popular school religious instruction in the religion of the\r\nmajority, a Catholic instruction in Catholic Cantons, like Luzern, a\r\nProtestant in Protestant Cantons, like Zurich; and there is no unfair\r\ndealing, no proselytizing, no complaint.” The first school-year varies\r\nfrom five to seven years of age, and runs up to twelve, except in\r\na few Cantons, where it extends to the fourteenth, fifteenth, and\r\nsixteenth years. Primary instruction is left to the determination\r\nof the several Cantons, only it must be, under the constitution,\r\n“adequate.” With the exception of the Canton of Solothurn, where all\r\nchildren must receive their primary instruction in the public schools,\r\na person is not obliged to send his children to the public school. He\r\nis perfectly free to have them instructed wherever he wishes, provided\r\nthey receive an education, at least as good as that which is given in\r\nthe public schools. Parents who neglect or refuse to do one or the\r\nother are cited before the authorities and subject to a fine, and\r\nin case of a repetition of the offence to imprisonment. In most of\r\nthe Cantons the gratuity covers books and other school-materials to\r\nchildren of indigent parents. There is no class of vagrant or destitute\r\nchildren which the system fails to reach; even to those too poor to\r\nobtain proper food and clothing, both public and private assistance\r\nare freely rendered. The obligation resting upon the Confederation\r\nto see that the Cantons meet the constitutional requirements has so\r\nfar not been supplemented by any federal legislation, prescribing the\r\nmethod of such enforcement, or imposing any penalties for disregard\r\nof the law. Certain Cantons having failed to do their duties in this\r\nrespect, the Federal Assembly in 1882 instructed the Federal Council to\r\ntake steps to insure a general compliance with the provisions of the\r\nconstitution. The Council proposed the creation of a Federal Department\r\nof Public Instruction, with a number of inspectors, whose duty it\r\nwould be to enforce the law. So soon as the Assembly submitted this\r\nsuggestion in the form of a federal law, nearly two hundred thousand\r\ncitizens demanded its subjection to the _Referendum_ (30,000 was\r\nsufficient to do so), and upon the taking of the popular vote, it was\r\nrejected by the extraordinary majority of 146,129. It was an indignant\r\nprotest against what was regarded as an attempted interference with\r\ntheir local home-government of the schools. Therefore the details\r\nof school administration, organization, and inspection still remain\r\nin the hands of the educational department of each Canton. In some\r\nCantons inspectors are appointed by the educational department; in\r\nothers, it is voluntarily conducted by a board composed chiefly of\r\nprofessional men,--pastors or persons of influence. These inspectors\r\ndecide as to the course of studies, the books to be used, and act as a\r\nsort of tribunal to hear and decide all controversies that may arise\r\nbetween the teachers and the local authorities. As a rule, women are\r\nnot eligible as school inspectors. Every Commune, in addition to the\r\ninspectors, has a school commission, elected by the communal assembly.\r\nThey are charged with providing sufficient school accommodation, and\r\nkeeping the buildings in repair; also to visit the schools and see\r\nthat any suggestions made by the inspector have been properly carried\r\nout. The Commune provides the sites for the school buildings, and\r\nthese are erected at the joint expense of the Commune and Canton.\r\nGreat attention is given to the construction of these school-houses,\r\nas to their comfort and convenience; the windows must face the east\r\nor southeast, and the benches so arranged that the light falls upon\r\nthe pupil’s left hand. Then there is sure to be a large and grassy\r\nplot for the children’s play-ground, with a fountain of pure water on\r\nit, shady trees, and all the accessories for athletic exercise. The\r\nschool-house is the most commodious, modern, and handsome edifice to\r\nbe seen in a Swiss town. One may look in vain for the court-house and\r\ntown-hall, but on the most central and costly site is the school-house,\r\nthe pride of every city square and village slope. The schools are not\r\nmixed, and when the Commune is not able to sustain separate schools,\r\nthe boys attend in the morning, and the girls in the afternoon.\r\nSaturday is not a holiday. Each class has so many hours of schooling\r\nfor the week, apportioned among the six days. Every form of corporal\r\npunishment is forbidden. No bodily pain, no bodily shame, is suffered\r\nin the schools. Chastisement, it is claimed, first brutalizes a child;\r\nsecond, makes him cowardly; and, third, blunts his sense of shame,\r\nwhich must soon form the bulwark round virtue. “A lad has rights,”\r\nsays the Swiss teacher. “We cannot stint his food, we cannot lock him\r\nup, we cannot crown him with a dunce’s cap, or we cannot make a guy\r\nof him. Our discipline is wholly moral; our means are prizes, good\r\nwords, all leading up to public acts of honor. Should we have any\r\nincorrigible ones, they are expelled, but expulsion is a very serious\r\nmatter, and must be exercised under prescribed rules, with due notice\r\nto parents and the school officials; and at first only temporary and\r\nconditional, and never final and absolute, without the formal sanction\r\nof the school commission. This emergency rarely occurs. A threat or\r\nadmonition suffices, for expulsion is considered only one degree from\r\nruin.” Obedience which is rendered merely because there is a sense of\r\nauthority about the commander destroys the sympathetic relation which\r\nshould exist between the teacher and pupil. The best and only true\r\ndiscipline is that which is secured, not through habits created from\r\nthe will of the teacher, says Professor Shaler, of Harvard, but won\r\nthrough the exercise of the will of the pupil; only when accomplished\r\nby sympathetic stimulus, is the effect truly educational. Manliness,\r\nsincerity, and conscientiousness are its legitimate fruits; it fosters\r\nhonesty and truthfulness more than any regimen discipline.\r\n\r\nThe pupil’s manners and appearance are also cared for. He is taught\r\nhow to appear and act no less than how to read and write; how to walk,\r\nstand, and speak; that his hands and face should be kept clean, as\r\nwell as his papers and books. A blot upon his page and a smudge upon\r\nhis face are regarded as equally bad. “A book befouled,” the teacher\r\ntells us, “with grime is wasted, and our simple economical habits will\r\nnot suffer such waste; turn over any of these books, which are in\r\ndaily use, no leaf is torn or dog-eared, nor the covers defaced with\r\nscribbling.” The same observation would apply to the school furniture\r\nand building. The desks, though extremely plain, look as if they are\r\ndaily washed and polished; not a spot nor splash of ink to be seen\r\non their surface, not any evidence of the bad boy’s knife; the large\r\ncorridors and spacious stairways show no scratch or scrawl; the wall\r\nfree from fingermarks and inscriptions, and no bits of paper on the\r\nfloor. The children, representing all classes of society, from the\r\npatrician to the poorest peasant, are neatly and comfortably clad;\r\nnone dirty, ragged, or shoeless. To an expression of surprise at this,\r\nwe are informed “that if a child comes to school with face begrimed\r\nor clothes torn, he is washed, cleaned, and mended up, and then sent\r\nhome; the mother gets ashamed on finding that some other woman, or\r\nit may be a man, has had to wash her child; the child also becomes\r\nmortified, and it is never necessary to repeat the treatment.” The\r\nmoment that a pupil is on the street he has passed from the circle of\r\nhis home, and that moment has commenced the school’s authority. The\r\nregulations, printed on slips and dropped in every house, contain,\r\namong a score of others, the following rule relating to conduct on\r\nthe street: “Delay of any kind between the scholar’s home and school\r\nis not allowed. No whooping, yelling, throwing stones and snow-balls,\r\nteasing children, ridiculing age or deformity can be endured. Grown\r\npersons shall be met with kind civility, politely greeted as they\r\npass, and thus shall honor be reflected on the school.” There is very\r\nlittle contumacious absence from school. The children have the habit\r\nof going to school as a matter of course, and the parents equally\r\nthe habit of acquiescing in their going. The Federal Factory Act of\r\n1877, with a purpose of preventing any interference with attendance\r\nat school, forbids the employment, in a mill or public workshop,\r\nof any child until he has attained the age of fifteen. And every\r\nSwiss _recruit_ for military service is required to pass an _examen\r\npédagogique_, with a view of enabling the authorities to ascertain\r\nthe degree of instruction attained by the youth of the country. This\r\nexamination consists of arithmetic, geography, and Swiss history;\r\nand those who do not come up to the minimum educational standard are\r\nrequired to undergo instruction at the _recruit_ school, and the odium\r\nattendant upon this is found to exercise a marked beneficial effect on\r\nthe education of the peasantry. The teachers of the primary schools\r\nare nominated by the school inspectors and elected by the Communal\r\nAssembly. Teachers of the higher schools are appointed by the Cantonal\r\nDirector of Education and confirmed by the Board of Educational\r\nDepartment. They are elected for a term of six years, and after\r\nservice on a differential scale are retired on a pension of not less\r\nthan one-half of their salary at the time of their retirement. Each\r\nCommune decides for itself whether male or female teachers shall be\r\nemployed. The teachers are trained for a period of four years in one\r\nof the cantonal normal schools. In the Grisons and Neuchâtel, normal\r\nschools are attached to the secondary schools, but in the Cantons of\r\nZurich, Bern, Luzern, Schwyz, Freiburg, Solothurn, St. Gallen, Aargau,\r\nThurgau, Ticino, Vaud, and Valais separate establishments exist. The\r\nstudents are usually lodged and boarded at the actual cost; and free\r\nand half-free places are open for those unable to pay in full. Each\r\nCommune must pay to the primary school-teacher a minimum salary of\r\n550 francs, but these salaries will run from 600 to 1000 francs, with\r\nfree lodging and fuel, the latter being an important item of expense.\r\nThose in the larger towns receive from 1200 to 1700 francs, secondary\r\nschool-teachers are paid from 2200 to 2500 francs, and teachers in the\r\ngymnasiums an average of 3300 francs. The Cantons assist the Communes\r\nin augmenting the lower salaries and in the payment of the pensions.\r\nAfter thirty years of service, or in case of disability or illness\r\ncontracted in the line of professional duty, teachers may retire on\r\nthe pension above indicated. In some Cantons, after five years of\r\nservice, 100 francs are added to the salary, and an additional 100\r\nfor each _quinquennium_. In Basel a female teacher, after ten years\r\nof service, is entitled to a supplemental salary of 250 francs per\r\nannum; after fifteen years, 357 francs per annum, and then on voluntary\r\nretirement, after fifteen years of service, a pension for life equal to\r\ntwo per cent. on the amount she was being paid at time of retirement.\r\nThus the Swiss teacher has pragmatic rights,--that is, he has a legal\r\nclaim to a fixed salary, and to a retiring pension in case of age or\r\nillness. The Swiss teacher is to his pupil a father and companion.\r\nHe leads and assists on the play-ground the same as he does in the\r\nschool-room; a free and unrestrained companionship, beautiful as it is\r\nbeneficial, unmixed with foolish fondness or paternal pride. Together\r\nthey will run and leap and laugh and dance and sing as well as learn.\r\nThe hours of study past, the pupil and teacher wander to the forests\r\nand the field; together pluck wild flowers and plants; together climb\r\nthe hills, cross lakes and streams, searching for curious rocks and\r\nplants, learning again from them the lessons of the day. This is the\r\nvery essence of education: for a man who professes to instruct to get\r\namong his pupils, study their character, gain their affections, and\r\nform their inclinations and aversions, together with that affectionate\r\nvigilance which is experienced in the best home-circle. These men\r\nregard the school as a psychological observatory, where they are to\r\npractise the very difficult art of discovering the capacities of the\r\npupils, receiving them with a tender consideration for the good and\r\nevil they bring with them, and with an apt adjustment of the resources\r\nof education to their individual needs. The primary or communal schools\r\ncome first in number. In every hamlet, where there may be twenty girls\r\nand boys, the communal officials must provide a school-house and hire\r\na master. These are supposed to embrace the pupilage for the first\r\nfive or six school-years. The lessons average from twenty to thirty\r\nweekly, and they have annual vacations from ten to twelve weeks. The\r\nchildren who are old enough to assist in work at home are only required\r\nto attend one-half of the day during the harvest season, or other busy\r\ntimes. In some instances there is provided for this class what is known\r\nas the supplementary school, which is held only on two mornings of\r\nthe week; the aim being to help the pupil retain what he has already\r\nlearned in the primary school until he can again resume his regular\r\nattendance. A curious custom prevails in some of these communal schools\r\nwith respect to the supply of the necessary firewood in winter. Every\r\nboy or girl must contribute a piece; and in winter the children may be\r\nconstantly seen tearing down-hill, each with a log of wood tied to a\r\n_luge_ (little sledge) as his contribution to the school-fire.\r\n\r\nThe course of study in the primary school embraces:\r\n\r\n  1. Religion.\r\n  2. Native language.\r\n  3. Arithmetic.\r\n  4. Writing.\r\n  5. Physical and political geography.\r\n  6. History of Switzerland.\r\n  7. Elements of civic instruction.\r\n  8. Drawing.\r\n  9. Elements of natural science.\r\n  10. Singing.\r\n  11. Gymnastics; and\r\n  12. (For the girls) Manual work in knitting and sewing.\r\n\r\nConnected with the primary schools in some Cantons is the\r\n_secundar-schule_, or secondary school; this school is open on\r\nSundays and in the evenings, during the winter months; and the course\r\nincludes book-keeping, business composition, such as letters, bills,\r\ncontracts, and obligations of various kinds appertaining to trade\r\nand industry. In many Cantons the secondary or advanced division of\r\nthe primary school is free, and attendance compulsory; in others,\r\nattendance optional, with a nominal charge of five francs. The course\r\nis three years for boys and four for girls. In the Cantons of Zurich\r\nand Luzern, the children from the primary schools are given four\r\nyears of gratuitous instruction in these supplementary schools. By\r\nthe last accessible report, it appears there were in attendance at\r\nthe primary schools 455,490 pupils, under the care of 8763 teachers.\r\nSixteen Cantons provided 437 secondary schools, with 20,500 pupils. The\r\n_intermediate_ schools present much variety, and have only one feature\r\nin common, in that they represent a higher grade than the primary,\r\nwith an enlarged and more deepened course of study. They extend to\r\nelements of literature in the mother tongue, composition of an advanced\r\nkind, reading of classical authors, higher mathematics, and foreign\r\nlanguages (which practically are confined to French for the German and\r\nItalian Cantons, and to German for the French Cantons); geography and\r\nhistory also become much extended.\r\n\r\nThese schools, however, do not have any pretensions beyond what\r\ntheir title of _intermediate_ indicates. There are several grades\r\nof these intermediate schools, such as the _district school_ and\r\n_under-gymnasium_. In these, still more advanced literary, technical,\r\nand artistic instructions are given. The ancient languages, Greek,\r\nLatin, natural history, physics, and chemistry are taught. Many of\r\nthem are free, and in no case does the fee exceed 25 to 40 francs\r\nfor the scholastic year. The greater portion of the expense of these\r\nschools is defrayed by the Communes, some of the cantonal governments\r\nassisting. The Canton of Bern pays one-half the salaries of the\r\nteachers, and pensions meritorious and indigent pupils from 50 to 100\r\nfrancs per annum. The highest grade of an intermediate school is the\r\nhigh-school or _gymnasium_. The course is from three to six years, and\r\nis preparatory for the university. Pupils who obtain a “certificate” at\r\nthe close of the gymnasium curriculum are, as a rule, enabled to enter\r\nthe university or the polytechnic without examination. These schools\r\nare all subject to cantonal control and supported by them, except in\r\na few of the largest towns, where they are under municipal authority,\r\nand then the towns bear much of the expense. With the exception of the\r\nfederal palace, the most costly structure in Bern is the _gymnasium_,\r\nand the same relative superiority prevails as to these school buildings\r\nthroughout Switzerland. The age for admission is from fifteen to\r\nseventeen years, with a fee from 10 to 100 francs covering the annual\r\nsession. There are 58 of these _gymnasiums_, with 12,500 students. As a\r\nfair sample, the weekly curriculum of a first-class girls’ _gymnasium_\r\nin Bern may be given:\r\n\r\nMonday, history; Tuesday, religion; Wednesday, arithmetic; Thursday,\r\nreligion; Friday, French; Saturday, religion, eight to nine o’clock.\r\n\r\nMonday, German; Tuesday, French; Wednesday, geography; Thursday,\r\nsinging; Friday, German; Saturday, French, nine to ten o’clock.\r\n\r\nMonday, arithmetic; Tuesday, natural history; Wednesday, German;\r\nThursday, history; Friday, natural history; Saturday, geography, ten to\r\neleven o’clock.\r\n\r\nMonday, gymnastics; Tuesday, singing; Wednesday, French; Thursday,\r\nGerman; Friday, arithmetic; Saturday, arithmetic, two to three o’clock\r\nP.M.\r\n\r\nMonday, drawing; Tuesday, readings; Wednesday, holiday; Thursday,\r\nbook-keeping; Friday, readings; Saturday, holiday, three to four\r\no’clock P.M.\r\n\r\nThere are four _universities_ in Switzerland, located respectively\r\nat Basel, Bern, Zurich, and Geneva. The one at Basel was founded in\r\n1460, and in the early Reformation times was one of the most famous\r\ninstitutions in Europe; attracting Erasmus, of Rotterdam, from his\r\nprofessorship at Cambridge, and the German Œcolampadius, one of the\r\nmost learned men of his country, and to whose patient teaching and\r\nmoderate temper was due no little of the taking root of the Reformed\r\ndoctrines in Switzerland.[74] Each university contains the four\r\nfaculties of law, theology, medicine, arts and philosophy, and will\r\ncompare favorably in teaching-power, apart from the mere accessories\r\nof endowments and splendid buildings, with any universities to be\r\nfound in Europe. The tuition depends on the number and character of\r\nthe faculties attended, varying from 2½ to 10 francs per week, and 100\r\nto 200 francs per annum. The degree conferred is equivalent to that\r\nof “Doctor” in the German, and “Bachelor” in the French universities.\r\nThe matriculation of these universities by the last report was 2371,\r\nincluding 107 female students, and employing 200 teachers. In addition\r\nto these universities, of the same rank with them is the Polytechnic\r\nat Zurich, founded in 1854. This is, in fact, the only educational\r\ninstitution which is directly and exclusively under the control of\r\nthe Confederation. The federal authorities do not interfere with the\r\nmethods of instruction and matters of detail in the different schools\r\nthat may be assisted by the Confederation. The total annual expenditure\r\nof the Polytechnic is about 500,000 francs, and is defrayed by the\r\ngovernment. Extensive improvements and additions are in course of\r\nconstruction, under a federal appropriation of 1,000,000 francs for\r\nthat purpose.\r\n\r\nThe Polytechnic comprises seven distinct schools, with courses varying\r\nfrom two and a half to three and a half years, viz.:\r\n\r\n  1. Architectural.\r\n  2. Civil engineering.\r\n  3. Mechanical engineering.\r\n  4. Chemical technology (including pharmacy).\r\n  5. Agriculture and farming.\r\n  6. Normal school.\r\n  7. Philosophical and political science.\r\n\r\nThere are two hundred distinct courses of lectures given during the\r\nyear, by forty-five professors and thirteen assistants, in the German,\r\nFrench, and Italian languages. The average number of students is from\r\nseven to eight hundred, and they represent almost every nation.\r\nThe female students number from fifty to sixty. The charge for a\r\ncomplete course in any one of the polytechnical schools varies from\r\n400 to 500 francs. Between all Swiss schools, from the primary to the\r\nuniversity, there is an “organic connection;” the university, in the\r\nnatural continuation and correspondence, crowning the work begun in the\r\nprimary school. The Swiss method of teaching is never mechanical; it\r\nis gradual, natural, and rational. It is patient, avoids over-hurry;\r\ncontent to advance slowly, with a firm securing of the ground passed\r\nover. The fundamental maxim is from the intuition to the notion,\r\nfrom the concrete to the abstract, founding habits alike of accurate\r\napprehension and clear expression. The system is not wooden, but\r\nappreciates that variety in mental food is as important as in bodily\r\nnourishment for healthy growth; that children at school are often\r\ntired and listless, because they are wearied and bored. From this the\r\nSwiss school finds relief in drill, gymnastics, singing, and drawing.\r\nEspecially do music and drawing play a leading part in the programme.\r\nIt is natural for children to imitate; thus they acquire language,\r\nand thus, with proper direction and encouragement, they find pleasure\r\nin attempting to sing the melodies they hear, and to draw the simple\r\nobjects around them. By drawing, the eye is trained as well as the\r\nhand; the attention to the exact shape of the whole and the proportion\r\nof the parts which is requisite for the taking of an adequate sketch\r\nis converted into a habit, and becomes productive both of instruction\r\nand amusement. The Swiss system seeks to adapt the methods to the\r\nmental process; every effort is made to interest the pupil and to make\r\nlearning palatable, and, like Lucretius, “to smear the rim of the\r\neducational cup with honey.” It is a common practice in schools of the\r\nUnited States to give children the rule for doing a sum, and then test\r\nthem by seeing if, by that rule, they can do so many given sums right.\r\nThe notion of a Swiss teacher is, that the school-hour for arithmetic\r\nis to be employed in ascertaining that the children understand the rule\r\nand the processes to which it is applied. The former practice places\r\nthe abstract before the concrete, the latter works in the opposite\r\nway. The Swiss instruction aims to render the pupil capable of solving\r\nindependently and with certainty the calculations which are likely to\r\ncome up before him in ordinary life. In a word, the Swiss possess and\r\nfollow a carefully-matured science of pedagogy. If a school is fate to\r\na Swiss child, the vision comes to him in the likeness of a fairy; it\r\nis made, by public and private acts, a centre of happy thoughts and\r\npleasant times; it shares the joy of home and the reward of church. The\r\nchildren have tasks to do at home nearly equal to the tasks at school.\r\nThe hours of study, school-work, drill, and home-work are frequently\r\nfrom ten to twelve a day. Indeed, you may say, these Swiss children\r\nmust tug at learning in a way that would create a rebellion with the\r\nyoung American. In spite of these long hours and manifold duties, the\r\nattention is never unduly strained, and, at intervals, never exceeding\r\ntwo hours, the class disperses for a few moments to the corridors or\r\nplay-grounds for recreation and a romp. No people can boast of so many\r\nschools in proportion to population, or of a system of education at\r\nonce so enlarged and simplified, so instructive and attractive, so\r\nscientific and practical. Healthy, for it takes care of the body as\r\nwell as the mind; practical, for it teaches drawing, which is the key\r\nof all industrial and mechanical professions; moral and patriotic,\r\nbecause it is founded on love of country. In many countries it is a\r\npolitical or governing class which establishes popular schools for the\r\nbenefit of the masses. In Switzerland it is the people, the Communes,\r\nwhich establish and sustain the schools for their own benefit. The\r\nsame general equality of conditions prevails as in the United States,\r\nand these schools are freely used by all classes. This is as it should\r\nbe in a free commonwealth, where character and ability are the only\r\nrank, and men are thrown together in later life according to the groups\r\nthey form at school. Every child of superior merit, however humble and\r\npoor, has an equal chance to mount the highest round of the educational\r\nladder. This building of human minds means business in Switzerland.\r\nEverywhere you find a school,--a primary school, a supplementary\r\nschool, a secondary school, a day school, evening school, school for\r\nthe blind, school for the deaf, industrial school, commercial school,\r\nlinguistic school, intermediate school, gymnasium or high-school,\r\nuniversity, polytechnical school, schools of every sort and size, class\r\nand grade, with the happy motto carved over many a door: “Dedicated to\r\nthe Children.” It is a business, standing far ahead of petty politics\r\nand hunting after place, or the worship of Mammon; a business that,\r\nwhen nobly done, brings bountiful return in love of order, law, right,\r\nand truth.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss cantonal constitutions declare that the happiness of the\r\npeople is to be found in good morals and good instruction; and that,\r\nin a free country, every citizen should have placed within his reach\r\nan education fitting him for his rights and duties. Every Canton\r\nhas in its constitution some expression embodying the idea that the\r\nbusiness of a public teacher is to make his boys good citizens and\r\ngood Christians. In some Cantons the distinct announcement is made\r\nthat the true end of public instruction is to combine democracy with\r\nreligion. In that of Zurich it is announced: “The people’s school\r\nshall train the children of all classes, on a plan agreed upon, to be\r\nintelligent men, useful citizens, and moral, religious beings.” In\r\nLuzern it is laid down that “the schools shall afford to every boy and\r\ngirl capable of receiving an education the means of developing their\r\nmental and physical faculties, of training them for life in the family,\r\nin the Commune, in the church, and in the state, and of putting them\r\nin the way of getting their future bread.” In Vaud it is declared\r\nthat “teaching in the public schools shall be in accordance with\r\nthe principles of Christianity and democracy.” In fact, the organic\r\nlaw of each and every Canton demands a system of public education,\r\nsound, solid, moral, and democratic. They all bespeak the early and\r\nimperishable impress of that great Swiss educational reformer who, more\r\nthan a century ago, uttered the memorable invocation: “Patron saint of\r\nthis country, announce it in thunder tones through hill and valley that\r\ntrue popular freedom can only be made possible through the education\r\nof man!” Since the two zealous Irish monks, Columban and Gall, went to\r\nthe continent, A.D. 585, and the latter founded the famous monastery of\r\nSt. Gallen, the descendants of the Helvetii have powerfully contributed\r\nto European civilization and progress; learning and science finding a\r\nhome not only at St. Gallen, but at Basel, Zurich, Geneva, and Bern.\r\nIn the age of the Carlovingians, more than a thousand years ago, the\r\nAbbey of St. Gallen was the most erudite spot in Europe. It had the\r\noriginal manuscript of Quintilian, from which the first edition was\r\npublished. The art of printing, when in its infancy everywhere else,\r\nhad already been carried to a high degree of perfection at Basel; and\r\nthe crusaders, who conquered Constantinople, met there A.D. 1202.\r\nGeneva was early distinguished in the annals of literature and science\r\nas well as for progress in the arts. Learned men, some of the exiles of\r\nQueen Mary’s reign, among whom was Whittingham, who married Calvin’s\r\nsister, devoted “the space of two years and more, day and night,” to a\r\ncareful revision of the text of the English Bible, and the preparation\r\nof a marginal commentary upon it. The result of these labors was the\r\npublication, in 1560, of the celebrated Geneva Bible. The cost of this\r\nwas defrayed by the English congregation at Geneva. Queen Elizabeth,\r\nto whom it was dedicated, granted a patent to John Bodley, the father\r\nof the founder of the Bodleian Library, for the exclusive right of\r\nprinting it in English for the space of seven years. Its advantages\r\nwere so many and great that it at once secured and--even after the\r\nappearance of King James’s Bible--continued to retain a firm hold upon\r\nthe bulk of the English nation. While Switzerland can hardly be said to\r\npossess a truly national literature, it has always maintained a very\r\ngood literature in German and in French; but these literatures are not\r\nthe expression of a common national life. The Swiss have displayed\r\nremarkable powers in science, in political philosophy, in history,\r\nand in letters. Among the distinguished workers in these intellectual\r\nfields may be mentioned Lavater, whose eloquence, daring, and\r\nimagination as a physiognomist procured European celebrity; Pestalozzi,\r\nthe originator of a system of education to which he devoted a life of\r\nsplendid sacrifice; De Saussure, the indefatigable philosopher, the\r\ninventor of a thermometer for ascertaining the temperature of water at\r\nall depths, and the electrometer for showing the electrical condition\r\nof the atmosphere; Bonnet, the psychologist; Gesner, the poet, whose\r\n“Death of Abel” has been translated into many languages; Müller, a\r\nhistorian remarkable for his patience in research, picturesque writing,\r\nand disgust for traditionary tales, and who is reported to have read\r\nmore books than any man in Europe, in proof of which they point to his\r\nfifty folio volumes of excerpts in the town library of Schaffhausen;\r\nZwingli, the Canon of Zurich and the co-laborer of Calvin, a man of\r\nextensive learning, uncommon sagacity, and heroic courage; Mallet,\r\nthe illustrious student of antiquities of Northern Europe; Constant,\r\nphilosopher of the source, forms, and history of religion; Sismondi,\r\na writer of history, literature, and political economy; Necker,\r\nbrilliant in politics and finance, and his celebrated daughter, Madame\r\nde Staël; Rousseau, who fired all Europe with his zeal for the rights\r\nof the poor and the free development of individual character, and who\r\nwielded the most fertile and fascinating pen that ever was pointed in\r\nthe cause of infidelity; D’Aubigné, the well-known historian of the\r\nReformation; Agassiz, the greatest naturalist of his age, and Guyot,\r\nhis compatriot and fellow-worker, to whom we owe the inception of\r\nthat system of meteorological observations called the Signal Service;\r\nHaller, Horner, Dumont, and many others who won an honorable place in\r\nlearning and literature. The remarkable resources of its modern schools\r\nand universities, and the zeal of the rising generation for learning,\r\npromise well for the intellectual future of Switzerland. To be quick\r\nin thought and quick in action; to have practical, scientific, and\r\ntechnical knowledge; to be capable of appreciating new facts, and of\r\ntaking large views; to be patient and painstaking; to have the power of\r\nworking mentally for distant objects; to have an instinct of submission\r\nto law, both to the laws of society, which aim at justice to all and\r\nat order, and to the laws of nature, submission to which enables a man\r\nto use effectually his own powers and to turn to account the powers of\r\nnature; to raise life into a higher stage; to give to every one free\r\nopportunities for participation in the knowledge and moral training,\r\ncombined with freedom and political equality, which will elevate the\r\nidea of humanity,--these are the moral and intellectual qualities\r\nwith which the Swiss school system would fain endow the whole people.\r\nJust as their old agrarian system made land, so their new educational\r\nsystem is making intellectual training common to all. The powers it\r\nconfers are now, in a sense, common pastures, upon which all may keep\r\nflocks and herds; common forests, from which all may get fuel and\r\nbuilding-materials; and common garden ground, by the cultivation of\r\nwhich all may supply their wants. The quaint words of John Knox contain\r\na sentiment still potent in Switzerland, “That no father, of what\r\nestate or condition that ever he may be, can use his children at his\r\nown fantasie, especially in their youthhood; but all must be compelled\r\nto bring up their youth in learning and virtue.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL AND INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\n  “The noble craftsman we promote,\r\n    Disown the knave and fool;\r\n  Each honest man shall have his vote,\r\n    Each child shall have his school.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA French writer has compared a well-arranged plan of public instruction\r\n“to a railway system, with its main line, stations, junctions, and\r\nbranch lines. Just as passengers on a railway get out at the different\r\nstations, so the children who, from pecuniary necessity or social\r\nposition, are compelled to earn their livelihood leave school at\r\nany point of this course; all, according to the amount of knowledge\r\nthey have acquired, are able to take their place in the social\r\nstratification.”\r\n\r\nAs it is the duty and interest of railway managers to give facilities\r\nfor all classes of passengers, so it is the duty and interest of the\r\nstate to provide for all who travel the road of learning, leaving to\r\nthe operation of natural laws, in both cases, the fixing of proportions\r\nof way and through fares.\r\n\r\nEducation as the acquiring of information is one thing: it is quite\r\nanother thing to develop the human forces by a thoughtfully-planned\r\ncourse of training, mentally, physically, and morally fitting one\r\nfor “complete living.” Educational methods in every age have been\r\nthe outgrowth of the social conditions of the time, and are, as a\r\nrule, found to be in accordance with the beliefs and principles by\r\nwhich nations are controlled. A new definition of culture is being\r\nconstructed, one which shall embrace the industries and the mechanical\r\narts. Industrial processes and occupations are claiming recognition\r\nin school and college courses, both for the sake of the encouragement\r\nand assistance they may render to the industrial classes, and because\r\nthe familiarity with them is felt to be required by the wants and\r\ndemands of the age. It is not a rebellion against the old methods as\r\nbad in themselves. It does not necessarily interfere with or involve\r\nany loss to the traditional studies of the school-room. It is not an\r\nattempt to substitute the labors of the workshop for the legitimate\r\nintellectual training of the school, inasmuch as the shop-practice, if\r\nproperly arranged, would be in the nature of change and rest, and even\r\nof recreation to the pupil, bringing him back fresher and brighter to\r\nhis studies. The alternation is stimulating. Change of occupation is\r\nproverbially almost as refreshing as rest. The pupils pass from the\r\nshop to the class-room, and conversely, with a new zeal and zest for\r\ntheir tasks in either department. It means the addition of practice\r\nto theory, experiment to knowledge, the correct eye and skilful hand\r\nto the developed brain; that the youth sent forth from school shall\r\nbe fitted not only for professions and clerkships, but for the heat\r\nand task of active life, and for the skilled labor which is so sorely\r\nneeded. There exist much general misapprehension and no little grave\r\nmisrepresentation as to industrial schools and manual training, and an\r\nattempt in some quarters to confound them with the stupefying effect\r\nof long-continued toil. It is not contemplated to swing too far the\r\npendulum of school reform, or to present a panacea. It is proposed to\r\nsupplement the older scholastic culture with that which will make it\r\ntake a firmer hold upon men’s minds, and will bring the school into\r\ncloser harmony with the time-spirit. Let there be no interference, much\r\nless any extinction of the classical system. We have come to regard\r\nthat as a sacred thing and unassailable. Let it remain impregnable\r\nto all the attacks of iconoclasts and reformers. The Latin and Greek\r\nlanguages and the science of mathematics come recommended to us by\r\nall experience, signed and countersigned, as it were, by the testimony\r\nof ages as the basis of every system of liberal culture. They furnish\r\na grateful vicissitude of genial and severe studies; while the one\r\nawakens the sensibilities, refines the taste, enlarges the conception,\r\nenriches the memory, and invigorates the power of moral judgment; the\r\nother, by a course of mental gymnastics as rigid as it is perfect,\r\ndevelops to the utmost the great faculties of attention, analysis, and\r\ngeneralization. No scholar can doubt that they must always form an\r\nindispensable element in any scheme of liberal instruction, by which\r\nall the powers and emotions of our moral and intellectual nature may\r\nbe so touched, quickened, directed, exercised, and informed, as to\r\nattain their largest measure of capacity. But, side by side with the\r\nhigher institutions of learning, there should be established schools\r\nwhere the sciences in their relations to the arts and industries shall\r\nbe specific branches of instruction and training; the addition of a\r\nsufficient amount of work in the handling of tools and the manipulation\r\nof materials to a good sound education in languages, mathematics,\r\nhistory, and science. Young people should be prepared to take a\r\nbroad and intelligent part in the life of an age which is eminently\r\nscientific and practical; an age which has to do with a world of\r\nfierce competition, in which trade is not despised, while science of\r\nevery kind is a means of making a livelihood; an age which demands an\r\neducation that seeks to arm a man as well as to adorn him, _armer_ and\r\n_orner_. There is no warrant for applying the term educational to any\r\nsort of knowledge which does not increase the power of its possessor,\r\nand so make him the more able to satisfy his needs and desires without\r\ndisorder and waste. The measure of this ability is the measure of a\r\ncountry’s economic progress. Industrial training has an economical and\r\nmoral as well as an educational value. As Professor Huxley puts it, we\r\ncannot continue in this age “of full modern artillery to turn out our\r\nboys to do battle in it, equipped only with the sword and shield of an\r\nancient gladiator.”\r\n\r\nWith many education is looked upon merely as a mental training\r\nwhose sole object is to place the mind in a state fit to receive\r\nfuture impressions. This may be all very well for those who are\r\nnever to feel the keen struggle for existence; but for a vast and\r\nconstantly-increasing majority who are doomed to a bread-winning life,\r\nthe main purpose of education should be to make the youthful mind\r\n“a supple, effective, strong, and available instrument for whatever\r\npurpose it may be applied to.” Less than three per cent. of the boys\r\nof this country can hope to make a living by the practice of the\r\nprofessions. Less than twenty per cent. of the boys enter high schools,\r\nand less than half of those who enter complete the course. The first\r\nduty of man is to work, and the first object of education should be\r\nto fit him for that work; to make him not the slave but the master\r\nof what it has imparted, the manipulator and not the mere receptacle\r\nof its power. Every year adds to the necessity of supplementing the\r\nmuscular power of the laborer and artisan with that mental energy which\r\nonly comes of education. Men in the busy corners of the globe are\r\nmultiplying day by day, and multiplying more rapidly than the means\r\nof supporting life. Unskilled labor, or, as technically defined, the\r\n“labor of quantity,” is being ousted by the iron sinews and fiery pulse\r\nof the steam-engine and the machine. Man, as the mere owner of muscle,\r\nis being edged out by these most powerful competitors. Merely as an\r\nagent of physical force, as the possessor of the power of labor, the\r\nsteam-engine is a competitor which drives him easily out of the market,\r\nand more and more unskilled labor is passing away by the development of\r\nthe forces which mechanical science has discovered. As the world goes\r\non, we must expect mechanical force to be more varied, more powerful,\r\nand cheaper, and the competition of the human limbs to become more\r\nhelpless. But there is one region where the machine can never follow\r\nthe human being, and that is in the exercise of thought. In skill, in\r\nthe cultivation of the mind, in the power of applying the powers of\r\nthought to the laws of nature, in all that we call skilled labor of\r\nthe highest kind, in that man must always have a monopoly and need\r\nfear no encroachment. Science teaching, as applied to that instruction\r\nwhich familiarizes the student with the universe in which he lives,\r\nand makes him in the presence of the great laws and forces of nature\r\nnot a stranger, but a child at home, must be recognized as one of the\r\ngreat moulding influences of the time; it is at the foundation of\r\nmaterial progress; it is the basis on which much of the manufacturing\r\nindustry and commerce rests; many of the deep social ameliorations of\r\nthe day are due to its influence; and popular education must be brought\r\ninto closer relations with it. The industrial world has been made by\r\nscientific discovery, and its prosperity must largely depend on the\r\nspirit of scientific knowledge among the masses of its workers. It\r\nis only by the practical application of such knowledge to industrial\r\nprocesses that a country can hope to hold its own in the struggle\r\nof national competition. The genius of invention has succeeded in\r\nproducing by machinery cheap and serviceable imitations of almost every\r\nnecessary of life, hitherto the exclusive product of skilled labor. The\r\nartisan is daily becoming more and more the servant of automatic tools.\r\nEvery industry is tending to centralization in a few hands, and from\r\nhuman to mechanical hands. If the workshop is to compete successfully\r\nwith the factory, it must do so by superior taste and finish in that\r\nhigher sphere of methodical, technical, rational labor whither the\r\nfinest inventions cannot follow in the domain of thought. It is here,\r\nand only here, the laborer can hope to hold his own against the great\r\npower he has himself brought forth. It is here the means of increased\r\nsubsistence must be found. One of the most anxious subjects of public\r\ncare is to discover methods by which the masses of the people shall be\r\nable to maintain themselves in a prosperous, decent, and comfortable\r\ncondition. In bare, unskilled labor the satisfaction for this want is\r\nnot to be found. The Swiss have foreseen that the industrial victory\r\nmust be won on the intellectual field, the association of manual work\r\nwith technical training and scientific research; and the necessity\r\nfor that delicacy of touch and accuracy of eye, that have made their\r\nmechanics in many departments the best in the world, to be further\r\neducated and prepared for supremacy in a field of wider range and more\r\nvaried scope. In this way art may regain an influence over manufacture,\r\nwhich, though not lost, is certainly jeopardized by the introduction\r\nof machinery. The whole tendency of modern trade has been in the\r\ndirection of wholesale transactions, which, while favoring the hundred\r\nand the gross, have neglected the piece or the example. We miss in the\r\nmanufactures which we turn out the individual touch of the workman, and\r\nwe have gained a dead level of uninteresting achievement at the expense\r\nof intelligence, originality, and variety. The demand for old designs\r\nin furniture, or silver or iron work, pushed to undue excess, perhaps,\r\nby the caprice of fashion, is after all a healthy protest against the\r\nmonotonous and mindless excellence of the machine-made article. There\r\nis a difference between learning a trade and learning the principles\r\nof a trade. The object is not always to teach the “technic” of an\r\nindustry, because that can be done only in the workshop, but it may\r\nbe to teach the science and art upon which all technics are really\r\nbased. Manual training is of course training to manual labor, which has\r\nbeen called the “study of the external world.” While in all technical\r\neducation the sciences and arts must be illustrated by practical\r\nexamples, the main object is to so instruct masters and workmen\r\nthat they can pursue their craft with dignity and intelligence,\r\nwithout professing to teach the craft itself. The need for technical\r\ninstruction arises from the fact that ordinary educational systems are\r\nnot fitted to promote the rapid development of trade, manufactures, and\r\ncommerce. The education of the industrial classes should bear on their\r\noccupations in life. The life of a laborer is spent in dealing with\r\nthings which he has to convert into utilities. In this conversion he\r\nmust take the properties inherent to each kind of matter and convert\r\nthem into utilities by an intelligent application of forces, which\r\nhe may guide but cannot alter. No man can create new properties in\r\nmatter or subject it to the action of new forces. When working-men get\r\na higher life, a life of intelligence and knowledge, they then can\r\ndevelop improvements in their industries by an economical application\r\nof force, and a wise use of properties in material. Not mere handicraft\r\nskill, with ten fingers disassociated from the head and the heart,\r\ncan sustain mechanical industry. Machinery, when rightly understood\r\nand applied, will prove the greatest means of intellectual elevation,\r\nfor its very purpose is to substitute the thought of the brain for\r\nthe toil of the hand and the sweat of the brow. How excellent the\r\nold Greek poet is when natural forces are made substitutes for human\r\nlabor: “Woman!” he exclaims, “you have hitherto had to grind corn, let\r\nyour arms rest for the future! It is no longer for you that the birds\r\nannounce by their songs the dawn of the morning. Ceres has ordered the\r\nwater nymphs to move the mill-stones and perform your labor.” Technical\r\neducation is to train the pupils to handiness; to supplement mental\r\nactivity with physical dexterity. The object of teaching girls to sew\r\nis not necessarily to train professional dress-makers, but to make\r\nthem careful and tidy in their homes. Workshop instruction is not to\r\nmake boys carpenters and cabinet-makers, but to enable them to learn\r\nany trade more easily and make them generally handy. It is no small\r\npart of the value of such training that the workman may be fitted to\r\nrender his home more commodious, to arrange a shelf or cupboard, to\r\nrepair a broken piece of furniture, or possibly to decorate his humble\r\nhome. But whether or not, in after years, the student sees proper to\r\nbecome or by necessity is driven to a professional use of his technical\r\nknowledge, this is not involved in the idea and system of its pursuit.\r\nIts purpose is that, when he leaves school, he shall carry with him\r\nan education serviceable for any occupation of life; to develop a\r\ndexterity of hand which will prove valuable under any circumstances,\r\nand at the same time furnish him with a means of healthy enjoyment. It\r\nis a simple recognition of the fact that a large number of the children\r\nmust be destined to make their living by industrial labor. There is\r\ncertainly something in the operation of learning a trade that is akin\r\nto capitalizing. The youth works in the training-school, and he defers\r\nto the future the final results of the process. He lays up wealth, as\r\nit were, by doing that which avails only to give him a larger income\r\nhereafter. It is much as if he put money into the banks. It has always\r\nappeared as though a purely scholastic education makes children averse\r\nto manual labor; that it results too much in every boy and girl leaving\r\nschool desirous of engaging in work which is neither manual nor, what\r\nis mistermed, menial. It brings too often to expectant parents the\r\ndisappointment experienced by Sir Francis Pedant, in Fielding’s comedy;\r\nthat gentleman, it will be remembered, was very angry when he found\r\nthat, instead of instilling into his boy at Oxford, as per contract,\r\n“a tolerable knowledge of stock jobbery,” his tutor had fraudulently\r\ncrammed him with the works of all the logicians and metaphysicians from\r\n“the great Aristotle down to the learned modern Burgersdicius.” “Have I\r\nbeen at all this expense,” exclaimed Sir Avarice, piteously, “to breed\r\na philosopher?”\r\n\r\nAs a fundamental rule, it may be accepted that the knowledge which is\r\nbest for use is also best for discipline, since any other supposition,\r\nas Herbert Spencer has shown, would “be utterly contrary to the\r\nbeautiful economy of nature, if one kind of culture were needed for\r\nthe gaining of information, and another kind were needed as a mental\r\ngymnastic.” The best end of any education is to equip boys and girls\r\nto earn their own living when they grow up, and to perform efficiently\r\nthe duties to which they may be called when they reach the estate of\r\nmanhood and womanhood; giving them that most valuable of all gifts\r\non earth--personal independence--the capacity to stand on their own\r\nfeet and look the world in the face, to take care of themselves, and\r\nthose who belong to them. The question of technical and industrial\r\neducation has received much intelligent consideration and very\r\nextensive application in Switzerland. Since 1884 the Confederation, to\r\nencourage the existing technical schools as well as the establishment\r\nof new ones, has been granting annual subsidies, which are becoming\r\nmore and more liberal. The Polytechnic at Zurich, to which reference\r\nhas been made in the previous chapter, is now well known as a model\r\nschool of practical life, with mechanics, physics, and arts under a\r\nthoroughly scientific curriculum. Trade and industrial schools, as\r\ndistinguished from polytechnical,--genuine establishments for teaching\r\nhomely trades,--have been made a prominent as well as a compulsory\r\nfeature in many of the Swiss educational systems. In some form these\r\nare to be found in every Canton, furnishing instruction in one or more\r\nbranches of handiwork,--the boys preparing to become skilled workmen\r\nand competent foremen; and many a girl, though an indifferent scholar,\r\nby being taught cutting, needle-work, cooking, nursing, and methodical\r\nhabits--accomplishments that bear so closely upon the happiness and the\r\nvery existence of home--will enable her to be a useful wife and good\r\nmother. Trade-schools in Switzerland are of ancient origin, having an\r\nintimate connection with the great impulse which the watch industry of\r\nFrench Switzerland received in the latter half of the last century. In\r\nthe year 1770 a journeyman watchmaker, named Louis Faigare, applied to\r\nProfessor Saussure for some information connected with his trade, which\r\nthe then means of ordinary public instruction did not afford to his\r\nclass. The professor accommodated him, and from this resulted a series\r\nof lectures, or rather _conversaziones_, held in the great scientist’s\r\ndrawing-room. The audience increasing to such proportions, it was\r\nfound advisable to secure suitable quarters, and a club was formally\r\norganized under the title of _Société des Arts de Genève_. This club,\r\nso modest in its inception, has survived all the mighty political\r\ntempests of a troubled age,--the violent annexation of the Genevese\r\nrepublic to France and its restoration to the Helvetic union,--and\r\nto-day enjoys a high rank among learned societies, and numbers in its\r\nlist of members some of the most eminent names of modern science. This\r\nis the parent of the celebrated Horological School in Geneva, with\r\nits branches at Chaux-de-Fonds, Neuchâtel, Biel, Fleurier, and St.\r\nImier. Pupils are received in these schools when they have passed their\r\nfourteenth year, and the course is from three to four and one-half\r\nyears. For the artistic education, there is a special school devoted\r\nentirely to the art of decorating watches, which has become a very\r\nimportant branch of the industry.\r\n\r\nThere is also in Geneva a school of industrial art, the organization\r\nand work of which are substantially the same as the one at Munich,\r\nand the two are considered the best in Europe. This school is under\r\nthe direction and administration of the Council of State of the\r\nCanton, which delegates one of its members to act as president of the\r\ncommission which administers its affairs. Two classes of students are\r\nadmitted, viz., regular scholars, who attend regularly and continuously\r\neither a general course of art study or some particular branch, such\r\nas carving, bronze founding, goldsmith’s work, etc.; and special\r\nstudents, apprentices, workmen, and others who arrange to receive\r\ninstruction at stated hours. The pupils produce work which has a\r\ncommercial value, and objects made in the school are kept for sale, a\r\npart of the money thus received being paid to the student executing the\r\nwork. The courses of study embrace modelling and carving in plaster,\r\nstone, and wood; _repoussé_ work in metals; painting in water-color, in\r\nenamel, and on china; casting and chasing of bronze and the precious\r\nmetals; work in wrought iron and engraving, besides the regular work of\r\ndrawing-schools in general, such as drawing from the cast, from plants\r\nand flowers, and from the living model. The school occupies a very\r\nfine and spacious building, erected a few years ago at a cost of about\r\n$160,000, and is furnished with very admirable and adequate appliances,\r\nnot only for study but for the execution of art-work on a considerable\r\nscale. The pupils are of both sexes, and there is no distinction of\r\nor separation between them in the organization of the classes. The\r\ndiscipline of the school is very strict, the time of each pupil coming\r\nin and going out being carefully noted, and the utmost regularity of\r\nattendance, during the hours covered by his course, being required of\r\neach pupil. All the regular pupils are also required to attend the\r\nevening schools of the city. Encouragement and recognition of ability\r\nand application are made in the form of prizes, which are awarded by\r\nmeans of competition or _concours_ held at different times, and on such\r\nsubjects as are announced from time to time. The methods of study and\r\ndiscipline are all sensible and practical.\r\n\r\nMore humble in their first stages, but scarcely inferior as to\r\npractical results, are the Swiss straw-platting schools. These have\r\nsucceeded, in a few years, in developing a veritable new industry,\r\ncommanding markets in the utmost corners of the earth. Some of the\r\npoorest portions of the sub-Alpine districts have become well-to-do\r\nand flourishing, and at least one little hamlet, not to be found in\r\nthe guide-books a few years ago, is now from this trade a thrifty\r\ntown of some ten thousand inhabitants. The higher instruction in this\r\nparticular industry extends to the cultivation and acclimatization\r\nof various kinds of foreign grasses, furnishing from the coarsest to\r\nthe finest qualities of straw. In the mountain districts there are\r\nschools for teaching the manufacture of children’s toys, for which the\r\nSwiss pine is admirably adapted. Then, in those sections where osiers\r\n(a species of willow) can be cultivated, establishments for learning\r\nbasket-making have been started. In Zurich there is a “Dressmakers’\r\nInstitute,” from which annually “graduate” thirty to forty _Couturières\r\nParisiennes_. At Winterthur there is a shoemakers’ school, with a\r\nperipatetic staff of professors who give lessons wherever a class may\r\nbe formed. This school also issues publications relating to its aims,\r\none of the latest being quite an exhaustive and scientific treatise on\r\nthe structure of the human foot, and giving the technical side of the\r\nnew government regulations concerning the manufacture of army boots and\r\nshoes.\r\n\r\nOther handicrafts have followed the example set by the shoemakers. The\r\njoiners, cabinet-makers, silk-weavers, jewellers, and even to umbrellas\r\nand parasols, each have their cheap and, in many cases, free-training\r\nschools. The knit goods of Switzerland, so largely imported to the\r\nUnited States, do not owe their introduction to cheap Swiss labor, but\r\nsimply to their superior quality, the result of the excellent training\r\nall girls obtain at school; knitting being regarded as an indispensable\r\nacquirement. Drawing, industrial as distinguished from artistic, is\r\ntaught in all Swiss schools; not as an accomplishment, but as of\r\nparamount utility. It is considered that “drawing” lies at the bottom\r\nof all industrial training, enabling one to delineate with precision\r\nthat which he wishes to express better than he can do it with the\r\nlanguage of the pen. In his “Proposed Hints for an Academy,” Benjamin\r\nFranklin classed “drawing” with the three “R’s” as subjects necessary\r\nfor all. It ranks with them because it is the language of form in every\r\nbranch of industry from the most simple to the complex. It makes the\r\nworkman more exact, more efficient, and more careful; it is always\r\nconvenient and often very useful. A trade which, either by law or\r\nimmemorial usage, is assumed to require a more exacting apprenticeship\r\nis wood-carving; a Swiss product that enjoys world-wide reputation,\r\nand has long been a source of considerable revenue to the country.\r\nThe schools for wood-carving have a fully organized faculty, and the\r\nword faculty is used advisedly, for the classes have an almost amusing\r\nresemblance to an academic course. There are lectures with manipulatory\r\ndemonstrations in the use of the plane, saw, lathe, and all needed\r\ntools, and also on the distinctive characteristics of various woods.\r\nA school for ornamental work and design in wood-carving at Brienz is\r\nsupported by the Canton; and at Interlaken the wood-workers enjoy,\r\nfree of charge, the services of a “Master Modeller,” furnished by the\r\nCanton. There are separate schools for the study of wood-engraving,\r\nsculpture, and art cabinet-making. The agricultural and forestry\r\ndepartments of the Polytechnic, in its “technology,” as signifying\r\nscience applied to industrial arts, has advanced these interests to\r\npositions that otherwise could never have been attained. Switzerland\r\nin physical respects is not a bountiful motherland, neither the\r\nclimate nor soil is good for agriculture, yet it is surprising what\r\ngood results are obtained through the general diffusion among the\r\nagricultural class of much technical information, susceptible of easy\r\napprehension and ready application. Swiss agriculture, to make any\r\nreturn, cannot be a mechanical routine, but must be intelligent if not\r\nscientific.\r\n\r\nWhat is known as practical farming would not return the seed and labor\r\ninvolved. As an intelligently and scientifically-directed industry,\r\nit has assumed a prosperous and profitable condition. The agricultural\r\ncourse in the Polytechnic is thorough and comprehensive. It covers\r\nthe mechanical and chemical composition of the soil; the scientific\r\nbasis as to the rotation of crops; the periods of growth at which\r\nplants take their nitrogen; how draining improves land; and many other\r\nsimilar matters varied in their application, but ruled by fixed laws,\r\nand which must be learned outside the daily experience and observation\r\nof farm-life. In the single crop of grass, which is of such great\r\nvalue in its relation to the extensive Swiss dairy interest, in its\r\ncultivation, grazing, and harvesting, the suggestions and counsel\r\nemanating from the agricultural department of the Polytechnic have\r\nbeen of incalculable value. The amount of this crop, from a cold and\r\nbarren soil, and the uses to which it is turned would seem incredible\r\nto the American farmer. The Swiss farmer, to accomplish so much,\r\nmust know something of the chemical analysis of the grass, both in\r\nthe natural and dried state; the feeding value of like weight in the\r\ndifferent varieties, in an equally moist or dry condition; the final\r\nstage of growth which they ought to be allowed to attain; suitability\r\nfor permanent or other pastures; the adaptability of grasses for\r\ncertain soil; their duration, ability to resist drouth, and strength\r\nto over-power weeds. Then come questions of hay-making, ensilage,\r\nthe management of old and new grass-lands; on these and many others\r\nthe peasant is enlightened and constantly advised, not only by the\r\nPolytechnic but from cantonal agricultural schools at Rütte (Bern),\r\nStrickhof (Zurich), Sursee (Luzern), and at Brugg (Aargau). There is\r\nan institution for experimental vine growing at Lausanne; a school of\r\ngardening at Geneva; and dairy schools at Sornthal (St. Gallen), and\r\nTrayveaux (Freiburg). From time to time lectures and short courses of\r\ninstruction are given in different parts of the country on horticulture\r\nand vineculture, fodder-growing, cattle-breeding, by which some\r\nknowledge of the theory and technical details of agricultural science\r\nis given, with the view of awakening a spirit of enterprise in the more\r\nremote districts of the country. Forest culture and forest preservation\r\nmay be considered a necessity in Switzerland, for its influence in\r\nchecking the sudden and disastrous floods so common in the mountain\r\nstreams, and in the protection and maintenance of the steep hill-sides\r\nwhich constitute so large a portion of the agricultural area of the\r\ncountry. While riparian trees are gross water-users, and usually\r\ndeciduous, such as the sycamores, alders, willows, cottonwoods, etc.,\r\nupon the mountains the trees are of a different class, and their effect\r\nis without known exception beneficial to irrigators and water-users in\r\nthe valleys below. The denudation of mountain districts is followed\r\nby increased torrent or flood action and diminished regular flow in\r\nsprings and streams, often by the entire desiccation of these. There\r\nis a department in the Polytechnic devoted to forestry, from which is\r\nsupplied a large body of thoroughly educated foresters, who find ready\r\nemployment under the federal and cantonal forest departments.[75] The\r\ncourse of study is of the most advanced character, and requires three\r\nyears for its completion. There are, besides, many local and primary\r\nforest schools, having spring and autumn terms of three to four weeks\r\neach, and they are assisted by federal subsidy. By a federal law of\r\n1885, there was added to the forest department of the Polytechnic, a\r\nschool for forest experiment connected with meteorological stations,\r\nthereby supplementing this already excellent school with the means of\r\naccurate, scientific, and regular meteorological observations, in their\r\nclose and important alliance with matters of forest culture.\r\n\r\nIt is under the supervision of these educated foresters and trained\r\nwood-rangers that, on the mountain-side, apparently but a forbidding\r\nrock, by constant, careful, and scientific attention, are found\r\noak-, beech-, birch-, and pine-trees in large quantities and of good\r\ndimensions. Each tree is carefully looked after and preserved, and\r\ntrained so that they shall not interfere with each other; each has its\r\nfair share of space and light. In this work nature and man’s labor and\r\nthought give to the forest an abundance of moisture, and between the\r\nfrequent storms and showers, abundant floods of sunlight and warmth.\r\nIt is this intelligent care and attention that enables a tree to take\r\nroot and grow to its normal size on what is apparently little more\r\nthan towering and weird piles of sheer rocks. The vast treeless West\r\nand the reckless wasteful deforesting of American woodlands will soon\r\nrender forest culture and protection a necessity in the United States.\r\nNever was a country so lavishly supplied with forest flora of all the\r\nqualities in all gradations. No country ever used its wood materials\r\nso lavishly; squandering a wealth of timbers before its true value was\r\nknown. It is time to husband the remnant with more intelligence and\r\nto stop its wasteful destruction. Why should sylviculture not present\r\nan inviting field for business enterprise, or be quite as fascinating\r\nto watch the development of a collection of trees as that of a herd\r\nor flock? Our landholders, who are accustomed to garner crops in a\r\nhundred days from planting, have a natural shrinking from a seed which\r\nmay not mature a crop in a hundred years. But it can be shown that\r\ngrowing wood on waste-lands enhances the value of the remainder of\r\nthe farm by more than the planting and care have cost; and that the\r\nfirst instalment of a forest-crop is not so remote as is generally\r\nbelieved. The best varieties of wood can be grown as easily as the\r\npoorest, and the demand for certain forest products is rapidly becoming\r\nmore urgent. The tree-growth enriches rather than impoverishes the\r\nground. Forestry not only beautifies the farm, but between woodland\r\nand plough-land is established that balance which must be preserved\r\nto insure the most equitable distribution of moisture and climatic\r\nconditions most favorable to the productiveness of the soil and the\r\nbetter health of the people. Almost every Commune in Switzerland has\r\nits _realschule_, where children from the primary school have the\r\nopportunity of a higher education, specially adapted to fit them for\r\ncommercial and industrial life. These schools take the place of the old\r\nand now practically extinct system of apprenticeship. The handiwork\r\nand technical schools embrace instruction in drawing, modelling,\r\npractical reckoning, elements of geometry (especially surface and\r\nbody measurements), book-keeping in French and German, physics,\r\nchemistry, and technological branches, ceramics, and _aquarelle_.\r\nThe schools for girls include singing, drawing, fancy or handiwork,\r\nletter-writing, book-keeping, casting accounts, sewing by hand and\r\nmachine, dress-making (pressing, cutting, and trimming), besides a\r\nknowledge of different kinds of wares, how to tend plants and flowers,\r\nand even the art of treating the sick and wounded. From these schools\r\nall have access to the Polytechnic, where each professor is an\r\nacknowledged authority in the branch of service with which he deals. In\r\nall the higher schools and universities every encouragement is given to\r\nstudents to qualify themselves for technical pursuits. The secret of\r\nSwitzerland’s material success lies in the liberality of its conception\r\nof public education. Its primary schools are graded with good secondary\r\nschools for scientific education, and these lead to remarkable\r\ntechnical institutions with great completeness of organization. If\r\nany country appears by nature unfit for manufactures it is surely\r\nSwitzerland. Cut off from the rest of Europe by frowning mountains,\r\nhaving no sea-coast and removed therefore from all the fruits of\r\nmaritime enterprise, having no coal or other sources of mineral wealth,\r\nSwitzerland might have degenerated into a brave semi-civilized nation\r\nlike Montenegro. Instead of this it proudly competes with all Europe\r\nand America in industries for which it has to purchase from them the\r\nraw materials and even the coal, the source of power necessary to\r\nconvert them into utilities. Other countries have become sensible of\r\nthe superiority which skilled education can confer, and they have not\r\nbeen slow to take advantage of it. The United States are justly proud\r\nof their common-school systems as they exist in the several States.\r\nThey have done a great deal for public education, and are progressing\r\nby their own force and by the general sympathy of the community. Mr.\r\nEdward Atkinson, in summing up the elements that have contributed to\r\nthe vast gain in the conditions of material welfare in the United\r\nStates, names seven, and assigns the third position in importance to\r\nthe “systems of common schools which are now extending throughout the\r\nland.” The tendency to be guarded against is that in education as\r\napplied to the whole mass of the people, what is desirable and charming\r\nand decorative be not put before what is absolutely useful; not to take\r\nthe garnish first and leave the solid meat to take care of itself.\r\nWhen it comes to deal with the large masses of the community who must\r\nwork, and to whom it is, so to speak, a matter of life and death, the\r\nquestion to be considered is whether they shall work well prepared\r\nwith the utmost assistance which the accumulated knowledge and skill\r\nof the community can give them, or whether each man shall be left to\r\nfight his own way and learn his own industry for himself. The country\r\nwants more handicraftsmen, the school produces too many scriveners.\r\nThe country is crying out for skilled laborers, and the school sends it\r\nclerks or would-be gentlemen of leisure. The farmers and working men\r\nwant wives who can make a home neat and happy, and who understand the\r\nwise economy of limited resources, and the school sends them women fit\r\nonly to be governesses. The system of education in the United States\r\nsends too many boys into trading, teaching, the professions, or “living\r\nby their wits.” They imbibe a spirit that shuns what are termed the\r\n“humble callings,” and crowd, at starvation wages, the occupations of\r\nthe counter and desk. They grow up to feel and believe that the bread\r\nwhich has been gained by the sweat of the brow is less honorably earned\r\nthan that which is the product of mechanical quill-driving. Therefore\r\nthe United States have a plethora of men who, as described by President\r\nGarfield, are “learned so-called, who know the whole gamut of classical\r\nlearning, who have sounded the depths of mathematical and speculative\r\nphilosophy, and yet who could not harness a horse or make out a bill\r\nof sale, if their lives depended upon it.” There is need of a public\r\neducation that, while it gives to the mind fleet and safe modes of\r\nreasoning, shall at the same time, in a corresponding degree, develop a\r\nclear sight, a firm arm, and a training suitable for the various trades\r\nand occupations which are essential elements of a prosperous national\r\nlife. The utility of such acquirements is not their chief virtue;\r\nit is their permanence in the mental armory, for eyes and hands not\r\nonly respond to cultivation as readily as brains, but the trained eye\r\nand skilled hand do not slough off their acquirements like the weary\r\nbrain. All through the United States scientifically and technically\r\ntrained foreigners, fresh from their “_realschulen_,” are pushing out\r\nclassically-educated young men from their desks and stools and taking\r\nthe places of profit which belong to them by national inheritance.\r\nAmerican spirit, capacity, and energy are unrivalled, and require only\r\nan equal training and opportunity to insure an earnest of unbounded\r\nsuccess in establishing and maintaining the future eminence of the\r\ncountry in the world’s great field of human art and human industry.\r\n\r\nThe question of manual and industrial instruction is not confined in\r\nits interest only to those connected with the organization of schools\r\nand systems of education, as bearing entirely on the development\r\nand activity of the whole circle of intellectual faculties, but it\r\nrelates to a deep and far-reaching political problem that thoughtful\r\nstatesmen contemplate with serious concern. Might not the spirit of\r\ncheerful domestic industry, which the extension of educated handiwork\r\nis calculated to promote, do much to correct the evils of intemperance,\r\nviolence, and social discontent which are assuming such alarming\r\nsymptoms? The moral influence it exerts might produce a revolution for\r\nthe better and a well-ordered commonwealth of labor. The habits of\r\norder, exactness, and perseverance fostered by manual training have an\r\nincalculable moral value. The ranks of the unemployed and misery and\r\ncrime are largely recruited from the ranks of youth who are without any\r\nadequate training to earn an honest livelihood. With a more general\r\ndissemination of the rudiments of useful trades and employments there\r\nwould be secured a larger share to productive labor,--for it would put\r\nbrains into it and make it alike more honorable and profitable. It\r\nwould tend to remove whatever disadvantage has heretofore attached to\r\nindustrial occupations on grounds of dignity and the niceties of the\r\nsocial scale. When young America is trained for mechanical pursuits\r\nunder the same roof and amid the same surroundings as he is trained for\r\npreaching and pleading, when he is made to feel at school that the same\r\ndistinction is to be earned by skilful doing as by skilful dosing, the\r\nnecessity for all the more or less sincere, but very wordy, extolling\r\nof the dignity of labor, which employs so much of our energy at\r\npresent, will be removed. And when the mechanic has acquired industrial\r\nskill, not at the expense of his mental training, but along with it\r\nand as a necessary part of it, the crafts themselves will assume the\r\nold dignity and importance which once they had, but which they have\r\nlost in these days of false and foolish artificial standards by which\r\nmen measure each other. The units or grains of society are continually\r\nmoving to and fro between the scum and the dregs, from capital to labor\r\nand labor to capital, from wealth to poverty and poverty to wealth. But\r\nrich and poor, professional and artisan alike, have a common interest\r\nin strengthening the bulwarks against the dangers that menace honest\r\nsociety,--against nihilism, socialism, communism, and all kinds of\r\nvagabondage. Educated industry is the talisman. The strength of the\r\nrepublican pyramid is in its base, and it is in the lower social layer\r\nthat the true character of a country’s need in common-school education\r\nmust be looked for. A Nihilist lecturer recently stated that there are\r\nfour hundred schools in Europe whose sole work is to teach the use\r\nof explosives. If the Old World is thus diligently sowing the seeds\r\nof discontent and rebellion, scattering some of them on our own too\r\nprolific soil, teaching that to brute-force alone can humanity look for\r\nthe redress of its wrongs, how much more necessary it becomes to show\r\nthe world that not in killing each other, but in helping each other\r\nto live, is the only possible solution of social difficulties. Unless\r\nthe school can teach respect for labor, it will never be learned, and\r\nunless it is learned, and learned practically, the upheavals which of\r\nlate years have disturbed society will grow in frequency and violence.\r\nPericles, the great Athenian, describing the glory of the community of\r\nwhich he was so illustrious a member, said, “We, of Athens, are lovers\r\nof the beautiful, yet simple in our tastes; we cultivate the mind\r\nwithout loss of manliness.” But Athenian society rested on slavery,\r\nand the drudgery was performed by those who had no share in the good\r\nthings which the citizens could enjoy. Our object should be to bring\r\nPericlean ideas of beauty, simplicity, and cultivation of mind within\r\nreach of those who do the hard work of the world. It can be done,\r\nand should be done, in a way to advance the skill and develop to the\r\nhighest form of practical energy the skill of our handicraftsman and\r\nthe manliness of his life; giving him an education that will enlarge\r\nhis mind, improve his morals, instruct his industry, and thereby\r\nadvance the power, the prosperity, and the peace of the State. The\r\nfuture will, practically speaking, belong to the technically educated,\r\nfor no amount of natural “smartness” can compete with education in\r\nparticularities. Raw material, forming a capital advantage, has been\r\ngradually equalized in price and made available to all by improvements\r\nin locomotion; and henceforth industry must be sustained, not by a\r\ncompetition of local and popularly designated “natural advantages,” but\r\nby the inexorable competition of intellect in all of its manifold and\r\noverpowering evolution. If a country would not be left behind in the\r\nrace, if it desires to find any satisfactory solution for the deepest\r\nand most inscrutable problem of the time, if it wishes a complex and\r\nhigh civilization, to be maintained secure from all the dangers which\r\nthe presence of unprosperous and unfed millions must bring upon a\r\ncountry, it should do its utmost to give a healthy and wide development\r\nto the industrial education of the masses; such systematic instruction\r\nas shall enable them to carry to the factory, to the laboratory,\r\nto the quarry, to the mine, to the farm, that scientific knowledge\r\nwhich is required to deduce practice from theory, to give dignity as\r\nwell as efficiency to labor, and to connect abstract principles with\r\nthe industrial pursuits of life; in a word, to provide an education\r\nwhich will develop for each man and woman the faculties that nature\r\nhas given in such a manner that they may be as active and profitable\r\nand prosperous members of the community as possible; an education\r\nbeautiful by its adaptment, subservient by its use, and salutary by\r\nits application; an education that teaches in what way to utilize\r\nthose sources of happiness which nature supplies, and how to use all\r\nthe faculties to the greatest advantage of ourselves and others; an\r\neducation that heeds the advice of Professor James Blake: “Let us\r\nhead-train the hand-worker and hand-train the head-worker. For manual\r\nand head-training together form the only education. Apart from the\r\npractical advantages, it has an ethical value in enabling men and women\r\nto use all their faculties, for no man can distort himself by exclusive\r\nattention to one order of faculties, and especially by neglecting to\r\nkeep good balance between the two fundamental co-ordinates of his\r\nbeing, body and mind, without finding the distortion repeating itself\r\nin moral obtuseness and disorder.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nINDUSTRY AND COMMERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a popular mistake that Switzerland, industrially, occupies\r\na stagnant condition in the scale of nations, and exists for\r\npicturesqueness alone. It is equally a mistake to think that its main\r\nstaples are wood-carving and hotel-keeping. The circumstances which\r\nso long prohibited any advance in commerce and agriculture are to be\r\nfound in the peculiarities of the physical character of the country\r\nand the absence of capital. Switzerland had no sources of mineral nor,\r\nunder the conditions of former times, of agricultural wealth. It could\r\nnot maintain a large population on its own resources; nor could it\r\nhave cities, the inhabitants of which, either like those of Flanders,\r\nby the easy terms upon which they might get the raw materials, could\r\nhave manufactured for others; or like those of Venice, Genoa, and of\r\nthe cities of Holland, might have become common carriers. They could\r\nhave had no commerce, except with their surplus cheese. The amount\r\nof this that could be spared was so small, and the transportation so\r\ndifficult, that but little could be made of it, and the whole of this\r\nlittle was wanted for the necessaries of life,--such as the useful\r\nmetals, etc.,--which the Swiss were obliged to procure from abroad.\r\nThere was no margin for saving, and so there could be no accumulations\r\nof capital. For long ages the most assiduous industry could supply\r\nthe Swiss with only the necessaries of life, and barely with them,\r\neven when aided by the surplus cheese. Agriculturists in a rude way,\r\nthey lived on the land which supported them and their families,\r\nand feeling no further pressing need, their untrained intelligence\r\ncould form no conception of the advantages of the social union and\r\ncommercial interdependence of a more civilized state of society. This\r\ncondition no longer exists. By the aid of new means of transportation\r\nand communication, and by the substitution of machinery for manual\r\nlabor, the motive power for which nature furnishes in abundance, the\r\npeople are becoming prosperous and capital is accumulating. For many\r\nages the poorest country in Europe, it is rapidly progressing towards\r\nbecoming, in proportion to the amount of its population, one of the\r\nrichest. The position taken to-day by Switzerland in the trade and\r\ncommerce of the world is remarkable, when the various natural obstacles\r\nare considered,--such as absence of raw material for its industries,\r\ngreat distance from the sea-coast, with costly and difficult means of\r\ntransportation, and restrictive customs established by neighboring\r\ncountries. It does not possess a single coal-mine, canal, or navigable\r\nstream. It is practically dependent for all its metals on foreign\r\nsupply. Asphalt is the only raw mineral product the export of which\r\nexceeds the import, and this is found only in the Canton of Neuchâtel,\r\nwhere the output is very large and of a superior quality. Inland,\r\nwithout ships or seaport, and therefore deprived of the advantages\r\nof direct exportation and importation, its commerce must be effected\r\nthrough the four conterminous countries of France, Germany, Austria,\r\nand Italy. Therefore, while every mart in the world is familiar with\r\nits manufactures, it is almost ignored in the commercial statistics\r\nof nations. The high protective policy so universally adopted by the\r\nneighboring countries, where for a long time the best markets for\r\nSwiss goods were found, has forced the Swiss manufacturers to extend\r\ntheir trade to transmarine markets, involving not only a vast amount\r\nof competition, but far more risk and uncertainty attending sales\r\nthan in doing business in markets nearer home. Then four-fifths of\r\nthe Swiss exports to countries other than the contiguous ones consist\r\nof silk goods, embroideries, and watches, which may be classed, in\r\na general sense, as luxuries; and, in seeking a foreign market,\r\nencounter the highest duty. On the other hand, its importations are\r\ncotton, machinery, cereals, food-supply, and raw materials for its\r\nmanufacturers,--that will not admit of a corresponding heavy import\r\nduty. The remedy heretofore partially found in special commercial\r\ntreaties has become almost futile by the rapid blocking of the\r\nprovisions of the “most favored nation” clauses. These have practically\r\nlost their purpose and force by each party to the treaty persisting\r\nin the enlargement and accentuation of its own customs provisions. In\r\nan address recently delivered by the President of the Confederation,\r\nat a national agricultural exposition, referring to the depression\r\nof that industry, he said: “The political existence of Switzerland\r\nis at present not threatened or endangered from any quarter, but it\r\nis different with its economical existence, which causes us from day\r\nto day increased solicitude on account of the increase of unjust\r\nburdens imposed at all our neighboring frontiers. The first to feel\r\nthis condition were our manufacturers, who demanded a tariff of\r\nretaliation, and now the farmers complain that they are suffering from\r\na denial of the same protection. Indeed, we are to-day the witnesses\r\nof an eager race in the parliaments of many countries to raise the\r\nduties on importations from their neighboring states until the wall\r\nis so high that nothing can pass. Is this to be the grand coronation\r\nof the labor and civilization of the nineteenth century,--the century\r\nof steam, electricity, the piercing of the St. Gothard, the Suez and\r\nPanama canals? No! Such a condition cannot endure. Let me express the\r\nhope that the time will come when, from the excess of the evil, good\r\nwill result; that the people will realize that such a condition leads\r\nto general poverty, while liberty of exchange is the surest foundation\r\nof general prosperity.”\r\n\r\nWith these great natural and artificial obstacles to contend with,\r\nSwitzerland is nevertheless a commercial and manufacturing state. Its\r\nindustries are prosperous and show a constantly-increasing vitality\r\nand importance, and its citizens are growing rich and famous in the\r\ncommerce of Europe. Its silks, ribbons, embroideries, braided straws,\r\nwatches, and cheese go to every quarter of the globe. There is no\r\nstate in Europe in which there is so great a general trade per head of\r\npopulation. The commerce of Italy, with a population nearly ten times\r\ngreater, is only about double that of Switzerland; and the difference\r\nbetween Austrian and Swiss commerce is even still more remarkable. The\r\nsilk industry is the oldest in Switzerland, being already established\r\nat Zurich and Basel in the latter half of the thirteenth century.\r\nTicino is the only Canton where there are filatures for reeling the\r\ncocoon into silk. Italy, China, and Japan are the great sources\r\nof supply of raw materials to the silk manufacturers,--the former\r\nsupplying nearly four-fifths of all the organzines; of the raw silk,\r\nthe supply comes largely from Yokohama. Cotton began to be manufactured\r\nin Switzerland in the fifteenth century, and power-loom weaving was\r\nintroduced in 1830. Twisting, spinning and white-goods weaving, and\r\ncotton printing are of very considerable importance. Embroidered goods\r\nhave attained a great development, and furnish a heavy export trade\r\nfrom eastern Switzerland, especially in the Cantons of St. Gallen and\r\nAppenzell. Little of this beautiful work is now done by hand, machinery\r\nhaving reached marvellous perfection. Aniline colors, the wonderful\r\ndyes which the skill of modern chemists has evolved from bituminous\r\ntar, and the manufacture of flavoring extracts, from the products of\r\ncoal-tar and petroleum, constitute a thriving export business at Basel.\r\nWatchmaking is essentially a Swiss industry, and has been the most\r\nimportant industry in Geneva since 1587, and by a combination with\r\njewellers, making a union between mechanical industry and art, has\r\ngiven Geneva a world-wide reputation.[76] Watchmaking is done entirely\r\nby piece-work, and sixty master workmen are required to make a single\r\nwatch. The work is divided among so many different persons, each one\r\nof whom makes a specialty of one particular piece, and spends his\r\nlife making duplicates of this. The work is performed in the people’s\r\nhouses, the fronts of which present an uninterrupted row of windows\r\narranged without intermediate spaces, as the object is to admit all the\r\nlight possible. Every member of the family assists in some way. When\r\nthe house is put to rights, the wife drags a table to the window, gets\r\nout her magnifying-glass, and goes to work on a watch-spring.[77] If\r\nthere be a son or daughter, each produces his quota. These different\r\nparts, when gathered up by the watch merchant, are found to fit each\r\nits special place with mathematical niceness.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss federal custom-house returns classify all imports and exports\r\nunder three chief heads, viz., “live-stock,” “_ad valorem_ goods,” and\r\n“goods taxed per quintal.” No returns are published of the value of\r\neither the imports or exports, but only the quantities are given. The\r\nprincipal imports are grain and flour, cattle for slaughter, sugar,\r\ncoffee, fruit, poultry, eggs, and wine; all being articles of food.\r\nOf textile stuffs, silk, cotton, and woollen. Other articles include\r\nchemicals for industrial purposes, leather and leather goods, hosiery\r\nand ready-made clothes, iron and iron ware, live animals, coal and\r\ncoke, other metals and hardware, including machinery, wood, furniture,\r\npetroleum, gold and silver bullion for coinage. Cattle, horses, wheat,\r\nand flour are imported from Austria-Hungary; raw cotton from the\r\nUnited States and Egypt; manufactured cotton goods from England; wool\r\nchiefly from Germany; coal from the Rhine districts of Germany. The\r\nprincipal exports are: textile products, watches and jewelry, cheese\r\nand condensed milk, wine and beer, machinery, cattle, hides and skins,\r\ndye-stuffs, furniture and wood carvings. The Swiss tradesmen are shrewd\r\nin their bargains, honest in their reckonings, contented with small\r\ngains and small savings. They are the Scotch of continental Europe.\r\n\r\nIn Switzerland we find the primitive husbandry of the mountain\r\nflourishing side by side with modern industrial commercial enterprise.\r\nOf much Swiss agriculture it is still true, “_pater ipse colendi\r\nhaud facilem esse viam voluit_.” The minute division of the land\r\nand the cheapness of labor do not justify the general use of modern\r\nlabor-saving agricultural implements. For cutting, threshing, and\r\nwinnowing purposes the scythe, flail, and winnowing-basket are used.\r\nThe scythe is apparently an exact counterpart of that which is seen in\r\nthe hands of “Time” in the school primer. The plough would adorn an\r\narchæological collection; requiring four horses and three men to work\r\nit, and cutting only one furrow. Instead of the harrow or cultivator,\r\na number of women and children, armed with clubs, go over the ground\r\nafter it is ploughed, and pulverize the surface. Swiss soil is but\r\nlittle desecrated by the “devil-driven machinery of modern times;” and\r\nthe Swiss farmer has been equally faithful in regarding the first and\r\ndisregarding the second advice given in the distich of Pope,--\r\n\r\n  “Be not the first by whom the new are tried,\r\n  Nor yet the last to lay the old aside.”[78]\r\n\r\nThe peasant farmer must needs apply a high order of management and\r\neconomy. This economy must be discerning, and he cannot take readily to\r\nnew ideas that do not assure him a better result for his hard-earned\r\nmoney. This close farming yields very fair results to the small owners,\r\nwho, with their sons and daughters, have an interest in the soil and\r\na taste for the business. However, each change in the way of modern\r\nimprovement in its turn is fighting for establishment. The old methods\r\nhave prescription, tradition, custom to support them; the new, utility\r\nand necessity. In the early stage, what was needed for each Swiss\r\npeasant farmer was a little bit of land, a cow or two, a spade, a\r\nmanure basket, and a wife to carry it. This was the caterpillar stage.\r\nThey are very gradually passing into the butterfly stage. They are\r\nbeginning to evolve the capacity for collecting and turning to account\r\ncapital, the distilled essence of all property without which the land\r\ncannot be made much of now. Life to-day does not require the tough\r\nhide, the strong sinews, the gross stomach, the adstriction to a single\r\nspot of the old life; on the contrary, a vastly enlarged mobility, both\r\nof body and mind, a readiness for turning anything to account, and for\r\nentering on any opening have become necessary. If what is wanted and\r\nneeded cannot be found at home, be willing and disposed to go seek it\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nOwing to great difference in elevation of the surface, there is much\r\ndiversity in the production of Switzerland. In the valleys the summer\r\nheat is tropical, while the surrounding heights are robed in perpetual\r\nsnow. “From the lowest level on the southern slope of the Alps, say\r\nabout six hundred and fifty feet, where the lemon, the almond, and\r\nthe fig ripen in the open air, and thence ascend to an elevation of\r\nnine thousand five hundred feet, where every vestige even of the most\r\nprimitive artificial cultivation ceases, we might trace nearly every\r\nspecies of vegetable growth known in Europe.”[79]\r\n\r\nCereals are grown up to three thousand six hundred feet; rye\r\nsucceeds up to five thousand nine hundred feet in the Grisons, and\r\nto six thousand five hundred feet on the sunny slopes of Monte Rosa\r\nand Pontresina. Irrespective of exceptional cases we may say that\r\ncultivation ceases at three thousand nine hundred and fifty feet,\r\nand above this height all forms of vegetation are small and poor,\r\nconsisting of low scrubs, stunted firs, and mournful larches. As a\r\ngeneral rule, vegetation reaches a higher point in eastern and southern\r\nSwitzerland than in the northwest. It is therefore not the absolute\r\nheight which determines the boundary of the growth of plants so much as\r\nthe disposition and form of the mountains and valleys. Another point\r\naffecting materially the whole phytological covering of a country\r\nis the nature of the geological formation on which the plants grow.\r\nOne-half of the country lies above the region of agriculture. The total\r\narea of land under cultivation in Switzerland is, in figures, 5,378,122\r\nacres; of which, 1,715,781 acres, or 31.9 per cent., are meadow land,\r\nand 1,962,656 acres, or 36.5 per cent., are pasturage. The arable land\r\ncovers an area of 1,533,093 acres, or 28.5 per cent., of the whole;\r\nvineyards 87,714 acres, or 1.6 per cent.; while the ground devoted\r\nentirely to gardening purposes may be estimated at about 78,870 acres,\r\nor 1.5 per cent. The area of cultivated land is steadily diminishing,\r\nas the meadows prove more remunerative. Good arable land, being so\r\nlimited, commands a very high price, from $300 per acre to $1500\r\nand $2000 per acre for choice vineyard lands. About one-half of the\r\narable land is sown in grain; the remainder being used for potatoes,\r\nturnips, green maize, clover, vetch, etc. Both the federal and cantonal\r\ngovernments have shown an active interest in fostering and promoting\r\nthe agricultural prosperity of the country; and an agricultural bureau\r\nis attached to one of the federal departments at Bern. The cultivation\r\nof the grape is closely identified with Swiss agricultural interests,\r\nand with few exceptions the hill-sides on the Lake of Geneva have been\r\nsince the earliest periods of history planted with the generous vine.\r\nThere exist records to prove that some of these vineyards have been\r\nbearing uninterruptedly for five hundred years. The reader will readily\r\nsuppose that the materials have been often renewed. One above another\r\nthese vineyards extend along the lake to the height of two thousand\r\nfeet. They are formed with persevering industry upon these precipitous\r\nslopes by means of parallel walls, whose narrow intervals are filled\r\nwith earth that has been carried up by the peasants in baskets upon\r\ntheir backs from below; and in the same way they must every season be\r\nabundantly covered with manure. These successive terraces are reached\r\nby steps frequently cut with infinite labor in the hard rock, and\r\nwith every economy of the land. Every inch of the ground is valuable,\r\nbecause only on the side of certain hills will these vines come to\r\nperfection. These lands, after being purchased at so high a rate, need\r\nconstant attention; for the soil is washed away from these steeps\r\nbeneath the stone walls, and must be replaced every spring; every clod\r\nof earth is a great treasure, and they carefully collect the earth\r\nwhich has been thrown out of a ditch to fill up their vineyard patches.\r\nA square foot of land is reckoned to produce two bottles of wine\r\nannually. Every portion of a vine is used; the stems and leaves serving\r\nas food for the cattle; the husks, after being pressed and wedged into\r\nround moulds, then dried, are used for fuel, burning something as\r\npeat does. In many houses of this section the cellars are enormously\r\nlarge, with a capacity as high as a million bottles each; and they are\r\noften used as the common sitting- and reception-room.[80] Vineyards\r\nalso flourish on the slopes surrounding the lakes of Neuchâtel, Biel,\r\nand Zurich; in the valleys of the larger rivers and certain plains of\r\nnorthern Switzerland they are found to a small extent. Still, the wine\r\nproduced is not sufficient for the demand, and over 15,000,000 gallons\r\nare annually imported; in this consumption the great number of tourists\r\nwho come every season must be taken into account.\r\n\r\nGrowing grass and fodder, cattle-breeding, and cheese-making are the\r\nmost important branches of Swiss agriculture. For ages the forest\r\nCantons had little tillable land reclaimed, and from difficulty of\r\ncommunication with the outside world the people were thrown almost\r\nentirely upon their own scanty local resources. With hardly any\r\nmeans of getting supplies from without, with very little land for\r\ncultivating cereals, and in the days before maize and potatoes, their\r\nchief reliance was upon their cows. It is very much so even at this\r\nday, but in those days the reliance was all but unqualified. Their\r\ncows supplied them not only with a great part of their food, but\r\nalso, through the surplus cheese, with tools, and everything else\r\nthey were incapable of producing themselves, from the singularly\r\nlimited resources of their secluded valleys. The Switzer was then the\r\nparasite of the cow. There were no ways in which money could be made;\r\nthere were no manufactures and no travellers; and so there were no\r\ninn-keepers to supply travellers, nor shop-keepers to supply the wants\r\nof operatives, manufacturers, and travellers; and there were none who\r\nhad been educated up to the point that would enable them to go abroad\r\nto make money with which they might return to their old home. If the\r\ngeneral population had not had the means of keeping cows, they would\r\nnot have had the means for livelihood. The problem therefore for them\r\nto solve was,--how was every family to be enabled to keep cows? The\r\nsolution was found in the _Allmends_,--lands held and used in common.\r\nThe natural summer pastures were common, and every burgher had the\r\nright to keep as many cows upon them in the summer as he had himself\r\nkept during the previous winter with the hay he had made from his\r\nlabor-created and labor-maintained patch of cultivated ground, or, as\r\nit was called, prairies; or, if as yet he had no prairies, with the\r\ndried leaves and coarse stuff he had been able to collect from the\r\ncommon forest. This system was both necessary and fair. It originated\r\nin the nature of the country, and its then economical condition, and\r\nin turn it created the Swiss life and character. Every one knows La\r\nFontaine’s story of Perrette going to the market to buy eggs; the\r\neggs are hatched into chickens, the chickens produce a pig and then a\r\ncalf, and the calf becomes a cow. This dream of Perrette’s is daily\r\nrealized by the Swiss peasant farmer. He picks up grass and manure\r\nalong the road; he raises rabbits, and with the money they bring he\r\nbuys first a goat, then a pig, next a calf, by which he gets a cow\r\nproducing calves in her turn. Milk is the great thing desired by the\r\npastoral people, and not to possess a milk-giving animal is esteemed\r\nsuch a misfortune that, as a little solace to the poor, cream is in\r\ncertain places regularly distributed to them on the third Sunday in\r\nAugust. Switzerland varies, through a decennial period, from thirty\r\nto thirty-five head of horned cattle to every hundred inhabitants,\r\nyet it actually imports butter and cattle. It consumes more animal\r\nfood than the contiguous countries, viz., twenty-two kilos. of meat,\r\ntwelve kilos. of cheese, five of butter, and one hundred and eighty-two\r\nof milk per head per annum. To the Swiss may be applied the words\r\nof Cæsar as to the ancient Britons: “_Lacte et carne vivunt_.” The\r\ncountry is well adapted for the keeping and breeding of cattle, being\r\nfavored with good grass, water, and air. Large sums are expended by the\r\nvarious cantonal governments upon schemes for the improvement of the\r\nbreed of cattle and for the facilitation of their transport from the\r\nplace of production to the market. The cattle for milking, draught,\r\nand fattening are not kept and treated separately with a single object\r\nonly being kept in view; the Swiss cow is expected to unite all these\r\nqualities at one time within herself. It is believed that a cow is\r\npositively benefited by being put to the plough, especially if the\r\nwork be done in the morning; and few bullocks, but many cows, are\r\nfrequently seen serving various draught purposes, not with the yoke,\r\nbut with harness similar to that used for the horse. A cow which, at\r\nthe time of calving, fails to give eighteen litres (litre = .88 quart)\r\nof milk is not considered of any value. A fair average for the Swiss\r\ncow is ten quarts of milk per day the milking year through, and five\r\nthousand three hundred and fifteen pounds of milk per cow is an annual\r\naverage yield for the milking season of nine months. In England the\r\nfamous short-horned cows furnish only an average of four thousand\r\nsix hundred and eighty-eight pounds, and the highest average of milk\r\nreceived at the best dairies of the State of New York reaches a little\r\nover four thousand pounds, making a difference in favor of Swiss cows\r\nof over thirteen hundred pounds. The federal government makes an annual\r\nappropriation for the improvement of cattle, and in the distribution\r\nof the subsidy confines itself to those Cantons where cattle-breeding\r\nreceives local assistance and encouragement. All subsidies are made\r\nsubject to various conditions to secure the fullest benefit therefrom.\r\nThese require an annual examination of all breeding-bulls to be held\r\nat a district show; prize bulls must be used in the Canton for at\r\nleast one year after the awarding of the prize; breeding-bulls must be\r\nregistered, and none unregistered may be so used; prize cows must also\r\nremain a certain time in the Commune, and must not leave the Canton\r\nbefore calving. The Swiss have superior breeds of cattle for yield of\r\nmilk, aptitude for fattening, and capability of working, as well as\r\nhandsome in appearance. From reports made by United States consuls,\r\nthe two best-known and highly-prized breeds of cattle appear to be the\r\nparti-colored and the brown; the difference prevailing in each being,\r\nmainly, in point of size and greater or less degree of fineness. The\r\nparti-colored breed is seen at its best in the valleys of the Simme,\r\nSaane, and Kander, in the Gruyère and Bulle districts, and generally\r\nover the western and northern parts of Switzerland. They are large, and\r\namong the heaviest cattle in Europe; their ground color is white, and\r\nit is marked with dun, reddish-yellow, or black; the milk from these\r\ncows is admirably adapted for making cheese and butter. Some of the\r\nmost famous cheeses known to the market are from the milk of these\r\n“fleck” or spotted cows. They fatten kindly, and, owing to strength and\r\nsize, are well suited for draught purposes. The brown race consists of\r\na heavy Schwyz breed, the medium-size breed from Unterwalden and part\r\nof the eastern Cantons, and the smaller mountain breed. It has been\r\ncalled the “turf-breed,” and is considered to be more ancient than the\r\nparti-colored. It is mostly found in Schwyz, Zug, Luzern, and Zurich.\r\nThe brown Schwyz is a beautifully-formed cow of mouse color, running\r\ninto brown; large, straight back, usually with white streak; short,\r\nlight horns, two-thirds white with tips black; nose tipped dark gray,\r\nwith light borders; udder large, white, and smooth; usual weight about\r\ntwelve hundred to thirteen hundred pounds, those kept in the higher\r\nAlps weigh about nine hundred pounds. There is a breed in the Valais\r\nknown as the Hérens, which is considered by many to be a separate\r\nand primitive race. These animals, having short, stout bodies, are\r\nadmirably suited to the steepest and most inaccessible pasturage; they\r\nare readily fattened, the quality of their meat is greatly prized by\r\nbutchers, and they are renowned for their enormous powers of draught.\r\nIn 1880 a great impulse was given to the careful breeding of cattle\r\nby the establishment of four herd-books. It is alleged that the great\r\nnumber of good cows of pure blood help to make the Swiss herd-book a\r\nfailure. It began life with as many “pure bloods” as most herd-books\r\ncontain after twenty years’ existence. At the international show of\r\nParis, in 1878, every Swiss cow exhibited bore away a prize. They have\r\ncompeted also with exhibits from Holland, England, and Denmark, and\r\nother famous cattle and milk-producing districts of Europe. Good Swiss\r\ncows sell from 500 to 1200 francs each. These fine milk-, butter-,\r\nand cheese-producing animals are fed only on grass and hay the year\r\nthrough; occasionally a little dry bran may be added. From May to\r\nSeptember the cows in the neighborhood of the mountains are herded on\r\nthe upper Alps, and this rich, nutritious, short Alpine grass sustains\r\nfor nearly four months multitudes of as beautiful cattle as are to\r\nbe found in the world. All the mountain pasturages go by the name of\r\nAlp,[81] and comprise “voralpen,” used in the spring; “mittelalpen,”\r\nmiddle or intermediate pasture, remaining free of snow from the\r\nfirst of June to the end of September, and “hochalpen,” sometimes\r\nnine thousand feet high, for sheep and goats. Except when on these\r\nAlpine pastures, the cows have only house-feeding, and, there being\r\nno grazing-fields aside from the Alps, the cows of the plains are\r\nstall-fed through the entire year. In the summer the fresh-cut grass is\r\nfed to them. It is economy to cut the grass and carry it in as against\r\npermitting the meadows to be trampled, grass wasted, and the animals\r\nworried with flies. The cattle-stables are long, low, rectangular\r\nattachments to the barns. They are always built of stone, with walls\r\nabout two feet thick. The stalls are usually ceiled over head, and\r\noften plastered throughout; the floors stone or cement, and bedded\r\nwith poor hay, straw, or saw-dust, and a tight-fitting; oak door is at\r\nthe end of the rectangle. These barns are very warm, but thoroughly\r\nventilated, and the stalls are clean and nice beyond comparison. The\r\ncows are marched out to exercise, air, and water daily; they are\r\ncurried and cared for the same as fine horses; their coats are brushed\r\nuntil they shine, and the animals are evidently vain of their beauty.\r\nIn this, as in other cases, man’s regard for the lower animals appears\r\nto be rewarded by an increase in their intelligence. The universal\r\nreasons given for thus penning up these cows are: “It saves feed,”\r\n“the cows give more milk for the warmth,” “there are no flies to worry\r\nthem,” and “more manure is obtained.” The peasant, pointing to the\r\nmanure heap, will say, “Out there is where the per cents. are made.”\r\nAs grass and hay are almost exclusively fed, it is requisite that\r\nthese be of the best quality and of sufficient quantity. There is a\r\ngreat variety and succession of green crops for feeding in the house,\r\nalmost the year round, carefully cultivated. A moist climate, frequent\r\nappliance of liquid manure,[82] and the practice of growing fruit-trees\r\nin the meadows prevent drought in Switzerland. Then much moisture\r\ncomes from the incessant filtration of the melting glaciers which\r\nare constantly dissolving under the heat of the sun. The conditions\r\nof moisture and sunshine give to the country its abundance of grass,\r\ncausing it to grow anywhere. You see it rapidly establishing itself\r\non the tops of roadside walls. On a heap of stones lichens and moss\r\nsoon appear, and, by their decay, in time fill the interstices, then a\r\nmantle of turf creeps over it. In excavations on hill-sides, where the\r\nmountain torrent brings down successive avalanches of rocky detritus,\r\neach successive layer in turn and in time becomes consolidated with\r\nmould and then covered with turf. Indeed, a greater part of the valleys\r\nconsists of nothing but a film of soil superimposed on fragments of\r\nrock. There are two or three grass crops in Switzerland yearly,--the\r\nfirst in the beginning of May, the second at the end of July, and often\r\nanother early in October. The mountains intercept winds and clouds,\r\nmaking the amount of precipitation large. The clouds are generally\r\nintercepted by the mountains at an elevation of five thousand feet,\r\nand then descend in rain; higher up the precipitation is in the form\r\nof snow. There is great difference in annual waterfalls, the greatest\r\nbeing as we approach the Alps, whether from the north or south. The\r\nannual rainfall is thirty-five inches at Basel, sixty-four and a half\r\ninches at Interlaken, sixty-nine at Schwyz, rising to eighty-eight on\r\nthe Grimsel and one hundred and two on the St. Bernard, and falling\r\nat Lugano to sixty-three. The percentage of snow in the total annual\r\nrainfall varies from sixty-three on the St. Bernard to six at Geneva.\r\nThe importance of this precipitation may be understood when it is\r\nrecalled that a precipitation of twenty-eight inches is considered\r\nessential to agricultural security. The meadows are aided in no less\r\ndegree than the climate by constant fertilizing and extraordinary care\r\nin the way of watering, draining, etc. A Swiss acre of good grass-land\r\nis worth, in the richer and more populous Cantons, from 1500 to 2000\r\nfrancs. Milk, and what is made from it, constitute the most important\r\nresource of the peasant’s income. The manufacture of cheese is one\r\nof the most ancient industries of the country, instruments for this\r\npurpose having been found in different parts among the ruins of the\r\n“Lake-dwellers,” whose date is anterior to all historical records.\r\nOn wedding occasions it was formerly the custom to present the\r\nbride and bridegroom with a large cheese, the joint contribution of\r\ntheir relatives; and this cheese was handed down, generation after\r\ngeneration, as a family register, on which were inscribed births,\r\ndeaths, and marriages. Cheeses bearing date of 1660 are still to be\r\nseen. In some parts of the country cheese forms the staple food of\r\nthe people, and the laborers are often paid with it. There are no\r\nfewer than five thousand five hundred cheese-making factories, and\r\nnearly 13,000 tons are exported annually, the value of which is over\r\n$7,000,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 there were exported to the United States 4,262,000 pounds, at\r\nan invoice valuation of $658,000. During the Alpine pasture season the\r\ncheese is made in the little stone huts or _sennes_ of the herdsmen,\r\nand brought down in the autumn; the herdsman will descend from the\r\npastures with a cheese weighing from one hundred and fifty to one\r\nhundred and seventy-five pounds on his shoulders. The larger the cheese\r\nthe better its quality. Each cow is supposed to yield a hundred-weight\r\nof cheese during the summer months. The average of fat contained in the\r\nmilk of the best Swiss cows is three and three-tenths per cent., though\r\nin a few cases it may show four to four and a half per cent. of fat or\r\noil. The several varieties of cheese are classified: either according\r\nto consistency of material, as _dur_, _ferme_, and _mou_ (hard, firm,\r\nand soft); or according to the proportion of fatty matter, as _gras_,\r\n_migras_, or _maigre_ (rich, medium, or thin); or according to the\r\ncoagulation, whether by rennet (_à pressure_) or by sour milk (_à lait\r\naigre_). The better kinds of Swiss cheese are as much the products of\r\nskill and high art as the Swiss watch and Swiss embroidery. The best\r\nand most abundant, retaining nearly all the elements of the milk, with\r\nits nutritive value, is the _Emmenthal_, known as the _Schweizerkäse_,\r\nand is made in the valley of the Emme, Canton of Bern. This is a round\r\ncheese eighty to one hundred centimetres in diameter, ten to fifteen\r\ncentimetres thick, and weighing from fifty to one hundred kilos. or\r\nmore. Next in importance is the _Gruyère_, called after the village\r\nof that name in Freiburg, around which it is asserted grow succulent\r\nherbs of aromatic juices, that perfume the milk of which this cheese\r\nis made, that is so well known and highly appreciated throughout the\r\nworld. Another celebrated cheese is the _Schabzieger_, or green cheese,\r\nknown as the Sago or Sapsago. Its manufacture dates back to the tenth\r\ncentury, and it is still largely produced in the Canton of Glarus. The\r\npeculiarity of this cheese is due partly to the method of coagulation,\r\nand partly to treatment with the _Schabziegerklee_, a plant grown for\r\nthe purpose in Schwyz. The analysis of the _Emmenthal_ and _Gruyère_\r\ncheeses is given: the former, water, 34.92; fatty matter, 31.26;\r\ncaseine, 29.88; salts, 3.94: the latter, water, 34.57; fatty matter,\r\n29.12; caseine, 32.51; and salts, 3.80. There is at Cham the largest\r\nand most successful milk-condensing factory in the world, with branch\r\nestablishments in England, Germany, and Orange County, New York. It\r\nuses the milk of not less than six to seven thousand cows, and its\r\nproduct is known far and wide. At Romanshorn, also, the Swiss Alpine\r\nMilk Exporting Company does an immense export business of pure milk\r\nproduced from healthy, grass-fed cows. These companies claim to have\r\nsatisfactorily solved the problem of condensing and preserving milk\r\nwithout altering its original composition, either by the addition of\r\nsugar or other preservative substances. Switzerland is veritably the\r\nland “flowing with milk and honey, and cattle upon a thousand hills.”\r\nGreat attention is paid to apiaries; the honey is famed for its aroma\r\nand delicacy; though some tourists are disposed to doubt if that which\r\nis on every breakfast-table is all the product of the little busy\r\nhymenopteran.\r\n\r\nThe first railway on Swiss soil was a short piece from St. Louis to\r\nBasel, opened in 1844; but the first purely Swiss line was that from\r\nZurich to Baden, opened in 1847; yet Switzerland has to-day more\r\nrailways in proportion to area than any other country of Europe. Its\r\nrailroad mileage per ten thousand population, stands third in Europe,\r\nbeing exceeded only by Sweden and Denmark; and in outlay for the same\r\nper capita, it comes second, England being first. By a federal law of\r\n1872, the right to grant concessions to railroads was vested solely\r\nin the Confederation, but the co-operation of the Cantons was to be\r\nsought in the preliminary negotiations. The revised Constitution of\r\n1874 expressly sanctioned the condition into which railroad affairs\r\nhad been brought by previous legislation; for the 23d article repeats\r\nthe constitutional provisions of 1848 regarding public works, and\r\nanother article is added; the 26th declaring that “legislation on the\r\nconstruction and management of railroads belongs to the Confederation.”\r\nAll railroad companies, whether confined to a single Canton or running\r\nwithin the limits of more than one, and of whatever length, from trunk\r\nlines down to the shortest funicular, desiring a concession, must first\r\napply to the Federal Council, submitting the necessary documents and\r\ninformation. These are at once transmitted by the Federal Council to\r\nthe cantonal government or governments through which the projected\r\nrailway proposes to run, and negotiations take place between cantonal\r\nauthorities and representatives of the railway as to the concessions\r\nasked for, under the presidency of a delegation of the Federal Council,\r\nincluding the chief of that particular department. After the Federal\r\nCouncil has settled the terms of the concession, it sends a message,\r\nwith the text of the proposed conditions, to the Federal Assembly for\r\ntheir consideration. The ultimate decision rests with the Federal\r\nAssembly, and they may grant a concession even if the Canton opposes\r\nit. The purchase of the Swiss railways by the Confederation has\r\nbeen much discussed of late years, but so far without any result.\r\nThe Confederation has left the development of railroads to private\r\nenterprises, and never exercised its right of subsidies to railways\r\nexcept in the case of the St. Gothard Company, which pierced the Alps\r\nwith a tunnel of incalculable value to the whole of Switzerland. By\r\nthis tunnel Switzerland overcame the isolation resulting from an\r\naltitude above the sea; linking north and south, central Europe and\r\nItaly, in new bonds of amity, and opening through the very heart of\r\nthe Alps a new highway for the nations. It is one of the greatest\r\ntriumphs of modern engineering, one of the grandest monuments of human\r\nskill. It is the longest tunnel in the world, being fifteen kilometres\r\nlong, or nearly nine and a half miles; one and a half miles longer\r\nthan the Mont Cenis tunnel. In addition to the great tunnel there\r\nare fifty-two smaller tunnels approaching it, making a total length\r\nof tunnels in getting through the Alps fifteen miles. The St. Gothard\r\nrailway proper extends from Immensee, in Switzerland, to Chiasso, in\r\nItaly, a distance of one hundred and thirteen miles, and there are in\r\nall not less than fifty-six tunnels, comprising more than one-fifth\r\nof the whole line, or twenty-three miles of tunnelling. The width of\r\nthe great tunnel is twenty-six feet and the height nineteen feet. It\r\nrequires, at express-train speed, sixteen minutes to pass through it.\r\nIt is about one thousand feet below Andermatt, and five thousand to\r\nsix thousand five hundred feet below the peaks of the St. Gothard. The\r\npreliminary works were begun at Göschenen, on the north side, June the\r\n4th, and at Airolo, on the south side, July the 2d, 1872. Louis Favre,\r\nof Geneva, was the contractor.[83] On February 28, 1880, a perforation\r\nfrom the south side penetrated the last partition between north and\r\nsouth sections, and the workmen on either side exchanged greetings. On\r\nthe 22d of May, 1882, the first train passed over the line, and every\r\ntown from Luzern to Milan celebrated the completion with banquets and\r\nexcursions; and its business, passenger and traffic, at once assumed\r\nimmense proportions. The construction cost 56,000,000 francs; which was\r\npartly paid by subventions from Switzerland, Germany, and Italy, the\r\nconditions and respective amounts of which were the subject of a treaty\r\nbetween these governments. It penetrates the mountain like a corkscrew,\r\nmaking four complete loops within a distance of twenty miles, in order\r\nto attain the requisite elevation, when it emerges into daylight only\r\nto enter again the main tunnel. The waters of the Reuss and the Ticino\r\nsupplied the necessary motive power for working the screws attached\r\nto the machinery for compressing the air. The borers applied to the\r\nrock the piston of a cylinder made to rotate with great rapidity by\r\nthe pressure of air, reduced to one-twentieth of its ordinary volume;\r\nthen, when they had made the holes sufficiently deep, they withdrew the\r\nmachines and charged the mines with dynamite. After the explosion, the\r\n_débris_ was cleared away and the borers returned to their place. This\r\nwork was carried on day and night for nearly ten consecutive years.\r\nThe official report shows that three hundred and ten of the workmen\r\nwere killed by accidents during the building of the tunnel, and eight\r\nhundred and seventy-seven were wounded or received minor injuries. The\r\nwork was done by Italians; no others would accept so much toil and\r\ndanger for so little pay. There were used in its construction 2,000,000\r\npounds of dynamite and 700,000 kilos. of illuminating oil. The problem\r\nof keeping the temperature and atmosphere of the tunnel within a limit\r\ninvolving perfect safety to persons passing through it, proved one\r\nof the most difficult encountered. It was satisfactorily solved by\r\nthe establishment of immense steam-pumping machines, which constantly\r\nthrow in an ample supply of fresh air, and maintain a temperature never\r\nrising above 20° Celsius or 68° Fahrenheit. There is at present being\r\nprojected, by the Italian and Swiss governments, the Simplon tunnel, to\r\npierce the Alps about midway between Mont Cenis and St. Gothard, which\r\nwill be one kilometre longer than the St. Gothard,--that is, sixteen\r\nkilometres, or about ten miles in length.\r\n\r\nIn practical engineering the Swiss may challenge rivalry with any\r\nother nation. The suspension bridge at Freiburg, constructed in 1834,\r\nat that time had the largest single curve of any bridge in the world,\r\nbeing nine hundred feet in length, and one hundred and eighty high.\r\nOne of the most daring feats of modern engineering is the cog-wheel\r\nrailway up to Pilatus-culm, on the Lake of Luzern, six thousand seven\r\nhundred and twenty-four feet high. The road-bed is of solid masonry\r\nfaced with granite blocks. Streams and gorges are traversed by means\r\nof stone bridges. There are seven tunnels from thirty to three hundred\r\nfeet in length. The rack-rail, midway between and somewhat higher than\r\nthe tracks, is of wrought steel, and has a double row of vertical cogs\r\nmilled out of solid steel bars. The locomotive and car containing\r\nthirty-two seats form one train, with two movable axles and four\r\ncog-wheels gripping the cogs, and which, on downward trips, can be\r\ncontrolled by vigorous automatic brakes. The speed of the locomotive\r\nis two hundred feet per minute. The road has an average gradient of\r\nabout one foot in every two. Another piece of skilful engineering and\r\nof much scientific interest is the new electric mountain railway up the\r\nBurgenstock, also on the Lake of Luzern, it being the first application\r\nof this powerful agent to a mountain railway. The primary source of\r\nthe motive power is three miles away, where an immense water-wheel of\r\none hundred and fifty horse-power has been erected. This works two\r\ndynamoes, each of thirty horse-power. The electricity thus generated is\r\ntransmitted for three miles across the valley, by means of insulated\r\ncopper wires, to another pair of dynamoes, the negatives of the first,\r\nplaced in a station at the head of the railway. Here the electric\r\nforce is converted into mechanical power by the ordinary connection\r\nof leather belts, gearing the dynamoes, to two large driving-wheels\r\nof nine feet diameter. Then by shafting and cogs the power is carried\r\non to an immense wheel of sixteen feet diameter, and around this\r\npasses a wire rope with each end connected to the cars. One man only\r\nis required to control the motion of the cars. The whole apparatus\r\nfor this purpose is arranged compactly before him, and no scientific\r\nknowledge is required to manage it. Switzerland has developed the use\r\nof electricity to a greater extent, probably, than any other country;\r\nthe mountain streams furnishing a power ready to hand, and the Swiss\r\nin every possible way are utilizing it for electrical purposes. There\r\nis a railway to the summit of the Jungfrau being projected that will\r\nsurpass all existing works of the kind. It will be built entirely in\r\nthe rim of the mountain, in order that it may be completely safe from\r\nstorms, avalanches, and landslips. The tunnel will be on the western\r\nslope, which is very steep but the shortest route. It will start from\r\nStegmalten, two miles from Lauterbrunnen, a point two thousand eight\r\nhundred feet above the sea, running a southeasterly direction, under\r\nthe Mönch and the Silver Horn, to the summit. The road is estimated\r\nto be twenty-one thousand four hundred and fifty feet in length, and\r\nwill run as close beneath the surface of the mountain as possible.\r\nThe engineers supervising the construction are Herr Köchlin, who was\r\none of M. Eiffel’s principal assistants in building the lofty tower\r\nin Paris, and Colonel Locher, of Luzern, the constructor of the Mount\r\nPilatus Railway. The cost is put at 56,000,000 francs, and it is to\r\nbe completed within five years. The magnitude of this work is shown\r\nin the statement that the quantity of rock necessary to be removed is\r\nthirteen times that taken from the St. Gothard tunnel. At Winterthur\r\nand Schaffhausen, locomotives, other engines and heavy machinery of\r\nsuperior character, are being made, with occasional shipments even to\r\nthe United States. The recent movement of Switzerland, following the\r\nexample of other civilized nations, in adopting a patent law, will give\r\na new impulse to the natural mechanical genius of its citizens, and\r\nthe resultant establishment of other prosperous manufacturing plants.\r\nThis patent law, which went into effect November, 1888, protects only\r\nmaterial objects and not _processes_. This feature is said to be due\r\nto the efforts of the manufacturers of aniline colors and chemicals,\r\nwhose interest would be injuriously affected by a law as comprehensive\r\nas that of the United States, which protects “useful arts” and\r\n“compositions of matter” as well as tools and machines.\r\n\r\nIf a country’s roads be the “measure of its civilization,” Switzerland\r\nwould be easily first. Many of the roads, specially in the Alpine\r\ndistricts, represent an immense cost and the boldest engineering. There\r\nis not in the country a road for the use of which toll is charged;\r\nfor, to their apprehension, a toll would be a contradiction of the\r\nvery purpose for which the road was made. There is a road-master\r\n(_wegmeister_) for every Commune, but he is appointed and paid by the\r\nCanton. Though there is so much rainfall, the soil being permeable\r\nand favorable to the percolation of the water, the roads, even after\r\na heavy rain, rapidly become dry and clean; everywhere you find them\r\nas skilfully constructed and vigilantly repaired as the drives through\r\na park; the cost of their construction and maintenance is defrayed by\r\ncantonal and communal taxation. The importance of the mountain roads\r\nis recognized by a provision in the constitution, by which the Cantons\r\nof Uri, Grisons, Ticino, and Valais receive an annual indemnity on\r\naccount of their international Alpine roads; to Uri 80,000 francs; to\r\nGrisons 200,000 francs; to Ticino 200,000 francs; to Valais 50,000\r\nfrancs, with an additional indemnity of 40,000 francs to the Cantons\r\nof Uri and Ticino for clearing the snow from St. Gothard road, so long\r\nas that road shall not be replaced by a railroad.[84] These sums are\r\nto be withheld by the federal government if the roads are not kept in\r\nsuitable condition.\r\n\r\nThe “_fremden-industrie_,” or exploitation of foreigners, is not the\r\nleast profitable industry of the country. There are over 400 mountain\r\nresorts, and, in fact, for months the entire country is one great\r\nconsolidated hotel company.[85] Palatial hostleries with metropolitan\r\n_menus_ and _salles à manger_, bengal lights and brass bands, reached\r\nby cable roads, are perched on crags where only the eagle used to build\r\nhis eyrie or the chamois seek refuge. In July and August a quarter of a\r\nmillion tourists fill this little mountain country through its length\r\nand breadth with their joyfulness and jargon. This annual irruption\r\nconstitutes a perennial well-spring of good fortune to many branches of\r\nindustry and to a large number of Swiss people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nPEASANT HOME AND LIFE.\r\n\r\n  “Mid the murmurings of his fountains,\r\n  And the echoes of his mountains,\r\n  Where the lordly eagle soars,\r\n  Where the headlong torrent roars,\r\n  He is, as he was meant to be,\r\n  Poor and virtuous, calm and free.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe industry, thrift, helpfulness, and simple contentment of the Swiss\r\npeasants, next to the natural scenery, attract our attention. One\r\nmust respect their laborious industry, frugality, and perseverance,\r\nand regret that so much toil, with such close and unfailing economy,\r\nshould have such meagre results. Dwelling among the crags and clouds,\r\ntheir flats mostly water and their slopes mostly ice, they get out of\r\ntheir little holdings every farthing that they will yield, and squander\r\nnothing. There is a kind of manliness in their never-ending struggle\r\nagainst the niggardliness and severity of nature; out-braving and\r\nbeating its hard opposition. Sharp-pressing need spurs them to wring\r\na difficult and scant subsistence from the mountain-steeps. Secluded\r\nand poor, yet brave and cheerful, they recall the lines from the\r\ndescription of the old Corycian peasant:\r\n\r\n  “And wisely deem’d the wealth of monarchs less\r\n  Than little of his own, because his own did please.”\r\n\r\nEvery little scrap of ground is turned to the best account. If a few\r\nsquare yards can anywhere be made or reclaimed the requisite labor is\r\nnot grudged. Many of these sturdy people compel an incredibly little\r\nspot of ground to yield them enough, and some to spare. This surprising\r\nproduct from a soil, much of it very poor, is due to the perfection\r\nof spade-work; each field, or rather patch, has the perfection of\r\nshape given to it to facilitate cultivation and drainage. This small\r\ncultivator, only with spade in hand, can fertilize the waste and\r\nperform prodigies which nothing but his love of the land could enable\r\nhim to accomplish. These peasants have a proverb that “if the plough\r\nhas a ploughshare of iron, the spade has a point of gold.” In the\r\nmountainous districts the land is reclaimed by this _petite culture_.\r\nIn fact, the man makes the very soil. He builds terraces along steep\r\ninclines, lining them with blocks of stone, and then packs the earth to\r\nthem, transforming the mountain and the rock into a little patch where\r\nhe plants a vine or raises a little oats or maize. Up the heights of\r\nrocks which even goats cannot climb, on the very brow of the abyss, the\r\npeasant goes, clinging to the precipice with iron crampers on his feet\r\nin search of grass. He hangs on the sides of the rocks which imprison\r\nthe valley and mows down a few tufts of grass from craggy shelves. The\r\nhay thus gathered is called _wildheu_, and the reaper _wildheuer_. This\r\npeasant mountain-mower is essentially _sui generis_. He is accustomed\r\nto all the perils of the mountain, and the day before the mowing season\r\nbegins--a day fixed by communal decree--he bids farewell, perhaps for\r\nthe last time, to his wife and children. His scythe on his shoulder,\r\narmed with his iron-shod stick, provided with his clamp-irons, a cloth\r\nor a net rolled up in his bag, he sets out at midnight, in order that\r\nthe dawn may find him at his work. During the two months of hay-harvest\r\nhe only goes down to the village three or four times to renew his\r\nsupply of food or linen. By this hard and perilous occupation an Alpine\r\nmower makes from three to five francs a day, his food not included;\r\nand many times under some projecting rock he must seek a bed and pass\r\nthe night. Once dried, this wild hay is carefully gathered into a\r\ncloth or net and carried down to the first little plain, where it can\r\nbe made into a stack, which is loaded with large stones to prevent it\r\nbeing blown away. In winter, when everything is covered with snow, the\r\nmower climbs again the perpendicular sides of the mountain, carrying\r\nhis little wooden sledge on his shoulders. He loads it with hay,\r\nseats himself on the front, and shoots down with the swiftness of an\r\narrow. At times, the snow softened by the warm wind which blows upon\r\nthe heights, is detached in an avalanche behind him, and swallows him\r\nup before he reaches the valley. This aromatic hay, composed of the\r\nnourishing flora of the high Alps, of delicate and succulent plants,\r\nof the wild chrysanthemum, the dwarf carline thistle, the red-flowered\r\nveronica, the Alpine milfoil with its black calyx, the clover with its\r\ngreat tufts, and the meum, an umbelliferous plant, gives a delicious\r\nmilk, and is greatly sought after for the fattening of cattle. In these\r\nsteep solitudes where the grass is found, the life of man is so exposed\r\nand accidents are so frequent that the law forbids there should be\r\nmore than one mower in a family. With him it is a fight for life, not\r\ninfrequently conducted to the death. At all times great charges of\r\nwrath hang over him,--a beetling crag, a stream of stones, a cataract\r\nof ice, a moving field of snow, the flash that rends his roof, the wind\r\nthat strips his trees, the flood that drowns his land, against each of\r\nthese messengers of ill he must hold a separate watch, and must learn\r\nto brave each danger when it comes, alike by flush of noon and in the\r\ndead of night. The little valley below lies at the mercy of these ice-\r\nand storm-engendering heights. Year by year the peasants fight against\r\nits being extorted from their dominion. Yet this feeble community in\r\nthe valley, by their stout hearts and virtuous lives, continue to make\r\nit smile on the frowning mountains:\r\n\r\n  “Durum! sed levius fit patientia\r\n  Quicquid corrigere est nefas.”\r\n\r\nIt is a strange and savage reverence which the peasants feel for the\r\nmountains. They seem to grow like each other in spirits, even as a man\r\nand wife who live in peace grow like each other year by year. With no\r\npeople is the love of home and the native soil so strongly developed.\r\nTo return to his village in the midst of his beloved mountains is the\r\nconstant dream of his life, and to realize it he will endure every\r\nprivation and bind himself to the hardest and most painful toil.\r\nOne hope possesses him,--to see again the snows, the glaciers, the\r\nlakes, the great oaks, and the familiar pines of his country. It is a\r\nsentiment so human--of home, of kindred, of the accustomed locality, of\r\ncountry--that has fostered itself on him and binds him to the spot with\r\na chain he has no power to break. The Almighty himself has implanted\r\nin the human breast that passionate love of country which rivets with\r\nirresistible attraction the Esquimau to his eternal snows, the Arab to\r\nhis sandy desert, and the Swiss to his rugged mountains:\r\n\r\n  “Cling to thy home: if there the meanest shed\r\n  Yield thee a hearth and shelter for thy head,\r\n  And some poor plot, with vegetables stored,\r\n  Be all that Heaven allots thee for thy board,\r\n  Unsavory bread and herbs that scatter’d grow\r\n  Wild on the river-bank or mountain brow,\r\n  Yet e’en this cheerless mansion shall provide\r\n  More heart’s repose than all the world beside.”\r\n\r\nThere is a quietness and a sombre severity in the lives of these\r\npeasants. In spite of occasional merry-making, pleasure-seeking is\r\nrare. They have no great sensibility or expression of joy, but a\r\ncomposed satisfaction, a kind of phlegmatic good humor, marks the\r\nboundary of their happiness. Many visitors to the country are disposed\r\nto complain of the plainness of their demeanor; that their speech is\r\nrough and their style hard. The simple abruptness of the peasant’s\r\ngreeting is not without its charms. How far one feels from the\r\nobsequious manners of the city, from profuse and insincere compliments!\r\nIs there not to some extent in all this a philosophical basis? In\r\ngeneral, is it not true that the members of a republic, conscious of\r\ntheir independence and self-importance, adhere less scrupulously to the\r\nconventional regularity of forms? Again, the extreme politeness which\r\nsometimes characterizes the subject of an arbitrary government may be\r\nthe result of that policy which introduces and encourages an exterior\r\nair of civility as the mark of subordination and respect. The Swiss\r\npeasants have neither the time, disposition, nor necessity to affect\r\nthese elegant improvements,--fopperies of a trifling and superficial\r\nelegance which frequently serve merely to soften the deformities of\r\nvice. They are delightfully natural human beings, human nature simple\r\nand unabashed, and manifest a courteous consideration for each other’s\r\ncomforts and sensibilities. They have no occasion to assert offensively\r\nthat equality of right which nobody denies, and they respect each\r\nother’s rights as they do their own. There are no castes to clash,\r\nno lower class to assert itself in rudeness, and no higher class to\r\nprovoke rudeness by insolent assumption. They maintain old-fashioned\r\nhabits of courteous hospitality, and the workmen in the field will\r\nshout out to the passer-by a kindly _guten tag_ or _guten abend_,\r\nwith the _a_ prolonged beyond the amen of a chant, and the children\r\ninvariably take off their caps or drop a courtesy. Even the pastoral\r\nbeggars present a species of attractive mendicity, as the little\r\nchildren come out to meet you with offerings of Alpine roses, cherries\r\non their branches, and strawberries in the leaves, extending their\r\nhands, with the common entreaty--_bitte, bitte_ (pray do).\r\n\r\nWe hear a great deal of the peasant’s chalet. Though very picturesque\r\nin appearance, as they glisten in the sunbeams on the slopes or dot\r\nthe pastoral valleys, these chalets are by no means such charming\r\ndwellings as often pictured. Owing to the original abundance of timber,\r\nit was almost the only material employed in the building of these\r\nhouses. There are practically three styles: the so-called block-house,\r\nin which the logs are laid one upon the other, notched at the ends\r\nso as to fit into each other at the angles where they cross; the\r\npost-built house, in which upright posts and a strong framework are\r\nfilled in with planks; and the _riegelhaus_, with brick or stone.\r\nAll soon become dark-brown of hue, and are quaint and distinctive in\r\nform. They are covered with low flat roofs of shingles, weighted with\r\nstones to prevent them from being carried away by the wind; the roofs\r\noverhang the walls like the brim of a hat, widened to protect the\r\nface from the rain, and are frequently shaped and sculptured by the\r\nknife with curious and patient skill. There is a peculiarly sheltered\r\nlook in the broad projection of the thatched roofs, which, with the\r\nthick covering of moss, and their visible beams, making all kinds of\r\ntriangles upon the ancient plaster of the walls, are very odd and\r\nattractive things. The low panelled rooms are innocent of gilding and\r\nof painting, but are cleanliness itself. Hollow niches over the doors\r\ncontain statues of the Virgin, heroes, or saints. The plain benches,\r\ntables, cupboards, and chairs are made of the whitest wood, and are\r\nso scoured, washed, and polished that to paint or varnish them would\r\nbe to defile them. Most articles of furniture are quaintly shaped and\r\nornamented, old looking, but rubbed bright and in good preservation,\r\nfrom the nut-cracker, curiously carved, to the double-necked cruet,\r\npouring oil and vinegar out of the same bottle. They are heated with\r\nporcelain stoves, cylindrical in shape, two and a half to three feet\r\nin diameter, reaching from the floor almost to the ceiling, and bound\r\nwith bright brass rings to give them strength. These stoves are built\r\nof white enamelled tile, which is two or three inches in thickness, and\r\nthe blocks of tile are put in layers, the inside of the stove being\r\nlined with heavy fire-brick, leaving the flue not more than ten inches\r\nin diameter. From this wall of fire-brick run a series of small valves\r\nup and down and around, carrying the hot air to a number of caps at the\r\ntop and bottom of the stove, and thence into the room. Wood or turf is\r\nused, and it is astonishing how little fuel is necessary. A fire is\r\nstarted in the morning, the damper remains open until the gases have\r\nall passed up the chimney, and only the smouldering ashes remain, then\r\nthe damper is closed, and no more fuel is needed for twelve hours; if,\r\nbefore retiring, the process of the morning be repeated, it will remain\r\nwarm through the entire night. The stoves are not unsightly, but in\r\nmany instances ornamental, having a clean and well-polished surface,\r\nwith doors and caps of brass highly burnished. In the centre of the\r\nstove is a receptacle for warming dishes or keeping a supply of hot\r\nwater. The stoves are placed close up in the corner, or form part of\r\nthe partition between rooms so as to be out of the way and heat two\r\nrooms.\r\n\r\nTo some cottages there is an outside stair leading to the second\r\nstory, or even to the third, if there be one, for these houses are\r\nfrequently the property of several owners. The peasant who, in the\r\nValais, possesses the third part of a mule and the fourth part of a\r\ncow, has often only the half or third of a house. “The Jura cottage\r\nhas no daintiness of garden nor wealth of farm about it,--it is indeed\r\nlittle more than a delicately-built chalet, yet trim and domestic,\r\nmildly intelligent of things other than pastoral, watch-making and the\r\nlike; though set in the midst of its meadows, the gentian at its door,\r\nthe lily of the valley wild in the copses hard by. My delight in these\r\ncottages, and in the sense of human industry and enjoyment through the\r\nwhole scene, was at the root of all pleasure in its beauty.”[86]\r\n\r\nWithin and without these chalets are mural inscriptions and symbols:\r\n\r\n    “Quarter’d o’er with scutcheons of all hues,\r\n    And proverbs sage, which passing travellers\r\n  Linger to read, and ponder o’er their meaning.”\r\n\r\nThey are put upon the beam, upon panels, carved in the cornices\r\neverywhere to catch the eye. They are most various in character,\r\nfriendly welcomes, praises of their native land, exhortations to unity,\r\nto freedom, and to courage. On the great projecting beam supporting the\r\nroof, called _sablière_, are often painted, amid ornaments and flowers,\r\nthe initials J.M.J. (Jesus, Mary, and Joseph), as well as the name of\r\nthe man for whom the house was made, and that of the master carpenter\r\nwho built it. Those of the Bernese Oberland have inscriptions reminding\r\nman of his duty and the solemnity of life; of which the following are\r\nsamples:\r\n\r\n    “The friends from whom we needs must part\r\n      ’Twill pleasure give to meet again.\r\n    ’Gainst malice, lies, hypocrisy,\r\n      Closed may this house forever be.”\r\n\r\n    “My God, my strength, whom I will trust,\r\n      A buckler unto me;\r\n    The horn of my salvation\r\n      And my high tower is He.”\r\n\r\n  “On account of one day, be afraid of all days.”\r\n\r\nMany of the inscriptions are from the Bible, and thus not only the\r\nchurches, but public buildings and private houses teach morality. In\r\nthe Grisons you see on many the arms of the three leagues engraved; one\r\nwill bear a cross, another a wild goat, a third a man on horseback, and\r\nabove them the lines carved,--\r\n\r\n    “These are the arms of the Grisons,\r\n    On the mountains their strongholds lie;\r\n  God will have the graciousness\r\n    To preserve their liberty.”\r\n\r\nThis inscription is on a church-bell, dating back four centuries:\r\n“Vivos voco, mortuos plango, fulgura frango” (“I call the living, I\r\nmourn the dead, I break the lightning”).\r\n\r\nThe stone chalets in Ticino have their fronts painted pink, and\r\ndecorated in Italian fashion, with garlands of flowers and symbolical\r\nvases, pouring out wine and milk. The finest of these houses are not\r\nducal palaces, the poorest are never hovels. A real Swiss cottage is as\r\nmuch adapted to Swiss scenery as the Gothic is suited to the holy and\r\nsublime feelings of devotion; there is a fitness in the subdued color\r\nof the resin from the larch to an association which requires extreme\r\nsimplicity; the same cottage painted white would be found offensive\r\nand obtruding. Near by is the barn, a wooden bridge thrown over the\r\nentrance, with a long and gradual ascent, that conducts the wagons\r\nloaded with hay to the loft. Some of these are as generous in size and\r\nas well built and equipped as the best Pennsylvania barns. It may be\r\nthat the dwelling, barn, and dairy are all under one roof; but if so,\r\nthey are separated with a scrupulous regard to neatness. All wastes are\r\ncorded and covered up outside like so many piles of treasure, to renew\r\nthe soil when summer comes round. This _fumier_ is the special pride of\r\nthe peasant, and is frequently an imposing object, arranged in layers,\r\nwith the straw rolled and platted at the sides; it stands proudly by\r\nthe roadside and often the ornament of the front yard. Everything is\r\nin its place; order reigns by virtue of some natural law. There is a\r\nkind of Robinson Crusoe industry about their houses and their little\r\nproperties; they are perpetually building, repairing, altering, or\r\nimproving something. Thought and care are day by day bestowed on every\r\nbit of ground to secure a sufficiency of the things that will be needed\r\nin the long winter. Every plant is treated by itself as though it was\r\na child; every branch pruned, every bed watered, every gourd trained.\r\nFrom hour to hour the changes in the heavens are observed and what\r\nthey import considered; for they may import a great deal; the time\r\nallowed for bringing the little crops to maturity is so short that\r\nthe loss of sunshine for a few days may cause anxious thought. It is\r\na sight which awakens reflection and touches the heart. There is much\r\nof healthy purity prevailing around these cottage homes. Every one,\r\naccording to his means, endeavors to make the homestead an ornament\r\nto the grassy and elm-shadowed wayside. The green rock-strewn turf\r\ncomes up to the door, and the bench is along the wall outside. Flowers\r\nsurround and adorn the windows, the luscious clusters of the vine ripen\r\nabove the porch, and the little violet creeps over the stone steps or\r\nhangs in a sunny niche, its flowers gleaming remotely. Nothing can be\r\nmore charming than the large carnations which often brighten the dark\r\nlarch or pine-wood chalets, with their glossy red blossoms hanging\r\nfrom the windows and balconies. The pleasant vine-sheltered door seems\r\nto hospitably invite the imagination of the passer-by into the sweet\r\ndomestic interior of this cottage life. And there is about the inner\r\nlife of these humble homes a something one may almost say of sanctity,\r\nwhich is not so apparent, at all events on the surface of things, in\r\nsplendid mansions. Their splendor is transmuted money, there is no\r\npoetry in it; if hearts are moved by it, it is not in that fashion or\r\nto that issue that it touches them. Quite different with these quiet\r\nand secluded homes. There every object has a pleasing history. There\r\nindustry has accumulated its fruits, frugality its comforts, and virtue\r\ndiffused its contentment. The care that is taken of it tells you how\r\nhard it had been to come by. You read in it a little tale of the\r\nlabor, the self-denial expended on its acquisition; it is a revelation\r\nof an inner life which you are the better for contemplating and for\r\nsympathizing with. Shut off from the world, untainted by luxury,\r\nunstained by avarice mid lonely toil, practising the simple forms of\r\nlife and faith, maintaining bravely and contentedly a hard struggle\r\nin their Alpine glens, these peasants are on better terms with life\r\nthan many people who are regarded to have made a better bargain. “To\r\nwatch the corn grow or the blossoms set, to draw hard breath on the\r\nploughshare or spade,” have attractions for them, not accounted for in\r\nthe meagre train of advantages and comforts they bring, and must be\r\nsought in the inspiration of the poet,--\r\n\r\n  “Happy the man whose wish and care\r\n    A few paternal acres bound;\r\n  Content to breathe his native air\r\n    On his own ground.\r\n\r\n  Whose herds with milk, whose fields with bread,\r\n    Whose flocks supply him with attire;\r\n  Whose trees in summer yield him shade,\r\n    In winter fire.”\r\n\r\nOften the cottage is perched on a mountain crag, and the peasant must\r\nbe sleepless and prompt, for he lies down with danger at his door and\r\nmust rise to meet it when the moment comes. There is a continual menace\r\nof desolation and ruin:\r\n\r\n  “No zephyr fondly soothes the mountain’s breast,\r\n  But meteors glare and stormy glooms invest.”\r\n\r\nAt dusk you see a cottage on a shelf of rock, a hut in which the\r\nshepherd churns his milk, a bit of soil in which he grows his herbs,\r\na patch of grass on which his heifers browse, a simple cross at which\r\nhis children pray. At dead of night a tremor passes through the\r\nmountain-side, a slip of earth takes place, or a “thunderbolt of snow”\r\nwhich no one hears, rings up the heaven. At dawn there is a lonely\r\nshelf of rock above, a desolate wreck of human hopes below, and\r\n\r\n  “The gentle herd returns at evening close,\r\n  Untended from the hills, and white with snows.”[87]\r\n\r\nSome of the Alpine districts are entirely pastoral, where naught save\r\ncow-herd’s horn and cattle-bell is heard. In the spring it is a pretty\r\nsight to see the groups of cows with tinkling bells start for the\r\nmountains. The bells are nearly globular, thin, and light, of different\r\nsizes, from one foot to two inches in diameter; they are various in\r\npitch, all melting into one general musical effect, forming in right\r\nharmonious proportion to produce the concord of sounds without any\r\nclashing tones, just as the song of many birds does.\r\n\r\n  “The tintinnabulation that so musically swells\r\n  From the bells, bells, bells, bells.”\r\n\r\nThe cows are assembled in herds on the village green, and to the call\r\nof the herdsmen they begin their march to the mountain pastures. Each\r\nherd has its queen, who leads the procession. The choice of the queen\r\ndepends on her strength and beauty. Great care and expense are incurred\r\nin the ambition to procure one peerless animal for this purpose, and\r\nin order to develop a combative and fearless spirit they are said\r\nto be fed on oats soaked in spirits. The queen wears a finer collar\r\nand larger bell than the others. Proud of her superior strength, she\r\nseems, with the calmness of a settled conviction, to be defying her\r\ncompanions, and to be seeking--impatient for combat--some antagonist\r\nworthy to measure strength with her. See\r\n\r\n  “How gracefully yon heifer bears her honors!\r\n  Ay! well she knows she’s leader of the herd,\r\n  And take it from her, she’d refuse to feed.”\r\n\r\nAt the end of the herd marches the bull, with his compact body, little\r\npointed horns, curly hair, and, if he is of a wicked temper, a plate of\r\niron over his eyes. Then comes the train of dairy-girls and cow-herds,\r\nwho tend the cows in the summer pasturages, with wagons loaded with the\r\nimplements of their calling, the milking-stool, peculiarly constructed\r\npails, and the wooden vessels in which milk is carried up and down the\r\nprecipices to the chalet.[88] When different droves meet, it is almost\r\nsure to happen that the two queens defy each other to single combat.\r\nThe herdsmen themselves promote these struggles, and are very proud\r\nof the victory of their own queen cow. The herds begin by browsing\r\non the grass at the foot of the mountain, and then gradually, as the\r\nsnow disappears and is replaced by a fresh carpet of verdure, they go\r\nhigher, mounting insensibly till in the month of August they reach\r\nthe summit of the Alp. Then in September they descend slowly and by\r\ndegrees, as they went up. On their way up the mountain, if the start be\r\nmade too early in the spring, the water may be found high, and the herd\r\nstops at the edge of the torrent, afraid to cross. The chief herdsman\r\nseeks the parsonage, knocks at the door, and explains to the curé the\r\ncritical situation of the herd, and begs his prayers and blessings.\r\n\r\n  “Il faut que vous nous disiez une messe\r\n  Pour que nous puissions passer.”\r\n\r\nThe shepherd leads a more solitary and perilous life in the mountains\r\nthan the herdsman, living on polenta and cheese, and for drink, water\r\nor skimmed milk; and a little hay spread on a plank serves for a bed.\r\nThe highest and steepest parts of the Alps are apportioned to the\r\ngrazing of sheep and goats. Indeed, sometimes the sheep are carried up\r\none by one on men’s backs, and left there till the end of the summer,\r\nwhen they are carried down, considerably fattened, in the same fashion.\r\nHere the shepherd passes months, his only companions besides his flock\r\nare the chamois,[89] who, in the moonlight, cross the snow-fields, the\r\nglacier, or bound over the crevices and come to pasture on the grassy\r\nslopes; and the snow-partridge, or white hen, and the _laemmergeier_,\r\nor bearded vulture, a bird whose size surpasses that of the eagle,[90]\r\nand who circles around these peaks as he watches for his prey, and, by\r\na sharp blow of his wing, to precipitate into the chasm any animal he\r\ncan take unawares and defenceless. Alas! for the poor shepherd belated\r\nin a snow-storm, seeking vainly to recover the lost track; when the\r\nwind seems like some cruel demon, buffeting, blinding, maddening, as\r\nalong ways rendered unfamiliar by the drifts he plunges, helpless,\r\nhopeless; fainter and more faint, until at last there comes the awful\r\nmoment when he can fight no longer, and he sinks powerless down,\r\ndown into the soft and fatal depths; the drift sweeps over him,--he\r\nis lost as surely as “some strong swimmer in his agony” who sinks in\r\nmid-Atlantic among the boiling surge.\r\n\r\nWhen the flock is taken to the Alps, the sheep, instead of being driven\r\nbefore the shepherd, regularly follow him as he marches majestically\r\nin front,--tall, thin, sunburnt, and dirty,--armed with his long\r\niron-pointed stick. Behind him the whole mountain is covered with\r\na moving mass of gray fleeces; other shepherds and Bergamese dogs,\r\nwith long woolly hair, the most vigilant of guardians, are scattered\r\nat different points in this “living flood of white wool surging like\r\nfoaming waves.” The sheep do not disperse to feed until the chief\r\nshepherd, turning his face round to them, either by a whistle or notes\r\nfrom his pipe, seems to remind them that it is proper to do so. This\r\nleader or captain literally marches abroad in the morning piping his\r\nflocks forth to the pasture with some love sonnet, and his “fleecy\r\ncare” seem actually to be under the influence of his music. It is\r\nby whistling that thousands of sheep are guided, the straying lambs\r\ncalled back, and the dogs sent out and checked. In September, when the\r\nshepherds bring down their flocks from the mountains, their wives and\r\nchildren, who have remained in the plain making hay, the harvest, the\r\nvintage, and gathering in of other fruits, go to meet them with songs\r\nand waving flags. In the evening the whole village rejoices, dancing\r\ngoes on, and it is everybody’s festival:\r\n\r\n  “At night returning, every labor sped,\r\n  He sits him down, the monarch of a shed;\r\n  Smiles by his cheerful fire, and round surveys\r\n  His children’s looks, that brighten at the blaze;\r\n  While his loved partner, boastful of her hoard,\r\n  Displays her cleanly platter on the board.”\r\n\r\nThe shepherds are happy men, content with their lot, loving their\r\nfree and nomad mountain life with its long lazy times of rest and its\r\nmoments of perilous activity. No simpler, honester, braver hearts are\r\nto be found anywhere.\r\n\r\nThere is also the female swine-herd, who daily takes to pasture the\r\npigs and goats. She tends them all day on some stony, irreclaimed waste\r\nland. In the evening when she returns with her four or five score, each\r\nporker knows his own home in the village; some run on in advance of the\r\nherd to get as soon as possible to the supper they know will be ready\r\nfor them; others do not separate themselves from the herd till they\r\narrive at the familiar door. Behind the swine follow the goats with\r\ndistended udders,--the poor man’s cow. They, too, disperse themselves\r\nin the same fashion, from the desire to be promptly relieved of their\r\nburden. Last of all come the deliberately-stepping, sober-minded cows.\r\nThe tinkling of their bells is heard over the whole of the little\r\nvillage. In a few minutes the streets are cleared; every man, woman,\r\nand child appear to have followed the animals into the houses to give\r\nthem their supper or to draw the milk from them, or, at all events,\r\nto bed them for the night. Thus do these peasants from their earliest\r\nyears learn to treat their dumb associates kindly, almost as if they\r\nwere members of the family, to the support of which they so largely\r\ncontribute. They begin and end each day in company with them, and are\r\nperfectly familiar with the ways and wants of the egotistic pig, of the\r\nself-asserting, restless goat, and of the gentle, patient cow.\r\n\r\nSound travels far in these mountain solitudes, and the bells of the\r\nflocks may be heard through them night and day. This concert of\r\ncow-bells and of sheep-bells, suddenly heard in solitude and repeated\r\nby the echoes, like a distant and mysterious choir, is one of the\r\nfeatures of Alpine life that most powerfully impress the feelings and\r\ntake hold of the imagination.\r\n\r\nThe mountains’ response to the “alphorn” is most singular and\r\nbeautiful. When the tune on the horn is ended, the Alps make, not\r\nan echo, but a reproduction of it, in an improved and heightened\r\ncharacter; they take up, as it were, and chant the air again with\r\ninfinite sweetness and a dancing grace that is delightful. They seem to\r\nconstitute a natural instrument of music, of which the horn is but the\r\nawakening breath. The writer, on behalf of the New England Conservatory\r\nof Music, Boston, requested of the Swiss government samples of musical\r\ninstruments of Swiss origin. In answer an “alphorn,” of ancient form,\r\nwell constructed and of superior tone, was furnished, accompanied with\r\nthe statement that, after careful investigation, it was believed to be\r\nthe only musical instrument of “Swiss origin.” Distance softens the\r\ntone of the “alphorn,” and assimilates it more nearly to the flute-like\r\nsweetness of the echo which seems a sort of fairy answer coming out of\r\nsome magical hall in the rock. The tone is powerful, and the middle\r\nnotes extremely mellow.\r\n\r\nThe peasants call and answer their companions from peak to peak in\r\nmusical notes. The _Ranz des Vaches_, German _Kuhreihen_, are a\r\nclass of melodies prevailing and peculiar to the herdsmen. There is\r\nno particular air of this name, but nearly every Canton has its own\r\nherdsman’s song, each varying from the others in the notes as well as\r\nin the words, and even in the dialect. There are as many songs and airs\r\nwhich go by this name as there are valleys in Switzerland. A verse of\r\none, as rendered in the Canton of Appenzell, runs:\r\n\r\n  “The cow-herds of the Alps\r\n  Arise at an early hour.\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\n\r\n  Ha, ah! ha, ah!\r\n    Come all of you,\r\n  Black and white,\r\n    Red and mottled,\r\n  Young and old;\r\n    Beneath this oak\r\n  I am about to milk you,\r\n    Beneath this poplar\r\n  I am about to press,\r\n    Liauba! Liauba! in order to milk.”\r\n\r\nIt is a song of melancholy, of the homesickness in which the absent\r\nSwiss sees again, as in a musical vision, the chalet in which he was\r\nborn, the mountain where the herds shake their mellow bells as they\r\ngraze. It is, however, only in the refrain that is heard the melancholy\r\nnote, in this _Liauba! Liauba!_ thrown lingeringly to the winds,\r\nand going from echo to echo, till it expires like a lament, and is\r\nlost like a sigh in the infinite depths of the valley. The herds are\r\nsaid to love and obey its strains. Without anything striking in the\r\ncomposition, it has a powerful influence over the Swiss. Its effect on\r\nSwiss soldiers absent in foreign service was so great, giving rise to\r\nan irrepressible longing to return to their own country, that it was\r\nforbidden to be played in the Swiss regiments in the French service,\r\non pain of death. All the music of the mountains is strange and wild,\r\nhaving most probably received its inspiration from the grandeur of the\r\nnatural objects. Most of the sounds partake of the character of echoes,\r\nbeing high-keyed but false notes, such as the rocks send back to the\r\nvalleys when the voice is raised above its natural key in order that it\r\nmay reach the caverns and savage recesses of inaccessible precipices.\r\nThe Swiss _yodel_, with its falsetto notes, is heard everywhere. Nor\r\nmust the sounds of the landscape be forgotten. With the bleating of\r\nthe flocks and the chimes of the cow-bells are mingled the murmuring of\r\nthe bees, the running streams, whispering pines, the melancholy voice\r\nof the goat-herder, and the plaintive whistle of the mountain thrush.\r\n\r\nEvery member of a Swiss family produces his share. The whole family\r\ntake up their daily work before sunrise, suspend it only for their\r\nmeals, and end it only when the candles are put out at early bedtime.\r\nThe feeble efforts of old age and the petty industry of childhood\r\ncontribute to the sum of human toil. Children all work with their hands\r\nfor the common support, they help the elders in the common family\r\ninterests as soon as they can rock a cradle, drive a cow, or sweep a\r\nfloor; they thus acquire at home habits of application and industry\r\nwhich stand them in good stead in after life. The little ones who are\r\ntaken by their parents to the field and are too young to work have\r\nbells fastened to their belts, not for amusement, but, as the mothers\r\nexplain, “when we are in the fields and the children wander away,\r\nthanks to the bells, we can always hear and find them, and, besides,\r\nthe sound of the bell drives away the serpents.”[91] Even the infant in\r\nits baby-carriage passes the day amid the scenes of labor in which it\r\nwill soon be called to join. The women are not exempt from work, even\r\nin the families of very substantial peasant proprietors. A stranger,\r\nseeing the smart country girls at work about the cows’ food or in the\r\nharvest field, perhaps barefooted, is apt to consider it as a proof\r\nof extreme destitution. This is a mistake; it is merely the custom\r\nof the country. A well-to-do peasant’s daughters, who are stylishly\r\ndressed on Sundays, may be seen in the fields during the week. You see\r\nthe sturdy sunburnt creatures in petticoats, but otherwise manlike,\r\ntoiling side by side with their fathers and brothers in the rudest work\r\nof the farm. They wear a broad-brimmed straw hat, and as the breeze\r\nblows back its breadth of brim, the sunshine constantly adds depth to\r\nthe brown glow of their cheeks. In the absence of the men the women\r\ndo all the work,--mow the grass, cut the wood, look after the cattle,\r\nmake the cheese, bake the bread, and spin the wool. Whether they\r\nare employed in spreading the litter on the floor of the stable, in\r\ncarrying the pails foaming with the freshly-drawn milk, or in turning\r\nup with long wooden rakes the newly-mown hay, all their different\r\nlabors resemble festivals. From one hill to another, above the bed of\r\nthe mountain torrent, they reply to the songs of the young reapers by\r\nchanting national airs, it may be _Rufst du, mein Vaterland_ (“callest\r\nthou, my country”)! Their voices resemble modulated cries emitted by a\r\nsuperabundance of life and joy; musicians note them down without being\r\nable to imitate them; they are indigenous only on the waters or on\r\nthe green slopes of the Alps. The distinction between the sexes as to\r\nlabor in Switzerland has passed the temporary stage of evolution. Is\r\nit not true everywhere that women are entering a new era of self-care;\r\nthat they are undertaking not only office-work, but professions, and\r\ntrades, and farm-work? and the change is going on with great speed.\r\nThe woman of fifty years ago would not only have refused to undertake\r\nwhat the woman to-day achieves; she would have failed in it if she had.\r\nThe field of housework was in the last century vastly wider than it\r\nis to-day; yet woman filled it. She spun and wove and knit as well as\r\nsewed; and each household was a factory as well as a home. This sort\r\nof work was differentiated by machinery and taken away from our houses\r\nand wives. For a time woman was made more helpless and dependent than\r\never before. But a readjustment appears to be going on. Woman has gone\r\nout of the house and followed work. The sex is developing a robustness\r\nand alertness and enterprise that we had attributed to man alone; it is\r\na revolutionary change in the mental adaptability, physical endurance,\r\nand business capacity of woman.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss peasants may not shine by brilliant qualities or seductive\r\nmanners, but they are strongly framed, broad-chested, powerful, calm\r\nin countenance, frank and open in expression, with bright eyes, and\r\nlargely sculptured features, but of rather heavy gait. The women are\r\nactive in figure, with expanded shoulders, supple arms, elastic limbs,\r\nblue eyes, and healthy complexions. Light hair largely predominates,\r\nninety out of one hundred have hair of the different shades that make\r\nauburn, from the very light-brown to the very fair, but few have red\r\nhair, and scarcely any black. A mixture of manly beauty and feminine\r\nmodesty is harmoniously blended in their physiognomy; they appear\r\nrobust without coarseness; and their voices are soft and musical,\r\ncommon to dwellers in cold countries. With these peasants where the\r\nhomespun is not unknown every one eats the bread of carefulness. They\r\nare frugal and sparing in food; in the larder there is left little for\r\nthe mice at night. The diet of rye bread, milk, cheese, and potatoes\r\nis at least wholesome, for they are all produced at home. They use\r\nbut little fresh meat, and mostly vegetables and bread. Of the latter\r\nthey are the champion consumers, it being estimated that the yearly\r\nbread consumption is as high as three hundred and six pounds _per\r\ncapita_. Meeting children on the country road or village street, you\r\nare sure to find almost every one of them munching bread, and it will\r\nbe entirely guiltless of sugar or jam. With the poorer classes meagre\r\ncheese is the staple food. This is made of skimmed milk, and if not\r\npositively bad, this negation of badness is its only virtue. Also dried\r\nor mummy beef is much used. In the high mountain valleys the air is\r\nso dry that for nine months out of the twelve meat has no tendency to\r\ndecomposition; availing themselves of this favorable condition, they\r\nkill in the autumn the beef, pork, and game they will require for the\r\nensuing year. It is slightly salted and hung up to dry; in three or\r\nfour months’ time it is not only dried, but also cooked, at least the\r\nair has given it all the cooking it will ever receive. It has become as\r\ndry and hard as a board, and internally of the color of an old mahogany\r\ntable; externally there is nothing to suggest the idea of meat, and it\r\nis undistinguishable from fragments of the mummies of the sacred bulls\r\ntaken from the catacombs at Memphis. Strange as it may appear, when\r\ncut across the grain in shavings no thicker than writing-paper, it is\r\nfound not badly flavored, nor unusually repugnant to the process of\r\ndigestion. What is lacking in quality of the peasant’s food is made up\r\nin quantity or rather the frequency with which it is partaken of. There\r\nis early breakfast, lunch at nine A.M., called from its hour _s’nüni_,\r\ndinner at twelve, lunch again at four P.M., called _s’vierli_, and\r\nsupper. It is astonishing to see how much solid flesh, good blood, and\r\nhealthy color can be produced by such inferior and limited diet.\r\n\r\nThe language of the peasants is characterized by rough gutturals\r\nand the force with which dentals and hissing sounds are pronounced,\r\na sing-song accent, with numerous diminutions, contractions, and\r\nomissions of the final syllable. There is much of what is designated\r\nunder the general name of _patois_,--a mixture of Celtic, Latin, and\r\nItalian words; a Babylonish dialect,--a parti-colored dress of patched\r\nand piebald languages. This corrupt dialect is very sonorous and very\r\nharmonious, but is the relic of an almost extinguished antiquity. In\r\nthe Engadine, and the remote valleys of the Swiss Alps adjoining Italy\r\nand the Tyrol, the peasants use the Romansch and Ladin; the latter is\r\nmore musical, and to give an idea of it the following verse from a\r\npopular song is transcribed:\r\n\r\n    “Montagnas, ste bain!\r\n    Tu gad e valleda,\r\n    Tu fraischa contreda,\r\n    Squir eir in mi adsinga,\r\n  Montagnas, ste bain!”\r\n\r\n    “Ye mountains, adieu!\r\n    Thou vale with green bowers,\r\n    Fresh meadows and flowers,\r\n    When from you I must sever,\r\n  Ye mountains, adieu!”\r\n\r\nThe peasants still observe many manners and customs of the olden times:\r\nsome the imprints of the early influences of the Burgundians, others of\r\nthe Alemanni and the Ostrogoths. The separation by the mountain ranges\r\nof populations near and akin to each other, which led to the formation\r\nof so many dialects, also favored the growth and long continuance of\r\nlocal customs and traditions, giving to many localities a strongly\r\nmarked individuality.\r\n\r\nIn one part of the Canton of Ticino a very quaint marriage ceremony\r\nprevails. The bridegroom dresses in his “Sunday best,” and, accompanied\r\nby as many relatives and friends as he can muster for the fête, goes\r\nto claim his bride. Finding the door locked, he demands admittance;\r\nthe inmates ask him his business, and in reply he solicits the hand of\r\nthe maiden of his choice. If his answer be deemed satisfactory, he is\r\nsuccessively introduced to a number of matrons and old maids, some,\r\nperhaps, deformed and badly goitered. Then he is presented to some big\r\ndolls, all of whom he scornfully rejects amid general merriment. The\r\nbewildered bridegroom, with his impetuosity and temper sorely tried,\r\nis then informed that his lady love is absent, and he is invited in\r\nto see for himself. He rushes in, searches from room to room until he\r\nfinds her ready to go forth in the bridal-dress to the church. These\r\nobstacles thrown across the path of accepted suitors, in order to\r\ntest their fidelity or to restrain their ardor, are of very ancient\r\norigin. Who has not read of the self-imposed task of Penelope or of\r\nAtlanta, in classic fable; or the story of Brunhilde, in the Norse\r\nmythology, when Gunther’s courage and skill were tested not in vain? In\r\nother remote places the peasants still observe the old German idea of\r\nregulating matrimonial affairs by the Sundays of the month, each Sunday\r\nhaving a distinct part and significance assigned to it and designated\r\nin turn,--Review Sunday, Decision Sunday, Contract Sunday, Possession\r\nSunday. On the first the girls appear in dress-parade for the benefit\r\nof the young men with hymeneal hearts. Then they separate, each one\r\nto ponder for a week over the image which caught his or her fancy.\r\nOn the following Sunday the enamored swains are permitted to bow to\r\nthe objects of their choice; if the bow is returned with a pleasant\r\nsmile, he feels encouraged; if his salute is returned coldly, he is\r\ncorrespondingly discouraged. The third Sunday he is interviewed by\r\nthe parents of the young lady, and, if character and conditions are\r\nsatisfactorily established, the marriage is arranged to be celebrated\r\non Possession Sunday. In Uri a citizen was not allowed to marry a\r\nstranger without paying to the village a fine of 300 francs. In many\r\nplaces the local spirit is strong as to social relations, and the\r\nyouth in one Commune who would court a girl of another district meets\r\na rude reception from her fellow-villagers. During the fourteenth\r\ncentury the attendants at a wedding were limited to a very few guests.\r\nIn Zurich the most distinguished personage dared not invite more than\r\ntwenty mothers of families to the wedding feast, nor have more than\r\ntwo hautboys, two violins, and two singers. The bridegroom paid for\r\nthe wedding dinner, the cost of which was fixed so much _per capita_\r\nfor every invited male, married female, and maiden; the allowance for\r\nthe first was double that of the second, and four times that of the\r\nthird. In other Cantons the wedding was a grand occasion, an imposing\r\nand public affair in which the whole village was expected to take\r\npart. In the house of the newly-married pair there were open tables,\r\nand drinking, dancing, and feasting went on all night. But these\r\nPantagruel repasts are now no longer in fashion anywhere. The day fixed\r\nfor the wedding, among the peasants, is always Sunday. In the morning,\r\nbefore going to church, the invited guests meet at the bride’s house\r\nto partake of wine, soup, and fritters. After the marriage ceremony,\r\nthe party go in procession to the bridegroom’s house, where dinner is\r\nserved; the priest delivers a long discourse, and other orators hold\r\nforth. In the evening there is dancing, and at the stroke of midnight\r\nthe guests form a ring round the wedded pair and take off their\r\ncrowns, and, after a few words of encouragement, they are left alone.\r\nIn some places a man was not permitted to marry unless he had certain\r\npossessions, and could show himself able to defend his homestead from\r\nfire and robbers; he must have arms and uniform, hatchet, bucket, and\r\nladder. Custom, at least, was law to a woman. She must have acquired\r\na sufficient stock of linen and have learned many domestic arts; thus\r\nSwiss women became famous for their linen, and a girl would begin\r\nlaying up her stock of household and domestic articles _pour mon cher\r\npetit ménage_ long before she met her partner for life. The custom\r\nof Saturday-night visits among the young peasant people, whose daily\r\nlabors keep them away during the week, still prevails. On Saturday\r\nnight the young Swiss comes under the window of the fair lady to whom\r\nhe intends paying his addresses, or with whom he only wishes to become\r\nacquainted. Being visiting-night, and expecting company, she is at the\r\nwindow, neatly dressed, and admits or rejects the petition, for which\r\nher suitor is not at any trouble of improvisation, for it is according\r\nto a received form, learned by heart, and generally in verse; and the\r\nanswer is in verse also. The young man, permission obtained, climbs\r\nup to the window, and there he sits on the sill and is offered some\r\nrefreshments. According as his views are more or less serious, and he\r\nproves more or less acceptable, he is allowed to come into the room or\r\nsuffered to remain outside.\r\n\r\nThe last solemnities, those of death and burial, have among the\r\npeasants of the Latin Cantons something violent and passionate in their\r\ncharacter. For several Sundays after the funeral the women, dressed in\r\nmourning with a head-band across the forehead, meet in the cemetery\r\naround the grave, and, in a mournful and harrowing concert, renew their\r\ntears and lamentations. The nearest relations carry the coffin; little\r\nchildren follow, dressed as angels, all in white, with crowns on their\r\nheads; then come the _white penitents_, dressed in their death-shirt,\r\nor the robe of the brotherhood. White is the mourning color, and\r\npersons with whom you meet with a broad white band on their dress have\r\nlost a member of their family.\r\n\r\nThe picturesque costumes of the Swiss peasantry, which formerly were\r\nthe pride and distinguishing marks of the several Cantons, have almost\r\ndisappeared; their use being confined to holidays, festivals, or as\r\nadvertisements at public resorts. The Bernese have their snow-white\r\nshift-sleeves rolled up to the shoulder exposing to view a sinewy\r\nsunburnt arm, the dark-red stays laced with black in front, silk\r\naprons, silver chains, and buckles, colored skirts just short enough to\r\nshow a home-made white stocking, a heavy gaiter shoe, a beehive-shaped\r\nhat, and long yellow hair in a single plait hanging down nearly to the\r\nheels, along a back made very straight by the habit of carrying pails\r\nof milk and water on the head. In French Switzerland long tresses,\r\ntrimmed with black ribbon, descend on each side of the neck, a narrow\r\ndark bodice restrains the waist, the bosom is covered by a chemise\r\nplaited in a thousand folds and whiter than snow, a short and ample\r\nunder-petticoat leaves the leg exposed above the ankle, and red garters\r\nfull in sight. These costumes really have nothing to recommend them\r\nexcept their peculiarity; there is something very irresponsive in them,\r\nadding nothing to the beauty of person or grace of bearing, but simply\r\ntending to make the wearers, like Lord Dundreary’s girls, “look more\r\nor less alike, generally more alike;” none of them are pretty except\r\non paper, yet even the ugliest of them all, worn by the homeliest\r\nwomen, help to make up the sum of national peculiarities and add to the\r\npicturesqueness. The men affect immensely broad pants, a large round\r\ncoat high in the collar, short in the waist, with two little ludicrous\r\ntails in the very small of the back, and a soft beaver hat pushed\r\nsideways on the head; the complete appearance is sometimes suggested\r\nof a walking porpoise. The present ordinary male and female dress is\r\nsomewhat sombre, little use of bright color is made, and regard is had\r\nfor that which will wear best and require least washing; the material\r\nis either undyed homespun woollen cloth or coarse blue frieze, and the\r\ngarments are clumsily made, stiff and heavy.\r\n\r\nHuman character appears to consist of two opposite varieties: one\r\nthat makes a fetich of the past, and shrinks from changes as from a\r\nrude immorality; the other, that dashes forward impatiently after\r\nprogression and development. In most states these temperaments are\r\nbrought together in the diversity of persons, and the reforming and\r\nconserving influences work out in harmony the course of society.\r\nBut in Switzerland can be found peasant communities where nothing\r\nbut conservatives are generated. Time seems to have slumbered among\r\nthem for centuries; their character has continued ancient in modern\r\ntimes.[92] They have always been and will ever be peasants. They are\r\nreligious, unaffected, industrious people; shepherds, agriculturists,\r\nartisans, soldiers, patriots, and, above all, freemen, full of song,\r\nlabor, and fight. They wish to be ruled by habits rather than laws,\r\nwith traditional customs as a legislative code. What matters if the\r\nstorm rages, and if it snows, if the wind blusters in the pine forest,\r\nif a man shut up in his cottage has but black bread and cheese, under\r\nhis smoky light and beside his fire of turf? Another kingdom opens to\r\nreward him, the kingdom of inward contentment; his wife loves him and\r\nis faithful; his children round his hearth spell out the old family\r\nBible; he is the master in his home, the owner and protector; and if so\r\nbe that he needs assistance, he knows that at the first appeal he will\r\nsee his neighbors stand faithfully and bravely by his side,--\r\n\r\n    “And each shall care for other,\r\n    And each to each shall bend,\r\n  To the poor a noble brother,\r\n    To the good an equal friend.”\r\n\r\nQuite a different world from the every-day world of railways and\r\nelectricity; this carefully got-up world, gloved and starched, that\r\nscorns the unbought charm and the sublime simplicity, the severe and\r\ncontented virtue, of the children of nature. The peasant in rags,\r\ncoming out of his larch forest, brings with him a breath of wild\r\nnature; and the young girl, mounted on her donkey, fresh and rosy as\r\nthe rhododendrons, is as simple and natural as they. This blue-bloused\r\nson of the soil, trained to the habits of order by centuries of\r\nfreedom, understands his rights and has been taught at school his\r\ncivic duties, and knows something of the laws and the constitution\r\nof his country. Inquire of him, and you will probably learn that he\r\nis a Deputy and a Communal Councillor, and may one day be President\r\nof the Confederation. There is much of all that constitutes both the\r\ngood man and the good citizen distributed throughout the peasants. In\r\ntheir great cathedral of nature, the harsh clamor and ceaseless unrest\r\nof the outer world find but little place and less concern. Rejecting\r\nthose factitious wants which luxury creates, the expense and way of\r\nliving are proportioned to their small means, and every one, sooner\r\nor later, is sure of something which he enjoys in quiet and security.\r\nThe very spirit of picturesqueness hovers over their mountain homes,\r\nand lingers in their peaceful vales whispering of a past fraught with\r\nquaint traditions and glorious memories; and of a present, full of\r\nself-supporting energy, reciprocal dispositions to neighborly help,\r\na spontaneous tendency to order, forethought, plodding industry,\r\nsobriety, and contentment.\r\n\r\n  “And e’en those hills that round his mansion rise\r\n  Enhance the bliss his scanty fund supplies.\r\n  Dear is that shed to which his soul conforms,\r\n  And dear that hill which lifts him to the storms;\r\n  And as a child, when scaring sounds molest,\r\n  Clings close and closer to the mother’s breast,\r\n  So the loud torrent, and the whirlwind’s roar,\r\n  But bind him to his native mountains more.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nNATURAL BEAUTIES AND ATTRACTIONS.\r\n\r\n  “A wilderness of sweets: for nature here\r\n  Wanton’d as in her prime, and play’d at will,\r\n  Her virgin fancies pouring forth more sweet,\r\n  While above rule of art, enormous bliss.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNo spot in Europe can compare with Switzerland in loveliness and rural\r\ncharms; in variety, boldness, and sublimity of scenery; in tonic,\r\nsteel-strong air, a fine intoxicant of mental and physical joy and\r\npower. It is a land of valleys, exquisite in their loveliness, enriched\r\nby numberless streams, lakes, mountains, peak, and pass:\r\n\r\n  “Hills peep o’er hills, and Alps on Alps arise.”\r\n\r\nNowhere else, in one quarter of the globe, has nature laid her hand\r\non the face of the earth with the same majesty; no other division\r\nof it presents the same contrasts in a panorama so astonishing; no\r\nother exhibits so surprising a diversity of landscapes, caverns and\r\nwaterfalls, fields of ice and cascades, green and broad mountain-sides,\r\npastoral abodes and smiling vales, winding and rocky paths, aerial\r\nbridges and infernal glens, eternal snows and luxuriant pastures,\r\nforests of dark larches and congress of hoary mountains, austere\r\nloveliness and lofty nobleness:\r\n\r\n  “Ever charming, ever new,\r\n  When will the landscape tire the view?\r\n  The mountain’s fall, the river’s flow,\r\n  The wooded valleys, warm and low;\r\n  The windy summits wild and high,\r\n  Roughly rushing on the sky;\r\n  Town and village, tower and farm,\r\n  Each give to each a double charm.”\r\n\r\nIf the Neapolitan be moved to call the environments of his capital\r\n“_un pezzo del cielo caduto in terra_” (“a bit of heaven fallen upon\r\nthe earth”), the Swiss may more modestly claim that they have that\r\npiece of the Garden of Eden only which the angels of the legend lost\r\non their way. It is impossible to convey a vivid, and at the same time\r\nan accurate, impression of grand scenery by the use of words. Written\r\naccounts, when they come near their climax, fall as much below the\r\nintention as words are less substantial than things.\r\n\r\nThe _mountains_ come first in the glory and charm of Switzerland’s\r\nnatural beauties and attractions. They encompass us on every hand; fill\r\nour eyes when we are walking and haunt our dreams during sleep,--so\r\nbeautiful, so majestic, and yet so lovely. Grandeur of bulk and mass\r\nis conjoined with splendor and fulness of detail; form and shape are\r\ncrowned with soaring peak and matchless line; and the summits mingle\r\nwith that sky which seems to be the only fitting background for the\r\neternal hills. On the face of a topographical map Switzerland appears\r\nto consist chiefly of mountains lying near together, or piled one upon\r\nanother, as if the story of the Titans was realized, and with narrow\r\nvalleys between them. Of the western, central, and eastern Alps,\r\nconstituting the whole Alpine system, a part of the first, the whole\r\nof the second, and none of the third division belong to Switzerland.\r\nThe entire giant fabric, rising concentrically and almost abruptly from\r\nthe surrounding plains, offers its grandest development in Switzerland\r\nand Savoy. There are points of view in Switzerland whence the array\r\nof Alpine peaks, semicircular in form, presented at once to the eye,\r\nextends for more than one hundred and twenty miles, and comprises\r\nfrom two hundred to three hundred distinct summits, capped with snow\r\nor bristling with bare rocks. The Swiss Alps are divided into several\r\nsections,--the Pennine Alps, the Helvetian Alps, the Rhetian Alps, and\r\nthe Bernese Alps; all radiate from a central group, the St. Gothard\r\nbeing the key of the entire system, and all converge upon it. The\r\nPennine are the loftiest, including Mont Blanc,--\r\n\r\n          “the monarch of mountains:\r\n    They crown’d him long ago,\r\n  On a throne of rocks, in a robe of clouds,\r\n    With a diadem of snow.”\r\n\r\nIt is true that Mont Blanc is in Upper Savoy, just across the Swiss\r\nfrontier, but it is a part of the same wonderful formation, and few\r\npeople think of it without passing it incontinently to the credit of\r\nSwitzerland.\r\n\r\nThen come the Finsteraarhorn and Monte Rosa, being, next after Mont\r\nBlanc, the two highest mountains in Europe. The most important ranges\r\nare the Alps, which run along the Italian frontier, the Bernese\r\nOberland, and the Juras, which separate Switzerland on the west from\r\nFrance. Of the Bernese Alps the Finsteraarhorn, Jungfrau, Eiger, and\r\nSchreckhorn are the most conspicuous. As to height, the Alps are\r\ndivided into the High Alps, rising from eight thousand to fifteen\r\nthousand feet above the level of the sea, and covered with perpetual\r\nsnow and ice; the Middle Alps, beginning at about five thousand five\r\nhundred feet above the sea and rising to the point of perpetual\r\ncongelation; and the Low Alps, commencing with an elevation of about\r\ntwo thousand feet. The actual height of the Swiss mountain fluctuates\r\nas much as twenty-five feet, owing to the varying thickness of the\r\nstratum of snow that covers the summit. Some present pure white peaks;\r\nsome are black and riven under the frown of imperious cumuli; some\r\nhave cornices, bosses, and amphitheatres; others have blue rifts,\r\nsnow precipices, and glaciers issuing from their hollows,--“a chaos\r\nof metamorphic confusion, paradoxical conglomerates, strata twisted,\r\npitched vertically or upside-down, levels changed by upheavals or\r\ndepression.”\r\n\r\n  “As Atlas fix’d, each hoary pile appears\r\n  The gather’d winter of a thousand years.”\r\n\r\nA mountain guide will enumerate for you the names of the celebrated\r\nsummits, as a cicerone points out the most illustrious figures in a\r\nmuseum of sculpture. Each of these mountains has its biography,--its\r\nhistory,--which the guide will be sure to relate. One takes life, it\r\nis a sanguinary homicidal Alp; another, on the contrary, is humane,\r\nhospitable, it offers safe sheltering-places to strayed travellers.\r\nThe Matterhorn is a great storm-breeder.[93] The Schreckhorn is a peak\r\nof terror, the grimmest fiend of the Oberland; the Finsteraarhorn is a\r\nblack peak of the Aar; Diablerets (Devil’s Strokes) is a name given to\r\nanother in consequence of its terrible landslips, which have caused a\r\npopular superstition that, like Avernus, it is the portal of hell, and\r\nhaunted by evil spirits. Differing in form, altitude, and color, each\r\nof them has its physiognomy and its character, and even “its soul,” as\r\nMichelet says.\r\n\r\n  “Veil’d from eternity, the Jungfrau soars,”\r\n\r\nnot a single massive pyramid, but a series of crests rising\r\nterrace-fashion above each other, with a zone of névés and glaciers.\r\nThe pure, unsullied snow which always covers this mountain, it is\r\nsupposed, gave occasion to its name, which signifies “the virgin.” It\r\nis a prime favorite with the Swiss,--the great Diana of the Oberland\r\nrange. There is some spell, some mysterious potency in it. A sight\r\nnever to be forgotten, is to behold the marble dome of this stately\r\ntemple of nature, kindling in the fire of the setting sun, or silvering\r\nin the light of a full moon, with the gold-fringed clouds playing\r\nwantonly about,--\r\n\r\n  “To bathe the virgin’s marble brow,\r\n  Or crown her head with evening gold.”\r\n\r\nOn the Wengern Mountain, in full view of the Jungfrau, in 1816, Byron\r\ncomposed three of his noblest poems,--“The Prisoner of Chillon,” the\r\nthird canto of “Childe Harold,” and “Manfred,” in the latter of which\r\nhe describes the Jungfrau as\r\n\r\n          “This most steep, fantastic pinnacle,\r\n  The fretwork of some earthquake,--where the clouds\r\n  Pause to repose themselves in passing by.”\r\n\r\nAll the Alps have, more or less, naked excrescences, which rise above\r\nthe crest of the range, and which, in the language of the country, are\r\nnot inaptly termed “dents,” from some fancied and plausible resemblance\r\nto human teeth.\r\n\r\nProfessor Tyndall, writing of the wondrous scene presented by the\r\nSwiss mountains, says: “I asked myself, how was this colossal work\r\nperformed? Who chiselled these mighty and picturesque masses out of\r\na mere protuberance of the earth? And the answer was at hand. Ever\r\nyoung, ever mighty, with the vigor of a thousand years still within\r\nhim, the real sculptor was even then climbing up the eastern sky. It\r\nwas he who raised aloft the waters which cut out the ravines; it was he\r\nwho planted the glaciers on the mountain slopes, thus giving gravity\r\na plough to open up the valleys; and it is he who, acting through\r\nthe ages, will finally lay low these mighty mountains, rolling them\r\ngradually seaward, sowing the seeds of continents to be, so that the\r\npeople of another earth may see mould spread and corn wave over the\r\nhidden rocks which at this moment bear the weight of the Jungfrau.”\r\n\r\nMountains at once excite and satisfy an ideal in the soul, which holds\r\nkin with the divine in nature. They ennoble life by their majesty\r\nand fortify it by their stately beauty. The human mind thirsts after\r\nimmensity and immutability, and duration without bounds; but it needs\r\nsome tangible object from which to take its flight, something present\r\nto lead to futurity, something bounded from whence to rise to the\r\ninfinite. “Earth has built the great watch-towers of the mountains,\r\nand they lift their heads far up into the sky and gaze ever upward\r\nand around to see if the judge of the world comes not.”[94] Their\r\ncloud-capped summits are awful in their mysterious shrouds of darkness,\r\nand their sudden thunder crashing amid overhanging precipices is often\r\nterrible in its shock. With many their gloomy sublimity, hard, jagged,\r\nand torn, produces an uncomfortable feeling: Goethe wrote, “Switzerland\r\nwith its mountains at first made so great an impression upon me that\r\nit disturbed and confused me, only after repeated visits did I feel\r\nat my ease among them.” There is something inexpressibly interesting\r\nin their society, their age, their duration without change, and their\r\nmajestic repose; their fixed, frozen, changeless glory. The sun rolls\r\nhis purple tides of light through the air that surrounds their summits,\r\nbut his beams wake no seed-time and ripen no harvest. The moon and\r\nthe stars rise and move, and decline along the horizon, century after\r\ncentury, but the sweet vicissitudes of the season and of time move\r\nnot the sympathies of these pale, stern peaks, over which broods\r\none eternal winter. Upon them the vivifying and ordering syllables\r\nof creation seem never to have passed; a realm of chaos reserved to\r\nthe primeval empire of the _formless_ and the _void_; where there is\r\nbrilliance without warmth, summer without foliage, and days but no\r\nduties. Beneath the overwhelming radiance of a world of light, whose\r\nreflection makes every valley beneath them rejoice, these giants flaunt\r\ntheir crowns of snow everlastingly in the very face of the sun. They\r\nare so sharply defined and distinct that they seem to be within arm’s\r\nreach; apparent nearness, yet a sense of untraversable remoteness,\r\nlike heaven itself, at once the most distant from us and the nearest.\r\nTheir angle of elevation, seen from a distance, is very small indeed.\r\nFaithfully represented in a drawing, the effect would be insignificant;\r\nbut their aerial perspective amply restores the proportions lost in the\r\nmathematical perspective. “Mountains are the beginning and end of all\r\nnatural scenery,” and there is no Landseer for Alpine pictures. They\r\nare too vast and too simple; and the scene, though its objects are so\r\nfew, is too expanded for the canvas.\r\n\r\nThe _Glaciers_ of the Alps, frozen streams of ice, are remarkable\r\nphenomena of nature, and possess the greatest interest for geologists.\r\nThe name _Glacier_ is French; the German word is _Gletscher_, and the\r\nItalian _Ghiacciaio_. Ruskin calls them “silent and solemn causeways,\r\nbroad enough for the march of an army in a line of battle, and quiet\r\nas a street of tombs in a buried city;” Longfellow describes them as\r\n“resembling a vast gauntlet, of which the gorge represents the wrist,\r\nwhile the lower glacier, cleft by its fissures into fingers, like\r\nridges, is typified by the hand.” With the exception of the Engadine,\r\nwhere the limits do not begin below ten thousand and seventy feet, in\r\nthe other parts of Switzerland the limit of the glaciers and of the\r\neternal snow is met with at eight thousand seven hundred and forty to\r\nnine thousand one hundred and eighty feet. The average height of the\r\nsnow-line fluctuates according to north or south aspect, and greater or\r\nless exposure to the south wind, but in exceptionally warm summers, the\r\nsnow completely melts away on summits having an altitude of over eleven\r\nthousand feet. The common expression, the “line of perpetual snow,”\r\nis misleading; it is only correctly used to indicate the altitude\r\nabove which the mountains always appear white, because at that height\r\nit is merely the surface which at times thus gets partially melted.\r\nThese masses of ice or glaciers are called streams, because, though\r\nimperceptibly, they really move along; they are continually descending\r\ntowards the valley from the mountain-tops:\r\n\r\n  “The glacier’s cold and restless mass\r\n  Moves onward day by day.”\r\n\r\nTheir immobility is only apparent, they move and advance without\r\nceasing. Careful investigation has ascertained the rate of motion of\r\na glacier to be as much as two feet in twenty-four hours; but it is a\r\ncurious fact that the whole stream does not move at the same rate; the\r\ncentre moves quicker than the sides and drags them after it. Agassiz,\r\nthe Swiss naturalist, began in 1842 a series of careful observations\r\non the Aar glacier, taking up his abode in a little hut constructed on\r\npurpose, and called the “_Hôtel des Neuchâtelois_.” Men mocked at him\r\nwhen he set up his stakes on the glacier to discover the rate of the\r\ninvisible motion, but he persisted in his minute, painstaking labors,\r\nfutile and inconsequential as they seemed to the unscientific mind,\r\ntill he plucked out from every glacier in Switzerland the heart of its\r\nmysterious movement. He held that the differences in speed between\r\ndifferent and sundry parts of the same glacier were the results of\r\nunequal density and of unequal declivity. Savants differ as to the\r\ncauses which set the glacier in motion. Schaelzer holds that its\r\nexpansion arises from thaw; Professor Hugi is of the same opinion, that\r\nthe glacier, like an enormous sponge filled with aqueous particles,\r\nexpands and grows larger when it freezes. Of all the theories that of\r\nDe Saussure is the most generally accepted. He attributes the forward\r\nmovement of a glacier to gravitation,--that is to say, to the pressure\r\nof the superior masses on the inferior. Certain naturalists affirm that\r\nthe glaciers add to their power by their own cold, and that in time,\r\nwithout the intervention of some new natural phenomenon, they will\r\neventually extend themselves downward into the valleys that lie on the\r\nnext level beneath, overcoming vegetation and destroying life. There\r\nmust be a limit somewhere to the increase of the ice, and it is almost\r\ncertain that these limits have been attained during the centuries that\r\nthe present physical formation of Switzerland is known to have existed.\r\nAs a whole, the contest between heat and cold ought to be set down as\r\nproducing equal effects.\r\n\r\nThe constant heavy pressure on the glacial ice, and the tension\r\nresulting from obstacles in the channel followed by it, cause splits\r\nof large masses to occur, and force them so far to separate that\r\nthere is no chance of regelation. These splits are the _crevasses_\r\nmet with in many glaciers, and one of the most dangerous features\r\nto climbers, especially when they are concealed by a treacherous\r\ncoating of snow. The transverse crevasses are so close together and\r\nform such a bewildering labyrinth that it requires a good pilot and\r\nexperienced guide to steer clear of their difficulties. In proportion\r\nas the glacier develops, these crevasses or fissures enlarge. Some\r\nof them form into deep valleys, abysses, and unfathomable gulfs. If\r\none falls into a crevasse, it is alleged he hears everything that\r\nis said above him, but cannot make himself heard. The ice of these\r\nfissures has tints of extraordinary fineness and delicacy; it is of\r\na pale and tender blue, but if you detach a piece to examine it in\r\nfull light, its beautiful ideal blue color disappears, and you have\r\nnothing in your hand but a pale, colorless block. The crevasses, at\r\ntimes all lined with the purest, smoothest snow, open up like great\r\nalcoves, hung in clouds of ice with delicate ornaments thrown on them\r\nby the wind. They modify and change every spring, when the winter’s\r\naccumulation of snow melts under the action of the heat, and the frost\r\nof the nights incorporates it with the glacier. The guides, therefore,\r\nbefore conducting parties at the beginning of the season, sound the\r\nold crevasses, and study the new features of the glacier, its curves,\r\nits bridges of snow suspended in the air, its abysses covered with a\r\nfrail surface, its fantastic architecture of staircases and terraces\r\nof ice. The glacier ice, made of annual beds disposed in vertical bands\r\nof white and blue, does not resemble ordinary ice, which is homogeneous\r\nthroughout; it is granular, traversed by a multitude of small canals,\r\nby a net-work of veins in which a bluish water circulates, and which\r\npenetrates the whole thickness of the ice. The water that escapes\r\nfrom a glacier is either black, like ink, or green, like absinthe, or\r\nwhite, like milk; it is always troubled, and charged with mud or earth\r\nfull of fertilizing matter. So, while the glaciers make the higher\r\nvalleys into a land of desolation and misery, lower down on the slopes\r\nthat drink life from its flood, it is a garden, an orchard, a rich\r\nvine country, smiling hill-sides, shaded with trees and crowned with\r\nflowers. While a glacier is a stream of ice, it is not formed of frozen\r\nwater, but of frozen snow. The snow of the mountain-top is a fine dry\r\npowder, which is formed into a granular mass by the action of the sun\r\nshining on it in the middle of the day; what is thus partially melted\r\nquickly freezes again each evening into globular forms, consequently\r\na glacier is not slipping like ordinary ice. This process has gone on\r\nfor unknown ages. Geologists think that the glaciers of the present day\r\nare “mere pigmies as compared to the giants of the glacial epoch;” and\r\nthat their action has had much to do with the architecture of the Alps;\r\nthat the ice exerts a crushing force on every point of its bed which\r\nbears its weight, and the glaciers would naturally scoop out and carve\r\nthe mountains and valleys into the slopes which we now see; and that\r\nthe plains of Italy and Switzerland are covered with _débris_ of the\r\nAlps. These geologists are pretty well agreed that the Lake of Geneva\r\nwas excavated by a glacier. Whatever may be thought of the erosive\r\ntheory, there is no doubt that these dreary wastes of ice are of great\r\nuse in the economy of nature. They are the locked-up reservoirs, the\r\nsealed fountains which immediately fertilize the plains of Lombardy,\r\nthe valley of the Rhone, and of Southern Germany, and from which the\r\nvast rivers traversing the great continents of our globe are sustained.\r\nThe summer heat, which dries up sources of water, first opens out their\r\nbountiful supplies. When the rivers of the plain begin to shrink and\r\ndwindle within their parched beds, the torrents of the Alps, fed by the\r\nmelting snow and glaciers, rush down from the mountains and supply the\r\ndeficiency. Professor Hugi’s hypothesis, that the glacier is alive,\r\nis often suggested by the singular noises produced by the forcing of\r\nair and water through passages in the body of the glacier. In the eyes\r\nof the credulous mountaineers who live in the silence which broods\r\nover the sombre cliffs, the glacier is a place of grief and exile,\r\nof penance and punishment, of expiation and tears, such a place as\r\ndescribed by Dante in his “Inferno,” where\r\n\r\n            “... various tongues,\r\n  Horrible languages, outcries of woe,\r\n  Accents of anger, voices deep and hoarse,\r\n  With hands together smote, that swelled the sounds,\r\n  Made a tumult that forever whirls\r\n  Round through that air, with solid darkness stained,\r\n  Like to the sand that in the whirlwind flies.”\r\n\r\nThe peasants tell old stories of ice-gods ruling and thundering with\r\nstrange sounds, and the “lamentations and loud moans” of prisoners\r\nin these frozen caves. The legends people the glaciers only with\r\ngloomy, unhappy beings, trembling with fear, weighed down by some\r\nmalediction. Professor Helm has made a careful survey of the Alpine\r\nglaciers, and reckons them at eleven hundred and fifty-five, of which\r\nSwiss territory includes four hundred and seventy-one. He estimates\r\nthe total superficial area of these glaciers between three thousand\r\nand four thousand square kilometres; the area of the Swiss glaciers\r\nis put down as eighteen hundred and thirty-nine square kilometres.\r\nThey begin in the Canton of Glarus, extend to the Grisons, thence to\r\nthe Canton of Uri, and finally down to Bern. Of these Swiss glaciers,\r\none hundred and thirty-eight are of the first rank,--that is, over\r\nfour and three-quarters of a mile long. Eight glaciers unite at the\r\nfoot of Monte Rosa, seven at the foot of the Matterhorn, and five at\r\nthe foot of the Finsteraarhorn. The _Mer de Glace_, which surrounds\r\nthe Bernina, is more than sixteen leagues in circumference. Its\r\ntempestuous waves, with azure reflections like lava, pile themselves\r\nin the defiles, precipitate themselves into the gorges, or run by a\r\nrapid descent into the depths of the valleys; sometimes they leap up\r\nbetween two points of rocks, dart into space, and remain suspended\r\nabove the abyss till the day when their frozen sheet is broken up and\r\nhurled into its depths. There are few grander sights than the Bernina,\r\nwith its boldly contoured granitic rocks and its glaciers creeping low\r\ndown into the valleys. The Canton of Grisons, of which the Engadine\r\nforms a part, counts more than one hundred and fifty glaciers. The\r\ngreat ice-fields of the Bernese Oberland consist of one hundred and\r\neight to one hundred and twenty square miles in extent, and are the\r\nmost extensive in Europe. The boundaries are the Valais, the Grimsel,\r\nthe valley of the Aar, and the Gemmi, and spread over more than two\r\nhundred and thirty thousand acres. The longest glacier is the _Gross\r\nAletsch_ of the Bernese Oberland; it is fifteen miles long, and has a\r\nbasin forty-nine and eight-tenths square miles, and a maximum breadth\r\nof nineteen hundred and sixty-eight yards. The Rhone glacier is admired\r\nfor its natural beauties, more especially on account of its terminal\r\nface, furrowed by huge crevasses. The lowest point to which a Swiss\r\nglacier is known to have descended is three thousand two hundred and\r\ntwenty-five feet, attained by the Lower Grindelwald glacier in 1818.\r\nAs to the thickness of the glaciers there exist no reliable data. In\r\nthe series of investigations and measurements made by Professor Agassiz\r\non the Aar glacier, fifty years ago, he excavated to a depth of two\r\nhundred and sixty metres (over eight hundred and thirty feet), and\r\ndid not get to the bottom. He estimated the depth of the Aar glacier,\r\nat a point below the junction of the Finsteraarhorn and Lauter-Aar\r\nglaciers, at four hundred and sixty metres, or about fifteen hundred\r\nand ten feet. In viewing these glaciers no one, however sceptical,\r\nhowever unimaginative, can doubt the honesty of the great fiery Swiss\r\nnaturalist’s belief in the historical reality of a glacial epoch, that\r\nthis part of Switzerland is the natural result of the terrific orgy and\r\ndynamic force of profound glaciation, and that\r\n\r\n                    “Yon towers of ice\r\n  Since the creation’s dawn have known no thaw.”\r\n\r\nThe upper part of the glacier is known as the _Névé_ or _Firn_, and\r\nit is the lower part alone which is designated among the Swiss as the\r\nglacier. The névés are those fields of dazzling snow which extend above\r\nthe zone of the glaciers, and their incessant transformation produces\r\nthe glaciers. This snow of the névés does not resemble that lower down;\r\nit is harder, colder, and has the appearance of needles of pounded\r\nice or little crystallized stars, and the alternations from frost\r\nto thaw give to this snow the brilliance of metal and a consistency\r\napproaching that of ice. The name _Moraine_ is given to those piles\r\nof stones, pebbles, blocks of rock, _débris_ of all sorts that the\r\nglacier brings down with it in its course, and which it gets rid of as\r\nsoon as possible. “The glacier is always cleansing itself,” and if it\r\nexpands, it breaks up and disperses its moraine; it pushes it, throwing\r\nout and piling on the sides even the largest blocks of stone. If, on\r\nthe contrary, it contracts, part of this chaos of _débris_, left in\r\nits place, becomes covered by degrees with a carpet of turf. When two\r\nglaciers descend by opposite valleys, abutting on the same bed, and\r\nmeet, their moraines mingle with one another, and are sometimes piled\r\nup till they attain a width of almost a thousand feet and a height of\r\nabout seventy. The _Moulins_ form conduits for the surface-water, to\r\ncarry it to the under-ground streams flowing beneath the glacier.\r\n\r\nEnormous masses of snow accumulate in some angle or on some ledge of\r\nthe mountains until they either fall by their own weight or are broken\r\noff by oscillations of the air, or the warm ground thaws the lower\r\nstratum, and then the mass begins to slide, gaining in bulk and speed\r\nin its course. This is the terrible _avalanche_, and dwellings and\r\neven entire villages are buried from thirty to fifty feet deep. It\r\nsometimes descends with a force which causes it to rebound up the side\r\nof the opposite mountain. The avalanche produces a prodigious roar, not\r\na reverberation of sound, but a prolongation of sound more metallic\r\nand musical than thunder, and may be heard at a great distance. An\r\navalanche may be set in motion by a very trifling disturbance of the\r\nair: the flight of a bird, the cracking of a whip, the conversation of\r\npersons going along, sometimes suffices to shake and loosen it from the\r\nvertical face of the cliffs to which it is clinging:\r\n\r\n  “Ye toppling crags of ice,\r\n  Ye avalanches, whom a breath draws down\r\n  In mountainous o’erwhelming.”\r\n\r\nThe cutting away of trees, at one time a common cause of avalanches, is\r\nforbidden by a federal law:\r\n\r\n  “Altdorf long ago had been\r\n  Submerged beneath the avalanches’ weight,\r\n  Did not the forest there above the town\r\n  Stand like a bulwark to arrest their fall.”\r\n\r\nThere is a distinction between summer and winter avalanches. The\r\nformer are solid avalanches formed of old snow that has acquired\r\nalmost the solidity of ice. The warmth of spring softens it, loosens\r\nit from the rocks, and it slides down into the valleys; these are\r\ncalled “melting avalanches,” and they regularly follow certain tracks\r\nwhich are embanked like the course of a river with wood or bundles\r\nof branches. The most dreaded and terrible avalanches--those of dry\r\npowdery snow--occur only in winter, when sudden squalls and hurricanes\r\nof snow throw the whole atmosphere into chaos. They come down in sudden\r\nwhirlwinds, with the violence of a waterspout, and in a few minutes\r\nwork great destruction.\r\n\r\nThe most memorable avalanche in Switzerland occurred in 1806, when\r\none of the strata of Mount Rossberg, composed of limestone and flint\r\npebbles, nearly three miles long, one thousand feet broad, and one\r\nhundred feet thick, precipitated from a height of three thousand feet\r\nand annihilated the three prosperous villages of Goldau, Busingen,\r\nand Lowerz, and killed four hundred persons. Enormous blocks, some of\r\nthem still covered with trees, shot through the air as if sent from a\r\nprojectile or tossed about like grains of dust. In 1501 a company of\r\nsoldiers were swallowed up by an avalanche near the St. Bernard. At\r\nFontana, in the Canton of Ticino, in 1879, the church and town-hall\r\nwere destroyed and many lives lost. On this occasion, within a space\r\nof five minutes, no less than three hundred and fifty thousand cubic\r\nmetres of earth and rock came down from a height of four thousand three\r\nhundred feet. In the same year an avalanche came rushing down the\r\nwesterly slope of the Jungfrau into Lauterbrunnen valley, a distance\r\nof about seven thousand feet. Its peculiar feature was that, not only\r\nalong its course, but even on the opposite side of the valley, twelve\r\nhundred feet away, the atmospheric pressure, which its rapid movement\r\ngenerated, was so great as to level entire forests. In the Rhone\r\nvalley, in 1720, a single avalanche destroyed one hundred and twenty\r\nhouses at Ober-Gestalen, killing eighty-eight persons and four hundred\r\nhead of cattle. The victims were buried in a trench in the churchyard,\r\nwhere an inscription, still existing, records the event in these words:\r\n“God! what a grief, eight and eighty in one grave!” In the Grisons, the\r\nwhole village of Selva was buried, nothing remained visible but the\r\ntop of the church-steeple, and Val Vergasca was covered for several\r\nmonths by an avalanche one thousand feet in length and fifty in depth.\r\nThe extraordinary power of the wind, which at times accompanies an\r\navalanche, is well known and dreaded. A case is recorded in which a\r\nwoman, walking to church, was lifted up into the air and carried to\r\nthe top of a lofty pine, in which position she remained lodged until\r\ndiscovered and rescued by the returning congregation. The avalanche\r\nexhibits a striking picture of ruin which nature inflicts upon her own\r\ncreations; she buildeth up and taketh down; she lifts the mountains\r\nby her subterranean energies, and then blasts them by her lightnings,\r\nfrosts, thaws, and avalanches:\r\n\r\n  “As where, by age, or rains, or tempests torn,\r\n  A rock from some high precipice is borne;\r\n  Trees, herds, and swains involving in the sweep,\r\n  The mass flies furious from the aerial steep,\r\n  Leaps down the mountain’s side, with many a bound,\r\n  In fiery whirls, and smokes along the ground.”[95]\r\n\r\nEvery movement that is grand or beautiful in the course of rushing\r\nwaters seems to be the mission of mountain streams to illustrate. The\r\nfierce rivers rush over rocks with such aimless force that the violence\r\nof the torrent creates a back sweep of the overdriven, mad waves; here\r\nand there in the bed of these rivers are seen blocks of stone, many of\r\nthem as large as a good-sized house, heaped up most strangely, jammed\r\nin by their angles, in equilibrium on a point, or forming perilous\r\nbridges over which you may with proper precaution pick your way to the\r\nother side. The quarry from which the materials of this bridge came is\r\njust above your head, and the miners are still at work,--air, water,\r\nfrost, weight, and time. Other blocks are only waiting for the last\r\nmoment of the great lever of nature to take the horrid leap, and bury\r\nunder some hundred feet of new chaotic ruins the trees and the verdant\r\nlawn below. All round is the sound of water, the beat of the waves on\r\nthe shore, the onward flowing of the river, the rush of the torrent,\r\nthe splash of the waterfall, or the bubbling of some little stream;\r\neverywhere the music of a hurrying stream accompanies you. Every valley\r\nhas its roar and rush of water and cataracts leaping to join the chorus\r\nof torrents below, making one appreciate Wordsworth’s line,--\r\n\r\n  “The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep.”\r\n\r\nThere is something which fascinates more in the free life, the young\r\nenergy, the sparkling transparency, and merry music of the smaller\r\nstreams. The upper Swiss valleys are sweet with perpetual streamlets,\r\nthat seem always to have “chosen the steepest places to come down for\r\nthe sake of the leaps, scattering their handfuls of crystals this way\r\nand that, as the wind takes them, with all the grace, but with none\r\nof the formalism of fountains, until at last they find their way down\r\nto the turf, and lose themselves in that, silently; with quiet depth\r\nof clear water furrowing among the grass-blades and looking only like\r\ntheir shadows, but presently emerging again in little startled gushes\r\nand laughing hurries, as if they had remembered suddenly that the day\r\nwas too short for them to get down the hill.” On summer days even the\r\nglaciers are furrowed with thousands of threads of water; innumerable\r\nlittle rills, which run and sparkle over its sides like streams of\r\nquicksilver, and which disappear suddenly in the moulins, at the bottom\r\nof which invisible canals join the extremity of the glacier. At night\r\nall these brooklets are silent, and stopped; the cold congeals and\r\nimprisons them in a thin coating of ice, which evaporates again the\r\nnext day. Of these mountain streams our own poet Bryant writes,--\r\n\r\n  “Thy springs are in the cloud; thy stream\r\n    Begins to move and murmur first\r\n  Where ice-peaks feed the noonday beam,\r\n    Or rain-storms on the glacier burst.”\r\n\r\nIt is easy to have cascades in Switzerland, with its vast bodies\r\nof snow at an elevation which does not preclude melting in summer,\r\nand from which the water has to find its way down rocky precipices,\r\nsometimes thousands of feet. The most noted of these cascades are the\r\n_Giessbach_ and the _Staubbach_. The first consists of a succession of\r\nseven cascades, embowered in foliage, leaping from a height of eleven\r\nhundred feet, and finally losing themselves in the waters of the Lake\r\nof Brienz; the soft winds swing the spray as light as a mist of the\r\nsunrise or the gentle sway of a bridal veil, while the rainbow hues\r\nrest like kisses on its silver threads. The Falls of Staubbach, or\r\n_Fall of Dust_, is well named; it is so ethereal, or dust-like, that it\r\nappears at times about to sail away like a cloud on the wings of the\r\nwind; it apparently creeps down from its lofty rock, a thousand feet\r\non high, and seems to throw itself timidly into the abyss, and to win\r\nslowly against the mass of air. This retarded appearance in the fall\r\nis caused by its being broken into mist soon after it leaves the shelf\r\nover which it is precipitated. In its centre the fall is purely vapor;\r\nbut the rock advancing somewhat towards the base, it collects again\r\ninto water as it strikes it and forms a stream at the bottom. It has\r\nbeen compared by poets to “the tail of the white horse on which death\r\nwas mounted,” and called a “sky-born waterfall,” and Goethe describes\r\nit,--\r\n\r\n  “Streams from the high,\r\n  Steep, rocky wall,\r\n  The purest fount;\r\n  In clouds of spray,\r\n  Like silver dust,\r\n  It veils the rock\r\n  In rainbow hues\r\n  And, dancing down,\r\n  With music soft,\r\n  Is lost in air.”\r\n\r\nWherever the sun can get at the naked rock of the mountain, from July\r\nto September, and find an open fissure, there vegetation climbs, and\r\nclinging, establishes itself, and flourishes, and blooms. Charming\r\ncolonies of little flowers seem to have emigrated from the valleys,\r\nand come to hide themselves in the cold deserts, where the brevity of\r\ntheir life appears to enhance the beauty of their color. To better\r\nresist the hoar-frost, they grow in thick tufts closely pressed\r\nagainst each other. The rocks are velvet with lichens and mosses, that\r\nanchor their roots into a mass of granite, grappling with a substance\r\nwhich, when struck with steel, tears up its tempered grain and dashes\r\nout the spark. There are familiar pinks, blue-bells, a species of\r\nforget-me-not, a small star-shaped flower of a deep metallic blue\r\nshading upon green, that flashes through the grass with a moist,\r\nlustrous softness,--it is the smaller gentian, so dear to the poet’s\r\nheart and verse. Then great rose-colored beds of rhododendrons; azaleas\r\nof vivid carmine; golden arnicas, with their stately bearing, like rays\r\nof sunshine turned into flowers; in every direction, orchids, diffusing\r\na strong odor of vanilla; and the narcissi, which are visible a great\r\ndistance, and their odor wafted by the wind, is no less penetrating\r\nthan that of an orange grove; the Alpine rose, of which Ruskin says,\r\n“when the traveller finds himself physically exhausted by the pomp of\r\nlandscape, let him sink down on his knees and concentrate his attention\r\non the petals of a rock-rose.” Against the cliffs are rich clumps of\r\nthe peerless, delicately-cut _Edelweiss_; called by the botanists\r\n“_Gnaphalium alpinum_.” It is a peculiar plant of delicate construction\r\nthat grows under the snow; containing very little sap, so that it can\r\nbe preserved a long time; the blossom is surrounded by white velvety\r\nleaves, and even the stem has a down upon it. The possession of one\r\nis proof of unusual daring, and to gather it, the hunter, tempted by\r\nits beauty and by his love (for it is immensely valued by the Swiss\r\nmaidens) climbs the most inaccessible cliffs on which it grows, and\r\nis sometimes found dead at the foot with the flower in his hand. No\r\nart can simulate its beautiful, ermine-like bloom, and experiments\r\nhave been made to cultivate it in other places, but it changes its\r\ncharacter and becomes transformed into a new species; in its Alpine\r\nhome alone will it flourish, and there must it be sought, and adorn\r\nthe hat as the badge of triumph for the Alpine climber. The mountain\r\nis really a botanical garden; the Swiss flora is the largest on the\r\nEuropean continent, in proportion to the area it covers. The varied\r\nlocal influences and conditions resulting from such a broken surface,\r\nand differences of altitude concur in producing the graduation and\r\nunbounded variety of botanical specimens.\r\n\r\nTrees are also present in great abundance and variety, increasing the\r\nenchantment of the view with their leafy clothing, which, by partly\r\nconcealing, adds charm of mystery to the prospect. There are specimens\r\nof noble chestnuts and walnuts, grand old oaks, larches, and gigantic\r\npines. The walnut-trees disappear at a height of twenty-five hundred\r\nfeet; chestnuts and beeches cover the slopes a little higher; to these\r\nsucceed the firs, which seem to have sown themselves in a luxuriant\r\nway, some standing alone in green gracefulness, others growing in\r\npretty little miniature groves; then the knotted oaks, holding by\r\ntheir strong roots to the precipitous sides; and the burly pines that\r\nflourish at far greater altitudes than either, seeming to require\r\nscarcely any earth, but grasping with their strong, rough roots the\r\nfrozen rock, out of which, somehow, they contrive to draw moisture.\r\nSome of the ancient pines on the Jungfrau are supposed to have stood\r\nthe blasts of winter for a thousand years; they are affirmed to be as\r\nhigh as one hundred and sixty feet, and to measure twenty-four feet in\r\ncircumference. It is their peculiar conical form which enables them to\r\nbow to, and thus resist the force of, the storm. The pine is the king\r\nof the mountains; he strikes his club-foot deep into the cleft of the\r\nrocks, or grasps its span with conscious power; there he lifts his\r\nhaughty front, like the warrior monarch that he is,--no flinching about\r\nthe pine, let the time be ever so stormy. His throne is the crag and\r\nhis crown is a good way up in the heavens, and as for the clouds, he\r\ntears them asunder sometimes and uses them for robes. Then the stern,\r\ndeep, awfully deep roar that he makes in a storm. When he has aroused\r\nhis energies to meet the storm, the battle-cry he sends down the wind\r\nis heard above all the roar and artillery of thunder, and when the\r\ntempest leaves him, how quietly he settles to his repose,--the scented\r\nbreeze of a soft evening breathes upon him and the grim warrior king\r\nwakes his murmuring lute, and through his dusky boughs float sweet and\r\nsoothing sounds. Higher still than the pine are the larches, a wood\r\nhighly valued; and at last comes the creeping pine, struggling against\r\nthe wind and cold: it is the highest climber among Alpine trees, and is\r\nthe immediate neighbor of the glacier.\r\n\r\nThe perils of wandering in the high Alps remain terribly real, and are\r\nonly to be met by knowledge, courage, caution, skill, and strength;\r\nfor rashness, ignorance, carelessness, the mountains still leave no\r\nmargin, and to these three-fourths of the catastrophes which shock us\r\nare to be traced. Mountaineering without guides is not a thing to be\r\nencouraged. The mountaineer’s instinct on rock and ice is an art quite\r\nas subtle and complex as the art of the seaman or the horseman. The\r\nsenses all awake, the eye clear, the heart strong, the limbs steady\r\nyet flexible, with power of recovery in store and ready for instant\r\naction should the footing give way, such is the discipline which these\r\nterrible ascents impose. The mountain guides are not ignorant, they\r\nare licensed only after severe examination. They are obliged to take\r\ncourses of study; they are taught topography, and how to read a map and\r\nfind their way by it; to use the compass and the other instruments that\r\nare indispensable in journeys of exploration; they are also taught how\r\nto bind up wounds, so as to be able to do what is necessary at once in\r\ncase of accident; in a word, they are brave, modest, affable, sunburnt,\r\nand scarred men, who have planted a flag on every summit, and who have\r\nlent to the stern and awful mountains the romance of mountaineering.\r\nIt is understood that a true Swiss guide is literally “faithful unto\r\ndeath;” that he does not hesitate to risk his own life for the sake of\r\nhis charge, and that instances are known in which it has not only been\r\nrisked but actually sacrificed. Many accidents in mountain-climbing\r\nhave resulted from an insane effort to dispense with the services of\r\naccredited guides, or disregarding their directions. In the short space\r\nof not quite a month, in 1887, eighteen tourists lost their lives; one\r\naccident on the Jungfrau involving the loss of six. The fate of blind\r\nguides and those they lead is set forth in unmistakable terms by the\r\nScriptures. Choose for your guides the hardy men who have learned their\r\nbusiness thoroughly, who have been chamois hunters from their youth,\r\nwho have lived on the mountains from their birth, and to whom the snows\r\nand rocks and the clouds speak a language which they can understand,\r\nand then accident is almost impossible. Roping is the common and safest\r\nprecaution, especially for ice traversing. A slip-knot is passed over\r\neach climber’s head and shoulders and drawn tight under the arms. It\r\ncannot be particularly pleasant, for at times the one in front makes a\r\nspring, forgetting others are tied behind him, and takes them unawares,\r\nnearly pulling them off their feet; then, on the other hand, oblivious\r\nof the person behind you, suddenly you are checked in the middle of\r\nyour jump, perhaps, over a crevasse, or when standing in a little niche\r\non a steep wall of ice a thousand feet high. The graceful alpenstock,\r\nso often seen in the hands of Swiss tourists inscribed with its roll\r\nof triumph, must be taken _cum grano salis_. Many of them have never\r\ndone service beyond mountain hotel parlors, broad piazzas, and great\r\ndining-rooms. They can be bought with “records” complete and shining,\r\nand therefore are not as closely related to mountain-climbing as one\r\nmight suspect them to be. It is refreshing to see young lads stalking\r\nabout with these alpenstocks and ice-axes, like conquerors amid a\r\nsubject race. What lofty scorn they have for every man who has not\r\nascended the highest peak, and yet they never dared to try it! They\r\ncall themselves mountaineers, and at evening and in bad weather stalk\r\nand lounge about the hotel, moody, terrible, and statuesque; they\r\nspeak to none but to other young braves, with whom they perpetually\r\nmutter dark things about horrid places and cutting the record. No;\r\ngood mountaineering is the education of a lifetime begun in childhood,\r\nand these pretentious youths are no more mountaineers than their boots\r\nare. Under proper precautions, and with an experienced guide, it is\r\nglorious and healthful exercise, and for purposes of science has been\r\nof incalculable value.\r\n\r\nIn the later Middle Ages invalids came to _Baden_, in the Canton\r\nof Aargau, for the sake of the mineral waters; and the springs\r\nof _Pfäffers_ were known in 1242, and the waters considered very\r\nefficacious, particularly in the case of persons “who had been\r\ntortured.” These places are still visited, but the air-cure of the\r\nmountain has almost superseded them. Jean Jacques Rousseau expressed\r\nsurprise that “bathing in the salubrious and beneficial mountain air\r\nhad not yet become one of the great resources of medical science or of\r\nmoral education.” There would be no occasion to-day for at least one\r\npart of his surprise. The Swiss mountains have developed well-defined\r\nand well-known health phases. They have become mediciners, and the\r\nsnow-clad peaks and the upper snow-clad valleys are being looked to\r\nby physicians for the relief of certain ailments not easily remedied\r\nby other means. Davos Platz and St. Moritz, in the Engadine, are\r\namong the most familiar regions famed for the climatic treatment\r\nof disease,--possessing remarkable health-giving properties in\r\nlung trouble. It is the exquisite purity of the air, exercise, and\r\nespecial modes of life which the mountains impose that serve as the\r\nchief medicine, and give these heights their beneficial virtues. The\r\nrarefaction has its own and special effect. The breathing becomes\r\nquicker, deeper, and fuller. One breathes fifteen to twenty-five per\r\ncent. less air to produce a given weight of carbonic acid. The action\r\nof the air on the blood in the lungs seems to be facilitated with\r\ndecreasing density; one, however, must ascend over two thousand feet\r\nbefore the lighter air-pressure begins to make itself appreciable,\r\nbut for every one thousand feet additional the difference in the\r\nrarefaction becomes of a very marked character. Here the law of “use\r\nand disuse of organs” is illustrated in typical fashion,--parts of\r\nthe lungs but little used in ordinary life are brought freely into\r\nuse,--one is forced to breathe deeply, thus the vital capacity is\r\nenlarged, and, by favoring exercise of little-used parts banishes the\r\ntendency to disease from one of the seats of life. This so-called\r\ndiaphanous rarefied air is not air, it is a celestial ether; and so\r\nwith the sun, though it is hot, what you feel is not heat, it is a\r\npermeating, invigorating, life-creating warmth. This warmth, then,\r\nwhich the sun imparts to this ether pervades your lungs, your heart,\r\nand reaches to your very bones. This virginally pure air makes you\r\nconscious of a lighter and of a quicker life, an unknown facility\r\nin breathing, and a lightness of body. Its electric freshness is a\r\nbrilliant vitality,--it is rest, inspiration, resolve. Then you are\r\nsurrounded with pine forests, and the bright sun is constantly raising\r\ninto the air from their trunks, branches, and leaves myriad molecules\r\nof their resinous exudations. On ascending a mountain the mean annual\r\ntemperature decreases on an average of one degree Fahrenheit for every\r\nthree hundred and forty-nine feet. The value of fresh air and exercise\r\nis a sentiment possibly as old as humanity itself. It is the same\r\nspirit which animated Hippocrates and Galen when those classic worthies\r\ndiscoursed upon the art of nature-cure. We really travel in circles in\r\nthe case of disease-cure, as in most other things. None the less may we\r\nbe thankful that, in our circular search after knowledge, we have come\r\nupon the beaten track of ancient days, and have enlarged the wisdom\r\nwhich of old showed forth the benefits of a cloudless sky and a pure\r\nether.\r\n\r\nThere are walks and excursions in the mountains for all, for the\r\ninvalid as for the cragsman; roads that are marvels of audacity,\r\ncrossing tremendous gorges, clinging in dizzy places along the\r\nprecipices at the foot of which is heard the boiling torrent, then\r\nsweeping around sudden corners and angles; roads will wind among the\r\nhills which rise steep and lofty from the scanty level place that\r\nlies between them, whilst the hills seem continually to thrust their\r\ngreat bulk before the wayfarer, as if grimly resolute to forbid his\r\npassage, or close abruptly behind him when he still dares to proceed.\r\nThere are broad avenues overarched with spreading elms and maples,\r\nwith vistas reminding one of the nave and aisles of a large cathedral.\r\nThe mountain-paths are so pretty and charming; they wander about so\r\ncapriciously and fancifully; they run so merrily over the moss in the\r\nwoods, and beside the murmuring brooks; they climb so cheerfully up the\r\nslopes and hill-sides; they lead you through so much of freshness, and\r\nperfume, and varied scenery, that the pleasures of sight soon make you\r\noblivious of bodily fatigue. The cemeteries placed among these wooded\r\nrocks and pastoral hills recall the wish of Ossian, “Oh, lay me, ye\r\nthat see the light, near some rock of my hills; let the thick hazels be\r\naround, let the rustling oak be near; green be the place of my rest,\r\nand let the distant torrent be heard.”\r\n\r\nSwitzerland is rich in aquatic landscapes; no country except Norway\r\nand Sweden has such a number of inland lakes. The Lakes of Geneva,\r\nLuzern, Zurich, Thun, Neuchâtel, Bienne, and Zug are all historic, and\r\nhave been the subject of numerous pen-pictures. The Lake of Geneva\r\nis the largest of Western Europe, being fifty-seven miles long, and\r\nits greatest width nine miles; it has its storms, its waves, and its\r\nsurge; now placid as a mirror, now furious as the Atlantic; at times\r\na deep-blue sea curling before the gentle waves, then a turbid ocean\r\ndark with the mud and sand from its lowest depths; the peasants on\r\nits banks still laugh at the idea of there being sufficient cordage\r\nin the world to reach to the bottom of the _Genfer-See_. It is eleven\r\nhundred and fifty-four feet above the sea, and having the same depth,\r\nits bottom coincides with the sea-level; the water is of such exceeding\r\npurity that when analyzed only 0.157 in 1000 contain foreign elements.\r\nThe lake lies nearly in the form of a crescent stretching from the\r\nsouthwest towards the northeast. Mountains rise on every side, groups\r\nof the Alps of Savoy, Valais, and Jura. The northern or the Swiss\r\nshore is chiefly what is known as a _côte_, or a declivity that admits\r\nof cultivation, with spots of verdant pasture scattered at its feet\r\nand sometimes on its breast, with a cheery range of garden, chalet,\r\nwood, and spire; villas, hamlets, and villages seem to touch each\r\nother down by the banks, and to form but one town, whilst higher up,\r\nthey peep out from among the vineyards or nestle under the shade of\r\nwalnut-trees. At the foot of the lake is the white city of Geneva, of\r\nwhich Bancroft wrote, “Had their cause been lost, Alexander Hamilton\r\nwould have retired with his bride to Geneva, where nature and society\r\nwere in their greatest perfection.” The city is divided into two parts\r\nby the Rhone as it glides out of the basin of the lake on its course\r\ntowards the Mediterranean. The Arve pours its turbid stream into the\r\nRhone soon after that river issues from the lake. The contrast between\r\nthe two rivers is very striking, the one being as pure and limpid as\r\nthe other is foul and muddy. The Rhone seems to scorn the alliance and\r\nkeeps as long as possible unmingled with his dirty spouse; two miles\r\nbelow the place of their junction a difference and opposition between\r\nthis ill-assorted couple is still observable; these, however, gradually\r\nabate by long habit, till at last, yielding to necessity, and to the\r\nunrelenting law which joined them together, they mix in perfect union\r\nand flow in a common stream to the end of their course.[96] At the\r\nhead of the lake begins the valley of the Rhone, where George Eliot\r\nsaid, “that the very sunshine seemed dreary mid the desolation of ruin\r\nand of waste in this long, marshy, squalid valley; and yet, on either\r\nside of the weary valley are noble ranges of granite mountains, and\r\nhill resorts of charm and health.” At the upper part of the lake are\r\nMontreux, Territet, and Vevay, sheltered from the north wind by the\r\nwestern spurs of the Alps, and celebrated for their beauty, and beloved\r\nof travellers; places of cure and convalescence for invalids, where\r\nthe temperature even in winter is of extreme mildness, having a mean\r\nduring the year of 48° Fahrenheit at seven o’clock in the morning,\r\n57° at one o’clock in the afternoon, and 50° at nine o’clock in the\r\nevening; with a barometer register of 28¾ inches at the level of the\r\nlake. Standing at almost any point on the Lake of Geneva, to the one\r\nside towers Dent-du-Midi, calm, proud, and dazzling, like a queen\r\nof brightness; on the other side is seen the Jura through her misty\r\nshroud extending in mellow lines, and a cloudless sky vying in depths\r\nof color with the azure waters. So graceful the outlines, so varied\r\nthe details, so imposing the framework in which this lake is set, well\r\nmight Voltaire exclaim, “_Mon lac est le premier_,” (my lake is the\r\nfirst). For richness combined with grandeur, for softness around and\r\nimpressiveness above, for a correspondence of contours on which the eye\r\nreposes with unwearied admiration, from the smiling aspect of fertility\r\nand cultivation at its lower extremity to the sublimity of a savage\r\nnature at its upper, no lake is superior to that of Geneva. Numberless\r\nalmost are the distinguished men and women who have lived, labored, and\r\ndied upon the shores of this fair lake; every spot has a tale to tell\r\nof genius, or records some history. In the calm retirement of Lausanne,\r\nGibbon contemplated the decay of empires; Rousseau and Byron found\r\ninspiration on these shores; there is\r\n\r\n  “Clarens, sweet Clarens, birthplace of deep love!\r\n  Thine air is the young breath of passionate thought;\r\n  Thy trees take root in love.”\r\n\r\nHere is Chillon, with its great white wall sinking into the deep\r\ncalm of the water, while its very stones echo memorable events,\r\nfrom the era of barbarism in 830, when Count Wala, who had held\r\ncommand of Charlemagne’s forces, was incarcerated within the tower of\r\nthis desolate rock during the reign of Louis le Débonnaire, to the\r\nimprisonment of the Salvation Army captain.[97]\r\n\r\n  “Lake Leman lies by Chillon’s walls;\r\n  A thousand feet in depth below,\r\n  Its massy waters meet and flow;\r\n  Below the surface of the lake\r\n  The dark vault lies”\r\n\r\nwhere Bonnivard, the prior of St. Victor and the great asserter of the\r\nindependence of Geneva, was found when the castle was wrested from the\r\nDuke of Savoy by the Bernese.\r\n\r\nAlong the shores of Lake Geneva the Romans had many stations and posts,\r\nvestiges of which are still visible.[98] The confusion and the mixture\r\nof interests that succeeded the fall of the Empire gave rise in the\r\nMiddle Ages to various baronial castles, ecclesiastical towns, and\r\ntowers of defence, the ruins of which still stand on the margin of the\r\nlake or on the eminences a little inland,--\r\n\r\n  “Chiefless castles breathing stern farewells\r\n  From gray but leafy walls, where ruin greenly dwells.”\r\n\r\nThe Lake of Luzern, _Vierwaldstätter-See_, is hardly a single sheet\r\nof water, but is composed of a group of seven basins, some joined to\r\neach other by narrow straits, others intersecting each other at right\r\nangles, giving extreme variety to its breadth; its extreme length\r\nin a diverging line is twenty-four miles; its widest part, taking\r\nin the two arms of Küssnacht and Alpnach (southwest to northeast),\r\nis twelve miles, but the average breadth is much less. There are\r\nrepeated eclipses of the landscapes caused by abrupt turnings, bold\r\npromontories, and the amphitheatrical closing in of the mountain\r\nstrips, and again opening up to view. It is scarcely possible to\r\nimagine any combination of beautiful water and bold mountains more\r\nstriking, more effective, and more lovely than the scenes that meet\r\nthe view in traversing this lake. A dozen different mountains advance\r\ninto the lake and check themselves suddenly in the depths of the gloomy\r\nwaters. Bare, steep, turret-like rocks hanging amid the clouds; rich,\r\nlawn-like grass in the intervening glades, sparkling with cottages and\r\ngardens, succeed and blend with each other in infinite alternation.\r\n_Pilatus_ and the _Rigi_ guard the approach to the lake. The former is\r\nfull of mysterious legendary pools associated with the haunting spirit\r\nof Pontius Pilate. No less than thirty-five writers have treated of its\r\nsupernatural apparitions, but a very natural supposition traces the\r\nname to a corruption of _pilea_ or _pileatus_,--from the cap of clouds\r\nalways on its summit. The Rigi, the most frequented belvedere in the\r\nworld, stands between the lakes of Luzern and Zug. It is its situation,\r\nrather than its elevation, which renders it famous. Its summit is\r\nlittle less than six thousand feet above the level of the sea, but\r\nit stands in the midst of most lovely scenery, and from its top is\r\npresented an extensive panoramic view scarcely equalled anywhere in\r\nthe Alps. The sunrise from the Rigi is a spectacle that every tourist\r\ncontemplates with eager pleasure. Brilliant in dazzling whiteness stand\r\nthe mountains under the first light of the morning; it begins to kindle\r\non their tops its glowing beacon; suddenly the sunbeams strike their\r\ncrowns and convert them into a boss of gold; first the tallest presents\r\na gilded summit while the others wait in silence, then they, in the\r\norder of their height, come afterwards, relaxing, as the sunbeams\r\nstrike each in succession, into a blush and smile. The splendor of the\r\nwhole spectacle, when the sun streams all the magic of his beams to\r\ncast upon the land an enchantment greater than its own, is such as to\r\noverwhelm the soul with admiration and astonishment. All who sleep at\r\nthe _Culm_, or topmost point, may expect to be awakened by the sound\r\nof a wooden horn, about sunrise, when every one gets up with the hope\r\nof a splendid prospect--a hope often disappointed:\r\n\r\n  “Nine weary, up-hill miles we sped,\r\n    The setting sun to see;\r\n  Sulky and grim he went to bed,\r\n    Sulky and grim went we.\r\n\r\n  “Seven sleepless hours we tossed, and then,\r\n    The rising sun to see,\r\n  Sulky and grim we rose again,\r\n    Sulky and grim rose he.”\r\n\r\nThe Lake of Zug, or Zuger-See, is set like a fine pearl in a necklace\r\nof woods and gardens, fertile fields and hills, over which white houses\r\nare scattered like tents. Its banks are graceful, and in its waters\r\nare reflected rich and varied vegetation; near by are wide marshes\r\ndotted with pools, in the midst of which great water-lilies shine, and\r\na few islets covered with vegetation, looking like baskets of flowers\r\nfloating in the water.\r\n\r\nThe Lake of Thun is the golden gate-way to the Bernese Oberland, and\r\nits wealth and variety of scenery is the pride of that Canton.\r\n\r\nThe Lake of Zurich, while not pretending to vie with the others in\r\nstern and rugged magnificence, is unsurpassed in pastoral beauty; on\r\neither side rise gently-sloping hills of fruitful vineyards, at the\r\nfoot of which, lining the shores, are prosperous villages. Here have\r\nbeen discovered the earliest traces of human activity, back in the age\r\nof Stone and Lake-Dwellers. Excavations from the old basin of the lake\r\nhave hinted that it has tales to tell and secrets to reveal which for\r\nages on ages may have been safely hidden beneath its deep waters.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss lakes differ in color; some appear to be green as malachite,\r\nand others blue. The water appears commonly of a bluish-green, shading\r\ninto blue, with a slightly milky hue in the summer, especially when\r\nfed by the glacier streams, which bring down a quantity of finely\r\ntriturated rock. Whenever a lake has high mountains rising from its\r\nedge, the hue is a purple-blue. The transparency of the lake waters is\r\nquite surprising; in many of them minute objects can be seen at a depth\r\nof fifty feet, and even lower down, as clearly as if viewed through\r\na glass. There is a quiet luxury of excitement, without exercise, in\r\nvoyaging in the well-appointed steamers on calm Swiss lakes, which\r\npresent a shifting panorama of hill and river scenery.[99]\r\n\r\nThere is much difference of opinion as to when the natural beauties and\r\nattractions of Switzerland appear to the best advantage. The larger\r\nnumber of strangers see the country only in its summer charms; it\r\nis a season when the mountains assume a greater brilliance of color\r\nand grandeur of form, the lower atmosphere being cleared of its dark\r\nmists as the clouds lift and give an ever-increasing flood of light.\r\nThis greater altitude of the clouds brings the mountains into fuller\r\nsunshine, with their coloring more intense, their forms more massive,\r\nand the blue of the sky behind them deeper and clearer.\r\n\r\nThose who see the sun rise each morning in glory over the Alps, and\r\nglowing all day, set in a flood of crimson over the pines, only to\r\nreturn in the splendor of the after-glow on the glacier and snow, claim\r\nthat autumn is a better time for realizing this sum of marvellous\r\nbeauty; that it is the season of crimson and gold, when the landscapes\r\ntake on incomparable magnificence, when the transformation of the woods\r\nis fairy-like, when the oaks are surrounded with a golden aureola, the\r\nbeeches are dyed in vivid red and yellow, and all the wooded hills,\r\norchards, hedges, and bushes form, as it were, a marvellous symphony\r\nof color, of warmer shades, and tints of an infinite tenderness. Then\r\ncomes the advocate of winter, who says, “You should see the loads\r\nof snow, falling almost perpendicularly in thick, heavy flakes, or\r\nwhirled about by the wild wind; on the calming of the snow-storm, you\r\nshould see the heavy brown clouds in the south assume a tinge more\r\nand more golden and bright, till the first patch of blue sky bursts\r\nforth amidst the gigantic masses, and at last permits the winter sun,\r\nfar down in the south, to gladden the earth with a brief sight of the\r\nsource of light and life;” and that the trees are more beautiful in\r\nthe hoar-frost than in summer or autumn glory; the pines, with their\r\nbranches bent, “stand like harpers hoar, with beards that rest on their\r\nbosoms,” and the taller trees seem to beckon with their long, white\r\narms, like ghosts.\r\n\r\nThe snow, which long after it has fallen lies as pure and stainless\r\nas the raiment of angels, is the crowning glory of a Swiss winter. It\r\nhas an intensity of whiteness which gives a new force to “whiter than\r\nsnow.” St. Matthew describes the Lord’s transfiguration raiment as\r\n“white as the light,” but St. Mark as “exceeding white as snow.” This\r\nAlpine snow is light materialized, and snow etherealized--solidified\r\nlight. With the snow nature transfigures all the landscape; at one\r\nsweep of her broad brush all the clumsy touches with which man has\r\nmarred the beauty of the world are effaced, the hills are rounded to a\r\nriper beauty, the fields lie smooth and white and fair, an unwritten\r\npage waiting as for the bold outlines of some new design.[100] The\r\nmountain air appears to give additional brilliancy even to the rainbow,\r\nas it rests on the turbid blackness of the clouds; it looks so near,\r\nand every band of color so broad and distinct, filling the very air\r\nwith the haze of its colors; seeing a rainbow following an Alpine\r\nthunder-storm, one can well conceive how, before it was known what\r\nproduced the storm and the rainbow, the one was taken for the wrath and\r\nthe other for the smile of God.\r\n\r\n“All things are good, as their Creator made them, but everything\r\ndegenerates in the hands of man; improving, man makes a general\r\nconfusion of elements, climates, and seasons; he defaces, he confounds\r\neverything, as if he delighted in nothing but monsters and deformity;”\r\nthese are the first words of the “Æmilius,” and the key-note of the\r\nauthor’s philosophy. Conceding that man’s work does not deserve this\r\nunqualified condemnation, and is in many respects most admirable, one\r\nmust regret to see the work of nature in Switzerland so ruthlessly\r\nspoiled and disfigured; to see the telegraph-pole and the factory\r\nchimney rear themselves against the horizon of every landscape;\r\nmountain fastnesses and remote valleys consecrated to the charms of\r\nnature alone, resounding with the whistle of the locomotive and the\r\nstroke of the hammer; the iconoclastic hand of material enterprise,\r\ndivested of all sentiment, reaching out into every nook and corner\r\nwhere the Divine Artist has surpassed himself in his handiwork, to\r\ndiscover and develop new commercial opportunities. One now goes by\r\nsteam in place of _diligence_, and the lovers of the characteristic\r\nmay well regret that the _couleur locale_, so dear to strangers, is\r\nfast disappearing. No more the post-carriage takes you in its moving\r\nhouse, with the sound of jingling bells, the cracking of the driver’s\r\nwhip, and the notes of the horn waking up the echoes of the woods. No\r\nlonger the white oxen tug up the steep mountain; no longer the chat\r\nwith the village gossips at each post-station; the mid-day halt, where\r\none dives into castle, church, or old courtyard; the chaffering for\r\nsome local trifle; the antique furniture of the salon; the early walk\r\nbefore the coach was ready,--it is all, all, almost gone. In things\r\nspiritual and things temporal alike, our modern mania is to carry with\r\nus our own life, instead of accepting that which we find on the spot.\r\nAlpine touring has become a highly-organized institution, brought\r\nto perfection by everything that administrative genius, capital,\r\nand science can give. All the inscriptions on the votive offerings\r\ndiscovered around the ruins of the Temple of Jupiter Penninus on the\r\nGreat St. Bernard, and which come down to the latest periods of the\r\nRoman Empire, are filled with warm expression of gratitude for having\r\nescaped the extraordinary perils of the passage. Even in the days of\r\nPliny, several hundred years after the first passage of the Alps by the\r\nRoman troops, and even after the establishment of a station at Sion,\r\nin the Valais, it was spoken of as a “most hidden part of the earth,\r\nin the region of perpetual night, amid forests forever inaccessible\r\nto human approach.” The courage, skill, and ingenuity of man have\r\novercome all these formidable dangers. Though the mountains are still\r\nlofty and precipitous, safe and convenient passes have been found\r\npracticable, and paths have been contrived, upon these giddy heights,\r\nover which the maiden threads without a thought of danger. The rushing\r\ntorrents are loud and furious in the descent to the valley; but they\r\nhave been bridged over by stone and timber, or perhaps by the fallen\r\npine, and the peasant boy sings cheerily, as he strides across the\r\nfoaming stream. Steam and electricity make the railway train emulate\r\nthe agility of the chamois, and carry the public across precipices to\r\na height of seven thousand feet. There is scarcely a point of view\r\nthat attracts tourists, a summit that climbers make fashionable, but\r\nat once the mountain is rent and insulted; it is stripped of its\r\nbeautiful forests, iron rails are screwed to its wounded and bleeding\r\nside, and you are carried up like a bundle of luggage, with no\r\nroadside halts under the trees, no flowers gathered by the wayside,\r\nno rustic inns hidden under the firs, but all along station-masters,\r\nticket-collectors, and stations; or _chaises-à-porteur_, and long\r\nlines of mules file up the Alps, carrying Saratoga trunks and cases of\r\nClicquot to the level of the eternal snows. Mountain summits are no\r\nlonger reserved for those who arrogantly pride themselves on superior\r\nsoundness of wind and limb, but are equally accessible to the blind,\r\nhalt, and lame. The circular-tour ticket has brought these summits\r\nwithin reach of everybody’s purse and everybody’s legs. Greed of gain\r\nand competition are rapidly producing the effect of false mountains,\r\nsham mountains, built by contractors and shareholders; a mountain at\r\na fair that the people ascend a franc for the round trip; where the\r\ntourist is nothing but a number, and is always dining between two\r\ntrains, at the buffet of an international railway station. There is a\r\ntendency all the world over to the loss of the true sense of natural\r\nbeauty; and forest solitudes and quiet valleys must retreat before\r\nthe spirit of Mammon, and succumb to factories and foundries. Yet\r\nare not the natural beauties of a country an inestimable treasure to\r\nit, and, from a business view, is it wise, lightly to give away what\r\nmoney cannot buy, nor modern art create? With commercial and economic\r\ndisadvantages difficult to overcome, it would appear the wiser policy\r\nfor Switzerland to check the rapid transformation of the beautiful and\r\nthe venerable into cheap and tasteless novelties, with their cast-iron\r\nuninterestingness. Nature has done all for Switzerland, from its pure\r\nand radiant air to its mountains, lakes, and wild flowers, which spring\r\nup as though Aphrodite were still there, “to sow them with her odorous\r\nfeet.” This marvellous and rare beauty of nature is too often taken as\r\na matter of course, and “holy men, in recommending of the love of God\r\nto us, refer but seldom to those things in which it is most abundantly\r\nand immediately shown; though they insist much on His giving of bread\r\nand raiment and health, they require us not to thank Him for that\r\nglory of His works which He has permitted us alone to perceive; they\r\ntell us often to meditate in the closet, but they send us not, like\r\nIsaac, into the fields at even.”\r\n\r\nFortunately, the grandeur of Alpine scenery cannot be altogether\r\ndestroyed, though seriously injured, by the spade, the pickaxe, and\r\nthe blasting-powder. There is a poetry of science, even of practical\r\nscience, and the invaluable and ubiquitous engineer cannot after all\r\ndo much to the everlasting hills, except here and there a simple climb\r\nmay be made simpler still, and an opening effected through what looks\r\nlike one of the permanent barriers of the world. The physical geography\r\nof Switzerland is still a stupendous unit. Man may enormously modify\r\nits surface, but its original conditions remain dominant, forcing a\r\nstern recognition of their supremacy; mountain-ranges may be passed or\r\nsurmounted; they have never yet been lowered or removed; Switzerland\r\nwill ever be mastered by its sublime physical features. While much of\r\nthe simplicity which was formerly the attraction of the country has\r\npassed away, never to be restored, still it presents an unrivalled\r\nscene, in picturesque combination, with advantages of atmospheric\r\nrelief, and aided by the contributing glories of a luminous and\r\nsensitive sky. There is beauty of every sort; beauties to enrapture\r\nevery sense; beauties to satisfy every taste; forms the grandest and\r\nloveliest; colors the most gorgeous and the most delicate; harmonies\r\nthe most soothing and the most stirring; the sunny glories of the\r\nday; the pale grace of moonlight; the silent pinnacles of aged snows;\r\ntropical luxuriance; the serenity of peerless sunsets; the sublimity of\r\nunchallenged storms; pomp of summits and world of clouds; witchery of\r\nwater, sky, and mountain; a very cluster of delights and grandeurs, to\r\nenchant the vision and animate the spirit,--warming commonplace persons\r\ninto something approaching to poetic fervor, and persons of genius to\r\npour forth their inspirations in verse or lofty prose. You may have\r\nread the most vivid and accurate description, yet the reality will\r\nburst upon you like a revelation; a few cherished hallucinations may be\r\nuncovered to the raw air of truth, but you will look again and again,\r\nday after day, and a perennial glory will surround the kaleidoscopic\r\npanorama, “ever charming, ever new,” photographing it in the mind\r\nforever. Scarcely a day, or an hour of the day, when there is not\r\nbeing produced, scene after scene, picture after picture, glory after\r\nglory, and working still upon an inexhaustible source of constant and\r\nperfect beauty. It is indeed a beautiful land, meriting the words of\r\nthe Psalmist, “a fair place, the joy of the whole earth.” It is a place\r\nwhere all save the spirit of man seems divine; so fascinating, that,\r\nlike Virgil, who on his death-bed longed to view once more the nymphs\r\nof Bacchus as they danced on the banks of the river of Peloponnesus,\r\none who has visited Switzerland sighs again for its glorious sun,\r\nits delicious air with the shivering freshness of the glacier, its\r\nmagnificent scenery, its gorgeous mountains, its valleys of idyllic\r\nbeauty, its beautiful roads shaded by hedges, its streams bordered with\r\nhazel copses, its forests carpeted with moss, its corners of shade and\r\nsolitude with freshness and luxurious ease, its happy and tranquil\r\nretreats, and its asylums for modest pleasure or for calm repose:\r\n\r\n  “Who first beholds those everlasting clouds,\r\n  Those mighty hills, so shadowy, so sublime,\r\n  As rather to belong to heaven than earth,\r\n  But instantly receives into his soul\r\n  A sense, a feeling, that he loses not;\r\n  A something that informs him ’tis an hour\r\n  Whence he may date henceforward and forever?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM TELL.\r\n\r\n  “Almighty powers! That was a shot indeed;\r\n  It will be talked of to the end of time.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTrite and worn out as the subject may appear, it is impossible by any\r\namount of familiarity to divest the historical legend of William Tell\r\nof its undying charm; and he who has visited the scene, so far from his\r\ninterest in it being exhausted, has only been made more enthusiastic\r\nin its favor. It is a perfectly simple and natural story, when read in\r\nthe light of the times, the circumstances that led up to it, and the\r\nimpulses which sustained it throughout.\r\n\r\nNearly in the centre of Switzerland, around the Lake of Luzern, were\r\nthe Forest Cantons of Schwyz, Uri, and Unterwalden; defended on the\r\nnorth by the stormy waves of the lake, on the south by inaccessible\r\npeaks and glaciers, on the side of Germany by precipices and unbroken\r\nforests, and the Rigi in the midst. This district was inhabited by a\r\nshepherd race; the elevated and barren site of their habitations had\r\nsecured them from the cruel caprices of the petty tyrants who ruled\r\nover the lower valleys, and they governed themselves under the forms of\r\na republic. Rudolph of Hapsburg, the father of the founder of the House\r\nof Austria, a distinguished soldier and leader of the Zurich troops,\r\nthe son of an Alsatian landgrave, had his castle near the confluence\r\nof the Reuss and Aar, and in 1257 was voluntarily chosen by the people\r\nas their governor. Sixteen years later he ascended the imperial throne\r\nof the Roman Empire of Germany; for eighteen years he kept the throne,\r\nand, remembering that he was by birth a native of Switzerland, he\r\nprotected his countrymen from oppression, and was esteemed for his\r\nhumanity, prudence, and valor. He gave firm assurance that he would\r\ntreat them as worthy sons of the Empire, with inalienable independence;\r\nand to that assurance he remained true till his death, which happened\r\nin 1291. His son, Albert, who had been made Duke of Austria, ascended\r\nthe throne. He was grasping and eager to make territorial acquisitions.\r\nHe desired to be first Duke of Helvetia, and proposed to these Forest\r\nCantons that they should sever their relationship, as a province of\r\nthe German Empire, and become a member of his Dukedom. Though Emperor\r\nof Germany, he was Duke of Austria, and his ambition was to aggrandize\r\nthe Austrian House. The peasants rejected his proposition. Jealous\r\nof this remnant of independence, which the snows and rocks had left\r\nto the peasants of upper Helvetia, he undertook to subjugate them.\r\nFailing to seduce them by diplomacy or pretended kindness, he sent\r\n_landvogts_, or governors, to reside in their midst; these governors\r\nbore the title of Imperial Bailiffs. Instead of sending, as was usual,\r\nsome noblemen for imperial governors, whose functions were only those\r\nof high judges in capital crimes, he sent two dependants of his family,\r\nmen whose dispositions were as hostile and cruel as their orders.\r\nTheir mission was to goad and persecute the people into some act of\r\nrebellion, that might be used as a pretext for reducing them to the\r\nlevel of common slavery. There were two of these bailiffs, Berenger\r\nand Gessler, the former stationed at Sarnen, the latter at Altdorf;\r\nthey were unbounded in their tyrannies, using their powers wantonly,\r\nwith all the stings of insolent authority. Gessler was the most cruel;\r\nhe pillaged private property, imprisoned husbands, carried off the\r\nwives, and dishonored the daughters. It was now the beginning of the\r\nfourteenth century, and the country was in a degraded and miserable\r\ncondition. The land groaned under violence; the despotism was distant\r\nand delegated; the sovereign too far removed to hear the universal\r\nlamentation. It became intolerable. A few brave hearts reasoned,\r\nthat God had never granted power to any emperor, king, or bailiff to\r\ncommit such injustice; and that death was preferable to a continued\r\nsubmission under so ignominious a yoke. The wife of Werner Stauffacher,\r\nof Schwyz, being brutally treated by one of the bailiffs’ officers, in\r\nthe absence of her husband, on his return reporting the affair to him,\r\nexclaimed, “Shall we mothers nurse beggars at our bosoms, and bring up\r\nmaid-servants for foreigners? What are the men of the mountains good\r\nfor? Let there be an end of this!”[101] Stauffacher sought the counsel\r\nof Walter Fürst, of Uri, and Arnold Melchthal, of Unterwalden; and\r\nthese three, from the result of that counsel, became famous as\r\n\r\n  “The Patriot Three that met of yore,\r\n    Beneath the midnight sky,\r\n  And leagued their hearts on the Rütli shore\r\n    In the name of liberty.”\r\n\r\nBeing well acquainted with the most injured, the most intrepid, and\r\nthe most implacable of their countrymen, they determined to see them,\r\nand ascertain whether they would be willing to risk their lives in\r\ndefence of their liberties. If the blood of the martyrs is the seed of\r\nthe church, no less true is it in all history, that the insolence of\r\ntyranny is the cradle of liberty. Rütli, so called from the uprooting\r\nand clearing of the trees (German, _ausgereutet_), a secluded field\r\nbelow Seelisberg, in the Canton of Uri, on a steep, small promontory\r\nstanding out from the mountain and surrounded on three sides by the\r\nwaters of the lake, was the spot chosen for their council chamber.[102]\r\nOn the night of the 7th of November, 1307, descending from their\r\nmountains, or crossing the lake in small fishing-boats, came the\r\npatriot three, each, as he had agreed to do, bringing ten true and\r\nbrave herdsmen, stout of heart and strong of limb. They silently\r\ngathered at the lonely spot, as they had concerted. The love of native\r\nsoil, the feeling of freedom and security under the protection of the\r\nlaws of the country, the feeling of being ill treated and subjugated\r\nby a foreign debauchee, a determination to throw off so obnoxious\r\na yoke--all these great and good qualities were shared by these\r\nuntutored, but heroic, noble-minded peasants. A handful of patriots,\r\nmeeting at midnight, and attesting the justice of their cause to the\r\nAlmighty Disposer of events, the God of equity and mercy, the protector\r\nof the helpless; calm and united, proceeding to the delivery of their\r\ncountry; retaining all the serene forbearance of the most elevated\r\nreason, amid the energies and the fury of vindictive right. They could\r\nbear to die, but not to be subdued:\r\n\r\n  “They linked their hands,--they pledged their stainless faith\r\n  In the dread presence of attesting Heaven,\r\n  They knelt, and rose in strength.”\r\n\r\nThey met to interchange oaths, and not to utter exciting speeches;\r\n“words could not weigh in the balance with that decisive night,\r\nbrooding under cover of its darkness the resurrection of a nation, with\r\nthose mountains, stars, rocks, and waves, and with the sword ready to\r\nbe drawn in the most sacred of causes.” They were summoned, and were\r\nbidden in a few brief sentences, uttered in a low tone, to choose;\r\nand they chose wisely and greatly; they chose liberty, born of the\r\nheavens, breathing of all their odors, and radiant with all their\r\nhues. With hands uplifted to the starry firmament, Fürst, Stauffacher,\r\nand Melchthal, with subdued and slow accent, their comrades repeating\r\nafter them, proclaimed, “We swear in the presence of God, before whom\r\nkings and people are equal, to live or die for our fellow-countrymen;\r\nto undertake and sustain all in common; neither to suffer injustice,\r\nnor to commit injury; to respect the rights and property of the Count\r\nof Hapsburg; to do no violence to the imperial bailiffs, but to put an\r\nend to their tyranny.” One of the men who at that momentous assembly\r\nengaged each other by the pledge of “All for each and each for all,”\r\nwas William Tell, a fisher of the lake and a hunter of chamois, of\r\nBürglen, a half-hour from Altdorf in Uri, and a son-in-law of Walter\r\nFürst. In the mean time, Gessler thought he perceived that the people\r\nwalked abroad with more confidence, and carried in their looks a\r\nhaughtier expression; when satisfied that the spirit of resistance was\r\nripe, with a view to confirm his suspicions, he determined to put down\r\nby force the first symptoms of disaffection, and invented a crime to\r\ntrap the most daring and dangerous. His hat, surmounted by the Austrian\r\ncrown, was placed on the top of a pole, erected in the market-place of\r\nAltdorf, and all who passed by were ordered to uncover their heads, and\r\nbow submissively before this symbol of the imperial sovereignty:\r\n\r\n  “It is the lord governor’s good will and pleasure\r\n  The cap shall have like honor as himself;\r\n  And all shall reverence it with bended knee\r\n  And heads uncovered....\r\n  His life and goods are forfeit to the crown\r\n  That shall refuse obedience to the order.”\r\n\r\nGuards were posted round the pole, and ordered to arrest all who\r\nrefused thus to pay homage. It happened that William Tell was passing,\r\nand failed to pay the required homage. He was instantly seized and\r\ntaken before the bailiff. The bailiff first tried to extract from\r\nTell whether his conduct had been premeditated, and if so, who were\r\nhis friends and abettors; but he remained stubbornly silent. Gessler,\r\nincensed at his contumacy, determined to punish him, and, the offence\r\nbeing one unknown to the land and of his own invention, he was likewise\r\ncompelled to invent a punishment. Tell had only one child, a boy, who\r\nwas with him at the time, and, as all peasants were accustomed to the\r\ncross-bow, Gessler condemned him to shoot from off his son’s head an\r\napple, saying, “Know, audacious bowman, that thy own art shall serve to\r\npunish thee.” The lad was blindfolded, the apple placed on his head,\r\nand Tell led away to his position:\r\n\r\n  “And let him take his distance,\r\n    Just eighty paces, as the custom is,\r\n  Not an inch more or less.”\r\n\r\nTo one side stood the cruel Gessler to watch the dreadful archery. Tell\r\nlooked well to his aim, and let the arrow fly:\r\n\r\n  “See Roman fire in Hampden’s bosom swell,\r\n  And fate and freedom in the shaft of Tell.”\r\n\r\nThe twang of the bow was heard, and the eager crowd for the moment held\r\ntheir breath; then a joyful shout proclaimed that the child was safe,\r\nand the apple was pinned by the unerring arrow. Gessler observing that\r\nTell had a second arrow, inquired why it was. “It was the custom of the\r\narchers,” he answered. Being further pressed, with the promise that\r\nhe might speak freely without fear of losing his life, and excited by\r\nthose generous emotions of resentment which a brave and simple race\r\nhave seldom the discretion to repress, he replied, “That was reserved\r\nfor you, had the first arrow hit my son.”\r\n\r\n  “If that my hand had struck my darling child,\r\n    This second arrow I had aimed at you,\r\n  And be assured, I should not then have missed.”\r\n\r\nThe tyrant, exasperated by the candid reply of Tell, said to him, “I\r\nhave promised thee life, but thou shalt spend it in a dungeon.” He\r\nwas pinioned by the guards, and thrown into Gessler’s boat, and they\r\nstarted for the castle of Küssnacht at the other end of the lake. Soon\r\na dangerous surge came on, such as at certain seasons occurs suddenly,\r\nproduced by contrary winds. The boat was in imminent peril from this\r\ntempest. Tell being a skilful boatman, and familiar with the sunken\r\nrocks and dangerous reefs of the long narrow lake, was unbound, placed\r\nat the helm, and ordered to land the boat. He at once steered straight\r\nto a flat piece of rock beneath the sharp sides of the Achsenberg. No\r\nsooner had the boat touched than Tell seized his bow, sprang on to\r\nthe narrow ledge, and, at the same time, with his foot pushed back\r\nthe frail craft into the angry waters. Quickly finding his way up the\r\nrock, and knowing where his enemy must land, he hastened there, and\r\nas Gessler approached, shot him through the heart. “A wife, Lucretia,\r\nliberated Rome; a father, William Tell, disenthralled Helvetia.”\r\n\r\nNo one can go to that rock-framed, mountain-embosomed, “that\r\nsacred lake withdrawn among the hills,” and so well known as the\r\nVierwaldstättersee, or Lake of the Four Forest Cantons, and specially\r\nthat part famed as the theatre of Tell’s exploits, and called the\r\nUrnersee (or Uri Lake), and examine the historic spot and see the\r\nnumerous evidences, many of them contemporaneous, without being\r\nconvinced that William Tell was as much an historical personage as\r\nJulius Cæsar, Napoleon Bonaparte, or George Washington; and that he\r\nlived, acted, and died, as the legend relates. One visiting these\r\nvarious places, must feel the force of what Latrobe wrote: “There\r\nis something in the grandeur and magnificence of the scene which\r\nsurrounds you, which gently but irresistibly opens the heart to a\r\nbelief in the truth of the page upon which the events which have\r\nhallowed them are recorded. Whatever a man may think, however he may\r\nbe inclined to question the strength of the evidence upon which the\r\nrelations of these facts rest while in his closet, I should think there\r\nare but few sufficiently insensible and dogmatical to stand firm and\r\nbar their hearts against the credibility which steals over them while\r\ncontemplating the spots themselves.”\r\n\r\nAt a bend of the lake, a short distance from Brunnen, there rises from\r\nthe water a slender rock pillar, some eighty feet in height. This is\r\nthe _Mythenstein_, a noble monument, fashioned in the morning of the\r\nworld by Nature herself, for the bard who was to hymn the rise of\r\nHelvetian freedom and the praise of its hero. The rock bears in golden\r\nletters the simple inscription:\r\n\r\n  “Dem Sänger Tell’s\r\n  Friedrich Schiller\r\n  Die Urkantone\r\n  1859.”\r\n\r\n    (“To the bard of Tell, Friedrich Schiller, the original\r\n    Cantons, 1859.”)[103]\r\n\r\nA little farther on, opposite Brunnen, at the foot of the rocky\r\nramparts of Seelisberg, lies a long meadow, Rütli-platte, where, the\r\npeasant tradition says, the spirits of the Patriot Three sleep in the\r\nrocky caverns, ready to awaken in their country’s hour of danger:\r\n\r\n  “When the battle-horn is blown\r\n    Till Schreckhorn’s peaks reply,\r\n  When the Jungfrau’s cliffs send back the tone,\r\n    Through their eagles’ lonely sky;\r\n  When Uri’s beechen woods wave red\r\n    In the burning hamlet’s light,\r\n  Then from the cavern of the dead\r\n    Shall the sleepers wake in might!\r\n  They shall wake beside their forest sea,\r\n    In the ancient garb they wore,\r\n  When they link’d the hands that made us free\r\n    On the Rütli’s moonlight shore.”\r\n\r\nWe now reach on the eastern bank, projecting into the lake, the\r\nplatform of rock, Tellsplatte, with its little chapel marking the\r\nspot where Tell leaped ashore and escaped from Gessler’s boat. After\r\nthe expulsion of the bailiffs and the demolition of their castles, it\r\nbecame customary among the Swiss to make pilgrimages to this place;\r\nand in 1388, only a little more than thirty years after the death\r\nof Tell, the Canton of Uri erected this chapel in the presence of a\r\nhundred and fourteen persons who had been acquainted with Tell. Müller\r\nthe historian suggests as a reason why there were only a hundred and\r\nfourteen persons who had known Tell to gather together, not much more\r\nthan thirty years after his death at the erection of the chapel, was,\r\nthat Tell did not often leave Bürglen, and the deed, according to the\r\nethics of that period, was not likely to attract inquisitive wonderers\r\nto him. It was Tell’s deed alone; the people had no part in Gessler’s\r\ndeath, the hour which they had agreed upon for their deliverance had\r\nnot come. All the old chronicles agree as to the erection of the\r\nchapel and the persons present. The chapel was restored in 1883,\r\nthe old frescoes being carefully removed, and now preserved in the\r\nCouncil House of Altdorf. The restored chapel has four large frescoes\r\nof artistic merit. On the back wall above the altar, to the left is\r\nthe “Leap from the boat;” to the right the “Death of the tyrant;” on\r\nthe north wall the “Apple scene;” on the southern wall the “Oath of\r\nRütli;” this last fresco is very frequent in Switzerland, representing\r\nthe Patriot Three (_Les Trois Suisses_, or _Die Drei Schweizer_); one\r\nholding a short-handled flag with a cross upon it; the central one\r\nleaning on a spear; and a third sustaining a tall standard which rests\r\non the ground; all wearing their swords. On Sunday following Easter,\r\nannually, a procession of boats, appropriately decorated, proceeds\r\nslowly to this chapel, consecrated by art, religion, and patriotism to\r\nthe great deeds or yet greater thoughts of its olden time hero, and a\r\nsolemn memorial service is held. Near by at Küssnacht there is another\r\nchapel marking the place where Gessler was shot, and over the door is\r\nan illustrated painting with the date 18th of November, 1307, and under\r\nit the inscription,--\r\n\r\n  “Here the proud tyrant Gessler fell,\r\n  And liberty was won by Tell;\r\n  How long ’twill last, you ask, and tremble:\r\n  Long as the Swiss their sires resemble.”\r\n\r\nAt the upper end of the lake, retired a short distance, is Altdorf, the\r\ncapital of Uri. Here in the public square are two fountains. The pillar\r\nin the centre of one of them is surmounted by a figure of Tell holding\r\nhis boy under one arm and pressing his bow to his bosom with the other;\r\nit marks the spot where Tell stood when he launched the fearful arrow.\r\nThe other fountain is placed on the supposed site of the lime-tree by\r\nwhich the boy stood awaiting his father’s unerring aim. A figure of\r\nGessler indicates where the pole bearing the hat and crown was erected;\r\nclose to the second fountain is an ancient square tower, on the outside\r\nof which are painted the scenes of Tell’s history. Near by Altdorf runs\r\nthe small stream of Schächen, where Tell met his death in 1354: seeing\r\na child fall into the swollen stream as he passed that way, he plunged\r\nin to rescue it, and, being old and feeble, lost his life. The museum\r\nat Zurich contains the cross-bow of Tell; the little hamlet of Bürglen,\r\nhis birthplace, has many reminiscences to show; old houses in Altdorf,\r\nArth, and Schaffhausen are frescoed with representations of facts in\r\nhis history. In Schaffhausen is a fountain having an old stone figure\r\nof Tell with the bow and arrow, on the base of which is the date 1682.\r\n\r\nBut we are told that history records six other apple-shooting feats,\r\nperformed by different individuals before and after the time of Tell.\r\nIt is difficult to see how this decides whether Tell was a real\r\ncharacter or not. Such skill in marksmanship was not rare in the days\r\nof archery. A similar, indeed identical, feat is mentioned of the\r\nScandinavian hero Egill, who was commanded by King Nidhung to shoot\r\nan apple from the head of his son. Egill, like Tell, took two arrows,\r\nand, on being asked why, replied, as Tell did to Gessler, “To shoot\r\nthee, tyrant, if I failed in my task.” Similar stories are recorded of\r\nEindridi, of Norway; of Hemingr, challenged to the display of skill by\r\nKing Harald, son of Sigurd, in 1066; of Toki, or Palnatoke, the Danish\r\nhero, in 1514; and of William of Cloudesley, who, to show the king his\r\nskill in shooting, bound his eldest son to a stake, put an apple on his\r\nhead, and at a distance of three hundred feet cleft the apple in two.\r\nThis is described by Percy in his “Reliques:”\r\n\r\n  “I have a son is seven years old,\r\n  He is to me full dear;\r\n  I will hym tye to a stake\r\n  And lay an apple upon his head,\r\n  And go sixscore paces hym fro,\r\n  And I myself with a broad arrow\r\n  Will cleve the apple in two.”\r\n\r\nIn modern times the same skill is seen with the gun instead of with the\r\ncross-bow. Snuffing a candle, cutting a string, barking a squirrel,\r\nbreaking glass balls thrown in the air, are all, perhaps, more\r\ndifficult than for a firm hand and a steady eye to pick off an apple\r\nfrom the head of a boy. The same thing was done in the seventh century\r\nthat is recorded of Tell in the fourteenth century, _ergo_ William Tell\r\nis a myth,--this is the question reduced to a logical form. Any one may\r\nsee that such an inference is absurd. Yet this is the greatest fact\r\nthat has been adduced to prove that Tell’s heroism is a mere figment\r\nof the past. To believe in one tradition and repudiate the other is\r\nnot less arbitrary than unphilosophic. Voltaire, whose function it was\r\nto deny, even sneered at the existence of the men of Rütli simply on\r\naccount of “the difficulty in pronouncing their names.” The story of\r\nTell is told in the chronicle of Klingenberg, that covers the close\r\nof the fourteenth century; then again in 1470, in the “Ballad of\r\nTell,” one of the chief treasures in the archives of Sarnen; in the\r\n“Chronicles of Russ,” 1482; and by Schilling, of Luzern, in 1510, who\r\nhad before him a “Tell-song;” and the chronicle of Eglof, town clerk\r\nof Luzern, in the first half of the fifteenth century. The first to\r\nclothe these traditions in the dress of historical narration of great\r\nsubstantial clearness was the celebrated Swiss chronicler, Ægidius\r\nTschudi, of Glarus, in 1570. All the early Swiss and German historians,\r\nStettler, Huldrich, and Müller, sanction it. Then it furnished Florian\r\nwith the subject of a novel in French, 1788; Lemierre with his tragedy\r\nof _Guillaume Tell_, 1766; Schiller with a tragedy in German, _Wilhelm\r\nTell_, 1804; Knowles with a tragedy in English, _William Tell_, 1840.\r\nIn 1829, Rossini, the most famous composer of the land beyond the\r\nmountains, wove the magic of his music round Schiller’s greatest drama\r\nwith the Italian opera of _Guglielmo Tell_, the delight of the musical\r\nworld.[104] Smollett, in his sublime “Ode to Independence,” thus\r\nalludes to Tell:\r\n\r\n   “Who with the generous rustics sate\r\n    On Uri’s rock, in close divan,\r\n  And wing’d that arrow, sure as fate,\r\n    Which ascertain’d the sacred rights of man.”\r\n\r\nGoethe writes: “I picture Tell as an heroic man, possessed of native\r\nstrength, but contented with himself, and in a state of childish\r\nunconsciousness. He traverses the Canton as a carrier, and is\r\neverywhere known and beloved, everywhere ready with his assistance. He\r\npeacefully follows his calling, providing for his wife and child.” Sir\r\nJames Mackintosh, one of the most impartial of historians, visited the\r\nregion associated with the name and deeds of Tell; he examined history,\r\nand became perfectly convinced of the existence of the mountain hero,\r\nand of the truth of the part he played in Switzerland when\r\n\r\n  “Few were the numbers she could boast,\r\n  But every freeman was a host,\r\n  And felt as though himself were he\r\n  On whose sole arm hung victory.”\r\n\r\nThus a seemingly unimportant event in the remote Alps became the\r\nkey-note of European thought, literature, art, and language; for it\r\ninspired not only statesmen, historians, orators, and poets, but\r\npainters, sculptors, and composers. It influenced and exercised pen,\r\npencil, and chisel, and expanded the vocabulary; for who has not seen,\r\nheard, read _Wilhelm Tell_ in his own or some other language?\r\n\r\nThe legend of Tell has a companion piece doubtless as mythical to the\r\nsceptical, being of the same historic period, and occurring at the\r\nbattle of Sempach. This was one of the great battles which terminated\r\nthe long and obstinate struggle begun at Rütli, and, like all other\r\nfamous achievements, is remembered in connection with a special example\r\nof personal self-sacrifice; still it passes historical scrutiny\r\nunchallenged, though no better authenticated, and in many respects\r\nmore contentious than the heroism of Tell. On the 9th of August, 1386,\r\nDuke Leopold was marching against Zurich to fight the last battle\r\nwhich Austria presumed to try against the Forest Cantons. He had the\r\nflower of the Austrian nobility, 4000 knights and barons, each with his\r\nown vassals, forming an army of veterans in columns 20,000 strong. A\r\nhandful of brave Swiss, numbering 1400 stout and fearless mountaineers,\r\nwent out on foot to meet them; they came up with the enemy at Sempach.\r\nThe mail-clad warriors, dismounting from their steeds, presented a\r\nsolid and impregnable barrier of lances; the Swiss were rudely armed\r\nwith halberds and _morgensterne_.[105] According to their ancient\r\ncustom, they knelt in silent prayer; arising, they placed themselves\r\nin column, presenting an angle, and charged. Again and again they\r\ndashed against these protruding lances that stood as firm as a wall\r\nof stone. Out of their little number sixty had died in vain; hearts\r\nseemed ready to fail; the Austrians were beginning to open in order to\r\nsurround them. At this crisis Arnold Winkelried, “a trusty man amongst\r\nthe confederates,” dropped his weapon, and, rushing forward, cried out,\r\n“I will open a way to freedom; protect my wife and children!”[106]\r\nBeing of great size and strength, he clutched as many of the enemy’s\r\nlances as his arms could embrace, gathered their points and buried them\r\nin his bosom, and as he fell drew his enemies with him. Before the\r\nAustrians could extract them his companions took advantage of the gap,\r\nrushed over his expiring body into the ranks of the enemy; a breach\r\nbeing made in the wall of mailed warriors, what seemed an inevitable\r\ndefeat was turned into glorious victory. “Heed not the corpse,” says\r\nByron’s Saul to his warriors and chiefs, admonishing them as to what\r\nthey are to do should the lance and the sword strike them down in the\r\nfront. Sempach is a story of thrilling heroism, and in little over half\r\na century was followed by the battle of St. Jacob in 1444, when 1600\r\nSwiss met a predatory invasion of the French, a corps of 8000 horse and\r\na large detachment of infantry, in all numbering over 20,000, called\r\nArmagnacs, the disbanded mercenaries of the English war, led by the\r\nDauphin, afterwards Louis XI. Though they might have retreated without\r\nloss, the Swiss determined rather to perish on the spot, and fought\r\nwith heroic fury, tearing the enemy’s arrows from their wounds to send\r\nthem back dripping with blood. Their valor and terrible sacrifice never\r\nwere surpassed. The Dauphin lost 6000 men; and of the 1600 Swiss,\r\nonly ten lived to tell the tale, and they were immediately proscribed\r\nthroughout Switzerland for having deserted their comrades. A monument\r\nis erected near the Birs, on the battle-field, consisting of a figure\r\nof Helvetia at the top with four dying soldiers on the pedestal, with\r\nthe inscription: “Our souls to God, our bodies to the enemy.” At\r\nMorgarten, in 1315, 1300 Swiss routed Leopold’s army of over 20,000,\r\nkilling 9000, when\r\n\r\n  “There were songs and festal fires\r\n    On the soaring Alps that night,\r\n  When children sprung to greet their sires\r\n    From the wild Morgarten fight.”\r\n\r\nThen there is the battle fought near Wessen, in the Canton of Glarus,\r\nwhere 350 Swiss attacked 8000 Austrians and gained the field. Eleven\r\npillars are erected on the field of battle to mark the places where\r\nthe Swiss rallied, for history says they were repulsed ten times,\r\nbut, rallying the eleventh, broke the enemies’ line and put them to\r\nflight with great slaughter. This victory is celebrated every year;\r\nthe people, in procession, fall upon their knees at each pillar, sing\r\na _Kyrie_ and thank God for so signal a victory. When they come to the\r\nlast pillar, one of their orators makes a eulogy of the three hundred\r\nand fifty, and, when he has finished, reads over a list of their\r\nnames,--just as the Spartans caused the names of their three hundred to\r\nbe cut in brass, to transmit their memories to posterity. There are,\r\nin addition, such duels of individual valor recorded as men fighting\r\nwhen mortally wounded, like Fontana, of Grisons, who cried out, “Do not\r\nstop for my fall, it is but one man the less;” or like John Walla, of\r\nGlarus, who met alone and put to flight thirty horsemen. These events,\r\nand many others well authenticated and unhesitatingly accepted in Swiss\r\nhistory, sound infinitely more of knight-errantry than the story of\r\nTell.\r\n\r\nMacaulay holds that intense patriotism and high courage are peculiar\r\nto people congregated in small spaces. Acts of unflinching bravery\r\nand of a noble self-immolation in the cause of conscience, duty,\r\nand freedom have been conspicuous in Swiss history. As habits of\r\ncourage are formed by continual exposure to danger, the hazardous\r\nstate, the perils and hardships which they hourly encountered, braced\r\ntheir nerves to enterprises of hardihood and daring. Turbulent times\r\ncreated a necessity for great sacrifices and daring exploits, and on\r\nthe same principle, that the supply of a commodity in transactions of\r\ncommercial life is generally found to be commensurate with the demand,\r\nthe frequent call for heroic achievements raised up the patriots who\r\nwere to perform them. There may be something in the deeply religious\r\ncharacter of the Swiss favorable to this virtue. Cicero maintained that\r\na belief in the immortality of the soul and a future state of rewards\r\nand punishments was indispensable to the steady sacrifice of private\r\ninterests and passions to the public good. Some, perhaps, in their\r\nbrighter visions of fancy, would aspire to those blessed abodes amidst\r\nthe laurel groves of Paradise, which the poet of Mantua has assigned to\r\nthe self-devoted victims of patriotic enthusiasm:\r\n\r\n  “Hic manus ob patriam pugnando vulnera passi.”[107]\r\n\r\nThe renown, likewise, of the heroes of ancient stories is indebted for\r\nno inconsiderable portion of its brightness to their mode of warfare,\r\nwhich, by rendering personal courage more effective, rendered it at\r\nthe same time the object of higher estimation. Prodigies of valor, by\r\nwhich the fate of a kingdom is decided, are now rarely performed, and\r\nvictory inclines much more to the side of skill than either of physical\r\nstrength or individual prowess.\r\n\r\nWith the Swiss no fable hangs about the deeds of William Tell and\r\nArnold Winkelried or the battles of Morgarten, Sempach, and St. Jacob.\r\nThey are the common glory of the people, their most cherished heritage;\r\nbut it is in William Tell their pride centres. His very name to this\r\nday stirs the Swiss heart with the deepest emotions of pride and\r\npatriotism.\r\n\r\nAll the mementoes connected with his history are cherished with the\r\nfondest affection and veneration. Tell’s chapel is the Mecca of all\r\nSwitzerland. The admiration for his character is an unbounded national\r\npassion. Every emotion of patriotism, national gratitude, and ardent\r\nlove of liberty seems to find its readiest mode of utterance in\r\npassionate expressions regarding this heroic man. Ballads are sung to\r\nhis memory, and in every popular gathering one may hear the familiar\r\nwords from the old Swiss song,--\r\n\r\n    “William Tell, he scorned the hat,\r\n    To death condemned was he for that,\r\n  Unless an apple, on the spot,\r\n    From his own child’s head he shot.”\r\n\r\nIn canvas and marble his effigy adorns the national and cantonal\r\ncapitals and the public buildings generally. On mountain, rock, and\r\nlake his history is carved indelibly.[108] “It cannot be otherwise,”\r\nsays the honest peasant; “it did so happen, and I believe it; not to\r\nbelieve it would be treason to my country.” In 1760, a pamphlet, under\r\nthe title of “Fable Danoise,” was issued by a clergyman of Bern named\r\nFreudenberger attacking the historical character of this legend. It so\r\naroused the patriotic indignation of the people that no one dared to\r\ngive it circulation, and the government of the Canton of Uri caused the\r\nbook to be publicly burned.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of so many memorials of the deeds of this hero,\r\nsustained by evidences of an antecedent and general popular conviction,\r\nand feeling that these things are entitled to have some weight, it is\r\ndifficult to feel any sympathy with the doubts which bookish students\r\nhave suggested as to the reality of Tell’s existence. No one can visit\r\nthe lake, the rock, the fountains, the chapel, read the story painted\r\non wall and tower, hear the local traditions in every man’s mouth,\r\nwitness the annual festivals, study the history of Switzerland, and\r\nconsider the character of its people, then think of Tell as a myth,\r\nmore than he would say that Switzerland and all its heroic people\r\nhave been a fable since Uri’s handful of patriots rid it of Gessler’s\r\ndespotism. No! The simple story bears a striking analogy to the\r\nprimitive and pastoral people who commemorate the name and actions of\r\nthis hero. They know that no character of the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies is better attested in their history, and will religiously\r\nregard him as one of the noblest men that ever lived, so long as the\r\nFinsteraarhorn and Jungfrau present themselves in the vast firmament\r\nas the ever-enduring symbols of liberty. “The artlessness of Tell’s\r\nhistory resembles a poem; it is a pastoral song in which a single\r\ndrop of blood is mingled with the dew upon a leaf or a tuft of grass.\r\nProvidence seems thus to delight in providing for every free community,\r\nas the founder of their independence, a fabulous or actual hero,\r\nconformable to the local situation, manners, and character of each\r\nparticular race. To a rustic, pastoral people like the Swiss is given\r\nfor their liberator a noble peasant; to a proud, aspiring race, such as\r\nthe Americans, an honest soldier. Two distinct symbols, standing erect\r\nby the cradles of the two modern liberties of the world, to personify\r\ntheir opposite natures; on the one hand, Tell with his arrow and the\r\napple; on the other, Washington with his sword and the law.”[109]\r\n\r\nThe doubt thrown upon the existence of Tell came from an influence\r\nthat bears upon things of a graver import. They originated at the\r\ntime when religion was dead, and when rationalism, with an appearance\r\nof erudition, was rife. Many critics formed theories of their own in\r\nregard to Homer and the ancient writers and heroes in general. Book\r\nafter book was issued from the press filled with the most absurd\r\ntheories. Every student who came from a university had the ambition\r\nto write a book. Each one thought himself a veritable Daniel come to\r\njudgment; nearly every historical character was a being of imagination.\r\nThey did not stop with human characters, they laid hold upon the Word\r\nof God. Moses became a myth in their hands; and Job was a mere story\r\nin poetry, like the Arabian Nights; Ecclesiastes was the blating of\r\nan Epicurean philosopher no longer young. Good, however, came out of\r\nthis evil. The best men were led to examine the basis on which the\r\ntruth stands, and to study more profoundly than ever the “faith once\r\ndelivered to the saints,” and the result was the overthrow of this\r\nschool of specious reasoning and crude theories. The details of Tell’s\r\nstory, at last, do not signify much; they form only the drapery of\r\nthe figure, which stands to this day one of the few heroes who have\r\nbeen able so to forget themselves, and so to inspire other men with\r\nself-forgetfulness, as to obtain with them a nation’s freedom. And thus\r\nTell lives, safely, in the people’s songs and in the faithful hearts of\r\nhis countrymen.\r\n\r\nIdeals, the symbols of the truth which we conceive, of the beauty\r\nwhich we imagine, and of the good which we long for, have as great an\r\ninfluence in the world as _ideas_, if not even greater. High ideals\r\nand loyalty to them are virtues which are requisite to the existence\r\nand safety of a progressive society. We cannot afford to surrender the\r\nleast of our high and pure ideals to the iconoclasm that would declare\r\nevery grand historical character to be apocryphal; a spirit that revels\r\nin the breaking of images simply for the pleasure of breaking, even if\r\nchiselled by the hand of Praxiteles; a folly not content with robbing\r\nus of Tell and his apple, but would deprive us of Newton’s apple, too,\r\nand vainly talks of a cryptogram lurking in Shakespeare’s dramas,\r\nwhich points to his mythical existence. We have too few immortal names\r\nidentified with their country’s glory. Let us not seek to inquire too\r\nminutely into their title to fame, to see if it is embarrassed by vague\r\nand contradictory traditions; but let us rather associate their names\r\nwith the greatness, the virtue, the durability of their race, and\r\ninvoke blessings on them down “to the last syllable of recorded time.”\r\n\r\nIn this day, so given to materialism, pitiful rivalries, and ignoble\r\nambitions, we want more hero-worship, a greater reverence of heroism, a\r\nmore just and delicate appreciation of individual worth, the traditions\r\nof noble deeds, and the “passion of philanthropy;” and not to believe\r\nthat all men are much of a sameness, and the old days in which the\r\ngods lived on earth are forever gone. There are certain great events\r\nembalmed in tradition that it will not do to question, and which, if of\r\ndoubtful historical support, it is unwise to disturb, as they are so\r\nmany incentives to noble deeds, and should be cherished in our hearts\r\neven as an inspiring fiction. It is easy for cynics to deride heroism,\r\nand scoff at the superiority of ideal existence over the facts of life.\r\nBut it is not good to be confined to what the physical eye can see, and\r\nrefuse to use the eye of faith and imagination. Enthusiasm lives and\r\nflourishes with imagination and idealism; and together they purify,\r\nas well as ennoble, every nature they touch. They paint the world and\r\nmen as they should be; all that human heart can do; all of which human\r\nnature, at its highest, is capable. The craving for the real is good\r\nand healthy, but it ought by no means to be set in opposition to the\r\ncraving for the ideal, for\r\n\r\n  “A deeper import lurks in the legends told our infant years\r\n  Than lies upon the truth we live to learn.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nBERN.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the end of the thirteenth century Bern was the great,\r\ninfluential, and growing town of Switzerland; rich, enterprising, and\r\nself-asserting. For the sake of securing their friendship, it made\r\ncitizens of many of the nobility who lived far from the city walls, and\r\nestablished guilds with many valuable privileges. Some of these guilds\r\nstill exist, and a membership is quite an expensive privilege, costing\r\nfrom 8000 to 10,000 francs; besides the applicant must possess property\r\nto the value of 15,000 francs. In early times Bern held a firm grasp\r\non the lands from Aargau to Lake Leman. Besides conquering them, it\r\nlargely bought out the neighboring territorial nobility. It was the\r\nfeudal idea, taking root and growing in mediæval times, that the right\r\nof government was as property, and the possession of landed property\r\nwas looked on as carrying with it a kind of right of government. The\r\nwhole early history of Bern is the greatest example in modern times\r\nof an inland city ruling over a great collection of subject towns and\r\ndistricts. It was an aristocratic republic, having been founded as\r\na refuge for the inferior nobility from the oppression of powerful\r\ncounts. The rapid development of industry within its substantial\r\nwalls attracted also peasants, artificers, and tradesmen, who flocked\r\nin from the neighborhood. The burghers secured many privileges, and\r\nwere eligible to the highest offices; but they generally concurred\r\nin the election of members of the patrician family. These young\r\npatricians were literally apprenticed to political life by the singular\r\ninstitution of the _Ausserstand_, a copy of the real commonwealth, with\r\ncouncils and magistrates of its own, and the _Schultheiss_, or chief\r\nmagistrate of the mimic republic, was commonly elected a member of the\r\nGreat Council of the real one.\r\n\r\nThe French Revolution submerged the aristocracy in a general Helvetian\r\nrepublic, and, when the flood had passed, the ancient landmark could\r\nonly be partially restored. The Bernese, however, continued to\r\nacknowledge the ascendency of these noble families, what few were left\r\nto them, whose ancestors had been the founders of the city, and whose\r\ncourage, virtues, and patriotism had secured the confidence of the\r\npeople. It was not until 1847, under the influence of the Sonderbund\r\nexcitement, that the last vestige of class privilege was abolished, and\r\nperfect equality of all citizens before the law established; political\r\nrights granted to every male citizen over twenty years of age,\r\ncivil administration and justice organized after modern democratic\r\nprinciples, guaranteeing the rights of man, and promising trial by jury.\r\n\r\nTradition has it that Bern was founded by Berchtold V., Duke of\r\nZähringen, in 1191. Being persistently opposed both by the Alpine\r\nand the Burgundian nobles, who took up arms against him, he met and\r\ndefeated them twice in the field, and then began to look about for a\r\nsuitable site, at an equal distance from both parties, where he might\r\nbuild a town larger and more important than any that yet existed.\r\nDifferent derivations are given for the name of Bern; some etymologists\r\nsay it is a corruption of the Celtic name of Verona; but the only one\r\nthat satisfies the Bernese is that given by the old recorder Justinger,\r\nwho wrote at the end of the fourteenth century, “How the town was\r\ncalled Bern:” There were many wild animals in the oak woods, and Duke\r\nBerchtold determined that the town should be called after the first\r\nthat was caught there; so the first that was caught was a bear, and the\r\ntown received its name from _Bären_, the Swabian for bears; and the\r\nDuke also gave the burghers a shield and armorial bearings, namely, a\r\nblack bear on a white field. A bronze statue of the Duke is erected in\r\nthe cathedral promenade, upon which is the inscription, _E bellua cæsa\r\nsit urbi futuræ nomen_ (“from a monster slain, let there be a name to\r\nthe future city”). The Emperor Frederick II. declared Bern a free city\r\nof the empire in 1218, and confirmed its privileges by a charter, which\r\nis still preserved in the archives. Its first prominence was in 1339,\r\nwhen in June of that year the Bernese, under Ulric von Erlach, were\r\ncompletely victorious over the allied forces, and struck the death-blow\r\nto the feudal nobility of western Helvetia. In 1405 the greater part\r\nof the city was destroyed by fire, but was soon rebuilt on the same\r\nsite. In 1798 it was plundered by the French. Immediately after their\r\nentrance into the city, the French soldiers made themselves masters\r\nof its treasure, which, no doubt, was one of the motives and most\r\nimmediate cause of the invasion and attack. The exact amount taken was\r\nnever ascertained, but by the most moderate estimate made it reached\r\n20,000,000 francs; everything of value that could be taken away became\r\nthe prey of the victors.\r\n\r\nFrom the date of its accession to the Confederation, in 1351, Bern\r\nhas been one of the most conspicuous and influential of Swiss towns.\r\nThe history of the city is the history of the Canton, and in some\r\nmeasure it is the history of the Confederation. From 1798 to 1815 the\r\nFederal Diet met in turns at Zurich, Bern, Luzern, Freiburg, Solothurn,\r\nand Basel. From 1815 to 1848 the three cities of Zurich, Bern, and\r\nLuzern were the seats of the government, the Diet sitting biennially\r\nin each place in turn. This system of having three capitals did not\r\nwork satisfactorily, and the necessity for the country possessing one\r\ncentre was generally seen. Zurich and Luzern surrendered their claims,\r\nand Bern became the central and fixed capital of the Confederation in\r\n1848, the Canton assuming the cost of erecting the necessary public\r\nbuildings. It is also the capital of the largest and most populous\r\nCanton, which has a population of 539,305, out of a total for the\r\nConfederation of 2,933,612, or nearly one-fifth. It is the most\r\nimportant of the sisterhood by its territory, wealth, and population,\r\nand may be called the Empire Canton of the Confederation. The city\r\nitself contains a population of about 50,000, with a superficial\r\nsurface of an American village of 2500 people. No great city in\r\nSwitzerland overtops the rest and draws them into moving around it\r\nby its mass and weight. Population and wealth are not concentrated\r\nin “enormous and apoplectic heads upon a bloodless body,” as great\r\ncities were designated by Mirabeau. The largest Swiss towns would be\r\nfifth-rate towns in the United States. The Swiss villages are on the\r\ndeclivities of the Alps; the towns either on advanced promontories\r\nor on the borders of the lakes. They are all small, and contain\r\nnone of the monuments which mark the luxury of great nations. They\r\nare municipalities rather than capitals, to whom the nature of the\r\ncountry and the smallness of the population have denied the power of\r\nincrease. Many of these towns are located with a view to the natural\r\ndefence, furnished by the topography of the site, and were originally\r\nwalled places of refuge. They resemble those towns of prehistoric Italy\r\ndescribed by Virgil, as “perched on precipices of rocks, with rivers\r\ngliding beneath their antique walls.” Bern occupies a bold promontory\r\nof sandstone rock, seventeen hundred and ten feet above the sea, and\r\nits position in early times entailed great strategical advantages.\r\nIt is nearly surrounded by the Aar, a bold, strong tributary of the\r\nRhine, which rises in the southeast mountains of Bern, and carries to\r\nits mouth the waters of fourteen Cantons. A sudden bend of the stream\r\nencloses the town on all sides but one. The magnificent slopes to this\r\nrapid river are in some places covered with turf, and supported in\r\nothers by lofty terraces planted with trees.[110] It is not an easy\r\nmatter to account for the first impression you receive on entering\r\nBern; you certainly feel that you have got to an ancient and remarkable\r\nplace. Passing under any of its old gate-ways for the first time, one\r\nfeels as if he had strayed upon a stage conscientiously prepared for\r\nthe playing of a mediæval comedy or tragedy. No town in Switzerland has\r\nbeen so preserved from the hands of the spoiler and the restorer; the\r\nwhole town is a sort of informal museum of archæology. A small portion\r\nthat has grown up around the Federal Palace, which was erected on the\r\noutskirts of the old town, when it was made the permanent capital in\r\n1848, is modern in appearance. That which constitutes the town proper\r\nis composed of ancient houses of an early age, with curiously frescoed\r\nand carved fronts, and many remnants of ancient architecture. The main\r\nstreets are broad and regular, the houses constructed of sandstone of\r\na grayish-blue color, found in the adjoining hills; in other streets,\r\nthe tall, thin houses are clustered together as if to use as little as\r\npossible of the margin which nature and industry have drawn so closely\r\naround them. These houses are six, seven, and eight stories high. Every\r\nfloor, with the exception of the first, which in all probability is\r\nused for business purposes, accommodates a family, and, among the poor\r\nclasses, several families. It would be difficult to find a town where\r\nevery part of the house is so fully put to use and little waste or idle\r\nroom. It is doubtful if a dozen families in Bern each occupy an entire\r\nhouse, and a very small number more than a flat of one floor. All the\r\nhouses, including the most ancient, are admirably constructed for this\r\nmultiform occupancy, and Swiss domestic life, as practised in Bern, is\r\na fine art of many centuries’ growth. The walls being very thick, the\r\nfront windows are made to serve the purpose of verandas. They have neat\r\niron railings encircling them, swung on hinges, and when thrown outward\r\nare both a protection and a rest for inclining against. In all pleasant\r\nweather these are the favorite places to sit. Furnished with bright\r\nred or orange cushions, and probably those on no two floors being\r\nuniform in figure, they present from the street a novel and variegated\r\nspectacle; touching up the projecting balconies, highly worked and of\r\na glossy black, and complementing the green Venetian shutters. These\r\nhouses preserve a mediæval physiognomy; the pomp and strength of feudal\r\nSwitzerland are called up before our mind when we look at the solid\r\nwalls, at the buttresses which support them, and their steep peaked\r\nroofs.\r\n\r\nThe streets are kept scrupulously clean, as much so as the floor of a\r\nwell-kept house; a gang is constantly at work sweeping and carrying\r\noff the dirt as soon as any can be found. Entering the town from the\r\nsouth, two gate-ways are passed, at short distances from each other,\r\nbeneath towers which mark epochs in the extension of its walled period.\r\nIn the upper portion of these gate-ways, still standing over the empty\r\narches, where there is no longer a gate to shut, peaceful pigeons have\r\na cote. They are the only wardens and watchful sentinels to challenge\r\nthe passer-by. The fronts of the houses rest upon arcades, which form\r\ncovered walks and are lined with shops. The heavy piers of the arcades\r\nexclude the sun, making the shops dark, and the arcade as damp as it is\r\ngloomy. All these objections are felt to be more than compensated by\r\nthe protection furnished from the long winter’s snow. The streets are\r\nprovided with numerous public fountains of strange devices. They are\r\nsculptured and decorated, as if the people loved the water and wished\r\nto heighten the pleasure of seeing, welcoming, and using it. This water\r\nis brought a great distance from mountain streams, and ceaselessly\r\npours its limpid stream through the open viaducts, and at convenient\r\nplaces is diverted into gigantic stone basins; it is never muddy, and\r\nis always delightfully cool. Through each of the principal streets flow\r\nadditional subterraneous streams of this water, furnishing the best of\r\nsewers. This is one of the most pleasing sights common to the smallest\r\nSwiss village,--the abundance of good water with which it is supplied;\r\nit is ever in sight; overflowing, sparkling everywhere, for every use\r\nof man and beast. These fountains resemble those of an Eastern well;\r\nto them daily come all the women of the village for the water they\r\nwill require for their families; and they have other uses, the milk\r\nvessels and the cooking utensils are for the most part washed there,\r\nand on certain days they are surrounded by groups of _blanchisseuses_.\r\nHere, too, the daily news of the village is discussed. Besides their\r\nbeauty and convenience, these fountains are a species of living\r\nrecords of the taste and manners of past ages. Many date from the\r\nsixteenth century, and are ornamented with colossal representations of\r\nSwiss warriors, clad in steel, with wasp-shapes and stuffed breasts,\r\nwearing diminutive caps, contrasting with their vast exuberance of\r\nbeard and stern countenances; then come goddesses, archers, bagpipers,\r\nand one--the terror of children--the _kinder-fresser-brunnen_, or\r\n“child-gormandizer-fountain.” Upon the top of a stone pillar, ten feet\r\nhigh, is seated an obese-looking old man; he has the head and shoulders\r\nof one poor baby in his gaping mouth, in the very act of swallowing;\r\na bag full of similar choice morceaus hangs around his neck, and they\r\nare apparently struggling to escape the fate of their comrade. In one\r\nhand of this ogre are the lower extremities of the child whose head he\r\nis masticating, and in the other a basket full of urchins to finish his\r\nrepast; two or three of these have gotten out of the basket, and are\r\nscampering off around the pedestal. There is a very beautiful fountain\r\nin front of the Federal Palace, adorned with a statue of Berna. But\r\nit is the effigy of the bear that perpetually recurs to the eye in\r\nvarious forms and armor; it is the ensign of Bern, its heraldic animal,\r\nand cherished with religious care as the palladium of the state. On\r\na fountain in the street of Justice, the Canton is represented in a\r\nmilitant attitude, by the figure of a bear in armor, with sword, belt,\r\nand banner; another fountain has a bear attending a cross-bowman as his\r\nsquire; and the equestrian statue of Rudolph von Erlach is supported\r\nat the corners by four life-sized bronze bears as helmet-bearers. From\r\nthe day of the legend connecting Bruin with the city’s foundation\r\nthe bears have played a prominent part in local heraldry, that sage\r\nand grave beast being cunningly reproduced in print, coin, stone,\r\nwood, and confectionery of great artistic and amusing caricatures.\r\nThe effigy appears upon the cantonal coat-of-arms, and is inseparably\r\nconnected with the conquests of the warlike burghers. As a memorial\r\nof the seven hundredth anniversary, in 1891, of the foundation of the\r\ncity, the municipal council intend opening a competition for designs\r\nof the statue of a bear more modern than that which has already\r\nexisted for seven centuries. Every visitor to Bern is certain to see\r\nthe _Bärengraben_, the bears’ den, containing the live animals. It is\r\ntold that a whimsical old lady left a handsome estate to the town to\r\nmaintain a family of bears. In 1798 they became associated with the\r\nspoliation of Bern, as they had been with its rise and prosperity.\r\nThey were transported to Paris by Napoleon’s troops, the huge cage\r\ncontaining the father of the family having upon it an inscription not\r\nyet forgotten by the Bernese, “_Avoyer de Berne_.” For some time these\r\nbears, like the eagles of Geneva, held their court in the _Jardin des\r\nPlantes_, where the Gallic cock flapped his new-fledged wings and\r\ncrowed over all the beasts in Europe--whether rampant or couchant--upon\r\nthe field of honor. Only one lived to return to his home at the general\r\nrestoration of the spoils; but this one was the aristocrat _Martin_,\r\nwhose descent was traced directly from the pair given to the town by\r\nRéné of Lorraine, the ally of Bern in the war against Charles the Bold.\r\nOthers were subsequently presented by friends of the town in Russia,\r\nand the family circle now numbers half a dozen. During the summer\r\nthey enjoy a great feast from the constant stream of tourists, who\r\npersuade them to perform many antics by throwing them bread, fruits,\r\nand vegetables, of which they are fond; they literally lay themselves\r\nout for your amusement, catching these things lazily as they roll about\r\non their backs. In the centre of the dens a pine stem is erected, and\r\nrenewed annually; on this the bears take air and exercise, and practise\r\na variety of gymnastics, to the great amusement of the spectators.\r\n\r\nProbably next in interest to the bear-pit comes the _Zeitglockenthurm_,\r\nor clock-tower. A minute or two before the hour strikes, a wooden\r\nchanticleer, as large as life, seated on a projection of the tower,\r\nflaps his wings and crows a warning twice, and at the corresponding\r\ntime after the striking of the hour he repeats his salutations. A\r\nfigure, representing Father Time sitting on a throne, marks the hour\r\nby reversing his hour-glass, a mail-clad figure strikes the hour on\r\nthe bell at the top of the tower, then a circle of bears emerge and\r\nmove round Father Time, who at every stroke of the bell slowly opens\r\nhis mouth and inclines his sceptre as if he himself were rather bored\r\nwith Time. Of other objects of interest there may be mentioned the\r\nmilitary depot, erected at a cost of 5,000,000 francs, and used as\r\na drilling-school for that military district; the Federal Palace, a\r\nhandsome stone structure of the Florentine style, and though only in\r\nuse since 1852, will soon be relegated to subordinate federal offices\r\nand a more modern and capacious building, now under construction, will\r\ntake its place as the federal capitol; a public library, founded at\r\nthe time of the Reformation, and containing more than fifty thousand\r\nvolumes; a museum where is to be seen the stuffed skin of the famous\r\nSt. Bernard dog Barry, who rescued and saved the lives of more than\r\ntwenty persons overcome in snow-storms and drifts; botanical garden;\r\nmint; University, with its faculties of law, medicine, theology,\r\nscience, languages, etc.; art gallery, and numerous scientific\r\ncollections, and societies; arsenal with its mediæval treasures,\r\nand a most complete system of charitable institutions, including\r\nfoundling, orphan, blind, mute, and lunatic asylums. The Münster, or\r\nCathedral, is an immense Gothic structure, dating from 1421, with a\r\nmost elaborate sculptured group on the principal portal, representing\r\nthe last judgment and the wise and foolish virgins; it is otherwise\r\nadorned with endless carvings in stone and flanked with two lofty\r\nsquare towers, which still remain in an unfinished condition; few\r\nsacred edifices on the continent are better calculated to make a\r\nstrong impression. In front of the Cathedral stands the fine bronze\r\nequestrian statue of Rudolph von Erlach, the brave defender of Bern at\r\nLaupin; it is a name celebrated in the Confederation for five hundred\r\nyears. An ancestor led his countrymen in the fourteenth century, and\r\nRudolph led the forces of the Canton against the French invasion at the\r\nclose of the eighteenth century; descendants of the name still live\r\nin Bern and enjoy the highest respect and esteem of the people. The\r\nCathedral _platz_, a small well-shaded park, raised and walled at a\r\ngreat expense, a hundred and eight feet above the river, overhangs the\r\nlower town, built on the narrow margin of the rapid Aar. The outer wall\r\nbears an inscription that, in 1654, a young student’s horse, frightened\r\nby some boys, plunged over this precipice with his rider, the horse\r\nbeing killed, but the rider escaped with only a broken arm and leg, and\r\nsurvived the accident thirty years as a preacher.\r\n\r\nOn market day, Tuesday in each week, the streets of Bern are crowded\r\nwith booths and tables exposing for sale every sort of merchandise,\r\ngarden and farm products, and live animals, from a goat to a cow, a dog\r\nto a horse; pigs and lambs are held in the embrace of their owners,\r\nhappy and contented with the nursing-bottle. The _Abattoir_, just out\r\nof the town, on the banks of the river, with its handsome buildings\r\nand beautiful grounds, sooner suggests to the passer-by an attractive\r\npleasure resort than a public slaughter-house.[111] Much of the garden\r\ntruck and all the dairy product are brought into market in small carts,\r\nheavy and stoutly built, pulled by two dogs, one on each side of the\r\nshafts, between which is the woman to uphold and guide it, and for\r\nthis motive power a woman and a dog or a boy and a dog tug together\r\nin friendly yoke-fellowship. Dogs are used throughout Switzerland for\r\nall light draught purposes; and not always very light, for these dogs\r\nhave been bred through generations for this purpose, until they have\r\nalmost the bone and strength of a small horse or ox. They do not seem\r\nto be of any distinct canine family, varying much in size, color, and\r\nappearance,--\r\n\r\n  “Both mongrel, puppy, whelp, and hound,\r\n  And curs of low degree.”\r\n\r\nThey serve the twofold purpose of beasts of burden and vigilant\r\nguardians; the moment the woman stops and puts down the shafts of the\r\ncart the dogs go beneath it and lie down, but their eyes never leave a\r\nstranger who comes near, and he would find it dangerous to attempt to\r\ntouch anything in the absence of their mistress. In the evening, when\r\nreadiness is made to return home, these dogs express their pleasure\r\nwith a deep-mouthed barking, forming a chorus of corresponding variety\r\nto their breeding; as in procession they pass through the streets\r\nthis barking becomes a deafening yelp; in their struggle to pass one\r\nanother, the carts being lightened of their loads, often the women are\r\nunable to check them with their own force and that of the brakes, with\r\nwhich the cart is provided, and a general stampede occurs. The dogs\r\nare highly valued and kindly treated by their owners; passing along\r\nat noon, when the women and the dogs are taking their dinner side by\r\nside from their respective tin buckets, you will find that the dogs are\r\nnot eating of the crumbs which fall from their master’s table, but are\r\nfurnished with rather a more generous repast. The law limits how many\r\npounds these dogs shall pull, but the woman may pull all she can.\r\n\r\nThough Bern is the national and cantonal capital, it has an essentially\r\nsmall-town, provincial system of life. There is no capital in Europe\r\nmore remote from the stir and impulse of the world’s activities.\r\nIsolated by its insignificance rather than by any geographical\r\nposition, free from all extraneous influences, it maintains a mummy\r\ncondition, bound up in the swaddling-clothes of quaint customs and\r\nantiquated ideas. It has been within this generation that a butcher\r\nof the town made the advertisement that “all persons, without respect\r\nof religion, can have fresh meat every day.” To the stranger, life in\r\nBern soon stagnates into a fearsome weariness. There is absolutely\r\nnothing to break the _tædium vitæ_ unless you devote yourself to the\r\ntask of doing it. From the first of December to the middle of April\r\nthere is an annual hibernation. Silence reigns in the streets, and\r\nthe tradesmen will tell you they do not make enough to pay for their\r\nlight. Amusements are few and too poor to lure one from his melancholy,\r\nand, tired with all things else, the weary heart must seek new life\r\nand joy in nature. Yet the very silence and absence of bustle, a\r\ncertain stateliness and reserved demeanor in the inhabitants, showing\r\nit not to be a money-making town, imply that its importance at some\r\ntime must have sprung from more solid and permanent sources than\r\ntrade can afford, and that another spirit animated its inhabitants.\r\nAristocratic pride is still excessive, and the antique simplicity of\r\nits magistrates, the plain and easy manners they uniformly preserve in\r\ntheir intercourse with the people, are not by any means at variance\r\nwith the assertion. For that external simplicity and affability\r\nto inferiors is one of the characteristics of the aristocratic\r\ngovernment; all assumption of superiority being carefully avoided\r\nwhen real authority is not in question. Zurich suggests the idea of a\r\nmunicipal aristocracy; Bern of an ancient one. In the one we think we\r\nsee citizens of a town transformed into nobility, in the other ancient\r\nnobles who have made themselves citizens. By the side of those gigantic\r\nterraces, of those fine fountains, those massive arches and noble\r\nshades you now see none but simple and solid dwellings, yet scarcely\r\nany beggarly ones; not an equipage to be seen, but many a wagon,\r\nwith a fine team of horses or oxen, well appointed in every way. The\r\naristocracy of Bern, in times past, was distinguished by its elegant\r\naccomplishments and the splendid ornaments and furniture of its houses,\r\nheirlooms of the wall and of the cupboard, which were the pride of\r\ngenerations. The value of the furniture of a Bernese patrician, called\r\nZeguti, was ascertained by his last will, A.D. 1367, to be equal to\r\nthe public revenue of the city for one year. The aristocratic Bernese\r\nofficials of those days had under their door-bells written: “_Ici on\r\nsonne et attend._” Bern is in the centre of one of the most beautiful\r\nlandscapes in Europe; the country is broken, but cultivated like a\r\ngarden, and so well wooded as to resemble a vast park. Every town\r\nin Switzerland possesses some feature of originality, and none are\r\ndestitute of lovely and refreshing walks; but there is none richer in\r\numbrageous roads, or where they are kept in better repair, than Bern.\r\nGraceful foot-paths wind among the fields, which are little encumbered\r\nwith fences or hedges, and roads as good as those which are seen in\r\npleasure-grounds. The fine wood of Bremgarten, with its magnificent\r\navenues of trees, extends almost to the very gates of the town, and is\r\nreached by a boulevard lined on each side with limes, which in their\r\nseason perfume the air. A more beautiful or highly-cultivated region\r\nis scarcely to be found than the banks of the Aar in its vicinity. The\r\nenvirons abound in views over hill and dale, over wood and river; and\r\nthe most unobservant cannot fail to remark how superior in brilliancy\r\nof color and elegance of form even the wayside flowers appear; the very\r\nweediest of weeds seem attractive and ornamental. In the rare pure air\r\nof this mountainous section the whole plant population becomes, as it\r\nwere, refined and aristocratic. Then Bern looks from her peninsula on\r\nthe beauties and snows of her Oberland, a continuous chain the most\r\nregular in all Switzerland, and the most imposing and pompous panorama\r\nthat can be found in the whole realm of mountains. In the grand barrier\r\nwhich separates Bern from the Valais there are six celebrated peaks,\r\ncommencing on the east with the Wetterhorn,[112] then the Schreckhorn,\r\nthe Finsteraarhorn, the Eiger, the Mönch, and the Jungfrau, ranging in\r\nheight from twelve thousand to fourteen thousand and twenty-six feet.\r\nThey all pierce the empyrean, but the Finsteraarhorn overtops all the\r\nothers. They look so sharp and wildly precipitous that the bare thought\r\nof standing on any one of them would make you shudder. The horizontal\r\nextent of this range is vast, the grouping magnificent, the scene\r\nunparagoned. They present bold outlines cut sharply against the sky,\r\nsummits veiled with clouds, crests alternately gently rounded or rugged\r\nand broken, noble slopes, steep precipices, outlines of mingled grace\r\nand boldness.[113] In the course of a clear day there is a beautiful\r\nvariety of aspect, bright, pure, rich, harmonious,--from the dark\r\nshadows cast by the rising sun, the brilliancy of mid-day, the violet\r\nhues at sunset, and the ashy and almost ghostly paleness of evening.\r\nImagine frozen snow piled in the heavens and stretching miles across\r\nthe boundary of an otherwise beautiful view, having its sides shaded\r\nby innumerable valleys, with here and there a patch of hoary, naked\r\nrock, and the upper line all tossed into peaks and swelling ridges,\r\nlike the waves of a colossal ocean. The grandest scene of all, and seen\r\nin greater perfection at Bern than any other point in Switzerland, is\r\nthat brief period when the majestic architecture of the Alps, with its\r\ncapitals and bastions, is flushed with the warm light of the lowering\r\nsun; when the _Alpenglühen_[114] (_Abendglühen_) bathes the stern faces\r\nof the ramparts with a flood of light and shade such as only nature\r\ncan produce from the rarest tints of infinite beauty. As the sun sinks\r\nlower the ruddiness of his light seems to augment until the filaments\r\nresemble streamers of flame; when the sun sinks deeper the light is\r\ngradually withdrawn, all is cold and gray again; the stars come out all\r\nat once and leave the mountain like a desolate old man whose\r\n\r\n                          “Hoary hair\r\n  Stream’d like a meteor in the troubled air.”\r\n\r\nThe vapor at times causes a great deal of refraction, and above the\r\nclouds rises the whole of the Oberland to an altitude which seems\r\ngreater than usual; every peak and all the majestic formation are\r\nclearly visible, though the whole range appears to be severed from the\r\nearth and to float in the air; the line of communication is varied,\r\nand while all below is enfeebled by the mist, the snow and ice above\r\nthrow back the fierce light of the sun with powerful splendor. The\r\npeople of Bern, of all conditions and ages, may be seen, day after\r\nday, waiting and watching for the _Alpenglühen_. As the hour of sunset\r\napproaches, the numerous little parks which furnish a view begin to\r\nfill up with the old and young; with the first announcing ray of the\r\n_Alpenglühen_ the children cease to be boisterous, the fingers that ply\r\nthe knitting-needle are still, the laborer at work pursues his vocation\r\nsedately, and all gaze in silent admiration. Bern abounds in these\r\nhumanizing, tranquillizing, and health-giving parks or promenades,\r\nornamented with beds of bright flowers and provided with comfortable\r\nseats. Although the Alps are not necessary to render the views from\r\nthese parks pleasant, yet there they are, to add a background of\r\nsublimity to a foreground of surpassing loveliness. The Aar flows\r\ntowards Bern in a northwest direction, through a valley of some width\r\nand several miles in length: to this fact the Bernese are indebted\r\nfor their fine view of the Oberland Alps, which stretch themselves\r\nexactly across the mouth of the gorge at a distance of forty miles in\r\nan air-line. There is a story of a king, who said he dearly wished he\r\nhad never had any picture or statue in his palace so that he could once\r\nagain have, even for a moment, the crude, sincere delight of a boy\r\nstaring at a wax-work group. The Bernese will never have need to frame\r\nsuch a wish. To them their Oberland will always be new, a picture that\r\ncan never fade, a strain of music which can never sound tuneless or\r\nharsh.\r\n\r\nBut in this sin-cursed world\r\n\r\n  “The sea of fortune doth not ever flow;\r\n    She draws her favors to the lowest ebb;\r\n  Her tides have equal times to come and go;\r\n    Her loom doth weave the fine and coarsest web.”\r\n\r\nThis same _Alpenglühen_ casts its kaleidoscopic rays directly at the\r\nfoot of the Oberland on eyes that are incapable of appreciating the\r\nwealth of beauty that is around and above them. Here are a most sadly\r\nafflicted people; here prevail, to a remarkable degree, _goitre_ and\r\n_cretinism_. We find in Juvenal, “_Quis tumidum guttur miratur in\r\nAlpibus?_” (“Who wonders at goitres in the Alps?”) Congenital cases\r\nare not infrequent, but, in a majority of instances, it makes its\r\nappearance on a child at about the age of twelve or fourteen. The size\r\nthese goitrous growths may attain is extraordinary, hanging down on the\r\nbreast, enormous and unsightly things, recalling the description in\r\n“The Tempest,”--\r\n\r\n  “When we were boys,\r\n  Who would have believed that there were mountaineers\r\n  Dew-lapp’d like bulls, whose throats had hanging at ’em\r\n  Hideous wallets of flesh.”\r\n\r\nIn some portions of this district, the goitre or swelling of the\r\nthyroid gland in front of the neck is so prevalent that\r\n\r\n  “Optimus ille est\r\n  Qui minimus urgetur.”\r\n\r\nIt is not painful, and not always apparently inconvenient, and the\r\nfew who are free from it are laughed at and called “goose-necked.” A\r\nstranger once entering a church in the neighborhood where but few were\r\nabsolutely free from these unseemly appendages, during service the\r\ncongregation betrayed improper curiosity, and the pastor, after a sharp\r\nreproach for their want of manners, reminded them that it was not the\r\nfault of the poor man “if he had no goitre.” By some it is actually\r\nconsidered, in a mild form, to be desirable; for it possesses a\r\npositive money value in furnishing exemption from military service. Now\r\nand then these monstrous excrescences become too large to be borne, and\r\nthe poor victims crawl on the ground because they cannot walk upright\r\nunder the weight. There is a popular as well as scientific belief\r\nthat water is the vehicle of the poison that produces it; that it is\r\nimpregnated with _tufa_ or _tuf_ a calcareous matter, whose tendency\r\nto concrete among the glands of the neck, aided, perhaps, by stagnant\r\nevaporation of narrow villages, produces these wenny protuberances.\r\nThis goitrous condition is often accompanied with an imperfect or\r\narrested state of mental development known as _cretinism_, a distinct\r\nand most distressful form of idiocy. The _cretin_ has an enormous head\r\nthat drops listlessly on the breast; a vacant countenance; goggling\r\neyes; thick tongue hanging out over moist, livid lips; mouth always\r\nopen, full of saliva, and exposing decayed teeth; limbs misshapen;\r\nand wanting at times even the power of articulation. Many are deaf\r\nand dumb,--in fact, physical abortions, with every sign of bodily\r\nand mental imbecility. Few of these poor creatures can do any work,\r\nand many are even incapable of taking care of themselves, and not\r\nsafe to leave alone. These distorted, mindless people, of semi-human\r\nattributes, excite a pitying disgust by their loathsome appearance,\r\nlolling tongue, obscene gestures, degraded appetites, and senseless\r\ngibberish as revolting as their aspects. The word _cretin_ is thought\r\nto be derived from the older _cretins_ of the Alps, whose name was a\r\ncorruption of _Chrétien_ or _Christianus_, and who, being baptized, and\r\nidiots, were supposed to be “washed from original sin” and incapable\r\nof actual sin. Cretinism is regarded by physicians as hereditary, for\r\nit appears in the most pronounced type in successive generations of\r\nthe same family. This unfortunate district borders on the most fertile\r\nand beautiful valley in Switzerland, the Emmenthal, the rich plain in\r\nthe northern part of the Canton of Bern, noted for its cheese and its\r\n_schwingfeste_ (winnowing-festivals). Here the peasants are sturdy and\r\nstrong of aspect, and on Sunday the men may be seen walking among\r\ntheir acres like lords of the soil, in their immaculate shirt sleeves\r\nof a fulness suggestive of episcopal dignity. It was the neat houses,\r\ncomfortable dresses, highly-cultivated and generous soil, giving a\r\ncheerful and prosperous look to the face alike of the people and the\r\ncountry in this section, that caused so high an authority as Burke to\r\nwrite, “That he had beheld throughout Switzerland, and above all in the\r\nCanton of Bern, a people at once the happiest and the best governed on\r\nearth.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nSWITZERLAND THE SEAT OF INTERNATIONAL UNIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not a little surprising--when we consider the great and rapid\r\nadvance that has been made during the last century in diplomacy,\r\njurisprudence, statesmanship, and political economy, and, indeed, in\r\nthe multifarious branches of knowledge,--that international relations,\r\nupon which depend to such an extent the most precious interests of the\r\nnations and of all mankind, should remain so long in a condition very\r\ncrude, indefinite, and incomplete. The “mills of God grind slowly,”\r\nbut the mills of human government seem even more tedious and rusty.\r\nNow that, in the advance of intelligence and civilization, the nations\r\nhave passed from the self-subsistent stage of national life into the\r\ndependent one; now that, through the great discoveries of modern times,\r\nthe nations have been brought together, compacted into one community,\r\nand the interests of all have been blended; now that “the separate\r\nthreads of national prosperity have been entangled in the international\r\nskein,” publicists have found it necessary to enlarge their opinions\r\nand judgments, so as to represent, not the narrowness of local\r\nprejudice, but the breadth and depth of the whole mind of civilized\r\nmankind. This tendency has found practical expression in international\r\ntreaties, with objects neither sectarian nor political; concerning not\r\nindividuals alone, not nations alone, but the whole community of man.\r\nWith aims the most comprehensive, desirableness and practicability\r\nmanifest, they are founded in a philanthropy seeking to promote the\r\nhonor and welfare of every nation, and to bring additional blessings\r\nto every home and every heart in the wide world. International unions,\r\nwith their noble and beneficent objects, constitute the fellowship of\r\nnations, under the dominion of law, in the bonds of peace. Central\r\nbureaus are required for the management of these unions, and it needed\r\nbut little reflection to discover that the Swiss republic presented\r\npeculiar advantages for their location. Its neutrality stood guaranteed\r\nby the powers; it could not come under any suspicion of political\r\nambition or territorial aggrandizement; it was thus mapped out to be a\r\nneutral state, with every reasonable prospect of this _status_ being\r\nsustained. This neutrality, with its strong assurance of immunity from\r\n“all entangling alliances” and the untoward complications of war or\r\nforeign occupation, and the central position in Europe with convenience\r\nof communication with the principal European capitals, were in\r\nthemselves sufficient to recommend Switzerland. Then the Swiss possess\r\nperhaps the most marked genius of any people for the administration of\r\nan office; the government itself is surely the most laborious, the most\r\neconomical, the least pretentious, yet withal systematic, thorough,\r\nand efficient; the same sobriety of demeanor, conscientious discharge\r\nof duty, with painstaking, patient labor at their desks, pervade\r\nthe entire Swiss bureaucracy; these were distinct and all-important\r\nadvantages. And, last, the supposition that affairs which influence\r\nthe conduct and affect the interests of nations might be discussed\r\namid its mountains with a calmness and candor which the contemplation\r\nof nature inspires, contributed no little to the cheerful consensus\r\nas to the propriety of its selection for the seat of the bureaus.\r\nThere are now a sufficient number of these unions, with their central\r\nbureaus or seats established in Bern, to confer upon the Confederation\r\na singularly conspicuous position of distinction and usefulness.\r\nUncontaminated by the ambitions of its neighbors, Switzerland offers to\r\ncontending nations a quiet spot in which to settle their disputes by\r\nthe peaceful means of arbitration. It is not only a place of occasional\r\nconventions, but also the official headquarters of a host of continuous\r\ninternational agreements, commercial treaties and unions, which render\r\npeace and freedom necessary, and therefore secure within its borders.\r\n\r\nThe first step from which resulted the concentration of these bureaus\r\nin Switzerland was taken in 1863. In that year a private committee,\r\ncomposed of different nationalities but animated by one noble impulse,\r\nassembled at Geneva to consider the practicability of making some\r\nbetter provision for the protection of the wounded in battle, the\r\ninadequacy of existing official means to meet the humane requirements\r\nof the sick and wounded soldiers in great wars having long been\r\npainfully apparent. It will always redound to the honor of Switzerland\r\nthat upon its soil the first formal international conference was held\r\nwith a view to the mitigation of some of the horrors of war. On that\r\noccasion the institution of national aid societies was organized, and a\r\nfew Swiss gentlemen were formed into an international committee for the\r\npurpose of constituting, on their neutral territory, an intermediary\r\nfor the aid of similar societies in all countries. This committee\r\nsoon discovered that their movement was everywhere attracting the\r\nattention and winning the warm approbation of all humane people, and\r\ndetermined to place it upon a broader and firmer basis. They requested\r\nthe Swiss Federal Council to propose to such other governments, as\r\nit deemed expedient, that a diplomatic conference should be held\r\nin Switzerland, to discuss and, if possible, give the undertaking\r\ninternational character and support. The Federal Council promptly\r\nacceded to the memorial of the committee, and the invitation, as\r\ndesired, was officially extended in the name of the Swiss government.\r\nMany of the leading powers accepted the invitation, and accredited\r\ndelegates to the conference, which assembled the following year in\r\nGeneva. This conference was brought to a successful conclusion by the\r\nsigning of the memorable “Geneva Convention of August 20, 1864,” by\r\nthe representatives of sixteen governments. Within four months it was\r\nratified and formally acceded to by eight European states, and at the\r\npresent date has been joined by a grand total of thirty-three states.\r\nThis convention embraces a wide field of practical philanthropy, being\r\ndesigned to remove soldiers when sick or wounded from the category\r\nof combatants, affording them relief and protection without regard\r\nto nationality. This protection extends to all persons officially\r\nattached to hospitals or ambulances, and to all houses so long as\r\nthey contain invalid soldiers. Inhabitants of a locality occupied\r\nby a belligerent army, and who are engaged in the care of the sick\r\nand wounded, are likewise included; provision is also to be made for\r\nthe return of invalid soldiers to their respective homes. “While the\r\ngun-carriage bears its death-dealing burden across the battle-field,\r\nin the ruts which rushing artillery wheels have torn up follow quickly\r\nthe ambulance wagons of this Christian brotherhood, bringing hope\r\nand succor to the wounded.” The insignia of hospital and ambulance\r\nis the Swiss flag, with its colors reversed, a red cross on a white\r\nground; and individuals in their employment wear a white armlet\r\nwith a red cross, and every red-cross flag must be accompanied, in\r\ntime of war, by the national flag of those using it. It is no mean\r\ndistinction for the Swiss Confederation that its national emblem is\r\nso intimately and exclusively associated with this great exhibition of\r\ninternational humanity. It is a grand and elevating education, a wise\r\nand philanthropic conception embodying the best principles of social\r\nscience, and that true spirit of charity which counts it a sacred\r\nprivilege to minister to one’s fellow-men in time of suffering. To\r\nsupply material wants, great as this may be, is not all of its mission;\r\nit seeks to carry to men’s hearts the message of universal brotherhood,\r\nwith “peace on earth, good will to men” as its ensign. The United\r\nStates gave their adhesion to this convention in 1882, and in the\r\nconferences had since that date, among the large number of delegates\r\nassembled, composed of royalties, nobilities, military and scientific\r\ncelebrities, no one commanded more respectful attention or contributed\r\nmore to the deliberations than a lone feminine delegate who bore the\r\ncredentials of the United States. The name of Clara Barton is known\r\nthe world over in connection with the burning cross on a snow-white\r\nfield. To her labors are largely due the widening of the scope of the\r\nred-cross activities, and the assimilation of its workings to the\r\nadvance plans already put in execution in her own country. These plans\r\nwere chiefly of her own suggestion, and she had been instrumental in\r\ntheir reduction to successful use, for which she found opportunity in\r\nthe late civil war, and subsequently during the Franco-German war,\r\nwhen she followed the German army into Paris, working faithfully alike\r\nin French and German camp; when all the nations of Europe rang with\r\npraises for her splendid work. She then first became acquainted with\r\nthe Red Cross Society, and at once united with it; returning home with\r\nthe iron cross of Baden on her breast, she organized the Red Cross\r\nSociety of the United States, and was made its president. Her influence\r\nmainly contributed to the favorable action of the United States in\r\njoining this convention in 1882.\r\n\r\nIn 1865, one year after the conclusion of the Red Cross Convention,\r\noccurred the initiative of the International Telegraph Union upon the\r\nsignature of the Convention of Paris. For a time the Union dispensed\r\nwith a central administration, and at the conference held in Vienna in\r\n1865 the policy of having a shifting administration, as between the\r\ncapitals where the conferences took place, was seriously considered,\r\nbut the necessity for a fixed and central administration was finally\r\nconceded, and the Swiss Confederation was asked to take charge of it.\r\nThe central office was organized without delay at Bern. Correspondence\r\nwas opened with thirty-seven telegraphic administrations, twenty-six\r\nof which belonged to the contracting states and eleven to private\r\ncorporations. The last report from the bureau-director shows the\r\nnumber of state administrations corresponding with the central\r\noffice to be forty; in addition to these are ten cable or submarine\r\ncompanies and eleven private land companies. The budget for 1888\r\nreports the total expense of this bureau at 84,000 francs, or about\r\n$16,500, an incredibly small outlay for so important and responsible a\r\nwork, involving an extensive line of correspondence and at times the\r\nadjustment of very technical questions. The bureau issues an official\r\ngazette, _Le Journal Télégraphique_. To this union the United States do\r\nnot belong, having no government control over the telegraph companies.\r\n\r\nNext came the Postal Union in 1874, and immediately upon the exchange\r\nof ratifications of the convention a year later the central office\r\nwas likewise organized at Bern. Correspondence opened with twenty-one\r\npostal administrations, which have now increased to forty-seven;\r\nthe annual budget is $15,700, making the contributive share of a\r\nfirst-class state only a little over $600 per annum, and about half\r\nthat sum for a second-class state; certainly a very inconsiderable\r\ntax for so essential a service. The chiefs or directors of the two\r\nabove-mentioned unions possess administrative ability that would\r\nreadily command in the United States three times the sums paid them.\r\nA journal, _L’Union Postale_, published monthly, in three languages,\r\nEnglish, German, and French, is conducted by the bureau, and enjoys a\r\nlarge circulation among those interested in knowing something of this\r\nclearing-house process of international mail-matter.\r\n\r\nPassing mention may be made of two more limited but very useful\r\nconventions concluded in Switzerland,--one for the extermination of\r\nphylloxera and the other for the regulation of the transportation of\r\ngoods by railway. The first had its origin at a conference of persons\r\ninterested in the culture of the vine, held at Lausanne in 1877,\r\nand a convention to establish a union was signed at Bern in 1878 by\r\nseveral states, with the object of promoting joint protection against\r\na disease which had caused such serious losses to vine-growers. Bern\r\nwas agreed upon as the seat of all future meetings, and this union,\r\nwhich continues to obtain adhesions, is in active and beneficial\r\noperation. The Railway Transportation Union is, from the very nature\r\nand difficulty of the matters involved, one of slow evolution, but\r\nconferences are from time to time held, and its friends do not despair\r\nthat it will ultimately result in the text of an international union\r\nwith its bureau at Bern; this union, however, cannot expect to embrace\r\nany but the continental states.\r\n\r\nA most important event in the history of these unions was the\r\nconclusion, at Paris, in 1883, after ten years’ negotiation, of\r\nthe Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, with a\r\nsupplemental protocol signed at Rome in 1886. By the terms of the\r\nconvention Switzerland assumed the responsibility for the management of\r\nthe central administration, and the bureau joined the others at Bern.\r\nThere are sixteen states in this union, the last accession being that\r\nof the United States, which was made on the 30th of May, 1887.\r\n\r\nLastly, and one very properly following close on that for the\r\nprotection of industrial property, came the Union for the Protection\r\nof Literary and Artistic Property. This, the result of conferences\r\nin 1884, 1885, and 1886 at Bern, was secured by the signature of\r\nthe convention on the 9th of September, 1886, and the ratification\r\nexchanged 5th of December, 1887, with ten adhering states. The central\r\nbureau, like those preceding it, was placed under the high authority\r\nof the Swiss Confederation, and is consolidated with its sister Bureau\r\nof Industrial Property. It issues an ably edited monthly journal, _Le\r\nDroit d’Auteur_.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the United States to adhere to this convention, it\r\nwas apprehended by many, would deprive the Union of much of its\r\ncontemplated value and practical results. This sentiment found\r\nexpression in terms of the most sincere and respectful regret on\r\nthe part of the delegates representing the signing states. At the\r\nBern Conference of 1886, to which the writer was commissioned as a\r\nconsultative delegate, he submitted the following statement explanatory\r\nof the attitude of the United States towards the conference:\r\n\r\n“Through a circular note of the Swiss Federal Council the United States\r\nhave been invited, in concert with the other powers represented in the\r\nCopyright Conference held here in September, 1885, to instruct and\r\nempower a delegate to attend this conference, and to sign on behalf\r\nof the United States the International Convention for the General\r\nProtection of Literary and Artistic Property, drafted _ad referendum_\r\nby the conference last year, and a copy of which draft convention,\r\nwith additional article and _protocole de clôture_, had been submitted\r\nto them. The United States again find it impracticable to depute a\r\ndelegate plenipotentiary, and are constrained to withhold from any\r\nformal participation, as a signatory to the International Convention\r\nwhich resulted from the deliberations of 1885, and the transformation\r\nof that convention into a complete diplomatic engagement. To exhibit\r\ntheir benevolence, however, towards the principle involved, the\r\nUnited States desire, with, the pleasure of this conference, to be\r\nrepresented here, and has conferred upon me the honor to attend this\r\nconference as such representative, provided that my attendance is fully\r\nrecognized and admitted to be without plenipotentiary powers; but under\r\nthe limitation and reservation that the United States, not being a\r\nparty to the proposed convention, reserve their privilege of future\r\naccession, under provisions of Article XVIII. thereof, which declare\r\nthat ‘countries which have not joined in the present convention, and\r\nwhich by their municipal laws assure legal protection to the right\r\nwhereof this convention treats, shall be admitted to accede thereto\r\non their request to that effect.’ While not prepared to join in the\r\nproposed convention as a full signatory, the United States do not wish\r\nthereby to be understood as opposing the measure in any way, but, on\r\nthe contrary, desire to reserve without prejudice the privilege of\r\nfuture accession, should it become expedient and practicable to do\r\nso. Should any question exist that the representation of the United\r\nStates here, though under the specific and express limitation of a\r\nconsultative delegate, is such a participation as would suffice to\r\nexclude them from the category of the ‘countries that had not joined in\r\nthe present convention,’ and therefore to deprive them of the privilege\r\nof future accession, in event they desire to avail themselves of it,\r\nI wish to reiterate and emphasize the fact, that the course of the\r\nUnited States in commissioning a delegate is in nowise intended or\r\nto be construed as a participation in the result of the conference,\r\neither by acceptance or rejection. The position and attitude of the\r\nUnited States is one simply of expectancy and reserve. The Constitution\r\nof the United States enumerates among the powers especially reserved\r\nto Congress, that ‘to promote the progress of science and the useful\r\narts, by securing for limited terms to authors and inventors the\r\nexclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries;’\r\nwhich implies that the origination and limitation of measures to\r\nthose ends rest with the legislative rather than the treaty-making\r\npowers. Copyright and patents are on the same footing of regulation\r\nby federal legislation, and the executive branch of the government\r\ncannot be unmindful of the continued pendency of its consideration\r\nby the legislative department, or disregard the constitutional\r\nright of that department to conclude international treaties on this\r\nimportant subject. The question of international copyright is one of\r\ngreat interest to the United States. In fact, few other countries\r\ncan lay claim to greater concern than that naturally felt by people\r\ndistinguished for enlightened, extensive, and growing intellectual\r\nlife, and while not infringing upon the constitutional prerogative\r\nof Congress to initiate and conclude copyright legislation, likewise\r\nto define the rights of aliens and citizens within its jurisdiction,\r\nthe Executive, in his first annual message to Congress, inviting\r\nits attention to the conference of last September, said, ‘action is\r\ncertainly desirable to effect the object in view;’ and the Secretary of\r\nState for foreign affairs, in his official despatches relating to this\r\nconference, freely expresses his concurrence with the principle sought\r\nto be enunciated by the proposed convention, and conveys the hope that\r\nthe time is not distant when rights of property in the creation of\r\nthe mind may be universally secured under conditions favorable alike\r\nto the author and to the world’s right to share in the diffusion of\r\nideas. That the brain that creates is entitled to and should receive\r\nits just and full compensation, is a sentiment having its origin in\r\nthe inherent sense of honesty. Literary property has been to some\r\nextent recognized in all ages, and is to-day guaranteed in almost every\r\nState by domestic legislation. This recognition and guarantee should\r\nbe without distinction of nationality and without regard to political\r\nfrontiers. It is a matter of congratulation, and redounds much to\r\nthe credit of the Swiss government, through whose active efforts\r\nthis movement was successfully inaugurated, and supplemented by the\r\npatient and intelligent labor of the several conferences assembled\r\nhere at its invitation, that a just and permanent settlement, once for\r\nall, of the grave question of the protection of works of literature\r\nand art, so long and unjustly denied, is about to be realized by the\r\ninstrumentality of a uniform, efficacious, and equitable international\r\nconvention.”\r\n\r\nAt the close of these remarks the president of the conference thanked\r\nthe delegate from the United States, and assured him that the\r\n“accession of the United States would be received at any time with joy\r\nby all the contracting states, and he but reflected the sincere wish of\r\nall present in hoping that within a measurable time the United States\r\nwill request that a place be made for them in the Union.”\r\n\r\nIt is time that the position of the United States on this important\r\nsubject should be set free from the thraldom of that short-sighted\r\nselfishness which has hitherto fettered and degraded it. The Congress\r\nof the United States should seek suggestion from those sentiments of\r\nelevated justice and public honesty which are the sources of judicial\r\ncounsel, and should act in that spirit of permanent and comprehensive\r\nwisdom, justice, and right which alone gives assurances of deep and\r\nexpanding benefits, as well to nations as to individuals. In the\r\nabsence of international copyright, just and fair compensation for\r\nnative literary and artistic property is out of the question. American\r\nauthors ask no protection, they demand no aids, no bounties; they\r\nsimply ask not to be subjected to this discrimination against domestic\r\ntalent that puts them at a cruel disadvantage with foreign competitors,\r\nthe fatal usage of whose cheap reprints, “without authorial expenses,”\r\nhas become an inveterate and crushing system. They ask only the\r\nprivilege of meeting these competitors on equal terms in a fair\r\ncontest. Literary property is the only kind of personal property not\r\nprotected by the law when the owner is not a citizen of the United\r\nStates. To the foreign owners of patents and trade-marks, which are\r\nso analogous to copyright, protection ample and easily enforced is\r\naccorded. It is half a century since Prussia first set the example of\r\ngranting international copyright. In 1837 a law was passed that every\r\ncountry might secure copyright for its authors in Prussia upon granting\r\nreciprocity. This was followed by England in the succeeding year.\r\nFrance set the example, during the Empire, of forbidding the piracy of\r\nbooks and works of art of foreigners, before obtaining reciprocity.\r\nProperty in ideas, dating back in England to the Statutes of Anne,\r\nwas recognized in the Constitution of the United States, and is now\r\nconceded in every civilized country by legislative enactment. The same\r\nlegal protection in the matter of ideas which is given to the natives\r\nof the state, is now accorded to the foreigner and outsider by all\r\nnations of high civilization except the United States. The right to\r\nprofit by the product of the brain should secure for the author “that\r\njustice which is not a matter of climates and degrees.” The principle\r\nof copyright being admitted, it cannot logically be confined to state\r\nlines or national boundaries. Grant that it is difficult to give\r\nliterary rights the well-defined nature and tangible form of what is\r\nknown, technically, as real or personal property; still, outside of the\r\nethical or abstract right, copyright is a modern development of the\r\nprinciple of property which commends itself to every sentiment of honor\r\nand justice, regardless of any obscurity which may have surrounded or\r\ninspired its conception. Who steals a man’s book may, indeed, steal\r\ntrash, but, at least, it is his own trash, more closely his own than\r\nhis purse. In a high state of civilization, a man’s book should be\r\neverywhere regarded as his property, and should ever be protected as\r\nscrupulously as if it were a pair of shoes, upon the construction of\r\nwhich he has also expended his time, his thought, his patience, and\r\nsuch talent and skill as he possesses. The sophistical plea that the\r\nculture and education of our people are to be imperilled, and the cost\r\nof books to be placed beyond the reach of the masses, is the mere weak\r\nsubterfuge of those who are unwilling to be disturbed in their wrongful\r\nappropriation of the labor of others. The reverse of this claim has\r\nbeen abundantly shown. France has had an international copyright law\r\nfor years, and series of books are issued there for five cents, and\r\neven two cents a number; it is the same with Germany; and these cheap\r\npublications represent all that is best in the literature of their\r\nrespective countries. The spirit of literary ambition and activity is\r\ndaily becoming greater and more diffused among the people of the United\r\nStates, quickening and nourishing into life the seeds of a vigorous\r\nand vast native literature. It is impossible to determine the elements\r\nwhich must conspire to form and build up a native literature. It is\r\na mystery, not solved to the satisfaction of scholars, why it should\r\nhave put forth so early and transitory a bloom in Italy; why it should\r\nhave ripened so late in Germany and Scotland; why in England alone it\r\nshould know no vicissitudes of seasons, but smile in eternal spring.\r\nBut we may be confidently assured that a people to whom Providence has\r\ngiven a stirring history, a land abounding in landscapes of beauty and\r\ngrandeur, and a high degree of mental activity, extending the range of\r\nknowledge and scattering its seeds among all classes without price,\r\ncannot and will not remain long without an extensive and superior\r\nnative literature. The literature of a people is the noblest emanation\r\nand truest measure of the intellect and earnestness and progression of\r\nthat community. But there can be no decided literature, national in\r\nits basis, original in its character, independent in its aim, in any\r\ncountry where authorship is not a firm, reliable, and safe possession.\r\nAlready the peer of the proudest in military achievements and material\r\nprosperity, truth, freedom, and civilization never presented a richer\r\nfield and a brighter future for intellectual laborers than is to be\r\nfound in the United States. Inexhaustible materials sleep in the womb\r\nof the morning, awaiting the forming hand of letters to seize and\r\nvitalize these mighty elements. The day must come when the pre-eminence\r\nof the United States in the field of material products will be rivalled\r\nby the existence of a literature as aspiring, as copious, and as\r\nbrilliant as the spirit, resources, and destiny of the country; an\r\nAmerican literature, breathing American ideas, and teaching respect\r\nand admiration for American government, furnishing to the young men\r\nand women of an impressionable age books which are American books, not\r\nforeign books; not the cheap books of fiction dedicated, as Matthew\r\nArnold has said, to the “Goddess of Lubricity.”[115]\r\n\r\nThe international unions, indicated as having their seats in Bern,\r\nit must not be forgotten, are practically the only ones which the\r\nworld has to show. The _Bureau du Mètre_ in France, the only cognate\r\ninstitution in another country partaking of an international character,\r\ncannot be reckoned in the same class, being scientific and not\r\ncommercial. It is noteworthy, as evidence of the high consideration\r\ngiven to these international unions, or rather to the location of their\r\ncentral bureaus in Switzerland, by its statesmen, that the directorship\r\nof the Postal Bureau was on its establishment accepted by an eminent\r\nmember of the Federal Council, who thus voluntarily surrendered\r\nvirtually a life-tenure position of the highest dignity, coupled with\r\nthe certainty of succeeding to the Presidency of the Confederation,\r\nto assume a more laborious and responsible post, with little, if any,\r\nincrease of salary. The acquisition by Switzerland of these important\r\nbureaus, with the world-wide scope of their operation, is properly\r\nregarded as forming a more effectual guarantee for its preservation\r\nas an independent state than any other that could be devised. These\r\nunions cannot fail to be also productive of a progressively improving\r\nunderstanding among all the states composing them, enabling their\r\nseveral systems to be compared, useful discoveries shared, legislation\r\nsimplified and assimilated, the science of statistics facilitated, and\r\nefforts, not merely for the development of commercial, but also of\r\nthe intellectual needs of their respective people, wisely stimulated\r\nand directed. These beneficent consequences must favorably reflect\r\non the state furnishing the safe and common ground upon which this\r\ngreat work can be peaceably and skilfully prosecuted, and elevate\r\nit to an exceptional plane of importance and security, giving it an\r\ninternational function which is interesting to note. It will not\r\ndo, in connection with these international bodies and episodes in\r\nSwiss history, to omit reference to the fact that the first great\r\ninternational court of arbitration of modern times had its sessions\r\nin Geneva, in 1872, by virtue of the Treaty of Washington between\r\nGreat Britain and the United States to arbitrate what was known as\r\nthe “Alabama Claims.” Over this most memorable court a distinguished\r\ncitizen of Switzerland was chosen to preside. It was such an imposing\r\nspectacle, and the results were so important, as to give an old process\r\na new dignity and reputation; and to awaken a fresh interest in the\r\nproject of a permanent international high court of arbitration. To this\r\nproject the Swiss Federal Council has been frequently addressed to lend\r\nits kindly offices. It is a project that every philanthropic publicist\r\nwould be happy to see made practicable. Insurmountable difficulties\r\nseem to interpose, yet the fact of great states submitting their\r\ndisputes to a body of impartial arbitrators for decision, and not the\r\narbitrament of war, is not a new one, but of very ancient origin, old\r\nas history. As a principle, it has received the approval of sovereigns\r\nand statesmen, parliaments and congresses. The chief powers of Europe\r\ngave their sanction to it by the Treaty of Paris in 1856, and the\r\ngovernment of the United States has, upon more than one occasion, given\r\napproval to it as the means of settling international controversy.[116]\r\nBarbarians and early people fought because they liked it, as the\r\nchivalrous Maoris did, and the Mussulmans, and the ancient Greeks. The\r\nromance and poetry of these people are all about war; it was their\r\nsport, their industry, their occupation; there was no other way to\r\nwealth and the heart of woman. Even the ancient Teutones regarded war\r\nas a great international lawsuit, and victory was the judgment of God\r\nin favor of the victor. Civilized people fight because they cannot help\r\nit, not because they like it. Civilized nations of to-day are supposed\r\nto act from motives of justice and humanity, and not upon calculations\r\nof profit, or ambition, or in the wantonness of mere caprice. Nations\r\nare now regarded as moral persons, bound so to act as to do each other\r\nthe least injury and the most good. There is a growing international\r\nconsciousness that, considered in the abstract, unconnected with all\r\nviews of the causes for which it may be undertaken, war is an evil, and\r\nthat it should yield to some plan of adjusting international quarrels\r\nmore consonant with the present boasted Christian civilization. War, it\r\nis true, has its great conquests, its pomps, its proud associations,\r\nand heroic memories, yet there is murder in its march, and humanity and\r\ncivilization, genius and statesmanship, are things to blush for if they\r\nfail to realize that\r\n\r\n  “Peace hath her victories\r\n  No less renown’d than war,”\r\n\r\nand that these words convey a profound principle, and not merely an\r\nabstraction too refined to be reduced to practice.\r\n\r\nThe trend of events is towards a peaceable settlement of international\r\ndifferences. National temperaments are being levelled by the ease of\r\nintercourse. The world is more and more assimilating to a condition\r\nlike that of a great family, in which the individual nations, as\r\nmembers, are linked together by interests, which disputes ending in\r\nwars only impair and cannot benefit. The principle in early Roman law\r\nwas that every stranger is a public enemy. The opposite prevails\r\nto-day with civilized peoples, that the normal relation between nations\r\nis one of peace and friendship. Unconquerable time itself works on\r\nincreasingly, bringing the nations nearer to one another in the\r\nnatural and orderly development of close international intercourse,\r\nstrengthening the community of mankind. A deep meaning and philosophic\r\ntruth is contained in the words of Vattel, “International justice is\r\nthe daughter of economic calculations.” These international unions are\r\nmost powerful auxiliaries in removing the hinderances that lie between\r\nnations; through them the lesson is being objectively taught that great\r\nnations are so dependent upon each other, that any disturbance in a\r\nparticular one is felt by the others, and that when their friendly\r\nrelations are interrupted, the civilized world suffers. Through\r\nthis influence nations are beginning to take a wider view of their\r\nmutual duties and relations, and appeal to reason and conscience in\r\ninternational dealings finds a response and an application which could\r\nnot have been expected earlier. These unions generate a spirit that\r\nturns its regard to the circuit of the globe, and to an inspiration in\r\nwhich international relations obtain a higher form and a more assured\r\nsecurity, with no purpose to interfere with particular states or their\r\ncomplete autonomous organism, or to oppress nations, but the better\r\nto secure the peace of the one and the freedom of the other. The best\r\nhuman arrangements cannot completely insure the world against civil\r\nwar. This ideal can be only approximated. It would be vain to look for\r\na political millennium, for a time when the “only battle-field will\r\nbe the market open to commerce and the mind open to new ideas,” when\r\nnations shall enjoy the boundless blessings offered them in the perfect\r\nfreedom of human industry and in the reign of a perpetual peace,--\r\n\r\n  “When the war-drum throbs no longer and the battle-flags are furled\r\n  In the parliament of man, the federation of the world.”\r\n\r\nThe latest movement, on the part of Switzerland, in the inauguration\r\nof international legislation, relates to “international law” and the\r\n“interest of the working-classes.” The former was organized, in 1888,\r\nat Lausanne, the seat of the Swiss Federal Tribunal, and formed the\r\n“Institute of International Law;” the subjects discussed comprised the\r\ncommon features of the conflict of civil laws; the conflict of the laws\r\nrelative to marriage and divorce; joint stock companies; encounters\r\nat sea; extradition; occupation of unclaimed territory, according\r\nto provisions of the Treaty of Berlin; international regulation of\r\nrailways, telegraphs, and telephones in time of war; and the manner\r\nand limit of expulsion of strangers from the territory by governments.\r\nThe second, relating to the “interest of the working-classes,” was\r\nforeshadowed by an article from the pen of M. Numa Droz, the chief\r\nof the Foreign Department in the Swiss Cabinet, and published in the\r\n_Revue Suisse_ of February, 1889. In this article M. Droz announced\r\nthat Switzerland was about to invite the other nations of Europe to a\r\ncongress, in which projects for improving the condition of the laboring\r\nclasses of Europe would be discussed. He expressed his confidence that\r\nonly good could come from such an official gathering, and stated that\r\nSwitzerland would consider it “as a great source of pleasure to offer\r\ncordial hospitality to the first European conference in the interest\r\nof labor legislation.” The distinguished and official authorship of\r\nthis article caused it to attract much attention, and it received very\r\nfavorable comment from the continental press. As indicated by M. Droz,\r\nwithin a short time after the appearance of his article, the Swiss\r\nFederal Council issued an invitation to the European manufacturing\r\nstates to send representatives to a conference in September, 1889, at\r\nBern, to consider the “well-being of the working-classes,” and the\r\norganization of an “International Labor Congress.” At the same time\r\nit suggested the following questions for consideration: Prohibition\r\nof Sunday work; fixing of a minimum age for the employment of children\r\nin factories, and a limitation of working-hours for young people;\r\nprohibition of the employment of minors and women in peculiarly\r\nunhealthy or dangerous industries; limitation of night-work; the\r\nadoption of a settled plan for the attainment of these objects. The\r\nsecond annual session of this conference was recently held at Berlin,\r\nby the invitation of the Emperor, who recognized that he could no\r\nlonger depend on the army to repress industrial discontent. Should\r\nthese conferences succeed in ameliorating the condition of the laboring\r\nclasses throughout Europe, and thus lift from those countries the\r\ndarkest and most angry cloud that now hangs over them, it will be the\r\nbrightest jewel in the crown of Switzerland’s hegemony in the great\r\nwork of international unions.\r\n\r\nIt can no longer be denied that it is possible to unite the whole\r\nglobe in such organizations, now that international law, with its\r\nhypothesis of the union of many states in one humanity, extends over\r\nthe greater part of the inhabited earth. There is a steadily-increasing\r\ninterdependence of the nations of the world, especially of those which\r\ngive themselves to commerce and manufactures, and alike of those\r\nwhich need a foreign field for a share of their capital. These ties\r\nunite them alike for good and evil, and render the prosperity of each\r\ndependent on the equal prosperity of all the rest. When this great\r\ntruth is well understood, it may, perhaps, become the peacemaker of\r\nthe world. Nations have their defects and passions like individuals,\r\nand well-established international laws, conventions, and unions\r\nare necessary to protect the weak and helpless from the strong and\r\nambitious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nSWITZERLAND AND THE EUROPEAN SITUATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSwitzerland has no small influence on the affairs of Europe, as well\r\nby its situation as by its warlike genius. There is much of history,\r\nbut still more political anomaly, written in the very conglomerate map\r\nof Switzerland. It is a land of unfulfilled destiny. The eye traces\r\nits great water-courses into the most important countries of civilized\r\nEurope, and recognizes the lines down which potent influences, social\r\nand political, are to descend. Its political boundaries do not coincide\r\nwith those of nature; they are erratic, the result of wars and\r\npolitical vicissitudes. On the one hand, France shoots out spurs of her\r\nterritory into Switzerland, and Switzerland, on the other hand, by the\r\nforce of circumstances, has overlapped Italian ground, taking in Ticino\r\nsouth of the main chain of the Alps, which is Italian in climate and\r\nflora; a large part of the Grisons is east of the Rhine, and of the\r\nranges separating it from Tyrol; while Schaffhausen and a couple of\r\nvillages in the Canton of Basel are altogether on the north side of the\r\nline, the German town of Constanz is to the south of the line. Again,\r\nif a Swiss wishes to pass from the Rhine valley to Geneva by the south\r\nbank of the lake, he must cross French territory in order to do so. The\r\nsouthwest frontier of Switzerland stops at Geneva, instead of extending\r\nto the Jura, which forms its natural frontier. Military writers have\r\npointed out that the easiest route for an investing force from Germany\r\nwould be through Switzerland; and similarly for a force from France,\r\nover the Jura, by Zurich, to the Rhine at Schaffhausen. “That a power\r\nwhich was master of Switzerland could debouch on the theatre of\r\noperations of the Rhone, the Saône, Po, or Danube; from Geneva an army\r\ncould march on Lyons, from Basel it could gain the valley of Saône by\r\nBelfort, from Constance the Danube could be reached; Italy could be\r\ninvaded, and the lines of defence of that country against France and\r\nAustria turned.”[117]\r\n\r\nThis potential position of Switzerland, a prominent point of moral\r\nand political contact between powerful and somewhat antagonistic\r\npowers, on the one side confining the limits of the German empire, and\r\non the other setting bounds to the French republic, naturally gives\r\nrise to many speculations. The gamut of these is frequently run by\r\nthe newspapers; Germany making overtures for a treaty undertaking to\r\nprotect Switzerland’s neutrality; France negotiating for the occupation\r\nby Switzerland of the Chablais and Faucigny districts, in Upper Savoy,\r\nin accordance with the treaties of 1815 and 1830, thus preventing the\r\nintervention of Italy as against France; then the right of Switzerland\r\nto occupy certain districts of Savoy, in case of war, is held by the\r\nGerman authorities to have been settled by the Congress of Vienna and\r\nneeds no further discussion; on the other hand, it is alleged that this\r\nright was subsequently denied by Napoleon III., after the annexation\r\nof Savoy to France; and as a culmination, Germany makes a serious\r\nproposition to Italy for the partition of Switzerland, but Italy\r\ndeclines the offer, preferring to have a little neutral and friendly\r\nrepublic than a great military empire as her neighbor; the proposition\r\nis submitted to France in turn, and also declined, as the greater\r\nportion of Switzerland being Teutonic in race and tongue, France\r\ncould get but a small fragment and Italy a still smaller. The theory\r\nis also advanced of making Switzerland, Alsace-Lorraine, Luxemburg,\r\nand Belgium into a sort of federated block of neutral territory, the\r\ninviolability of which all the rest of Europe should solemnly pledge\r\nitself to accept. Regardless of these diplomatic tergiversations\r\nSwitzerland continues to be governed according to the choice of its\r\nown people, and not according to the _bon plaisir_ of foreign powers.\r\nThe sort of negative which the Swiss government practises, and which\r\nis what the position of the country specially requires, is displayed\r\nboth in the theory and execution of the Swiss federal system, and by\r\na great prudence in foreign policy. Its policy since the beginning of\r\nthe sixteenth century has been neutrality. The object of the Congress\r\nof Vienna in guaranteeing the neutrality of Switzerland was primarily\r\nstrategical; it was also felt to be essential that steps should be\r\ntaken to prevent any one power from gaining possession of the line of\r\nthe Alps upon the breaking out of a fresh war.[118] The appreciation\r\nof this danger was strongly expressed by the First Consul of France,\r\nin an address issued in 1803, wherein he announced: “I would have gone\r\nto war on account of Switzerland; I would have sacrificed a hundred\r\nthousand men, rather than allowed it to remain in the hands of the\r\nparties who were at the head of the last insurrection; so great is the\r\ninfluence of its geographical position upon France. The interests of\r\ndefence bind Switzerland to France; those of attack render it of value\r\nto other powers.” Switzerland bears relations to the great powers of\r\ncontemporary civilization, in some respects, even more remarkable than\r\nthose which the little strip of soil along the Jordan, at the meeting\r\nof the continents, bore to the civilizations of antiquity. Like that\r\nof Palestine, its situation, while affording small temptation to\r\naggression upon its neighbors, is supremely advantageous for defence,\r\nfor isolation from foreign influence; and yet, at the same time, for\r\nthe exercise of effective influence outward upon the coterminous\r\nnations. To these advantages it adds another, in its polyglot\r\nfacility of communication with the most important nations of Europe.\r\nPreserving its ancient character, content within itself, constituting\r\na confederated republic, which, by its good order and industry,\r\nmorals and laws, rivals in age the oldest monarchy with its stability\r\nof self-government,--the greatest of these monarchies cannot afford\r\nto despise its friendship. Not only securing and protecting its own\r\nliberty, but it has been the arbiter of the fate of other people. It\r\nhas given examples of those qualities by which men may be so ennobled\r\nthat they are respected even amid their comparative poverty and\r\nweakness; heroes, though too few to be feared by the weak, they are too\r\nbrave to be insulted by the strong.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, powers of apparently inconsiderable greatness have usually\r\nbrought about its most decided changes, or at least have most\r\ninfluenced its historical course. Thus did Venice in the times of the\r\nCrusades, and Switzerland during the Burgundian and Italian wars; as\r\nHolland at the commencement of the eighteenth century gave a new form\r\nto Europe, so did Sweden predominate in the seventeenth century, and\r\nin the earlier half of that age surpass France herself in splendor.\r\nIt seems to be a capital necessity of great states to have something\r\nplaced between them that may relieve the severity of their mutual\r\nfriction; an arm of the sea; an impassable mountain; a small neutral\r\nstate, one not strong enough to play a great part in foreign politics,\r\nbut, with a modest policy, absorbed in domestic affairs; any of these\r\nmay be of great importance to limit and moderate the dangerous currents\r\nof great politics. This was illustrated by the action of Austria,\r\nafter the partition of Poland and the consequent juxtaposition of\r\nRussia, offering to restore its part of Poland for the purpose of\r\nreconstituting that kingdom. The present age in Europe differs entirely\r\nfrom that of the Middle Ages. Then the general tendency was to small\r\nstates, now it is to large ones. Then there existed a number of petty\r\nmonarchies and republics; the unity of the Roman empire was ideal\r\nrather than actual. The tendency to form larger states began with\r\nEngland, and is seen on the continent after the latter part of the\r\nfifteenth century, and has not yet reached its limits. Everywhere there\r\nis a tendency to the formation of large and important states, speaking\r\nfor the most part one language throughout their whole territory. It\r\nis promoted by the quickened impetus of trade and commerce, increased\r\nmilitary and financial resources, improved and extended communication,\r\nand by the entire development of modern civilization. This progress\r\ntowards the establishment of extensive and consolidated nationalities\r\nis conspicuously found in the present German empire. Though in no sense\r\na restoration of the Holy Roman Empire, it is a real restoration of the\r\nancient German kingdom, and the Kaiser fairly represents the German\r\nkingship from which the thirteen ancient Cantons gradually split off.\r\nRussia is practically the only Slavonic state; Italy comprises nearly\r\nall the Italians, except a few resident upon the head and eastern side\r\nof the Adriatic Gulf; France has by her losses in the Franco-Prussian\r\nwar become more French, since neither Alsace nor Lorraine is inhabited\r\nby people of the Gallic race; Spain and Portugal comprise the entire\r\nSpanish Peninsula; Austria is a great mongrel state and represents no\r\nnational aim, but is composed of fragments of various nationalities.\r\nThe national question in the British Islands is not settled, and may\r\nend in separation or more probably in the formation of a federation.\r\nThe smaller semi-independent principalities of Servia, Roumania,\r\nBulgaria, East Roumelia are simply materials out of which a second\r\nSlavonic state may at some time be formed, perhaps under the authority\r\nof Russia. The natural fate of Holland is absorption into Germany;\r\nof Belgium, absorption into France. Turkey--how this cumberer of\r\nthe earth can be disposed of without kindling a general European\r\nconflagration is a question that puzzles the wisest statesman. This\r\nunification might be made to play a beneficial part in checking war and\r\nimproving the European situation; but so far it has merely essayed a\r\nscience of combination, of application, and of deception, according to\r\ntimes, places, and circumstances. In the process of absorption there\r\nhas not been shown much disposition to take questions of ethics into\r\nconsideration in dealing with weaker peoples; even self-interest seems\r\nat times to be a less strong motive than the desire to annoy one’s\r\nneighbors. Bentham somewhere proves that there is such a thing as\r\n“disinterested malevolence;” and if it exists at all, it is certainly\r\nto be discovered in the action of these great European powers. Many of\r\nthem present vicious systems of military and coercive governments; vast\r\nempires resting upon bayonets and semi-bureaucracy, an anachronism and\r\nan incubus upon the true development of national life. All these great\r\npowers are monstrous outgrowths of warlike ambition and imperial pride\r\nin different degrees and under different conditions. On nearly every\r\nbattle-field great questions of dynastic and national reconstruction\r\nhave hung in the balance; military operations have been the decisive\r\nfactors. Huge military systems are abnormal, the morbid results of the\r\nspirit of war and domination, of national selfishness and revolutionary\r\nviolence. The game of kings has become the impact of armed peoples.\r\nThe Congress of Vienna settled the affairs of Europe upon a basis\r\nwhich endured with but few changes for almost fifty years; the great\r\ntreaty of Berlin of 1878, in form an act of restitution as well as of\r\npeace, has become as dead a letter as the treaty of Paris of 1856.\r\nPrinciples of older date and less questionable validity than treaties\r\npatched up with premature jubilation obtain; and the solemn irony of\r\nPrince Talleyrand, that “non-intervention is a diplomatic term, which\r\nsignifies much the same as intervention,” has become axiomatic. It is\r\nno exaggeration to speak of Europe as an armed camp, with the dogs\r\nof war pulling heavily on their chains. Armies of men stand scowling\r\ninto one another’s eyes across a fanciful frontier, marked by a few\r\nparti-colored posts. In spite of all European assurances of “cloudless\r\npolitical horizons” and “luxuriant international olive-branches,”\r\nthe perfection of armaments and the augmentation of already enormous\r\narmies go faithfully on. Every one who visits Europe must be amazed\r\nat the military influence that everywhere dominates, especially on\r\nthe continent. “Above the roar of the city street sounds the sharp\r\ndrum-beat of the passing regiment; in the sweet rural districts the\r\nvillage church-bell cannot drown the bugle peal from the fortress on\r\nthe hill. France sinks millions in frontier strongholds, Russia masses\r\ntroops in Poland and on the Pruth, Austria strengthens her fortresses\r\nin Galicia, and Germany builds railways to the Rhine and bridges\r\nto span its yellow flood.” There is no European peace, except that\r\npeace described by Hosea Biglow, which was “druv in with bag’nets.”\r\nMontesquieu, the upright magistrate, who, living under despotic rule,\r\nnevertheless insisted that by the Constitution of France its king was\r\nnot absolute, sought in the records of history to discern the tendency\r\nof each great form of government, and has left his testimony that\r\n“_L’esprit de la monarchie est la guerre et l’agrandissement; l’esprit\r\nde la république est la paix et la modération_” (“the spirit of\r\nmonarchy is war and aggrandizement; the spirit of a republic is peace\r\nand moderation”).\r\n\r\nAn armed truce is preserved out of mutual terror; if tranquillity\r\nexists, it is not the repose of reasonable, kindly powers, but the\r\ncrouching attitude of relentless rivals dreading the enemy whom they\r\nhate, and afraid of the destructive weapons which support modern\r\nwarfare, making the “mowing down” no longer figurative, but horribly\r\nliteral. Sheer force holds a larger place than it has held in modern\r\ntimes since the fall of Napoleon; and the will to take, without better\r\nreason than the power to hold, is naked and undisguised. One of the\r\nmost melancholy forms which this aggression has taken, and seems\r\ndestined to occupy so much of the future energies of imperialism,\r\nis the partition and exploitation of the vast African continent and\r\nthe defenceless islands of the Pacific. It is done in the name of\r\n“civilization,” and called _l’occupation des territoires sans maître_.\r\nIn the Pacific Ocean the work has been nearly completed, Samoa and\r\nHawaii remaining as almost the last abodes of aboriginal sovereignty.\r\nColonial extension and annexation is a veritable European Pandora’s\r\nbox; war is constantly threatened for the sake of localities whose\r\nvery names were previously unknown, and whose possession would seem\r\nof no practical importance. Since Dido tricked the Numidian king in\r\nher survey and purchase of a site for Carthage,[119] the world has\r\nbeen in constant trouble upon the subject of boundaries, and a very\r\nlarge proportion of the wars between nations, like lawsuits between\r\nindividuals, have arisen over disputed boundary lines. The cry of\r\n“fifty-four forty or fight,” the national watchword of the United\r\nStates in 1846, has found an echo in every age. Between England and\r\nRussia smoulders the Central Asia and Turkish empire question; between\r\nEngland and France the matter of Egyptian occupation; Italy and France\r\nhave their quarrel over Tunis and Tripoli, and the Mediterranean\r\ngenerally. Then there is the crux of the Balkan peninsula, where\r\nAustria and Russia glower at each other across the Carpathians; this\r\nEastern question is opened as often as the temple of Janus, and, like\r\nthat temple, its opening means war. So it goes; when pushed under\r\nat St. Petersburg, alarm makes its appearance in Paris; and when\r\nsilenced on the Rhine, it causes itself to be heard among the Balkans.\r\nRussia lowers across Europe from the east, patiently waiting, and not\r\nfearing central European alliance, confident some day, by natural\r\nexpansion, of overshadowing all eastern Europe, and gathering at will\r\nand in its own good time all the Slavonic people under its suzerain\r\nguardianship. France casts a dark shadow from the west, while the\r\n“_furor Teutonicus_” and the “_furie Française_” flourish perennially\r\nin the blood-feud which has Alsace-Lorraine for its bitter badge.[120]\r\nFrance looks with natural uneasiness at the iron circle in which\r\nthe unity of Germany and Italy is circumscribing her influence and\r\nexpansion. The tremendous struggle with Germany, with its crushing\r\ndefeat and the provinces torn away, left a wound that will not heal,\r\nbut with its gloomy memories and poignant regrets, with its latent but\r\nunfailing suggestion of revenge, too frequently guides her policy.\r\nWhile a united Germany made short work with the French emperor, it left\r\nFrance exasperated, and probably in a less unsound condition than at\r\nany previous moment since 1789.\r\n\r\nGermany, with the huge mass of Russia on one side and the lithe\r\nstrength of France on the other, must sleep in armor; during any\r\nrespite from the partisans of _la revanche_ on the one frontier or a\r\nmurmur of Panslavism from Moscow, Germany confronts serious problems\r\nwith her congeries of states. It remains to be seen how Germany will\r\nget on without the large, comprehensive, incomparable skill and the\r\nmettle of unyielding determination with which the Iron Chancellor\r\nlaid all international questions under tribute to the _Vaterland_.\r\nThis continental entanglement points to England as holding the\r\nbalance of power; jealous of Russia’s encroachments in the east,\r\njealous of Austria, jealous of the power of Germany, worried with a\r\ncertain uneasiness that “the circles of the morning drum-beat” may be\r\nbroken, England finds in this situation much food for contemplation\r\nand conjecture. All European movements, especially on the part of the\r\nGreat Powers,[121] profess to have no other object than to preserve\r\ntheir “political equilibrium” or the “balance of power.” Excepting the\r\nwars of religion, most European wars of the last three centuries have\r\nsought justification in this pretext, which is but another phase of the\r\nboundary question. Up to a very recent date the English Parliamentary\r\ngrants for supplies needed to support the army were expressly recited\r\nto be made for the purpose “of preserving the balance of power in\r\nEurope.” The “European Concert,” with its brood of auxiliaries, in the\r\n_modus vivendi_, _status quo_, and _entente cordiale_, interlarded with\r\nnumerous _pourparlers_, separating _re infecta_, is not the harmonious\r\ninstitution its musical title would indicate; but disagreements are\r\nconstantly arising as to who shall be _chef de musique_ and who shall\r\nplay second fiddle. It is a mere decorous synonyme for “European\r\ndiscord.” When not having in view a general scheme of spoliation,\r\nit is looking to the carving out the shape, the conditions, and the\r\ndestinies of the remaining small states, with a cynical indifference\r\nas to the weal or wish of the populations. European powers are simply\r\nracing in the absurd and ruinous rivalry for the mightiest battalions\r\nand the heaviest budgets. Under the plea of _si vis pacem para bellum_\r\neach one is striving to steal a march upon its neighbors, absolutely\r\nblind to the obvious fact that with each fraction of accelerated speed\r\nin one all the rest perforce quicken their pace. The danger of this\r\nmuch misused axiom, which advises the securing of peace by preparing\r\nfor war, brings a crushing burden of apprehension; it involves conduct\r\nthat betrays designs of future hostility, and if it does not excite\r\nviolence, always generates malignity with a sly reciprocation of\r\nindirect injuries without the bravery of war or the security of peace.\r\nFrom such a condition some chance tide rather than any chosen course\r\nmay any day cause a rupture. Nations drift into war, and peace is\r\nrarely disturbed by serious matters. The commercial necessities of\r\nEurope cannot much longer bear the severe strain of this unnaturally\r\nswollen and crushing militarism, a conscription so ruthless which\r\ndemands one inhabitant out of every hundred and takes one producer\r\nout of every twenty, transferring him from the ranks of tax-payers to\r\nthe ranks of tax-consumers. This strain must be lessened or it will\r\ninfallibly snap; the people are merely the soldiers of an army, they\r\nare drilled rather than governed; the workman is getting tired of going\r\nto his labors carrying a soldier upon his back; the masses are coming\r\nto regard appeals to their patriotism as full of bitter mockery, being\r\nmere appeals to kill their neighbors or distant races that they and\r\ntheir children may be more permanently enslaved at home. A universal\r\nrevolt is inevitable against exactions so intolerable, idiotic, and\r\ninhuman. If those alone who “sowed the wind did reap the whirlwind”\r\nit would be well, but the mischief is that the madness of ambition\r\nand the schemes of diplomacy find their victims principally among\r\nthe innocent and the unoffending. The cottage is sure to suffer for\r\nevery error of the court, the cabinet, or the camp, like the torrent\r\nwhich originates, indeed, in the mountain, but commits its devastation\r\nin the vale. If there is no check on this increasing demand upon\r\nthe lives and property of the masses, “this devouring mischief of\r\nmilitarism which is consuming the vitals of Europe,” the mightiest\r\npotentate may find that he has to face a combination of the toiling\r\nand suffering classes against which all his weapons will be futile.\r\n“Great,” says Carlyle, “is the combined voice of men, the utterance\r\nof their instincts, which are truer than their thoughts; it is the\r\ngreatest a man encounters among the sounds and shadows which make up\r\nthis world of time.” There is no constitution and no despotism which\r\ncould stand against it for a moment. The modern emperor is only an\r\napparition in comparison with the imperial muscle and bone of his\r\nancient prototype; no longer he is regarded as the “deputy elect of\r\nthe Lord,” whom the “breath of worldly men cannot depose.” A revolt,\r\npolitical in its aims but economic in its origin, will take place; an\r\neconomic revolt tending to change the economical conditions of the\r\nmasses and a political revolt tending to modify the very essence of the\r\npolitical organization, demanding that these vast armies be disbanded,\r\nthe swords turned into ploughshares, and the victory of the industrial\r\nover the military type of civilization be established. A revolution\r\ntoward the final abolition of feudalism with its arbitrary privileges\r\nfor the few and its excessive burdens for the many, toward the fuller\r\nparticipation of the people in the work of government and their more\r\nefficient protection in the enjoyment of the fruits of their labor.\r\nOtherwise the dilemma is a sad one,--to remain a colossal arsenal or\r\nbecome a wild field of devastation; war would mean destruction of human\r\nlife and of the elements of national prosperity beyond precedent.\r\nWhether these immense armaments will be peacefully discontinued or war\r\nensue as the only solution, and if so, what will be its effect on the\r\nmap of Europe, are all momentous questions beyond the ken of man. The\r\npowers leagued together in the Triple Alliance may, if favored by the\r\nwealth and maritime power of England, serve as a potent guarantee for\r\nthe maintenance of peace. This European drama is unfolding its actions\r\nslowly, so that no one can tell what it will bring forth; constantly\r\nnew novelties are being introduced upon the stage with an increasing\r\nnumber of hints of stranger things to come. The prominent persons\r\nin the play, though preserving a romantic air of mystery, manage\r\nconstantly to throw off a multiform mass of suggestions, speculations,\r\nand visions. What is developing astonishes the mind while it fascinates\r\nthe imagination, for it seems to be nothing less vast and portentous\r\nthan the passing away of the whole existing order of things almost\r\nwithout notice, certainly without comprehension. What proportions this\r\ngigantic, this politico-social movement will assume, how much of what\r\nis old it will leave standing, what the new order will be like, these\r\nare questions which Europe’s brain has not yet fairly grasped, much\r\nless tried to answer.\r\n\r\nThere is a strong continental opinion that in the event of war\r\nSwitzerland can hardly hope to successfully maintain the position\r\nassumed by it in 1870; that it occupies too small a space in the great\r\nchart of European political and military calculations to have much\r\nweight attached to its views. With less confidence in treaty guarantees\r\nthan in the maxim of Cromwell, whose Ironsides were taught to “put\r\ntheir trust in God and keep their powder dry,” Switzerland will heed\r\nthe advice given in the reply of the German chancellor, when asked\r\nin 1870 to what extent Swiss neutrality would be observed, said, “to\r\nthe extent to which you yourselves respect the device of the Scottish\r\nOrder of the Thistle, ‘_nemo me impune lacessit_.’” Switzerland can no\r\nlonger rely upon its mountain wall, which for so many ages, combined\r\nwith other geographical advantages, formed a safe breastwork against\r\nthe invader. Nature herself seemed to have thrown her arms around\r\nHelvetia to protect her from the invader; and by encompassing her\r\nwith inaccessible mountains, tremendous precipices, and stupendous\r\nmasses of eternal ice, to make her, as Frederick the Great of Prussia\r\ndescribed the lords of Savoy, “kings by virtue of their locality.” The\r\ncraggy escarpments, bastioned with horrid precipices, parapeted and\r\nbattlemented with eternal snow, were the ramparts of the cradle of her\r\nliberty; they played a great part:\r\n\r\n  “That like giants stand\r\n  To sentinel enchanted land.”\r\n\r\nThen Switzerland was self-contained, and enemies could not get at it.\r\nIt could say with the Psalmist, “I will lift mine eyes unto the hills,\r\nfrom whence cometh my help.” “We did not fear,” said the shepherds\r\nof Uri, “the armies of France; we are _four hundred_ strong, and if\r\nthat is not sufficient, _four hundred_ more in our valley are ready\r\nto march to the defence of the country.” In the same spirit wrote the\r\nCouncil of Bern, “A handful of Swiss is a match for an army; on our\r\nown soil, with our mountains behind us, we can defy the world.” The\r\nHelvetic Confederacy made the greatest and most powerful nations of\r\nEurope tremble in the fifteenth century; but Switzerland is no longer\r\ndefended by natural frontiers; its two great cities, that of Geneva on\r\nthe one side, and Basel upon the other, lie open to the invader, and\r\nthe occupation of two or three points upon its railway system (which\r\nbut for its army could be easily reached) would paralyze its defence;\r\nthe strength with which nature had endowed Switzerland under the old\r\ncondition of things has been wellnigh cancelled by the grand appliances\r\nof modern science, wealth, and organization. Modern Switzerland is\r\nnow no stronger than any other part of Europe. Defence no longer can\r\nbe intrusted to natural ramparts, the Alps, and mountaineers, led by\r\nthe sound of the horn, and armed with the bow of Tell. The strength\r\nof Switzerland is exactly proportioned to its armed force; numerical\r\nstrength preponderates in military fields, and victory attends the\r\nlargest army. This implies no impeachment of Swiss courage and\r\npatriotism; that love of country, wrought into a great and noble\r\nsentiment, which summons to its aid every better portion of human\r\nexcellence; that exalted power which gives vigor and efficacy to our\r\nexertions as citizens, which strengthens our constancy and animates\r\nour valor, which heightens our contempt of danger and inflames our\r\nimpatience of oppression. There is no safer criterion of the virtue and\r\nhappiness of a people than the height to which their attachment for\r\ntheir country is raised, and the difficulties which they are prepared\r\nto encounter in rescuing it from danger or exalting it to glory. As\r\npatriotism is always more intense in small states, where union for the\r\npurposes of self-preservation is more indispensably necessary, so the\r\nsame institutions which have engaged the affections of the Swiss will\r\nlikely inspire them with the courage and wisdom requisite for their\r\ndefence. Switzerland will be prepared in event of a rearrangement of\r\nthe map of Europe, by which it is likely to be effected, to demand a\r\nvoice in the general summing up. Even to the diplomatist, who, wanting\r\nto reach an understanding, must have something behind it to command\r\nattention and respect, and exclaims, “Don’t trouble me with your\r\narguments, tell me with what force you will back them,” Switzerland\r\nis not without an answer. The republic is not unprepared for war, as\r\nalready shown in the chapter on the army; every man in shop and field\r\nwould start into a soldier at the bugle’s call; a soldier armed,\r\nequipped, and ready for the march. Great sacrifices are willingly made\r\nin order to keep on foot an admirable democratic army. All the adjuncts\r\nfor making this army a mobile factor in the field are under the Swiss\r\nsystem complete and in thorough working order. It could put into the\r\nfield and maintain effectively 200,000 men, to prove that Switzerland\r\nwas not a “mere geographical expression,” but a very formidable entity.\r\nThe Swiss General Dufour, in a letter addressed to the French minister\r\nof war, just before the war broke out in 1870, after giving the size\r\nof the Swiss army, added: “Beyond all these defences we can count upon\r\nthe national spirit in the heart of every citizen; a resolution to\r\nprotect our independence and neutrality, let the storm break on us from\r\nwhatever side it may.” What 200,000 brave Swiss sharpshooters might do\r\ndefending their liberty in those mountain fastnesses no European army\r\nwould care to learn by close experience. Their stout hearts and hardy\r\narms will be ever ready, as in preceding ages, to vindicate against\r\ncountless hosts their personal liberty and the independence of their\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss government is not unaware that its neutrality may at any\r\ntime be endangered; that a small state is always in danger when it\r\nstands in the way of the arms or the ambition or the greed of the\r\ngreat ones, that if its territory offers a convenient route for the\r\nrival armies, they would not hesitate to brush away its neutrality, in\r\nspite of all guarantees, as the Allies did in 1814. Accordingly for\r\nyears past the government has been quietly but steadily preparing to\r\ndefend the country in such an event. The plan, so far, consists in the\r\nfortifications of the summit of St. Gothard; the plateau of Andermatt\r\ncommands not only the base of the St. Gothard, but the valleys, and\r\nwhoever is able to hold it can prevent any passage across Switzerland\r\nfrom south to north. Since 1885 nearly 10,000,000 francs have been\r\nspent on the strengthening of this commanding position; forts have\r\nbeen placed so as to confront each of the four roads by which alone\r\nthe stronghold can be passed, and it is thought that a large force\r\nof troops make it convenient to be cantoned in the vicinity, ready\r\nto make the most of the facilities for repelling intrusion when the\r\noccasion requires. They certainly could offer stubborn resistance to\r\nany junction being effected between portions of the German and Italian\r\narmies. The military Alpine roads, Furka, Ober-Alp, and Axenstrasse,\r\nare all kept in good condition by liberal appropriations.\r\n\r\nEver since 1830, when the religious refugees from France, England,\r\nand Flanders sought shelter there, and who, Sismondi relates, were\r\nwont to fall down on their knees and bless God when they came in sight\r\nof the Swiss mountains, the _right of asylum_ has been a difficult\r\nquestion for Switzerland, occasioning constant diplomatic collision.\r\nIn 1838 the demand of the French government for the expulsion of Louis\r\nNapoleon, which was declined by Switzerland, almost led to war, and\r\nit was probably only avoided by his voluntary departure. Switzerland\r\nhas never flinched from this sacred and most embarrassing duty of\r\nhospitality to the oppressed. The influx of political fugitives from\r\nthe despotic countries of Europe, seeking shelter from their pursuers,\r\nhas involved it in many a bitter discussion with powerful neighbors,\r\nbut it has stood firm in maintaining the sanctity of its principles and\r\nsoil, in the face of their overwhelming force and domineering spirit.\r\nA determined rejection of foreign interference in its domestic affairs\r\nhas been maintained, and when in 1847 the blockade or cordon was\r\nestablished, all access to the rebel district was forbidden to foreign\r\nagents. Under the constitution the federal authorities have the right\r\nto expel from Swiss territory any foreigners whose presence endangers\r\nthe internal or external security of the Confederation. An asylum is\r\noffered to the members of all parties suffering political persecution,\r\nas long as they show themselves worthy of such consideration by\r\npeaceful conduct. The republic, however, grants them no asylum, if,\r\nwhile on its territory, they continue their intrigues and attacks on\r\nthe existence and security of other states. It preserves a faithful\r\nregard for its international obligations, and, as an evidence of its\r\nfirm determination to fulfil them, keeps a federal official, known as\r\nthe _Procurator General_, whose duty it is to prosecute any foreigners,\r\nsocialists, nihilists, and _agents provocateurs_, and other dangerous\r\ntypes, who abuse the hospitality of the country for the shelter and\r\npromotion of schemes endangering either its international peace or\r\ninternal security. In July, 1890, Germany gave notice to Switzerland\r\nthat the treaty between the two countries, regulating the “settlement\r\nof foreigners,” would not be renewed at its expiration, which occurs\r\nat the end of 1891. This question of asylum involves in its handling\r\nthe utmost skill and judgment; anything like bravado or anything\r\nlike servility would be equally out of place. A dignified and wise\r\ndiscretion is necessary to enable Switzerland to continue to offer\r\na safe refuge to the proscribed victims of the endless political\r\nrevolutions and counter-revolutions of the surrounding nations, but\r\nit is believed, complicated as it is with delicate entanglements of\r\ndiplomatic relations, and suspicions of countenancing schemes of\r\nanarchy, it will continue to meet every exigency of the question with\r\nan honest and fearless policy.\r\n\r\nIf the acquisition of power has a certain tendency to weaken the ties\r\nof federal union, we should expect that a Confederacy, deprived by\r\nnatural as well as adventitious circumstances of all pretension to\r\npolitical power, would for that reason possess in a superior degree the\r\nmerit of stability. Everything that sets in motion the springs of the\r\nhuman heart, engages the Swiss to the protection of their inestimable\r\nprivileges. Bold and intrepid; a frame fitted to endure toil; a soul\r\ncapable of despising danger; an enthusiastic love of freedom; an\r\nabhorrence of the very name or emblem of royalty illustrated in ages of\r\nheroic and martial exploits, that with steadfast and daring enterprise\r\nbuilt up a nation and a state; with these qualities they will, if the\r\nnecessity comes, bear in mind the warning of their own Rousseau, “Ye\r\nfree nations, remember this maxim, freedom may be acquired, but it\r\ncannot be recovered.” In the moment of peril the Swiss will be moved\r\nby the spirit of their brave old Landammann, who answered the Duke of\r\nBurgundy: “Know that you may, if it be God’s will, gain our barren and\r\nrugged mountains; but, like our ancestors of old, we will seek refuge\r\nin wilder and more distant solitudes, and when we have resisted to the\r\nlast, we will starve in the icy wastes of the glaciers; men, women, and\r\nchildren, we will be frozen into annihilation together, ere our free\r\nSwitzer will acknowledge a foreign master.”\r\n\r\nThere may be a deeper danger awaiting Switzerland, to which no\r\nspirit, however vigorous and resolute, can be commensurate--a danger\r\nfrom within and not from without. The nation which, by the adverse\r\ncircumstances of numerical inferiority, poverty of means, or failure\r\nof enterprise, cannot sustain its own citizens in the acquisition of a\r\njust renown and material welfare, is deficient in one of the first and\r\nmost indispensable elements of strength. A small state is apt to waste\r\nits strength in acts too insignificant for general interest, frittering\r\naway its mental riches, no less than its treasure and blood, in\r\nsupporting interests that fail to enlist the sympathies of any beyond\r\nthe pale of its own borders; glory and strength, like riches, finding\r\nthemselves, and being most apt to be found, where their fruits have\r\nalready accumulated. If from any source evil should come to this little\r\nrepublic, in the patriotic words of its latest historian, “Generations\r\nwill point to the spot where it arose and flourished, and will say,\r\nHere once lived a free, self-governing people, a small but active\r\nrepublic, with remarkable institutions, with a famous and memorable\r\nhistory.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPULATION AND SOIL, CENSUS,

Incipiente mense Au-gu-sto.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATION.\r\n\r\nIN THE NAME OF THE LORD--AMEN!\r\n\r\nVirtue is promoted and utility provided for by the state so long as\r\ncovenants are firmly established with a proper basis of quiet and\r\npeace, therefore, let all men know that the valley of Uri and the\r\nentire district of the valley of Schwyz and the community of the\r\nintramontane people of the lower valley, while regarding the evil\r\ncharacter of the times, with the view of being able more efficiently\r\nto protect themselves and their interests, and better to preserve them\r\nin their proper condition, have promised in good faith mutually to\r\nstand by one another with their help, advice, and undivided support,\r\nin their persons and property, within and without the valleys, with\r\ntheir entire force and united effort against all men and singular\r\nwho shall inflict upon them or upon any one of them any violence,\r\nmolestation or injury in plotting any evil against their persons and\r\nproperty, and every district has promised to another in every event to\r\nmake haste whenever it shall be necessary to render it help. They also\r\n(have promised) at their individual expense to resist, as it shall be\r\nnecessary, the attacks of the evil-intending, to avenge wrongs, having\r\ntaken their oath corporal touching the faithful preservation of these\r\npresents from change before the ratification by oath of the instrument\r\nof Confederation. So, however, that any and every person is to be held\r\nto be subject to and to serve his Lord exactly according to the terms\r\nof his obligation. We also have promised, decided, _and more_, ordained\r\nby common resolve and unanimous assent that we will not, to any extent,\r\naccept or acknowledge any judge who shall secure the office itself at\r\nsome price, or by money, by any other device, or who shall not be one\r\nof our inhabitants or a provincial.\r\n\r\nBut if a disagreement shall arise among any of the Confederates, the\r\nmore discreet of them ought to come forward to allay the variance among\r\nthe parties just as it shall appear to them to be expedient, and the\r\nparty which shall reject the settlement _decided upon_, it were proper\r\nfor the other Confederates to be their adversaries.\r\n\r\nMoreover, above all things, it has been ordained among them that he who\r\nshall wrongfully and without provocation murder another, if he shall\r\nbe arrested, shall lose his life, as his heinous wrong-doing demands,\r\nunless he shall be able to show his innocence touching the alleged\r\ncrime, and if perchance he shall leave the country, he must never\r\nreturn, the harborers and defenders of the aforesaid malefactor are to\r\nbe cut off from the valleys until they be recalled with due foresight\r\nby the Confederates. But if any one shall in the daytime or in the\r\nsilence of night maliciously injure any one of the Confederates by\r\nburning, he ought never to be regarded as a fellow-provincial. And if\r\nany one harbors and defends the alleged evil-doer within the valleys,\r\nhe ought to render satisfaction to the person who has sustained the\r\nloss. In addition, if any one of the Confederates shall rob another of\r\nhis property or otherwise inflict loss upon him, if the property of the\r\noffending party can be found within the valleys, it ought to be held\r\nfor procuring satisfaction for the injured according to justice.\r\n\r\nMoreover no one ought to take the pledge of a second unless this one\r\nbe clearly a debtor or security, and this ought to be done only in\r\naccordance with a special license of a judge. Furthermore, any and\r\nevery one ought to obey his judge, and to indicate the very judge, if\r\nit shall be necessary, under whom he by choice assumes the obligation\r\nto obey the law. And if any one shall show himself defiant of the\r\ndecision of a judge, and in consequence of his perverseness any of the\r\nConfederates shall be damaged, all who are under oath are held to force\r\nthe aforesaid obstinate one to render satisfaction. But in case war\r\nor violent division shall arise among any of the Confederates, if one\r\nparty of the disputants is not disposed to receive the award of justice\r\nor satisfaction, the Confederates are held to defend the remaining\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nThe statutes above written are wholesomely ordained in behalf of the\r\npublic advantage with an unlimited duration, the Lord consenting\r\nthereto. As an evidence of this act the present instrument, made\r\naccording to the petition of the aforesaid persons, is confirmed by the\r\nauthority of the seals of the aforementioned districts and valleys.\r\nDone in the year of the Lord 1291, in the beginning of the month of\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe above translation was kindly made by Professor W. E. Peters, of the\r\nUniversity of Virginia, and in transmitting it he says: “I send you a\r\nliteral rendering of the Pact, the original is exceedingly rough and\r\nincorrect according to classical standards. I think, however, the sense\r\nis given. I render _vniversitas_ as district, and Commune might be\r\nembraced in brackets; I would render it _Canton_, but the Swiss Cantons\r\nwere not then formed, and the term Commune hardly expresses the sense,\r\nas it is French. I have had in some cases to force translation where\r\nthe Latin is absolutely corrupt and wrong. I have aimed to make the\r\ntranslation, as you desired, strictly according to the Latin, and not\r\naccording to what was permissible with the Latin and its collocation.”\r\n\r\nThe Honorable John D. Washburn, United States Minister at Bern, in an\r\narticle contributed to the American Antiquarian Society of Worcester,\r\nMass., April, 1890, on the “Foundation of the Swiss Republic,”\r\nreferring to the Pact of 1291, says: “The foundation stone on which\r\nit is generally understood that the whole superstructure [of the\r\nSwiss Republic] rests is known as the Pact--Letter of Alliance,\r\n_Bundesbrief_--of 1291. This is not a myth, but, apart, perhaps, from\r\nabsolute exactness of date and some extraneous circumstances alleged\r\nto attend it, a well-established record of history. This instrument\r\nwell repays a careful study, not only as a wonderfully bold declaration\r\nof modified independence at a very early day, but as especially\r\ninteresting to the American student for the remarkable parallels of\r\nthought in the minds of these ancient men, and in the minds of those\r\nwho nearly five hundred years later made the preliminary declarations\r\nof American Independence.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A.\r\n\r\n  Aar, water system of the, 415.\r\n\r\n  Aarau, peace of, 14.\r\n\r\n  Aargau admitted, 16.\r\n    conquest of, 13.\r\n\r\n  Academy,

The rights of the kings of Prussia as sovereigns date back\r\nto the cession made of it in 1707 by William of Orange to his cousin\r\nFrederick, first King of Prussia. In 1806 it was granted as a\r\nprincipality to Marshal Berthier, and so recognized by all the powers\r\nof Continental Europe. The Congress of Vienna restored it to the King\r\nof Prussia, making it, however, a Canton of the Helvetian Republic.\r\nIn 1848 a revolution forcibly overturned the authority of the King of\r\nPrussia, and it so remained, in apparent conflict to what had been\r\nformally recognized by all the Great Powers, until 1857, when a treaty\r\nwas signed between Austria, France, Prussia, Russia, Great Britain, and\r\nSwitzerland, by which it was made independent, to continue to form a\r\npart of the Swiss Confederation, by the same title as the other Cantons.\r\n\r\n[8] Rufus Choate.\r\n\r\n[9] Book xxi., ch. 31.\r\n\r\n[10] The dog Barry, one day, found a little child in a half-frozen\r\nstate; he began directly to lick him, and having succeeded first in\r\nrestoring animation, and next in the complete resuscitation of the boy,\r\nhe induced the child by his caresses to tie himself on his back. When\r\nthis was effected, he carried the poor child, as if in triumph, to the\r\nhospice. The body of Barry was stuffed and placed in the museum at\r\nBern, and may be seen there, with the little vial still hanging to his\r\nneck in which he carried a reviving drink for the perishing traveller.\r\n\r\n[11] Zwingli lost his life in 1531 in the battle of Cappel; though he\r\nfell under another banner than that of the Prince of Peace, he was\r\nacting in obedience to the law of the republic, and accompanied the\r\narmy by the express command of the magistrates. He is represented as a\r\nman of great meekness and moderation and charity, and, amidst all the\r\ndisputes, was a constant advocate for peace and reconciliation.\r\n\r\n[12] A hair-dresser of Geneva was imprisoned for arranging a bride’s\r\nhair with too much attention to vanity; and a woman was beaten for\r\nsinging secular words to a psalm-tune; men were imprisoned for reading\r\nwhat were considered profane books, and children beheaded for striking\r\na parent.\r\n\r\n[13] The old curator of the Bern Museum would say to the visitors,\r\npointing to the portrait of Voltaire, “There is the portrait of the\r\nfamous M. de Voltaire, who dared to write AGAINST THE REPUBLIC and\r\nagainst God.”\r\n\r\n[14] Professor Fiske.\r\n\r\n[15] These words, it may be remarked, are from the same root, _ligo_,\r\nto bind.\r\n\r\n[16] Agreements to furnish soldiers to foreign countries.\r\n\r\n[17] There are many provisions regulating the rights of citizens and\r\nelectors, Cantonal and Communal, which are given in Chapters 6 and 9,\r\nand “Chapter on Citizenship.”\r\n\r\n[18] It reads in the French text, “From his natural judge,” the natural\r\nor constitutional judge being the one provided by the terms of the\r\njudicial Constitution, and as contradistinguished from an exceptional\r\nCourt created after the appearance of the case to be adjudged.\r\n\r\n[19] See amendment of December, 1887.\r\n\r\n[20] See amendment of June, 1879.\r\n\r\n[21] Homeless persons, _Heimathlosen_. These comprise not only\r\nforeigners who have lost their nationality of origin without having\r\nobtained another, but also natives who are not members of any Swiss\r\nCommune.\r\n\r\n[22] The Constitutional provisions relating to these are fully given in\r\nchapters severally devoted to these Departments.\r\n\r\n[23] The Constitution is officially published in _Romansch_ and\r\n_Ladin_, in addition to the three “national languages.”\r\n\r\n[24] That the Constitution-making and amending power should be vested\r\nin a bare majority of the voting citizens, coupled with a majority\r\nof the Cantons, is considered by some as wanting in that solidity\r\nand security which are the most vital attributes of a fundamental\r\nlaw. But none of the enactments contained in the Swiss Constitution\r\ncan be legally abolished or modified without the employment of the\r\n_Referendum_. And no law which revises the Constitution, either\r\nwholly or in part, can come into force until it has been regularly\r\nsubmitted by means of the _Referendum_ to the vote of the people, and\r\nhas been approved by a majority of the citizens who on the particular\r\noccasion gave their votes, and also by a majority of the Cantons.\r\nIt is also provided, that under certain circumstances a vote of the\r\npeople shall be taken not only on the question, whether a particular\r\namendment or revision approved by the Federal Assembly shall or shall\r\nnot come into force, but also on the preliminary question whether any\r\nrevision or reform of the Constitution shall take place at all. And the\r\n_Referendum_ in all such cases, in the language of the Constitution, is\r\n“obligatory.” The self-imposed checks of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, in this respect of amendment, have been described as “obstacles\r\nin the way of the people’s whims, not of their wills.” The system\r\nof the Initiative for the Swiss constitutional revision (by 50,000\r\ncitizens), though modelled upon one of the alternative methods by which\r\namendments to the United States Constitution may be proposed, contains\r\none significant modification of it; the people in the former appear in\r\ntheir national character and independent of state lines; the same holds\r\ntrue of the ratification of amendments.\r\n\r\n[25] In 1480 fifteen hundred executions took place in Switzerland.\r\n\r\n[26] By a Federal law to carry out this amendment, the distilled\r\nliquors are sold for cash by the Confederation in _minimum_ quantity\r\nof a hundred and fifty _litres_ (0.88 quart), and the price to be\r\nfixed from time to time by the Federal Council; but it shall never be\r\nless than one hundred and twenty francs nor more than one hundred and\r\nfifty francs per _hectolitre_ (twenty-two gallons) of pure alcohol.\r\nDenaturalized spirits to be sold at cost price for technical and\r\nhousehold use.\r\n\r\n[27] The Swiss Constitution contains 7700 words and 127 articles\r\n(including temporary provisions); that of the United States, 5300\r\nwords, divided into 37 sections.\r\n\r\n[28] “American Historical Association,” vol. i., p. 37. Professor Scott.\r\n\r\n[29] It was the original purpose of the writer to include, as an\r\nappendix to this volume, a translation of the Swiss Constitution;\r\na faithful search having failed to discover any publication of it\r\nin English. But having ascertained that during the current year two\r\nsuch translations had appeared, one by Professor Edmund J. James,\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, the other by Professor Albert Bushnell\r\nHart, of Harvard, copies were obtained, and found to meet, in a most\r\nsatisfactory and excellent manner, every possible demand for such a\r\nwork. However, every important provision, and, in fact, almost the\r\ncomplete text of the Constitution, appears in the copious citations\r\nfrom it in the chapters on the Federal Departments, Cantons, Communes,\r\nand the Army.\r\n\r\n[30] John Adams, Works, iv., p. 186.\r\n\r\n[31] Previous to 1874 the members received only twelve francs a day.\r\n\r\n[32] Woodrow Wilson, “The State.”\r\n\r\n[33] Federal legislation may confer upon the Assembly the election or\r\nconfirmation of other federal officials.\r\n\r\n[34] This power was exercised in connection with the Neuchâtel\r\nrevolution of 1856, the Royalist prisoners and deserters being\r\namnestied in 1857.\r\n\r\n[35] In 1874 it was fixed by a federal law that the Assembly should\r\nconvene on the first Monday in June for the first, and on the first\r\nMonday in December for the second portion of the regular annual session.\r\n\r\n[36] The remuneration of these officials in 1848, when the system was\r\ninaugurated, was much smaller; the President receiving only 6000 francs\r\na year and each of the other members 5000 francs.\r\n\r\n[37] This election occurs during December of each year on a day agreed\r\nupon by the Assembly.\r\n\r\n[38] Although the Assembly cannot exactly turn out the members of the\r\nfederal executive during their term of office, it enjoys such extensive\r\npower of supervision and control over their acts, and, in fact,\r\nexercises so large a part of what is called executive discretion, that\r\nit can practically have very little reason for desiring to remove them.\r\n\r\n[39] “All such laws are adopted by the people, either tacitly or\r\nthrough the _referendum_; and the judiciary must submit their judgment\r\non constitutional questions to the will of the people.”--Dubs, “Das\r\nOeffentliche Recht der Schweizerischen Eidgenossenschaft.”\r\n\r\n[40] Marbury vs. Madison, 1 Cranch, 137. Mr. Madison disregarded the\r\n_obiter_ opinion of the court, and Mr. Jefferson treated it with\r\ncontempt. “The federal judges,” he said, “declared that commissions\r\nsigned and sealed by the President were valid, though not delivered.\r\nI deemed delivery essential to complete a deed, which as long as it\r\nremains in the hands of the party is as yet no deed. It is _in posse_\r\nonly but not _in esse_, and I withheld delivery of the commissions.”\r\n(Letter to Judge Roane, September 6, 1819.

They are the small\r\nCantons, and represent only twenty per cent. of the Swiss population.\r\nNo execution, however, has taken place in any of these Cantons since\r\n1879; two sentences of death have been passed, but in both cases they\r\nwere commuted to imprisonment for life.\r\n\r\n[49] Professor Dicey, “Law of the Constitution.”\r\n\r\n[50] These horns are made to imitate the human voice, and have a most\r\nmournful bellow.\r\n\r\n[51] This is done to secure religious equality and to provide for the\r\nrepresentation of the Catholic population in the Communes in which they\r\nare in the minority.\r\n\r\n[52] _Et in corruptissima republica plurimæ leges._--Tacitus.\r\n\r\n[53] Professor Dicey.\r\n\r\n[54] Numa Droz.\r\n\r\n[55] See chapter on citizenship.\r\n\r\n[56] Thomas Jefferson.\r\n\r\n[57] See chapters on “Constitution” and “Cantons.”\r\n\r\n[58] This includes, also, birth abroad of children of American citizens\r\ntemporarily residing or travelling in other countries (Rev. Stat. U.\r\nS., Sec. 1993).\r\n\r\n[59] “Citizenship of the United States,” Richman,--“Political Science\r\nQuarterly,” March, 1890.\r\n\r\n[60] “A citizen of a State is now only a citizen of the United States\r\nresiding in that State; citizenship of the United States is the primary\r\ncitizenship; State citizenship is secondary and derivative, depending\r\nupon citizenship of the United States.” (Slaughter-House cases, 16\r\nWallace.)\r\n\r\n[61] The difficulty of obtaining citizenship, at one time, in the\r\npastoral Cantons, is shown by the fact that no one had done so in lower\r\nUnterwald from 1664 to 1815.\r\n\r\n[62] The successful issue of this suit was due to the vigorous and\r\ndetermined efforts of the United States consul at Zurich, George L.\r\nCatlin.\r\n\r\n[63] These peasant proprietors do not live scattered amid the fields\r\nwhich they till, but are disposed to gather in the centre of the\r\nCommune, forming numerous small hamlets.\r\n\r\n[64] Called in the Roman law _legitima portio_, legitimate portion; but\r\nthe German law has a better designation for it,--_Pflichttheil_, duty\r\npart.\r\n\r\n[65] In the district of Saffelare, a part of East Flanders, which\r\nnature has endowed with an unproductive but easily cultivated sandy\r\nsoil, the territory is composed of 37,000 acres and has to nourish\r\n30,000 inhabitants, all living by agriculture; and yet these peasants\r\nnot only grow their own food, but they also export agricultural\r\nproduce, and pay rents to the amount of from fifteen to twenty-five\r\ndollars per acre. (Krapotkin, “The Forum,” August, 1890.)\r\n\r\n[66] In the matter of these capitulations the Cantons claimed that,\r\nfirst, they never granted troops to any prince or state but by virtue\r\nof some preceding alliance; second, they granted troops only for the\r\ndefence of the state they were given to, and not to act offensively;\r\nthird, that the sovereign never received any subsidy or other\r\nadvantages from it. The Cantons contented themselves with giving such\r\nauxiliary troops as were stipulated by their alliance and procuring\r\na beneficial service for their subjects, without reserving profit to\r\nthemselves. But in spite of the contention that these mercenaries\r\nespoused only a just quarrel, such service was a source of social no\r\nless than of political ills, and seriously impaired, for the time, the\r\ndignity and standing of the country.\r\n\r\n[67] _Primi in omnibus prœliis oculi vincuntur._--Tacitus.\r\n\r\n[68] Even the Cantons, from the first institution of their governments\r\nand up to the time the Confederation assumed control of the military\r\nservice, never kept in pay any standing troops. During the wars with\r\nthe House of Austria the service was performed by militia, who were\r\npaid by the respective Cantons while kept in the field, and dismissed\r\nas soon as the campaign was ended.\r\n\r\n[69] The minimum height for a recruit in the United States army is five\r\nfeet four inches, weight one hundred and twenty-five pounds, and chest\r\nmeasure thirty-two inches.\r\n\r\n[70] United States Revised Statutes, Sec. 1625, makes subject to\r\nenrolment in the militia “every able-bodied male citizen of the\r\nrespective States, resident therein,” etc.\r\n\r\n[71] “When the citizens of Geneva were alarmed in the night [the\r\n_Escalade_ of December 12, 1602], in the depth of winter, by the enemy,\r\nthey found their muskets sooner than their shoes.”--Rousseau.\r\n\r\n[72] The report of 1887 for the Canton of Bern gives 1,925,580 francs\r\nexpended on the cantonal and communal schools, not including the\r\nuniversity.\r\n\r\n[73] In July of this year (1890) a statue of Pestalozzi was dedicated\r\nat Yverdon, on the Lake of Neuchâtel, for it was there that, after\r\nmany struggles with adversity, he founded, at the beginning of this\r\ncentury, the school which was perhaps more deeply and lastingly useful\r\nthan any school that ever existed, by spreading the educational tenets\r\nand methods of its famous master throughout Europe, and later across\r\nto America, with contagious force. The unveiling of the monument was\r\naccompanied with a _Cantate patriotique_ by a choir of a thousand\r\nchildren. The statue represents Pestalozzi with a boy and girl whom he\r\nis instructing by his side, and bears the simple inscription, “Henry\r\nPestalozzi, 1746-1827. Monument erected by general subscription 1890.”\r\n\r\n[74] The University of Geneva, at the close of the last century,\r\nknown as the College of Geneva, and which exerted a wide influence in\r\nEurope, being temporarily suppressed during the revolution which had\r\ntaken place, proposed, through its faculty, the transplanting of the\r\ncollege in a body to the United States. To Washington, who had in view\r\nthe devoting of a quite large amount of money to the founding, or to\r\nthe support, of institutions of learning, Jefferson wrote a letter\r\non February 23, 1795, in which he laid before him the plan for the\r\ntransferring of this institution to the national capital; and in the\r\nletter Jefferson characterized the College of Geneva as one of the eyes\r\nof Europe in matters of science, the University of Edinburgh being the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n[75] Zurich has made its city forest, the _Sihl-Wald_, a great public\r\npleasure-ground that pays large sums annually into the city treasury,\r\nbesides yielding inestimable dividends in the shape of health and\r\nhappiness to the citizens. This forest has been owned by Zurich ever\r\nsince 1309, and has been carefully administered for centuries, and is\r\nnow managed on the most approved scientific principles by corps of\r\ntrained foresters. Last year the net profits were something over eight\r\ndollars an acre, or a total of about twenty thousand dollars, for the\r\ncity treasury. Half the annual yield of wood is from thinnings alone.\r\nIn the economic treatment of the forest, its value as a pleasure-ground\r\nis not forgotten; the landscape is preserved unharmed, and the place\r\nmade thoroughly and pleasantly accessible.\r\n\r\n[76] Early in the seventeenth century a king of Spain came to see a\r\nclock which had been made by Jacques Droz, who resided at Locle, and\r\nwhose automatons were much noted. Upon the clock there were seated\r\na shepherd, a negro, and a dog. As the hour was struck the shepherd\r\nplayed upon his flute, and the dog fondled gently at his feet. But when\r\nthe king reached forth to touch an apple that hung from a tree under\r\nwhich the shepherd rested, the dog flew at him and barked so furiously\r\nthat a live dog in the street answered him. One of the courtiers of the\r\nking ventured to ask the negro, in Spanish, what time it was. There was\r\nno reply, but when the question was repeated in French, an answer was\r\ngiven. All of them at once voted that the clock was the work of an evil\r\none.\r\n\r\n[77] It is estimated that 200 francs’ worth of steel will make 525,000\r\nfrancs’ worth of common watch-springs.\r\n\r\n[78] On the new federal palace at Bern, in progress of construction in\r\n1890, men were employed to act as turnspits, in immense wheels, for\r\nelevating the large blocks of stone.\r\n\r\n[79] Adams and Cunningham, “The Swiss Confederation.”\r\n\r\n[80] The _Fête des Vignerons_, which occurs once in fifteen years\r\nat one of the villages on the Lake of Geneva, is the most brilliant\r\nfestival held in Switzerland, and is accompanied with all the light,\r\njoyous mirth of the ancient Bacchanalian festivals. It is graphically\r\ndescribed in Cooper’s “Headsman.”\r\n\r\n[81] The word _Alp_ is a provincialism, and means an elevated pasture,\r\nand hence the name of the mountains on which the pastures exist.\r\n\r\n[82] Liquid manure fills an important part in the economy of Swiss\r\nhusbandry, under the name of _Jouche_ or _Mist-Wasser_ in the German\r\nCantons, and of _Lisier_ in the French Cantons. They collect in large\r\ncasks the drainage of their manure-piles, stables, and hog-pens, and\r\nbring it in carts to the fields, where it is drawn off into wooden tubs\r\nfitted to the shoulders of men, and sometimes of women, who, walking\r\nalong the furrows, distribute it in due proportion to each plant, by\r\nstooping to the right and left, the coffee-colored nectar pouring over\r\ntheir heads. It would be impossible to perform an uncleanly task in a\r\nmore delicate manner.\r\n\r\n[83] The great projector did not live to see the accomplishment of his\r\ngrand work.\r\n\r\n[84] The construction of the St. Gothard railway stopped this indemnity.\r\n\r\n[85] A report, made in connection with the Swiss National Exhibition\r\nof 1883, calculated that up to 1880, 1002 inns had been built for the\r\nspecial use of travellers, and that they contained 58,137 beds, an\r\naverage of 58 apiece. The capital value of the land, buildings, and\r\nfurniture belonging to these was estimated at 320,000,000 francs; the\r\ngross profits on which were 53,000,000 francs, or seventeen per cent.;\r\nthis was reduced by deduction of working expenses to 16,000,000 francs,\r\nor five per cent. Of these 1002 inns no fewer than 283 are situated in\r\npositions above three thousand four hundred feet, and 14 are actually\r\nabove six thousand five hundred and sixty-two feet in elevation.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland only became a “play-ground” within the last century. The\r\nfirst English guide-book appeared in 1818, by Daniel Wall, of London.\r\nThe first of any kind was published in 1684, by Wagner, a Zurich\r\nnaturalist, and called “_Index Memorabilium Helvetiæ_.”\r\n\r\n[86] Ruskin.\r\n\r\n[87] When these storms break upon the mountain, be it night or day, the\r\nbells of the village churches are vigorously rung to exorcise the evil\r\none, and bring the pious villagers on their knees in prayer.\r\n\r\n[88] These are made of maple, linden, and pine by the shepherds\r\nthemselves, who bestow much time on their manufacture. The ladles are\r\nmade in the shape of shells. The milk-strainer, the measures, and the\r\nmilk-hods are all elegantly shaped and very clean.\r\n\r\n[89] The chamois is a small species of antelope, somewhat resembling a\r\ngoat. Its hoofs are remarkably cloven, with a protruding border, which\r\nenables it to climb almost perpendicular declivities. Its muscular\r\npower is great: it can leap chasms twenty feet wide, and jump down\r\nrocks the same distance to platforms with only just room enough for its\r\nfour hoofs. In the autumn, when strongest and fattest, it is black, in\r\nthe early spring gray, and in the summer red.\r\n\r\n[90] It measures four and one-half feet in length and nine to ten feet\r\nfrom wing to wing extended, weighs as much as twenty pounds, and is of\r\na rusty brown color. It is a fierce enemy of sheep, goats, dogs, hares,\r\netc., and has been known to carry off young children.\r\n\r\n[91] The Swiss infant is bandaged into a large piece of cloth,--to\r\nbe kept straight, it is explained,--and resembles a pappoose. In the\r\ncountry churches can be seen old paintings of the Virgin holding the\r\ninfant Christ swathed in just the same manner.\r\n\r\n[92] A French writer, Picot, went so far as to say of the peasants of\r\nValais: “The Valaisans, far from desiring to attract attention from the\r\nworld, are jealous of their obscurity, of their ignorance, and even of\r\ntheir poverty, which they believe essential to their happiness.” Many\r\nlocalities have their written existence in song or story. The words of\r\nthe Vaudois poet, Juste Olivier, “_Vivons de notre vie_,” have sunk\r\ninto the hearts of a number of writers who, under their own public\r\nalone, are cherishing and seeking to reproduce the life about them,\r\ndwelling especially upon those local and traditional phases which they\r\nfeel daily to be giving way before the march of progress.\r\n\r\n[93] The winds, refrigerated in their passage over fields of ice and\r\nsnow, meet there a warm aerial current coming from the plains of Italy.\r\n\r\n[94] Longfellow’s “Hyperion.”\r\n\r\n[95] Virgil.\r\n\r\n[96] The Rhone is made to serve useful as well as æsthetic purposes;\r\nthe great water-power of this river has been utilized by diverting that\r\npart passing on the left of the island into a canal, which conducts the\r\nwater into a building containing twenty turbines, with four thousand\r\nfour hundred net horse-power; this power is utilized in a variety of\r\nways, from running sewing-machines to supplying power for an electric\r\nlight plant; it is an enterprise very profitable to the municipality of\r\nGeneva.\r\n\r\n[97] See Chapter on “Constitution.”\r\n\r\n[98] In the Canton of Vaud, a short distance back from the lake is\r\n_Avanche_ or _Avanches_, the ancient capital of Helvetia; near this\r\nplace the Helvetians were defeated by one of Vitellius’s lieutenants,\r\nand “many thousand were slain and many sold as slaves, and after\r\ncommitting great ravages the army marched in order of battle to\r\n_Aventicum_, the capital of the country.” (Tacitus.)\r\n\r\n[99] The first steamer on a Swiss lake was the “Guillaume Tell,” in\r\n1823, on the Lake of Geneva.\r\n\r\n[100] Whirlwinds of snow, or _tourmentes_ (known in the Grisons), are\r\ntossed aloft by the gale, like the sandy vortices of Africa formed by\r\nthe simoom; they are dangerous by blinding the traveller and effacing\r\nthe track.\r\n\r\n[101] On this passage of Helvetian history, there is a poem of\r\nexquisite beauty, by Mrs. Hemans, the “Record of Woman:”\r\n\r\n  “Werner sat beneath the linden tree,\r\n    That sent its lulling whispers through his door,\r\n  Even as man sits, whose heart alone would be\r\n    With some deep care, and thus can find no more\r\n  The accustomed joy in all which evening brings,\r\n  Gathering a household with her quiet wings.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[102] This place is evidently a fragment, some seventy-five or one\r\nhundred acres, that has fallen from the mountain, and, lying between\r\nthe lake and the rocks, it offered a good point of rendezvous.\r\n\r\n[103] It is a curious fact that Schiller made Franz, the hero of his\r\n“Robbers,” say, “In order to become a finished rascal one must have a\r\ncertain national bent; he must live in a certain climate and breathe a\r\ncertain rascally atmosphere; so I advise you to go into the Grisons,\r\nfor that is, in these days, the Athens of pickpockets.” Schiller\r\nwas obliged to apologize, the Council of the Leagues threatening to\r\nwithhold the money they had promised to lend the Duke of Wurtemberg if\r\nthe offending poet was not punished; he also received an order “never\r\nto write more of the same.”\r\n\r\n[104] In 1796 there appeared in New York an opera in three acts,\r\nadapted by William Dunlap from a dramatic performance published in\r\nLondon in 1794, called “Helvetic Liberty.”\r\n\r\n[105] A rude weapon much used by the early Swiss, consisting of a club\r\nending in a massive knob, with spikes protruding in every direction so\r\nas to suggest the name of “morning star.”\r\n\r\n[106] Although it is alleged that five similar feats to Winkelried’s\r\nare on record in Swiss history, only one is recognized and commemorated\r\nby the Swiss. In the village square of Stantz is a marble group\r\nrepresenting Arnold Winkelried in the act of pressing the Austrian\r\nspears into his heart and holding them down, while a second figure\r\npushes forward to take advantage of the gap.\r\n\r\n[107] The Æneid, vi. 660.\r\n\r\n[108] At the art exhibition held in Bern this year (1890) there were\r\nforty plaster models of statues of William Tell competing for the\r\none it is proposed to erect at Altdorf, 150,000 francs having been\r\nappropriated for that purpose.\r\n\r\n[109] Lamartine.\r\n\r\n[110] The Aar is perhaps the most interesting water system in\r\nSwitzerland, especially if we include its great tributaries, the\r\nReuss and the Limmat. Rising among the metamorphic wilds of the\r\nFinsteraarhorn, thundering through the granitic dikes of the Grimsel,\r\nbreaking its way to the Handeck, and plunging in mad career over the\r\nfalls, it dashes on to the clear profound of Brienz, to the softer\r\nbeauties of Interlaken and Thun, and, after watering the fertile\r\ntable-lands of Bern, receives the sister waters of the Reuss and\r\nLimmat, which it carries, in one dark-green flood, into the main artery\r\nof the Rhine.\r\n\r\n[111] The market for fowls has one feature worthy of imitation\r\neverywhere. In the centre of it stands a man with a miniature\r\nguillotine, who for one centime (a fifth of a cent) will behead the\r\nfowl, and it is done deftly and free of all bloody exposures; the\r\nfowl is firmly held and muffled to prevent outcry, the decapitation\r\ninstantaneous, the falling of the head and bleeding concealed, and when\r\nlife is extinct and flow of blood ceases, the fowl is nicely wrapped\r\nin paper by the executioner and replaced in the market-basket; it is\r\ncertainly a humane substitute for wringing off the neck.\r\n\r\n[112] Means weather-peak, and it is an established barometer in its\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\n[113] The western wing of the Bernese Alps presents broad pyramidal\r\nmasses of a flattened character. The eastern wing exhibits a complete\r\ncontrast in its tapering obelisks and rocky minarets, in its serrated\r\ncrests and numerous horns.\r\n\r\n[114] _Alpenglühen_, or sunset-glow, is an exception to the general\r\nlaws governing the disappearance of the sunlight by the gradual rise\r\nof the earth’s shadow; it is a kind of second or after-coloring in the\r\nsnowy masses, making them stand out from the dark background, though\r\nthe general light is constantly diminishing. The peaks are illuminated\r\ntill the sun is from 20° to 30° below the horizon; then the general\r\nclearness diminishes, but on the western horizon is a clear segment\r\nof 8° to 10°; but as the air has much less reflecting power than the\r\nsnowy mountains, the latter begin to be lighted up again. This second\r\nlighting may be so great that the mountains appear to be actually\r\nilluminated by the sun.\r\n\r\n[115] Since this was written and placed in the hands of the publishers\r\nCongress has passed and the President approved a copyright bill,\r\naimed at securing reciprocal protection to American and foreign\r\nauthors in the respective countries which may comply with its\r\nprovisions. While the measure which has become a law is not entirely\r\nsatisfactory to the friends of international copyright, and must be\r\nregarded as experimental as to its ultimate results or workings, all\r\nof its advocates feel that it is a huge instalment of justice, and\r\na gratifying victory gained for the indorsement of the principle of\r\ninternational copyright. In answer to an inquiry addressed to Mr. A.\r\nR. Spofford, Librarian of Congress, as to the effect of the law on the\r\nrelation of the United States to the Bern Convention, he has kindly\r\nmade the following statement: “Under the rather uncertain (not to say\r\nambiguous) meaning of Sec. 13 of the Act of March 3, 1891, two things\r\nseem to be necessary before a foreigner can be entitled to copyright\r\nin the United States: (1) His government must be one that already\r\ngrants copyright to Americans (by law or international agreement) on\r\nthe same terms as to its own people; (2) the President must certify by\r\nproclamation the fact just cited.\r\n\r\n“Whether the new law was intended to be at once applicable to the\r\nauthors of all nations who were parties to the Berne Convention of\r\n1885-86; whether the Executive of the United States has authority now\r\nto accede to this convention, and join the International Union under\r\nthe provisions of Article XVIII.; whether this would require the\r\nconcurrent action of the President and Senate; or, finally, whether\r\nan act of Congress would be required (as Great Britain had to pass\r\nan act through Parliament to make that country a party to the Berne\r\nInternational Union), all these appear to me to be open questions,\r\nowing to lack of precision in the Act of March 3, which was passed in\r\na crowded state of the public business, and not fully digested by a\r\ncommittee, especially with regard to the Berne Convention.”\r\n\r\n[116] An international arbitration agreement has been drafted by the\r\nnations of North, South, and Central America, and a copy has been sent\r\nto each European government, extending an invitation to signify their\r\nadherence to its provisions. The President of the Swiss Confederation\r\nhas submitted to the Federal Assembly this pan-American treaty, with a\r\nrecommendation that Switzerland accept the invitation given by the late\r\nInternational American Conference.\r\n\r\n[117] Adams and Cunningham, “Swiss Confederation.”\r\n\r\n[118] Though without a sea-coast or a ship, Switzerland has recognized\r\nrights even on the sea as a neutral nation; the treaty of Paris of 1856\r\nrespecting neutral flags, neutral goods on vessels of belligerents, and\r\nblockades, was also entered into by the Swiss government in the same\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n[119] A hide cut into shoe strings was made to surround a principality\r\nunder a bargain to buy,--_Taurino quantum possent circumdare tergo._\r\n\r\n[120] The annexation of Alsace-Lorraine was really a violation of what\r\nis the sound basis of the principle of the sacredness of nationalities;\r\na violation of the sacredness of self-government.\r\n\r\n[121] This term is employed to denote the seven nations which were\r\nparties to the Treaty of Berlin,--viz., England, France, Germany,\r\nAustria-Hungary, Russia, Italy, and Turkey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Notes\r\n\r\nObvious typographical errors have been silently corrected.
