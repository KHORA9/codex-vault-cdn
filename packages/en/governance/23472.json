Even in the pages of\r\nGibbon one might look in vain for the story of a reign thus singularly\r\ndarkened in its earliest chapters.  George the Fourth had hardly gone\r\nthrough the State ceremonials which asserted his royal position when he\r\nwas seized by a sudden illness so severe that, for a while, the nerves\r\nof the country were strained by the alarm which seemed to tell that a\r\ngrave would have to be dug for the new King before the body of the late\r\nsovereign had grown quite cold in the royal vault.  It would be idle,\r\nat this time of day, to affect any serious belief that the grief of the\r\nBritish people at this sudden taking off, had it come to pass, would\r\nhave exceeded any possibility of consolation.  George the Fourth was an\r\nelderly personage when he came to the throne, he had been known to his\r\nsubjects as a deputy King for many years, his mode of living had long\r\nbeen a familiar subject of scandal among all classes of his people, and\r\nno one could have supposed that the prosperity of the country {2}\r\ndepended to any measurable extent on the continuance of his life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1820--Lord Liverpool's Administration]\r\n\r\nGeorge, however, recovered.  His illness proved therefore to be only\r\none among the unpropitious conditions which accompanied the dawn of his\r\nreign.  Almost the next thing that was heard of him by the outer world\r\nwas that he had inaugurated his work of government by calling on his\r\nministers to assist him in obtaining a divorce from his wife.  Not\r\noften, it must be admitted, has a sovereign just succeeding to a throne\r\nthus celebrated his attainment of regal rank.  Then, again, the\r\nbeginning of George the Fourth's reign was immediately followed by the\r\nexplosion of a conspiracy belonging to an order uncommon indeed in the\r\nEngland of those days, almost wholly unknown to the England of our own\r\ntime, and resembling in its principal characteristics some of the\r\nNihilist or Anarchist enterprises common even still in certain parts of\r\nthe European continent.  Thus opened the first chapter of the reign of\r\nKing George the Fourth.  We shall have to go more fully into details,\r\nand we only print these few lines as what used to be called in former\r\ndays the argument of our first chapters.\r\n\r\nGeorge was too unwell to stand by his father's bedside when the poor\r\nold King was passing, at last, out of that life which had so long been\r\none of utter darkness to him.  George, the son, had taken cold in his\r\nbeloved pavilion at Brighton, and the cold soon developed into an\r\nillness so serious that for some days it was believed the now King was\r\ndestined to succeed his father in the grave almost as soon as he had\r\nsucceeded him in the sovereignty.  George's life of excesses had not,\r\nhowever, completely worn out the fine constitution with which nature\r\nhad originally endowed him, and despite the kind of medical treatment\r\nfavored at that time, the old familiar panacea, which consisted mainly\r\nin incessant bleeding, the King recovered.  He was soon able to receive\r\nthe official addresses of loyalty, to despatch to Louis the Eighteenth\r\nand other European sovereigns his formal announcement of the fact that\r\nhe had succeeded to the throne, his formal expressions of grief at {3}\r\nthe loss of his beloved father, and his formal assurances of his\r\nresolve to do all he could to maintain harmonious relations with the\r\nrulers of foreign States.  He retained the ministers whom he had found\r\nin office, and who were, of course, his own ministers.  Lord Liverpool\r\nwas Prime Minister, Lord Eldon was Lord Chancellor, Lord Palmerston was\r\none of the younger members of the administration.\r\n\r\nThe times were troublous.  Lord Liverpool's long tenure of office had\r\nbeen marked, so far as foreign affairs were concerned, by a resolute\r\nhostility to every policy and all movements which tended in a\r\nrevolutionary direction, and to Lord Liverpool and his closest\r\ncolleagues the whole principle of popular liberty was merely the\r\nprinciple of revolution.  In home affairs Lord Liverpool had always\r\nidentified himself with systems of political repression, systems which\r\nwere established on the theory that whenever there was any talk of\r\npopular grievance the only wise and just course was to put in prison\r\nthe men from whose mouths such talk came forth.  On financial questions\r\nLord Liverpool appears to have entertained some enlightened views,\r\nviews that were certainly in advance of the political economy professed\r\nby most of his colleagues, but where distinctly political controversy\r\ncame up he may be taken as a fair illustration of the old-fashioned\r\nTory statesmanship.  Eldon, the Lord Chancellor, had a great deal of\r\nshrewdness in his mental constitution, a shrewdness which very often\r\ntook the form of selfishness; and although he exhibited himself for the\r\nmost part as a genuine Tory, one is inclined to doubt whether he did\r\nnot now and then indulge in a secret chuckle at the expense of those\r\namong his colleagues who really believed that the principles of\r\nold-fashioned Toryism were the only sound principles of government.\r\n\r\nThe first business of State into which the new sovereign threw his\r\nwhole heart and soul was the endeavor to solemnize the opening of his\r\nreign by obtaining a divorce from his wife.  He went to work at once\r\nwith the set purpose of inducing his ministers to lend him their aid in\r\nthe {4} attainment of this great object.  Lord Eldon was more\r\nespecially in his confidence, and with him George had many private\r\ninterviews and much exchange of letters on the subject which then\r\nengrossed his attention.  He accomplished his object so far that it was\r\narranged to leave the name of his wife out of the Royal Liturgy.  But\r\neven to set on foot the formal proceedings for a divorce proved a much\r\nmore difficult piece of business.  Pliant as the ministers were,\r\ninclined to be abject as some of them were in their anxiety to please\r\ntheir royal master, yet the men with whom George especially consulted\r\ncould not shrink from impressing on his notice some of the obstacles\r\nwhich stood in the way of his obtaining his heart's desire.  One of the\r\nmain difficulties consisted in the fact that a great part of the\r\nevidence given against George's unhappy consort during the former\r\ninvestigations had been given by a class of witnesses upon whose\r\nstatement it would be impossible for any regularly constituted court of\r\nlaw to place much reliance.  Again and again in the correspondence\r\nwhich passed between the King and some of his ministers this weakness\r\nof his case is pointed out, and it is somewhat curious to find so\r\ncomplete a recognition of it by his advisers when we bear in mind what\r\nthey had sanctioned before and were to sanction later on.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1820--Queen Caroline]\r\n\r\nThe Queen herself was on the Continent, and was threatening her\r\nimmediate return to her husband's country unless some settlement was\r\nmade with her which should secure her ample means of living and allow\r\nher to be formally recognized abroad as the wife of King George.  Henry\r\nBrougham was acting as the Queen's principal adviser at home, and was\r\ndoing his best to bring about some sort of compromise which might\r\nresult in the Queen's accepting a quiet and informal separation on fair\r\nand reasonable terms.  George, however, was not inclined to listen to\r\nconditions of compromise.  He wanted to get rid of his Queen once for\r\nall, to be publicly and completely divorced from her, to be free from\r\neven a nominal association with her; and he was not inclined to accept\r\nany terms which merely secured him against the chance of her {5} ever\r\nagain appearing within his sight.  Brougham was disposed, and even\r\ndetermined, to do all he could for the unhappy Caroline, although now\r\nand then in one of his characteristic bursts of ill-temper he used to\r\nrail against the trouble she gave him by her impatient desire to rush\r\nback to England and make her appeal to public opinion there.  There was\r\na great deal of negotiation between the advisers on both sides, and the\r\nfinal offer made on the part of the King was that the Queen should have\r\nan allowance of 52,000 pounds a year--not, one would have thought, a\r\nvery illiberal allowance for the daughter of a small German prince--and\r\nthat she should be allowed to retain her titles, and should be\r\nauthorized to use them at foreign courts, but that her name was not to\r\nappear in the Liturgy, and that she was not to appear officially in\r\nEngland as the wife of the sovereign.  These terms were offered much\r\nagainst the will of the King himself, who still yearned for the\r\ndivorce, the whole divorce, and nothing but the divorce.  George\r\nyielded, however, to the urgent advice of his ministers, with the\r\nstrong hope and belief still in his own heart that Caroline would not\r\naccept the conditions, and would insist upon presenting herself in\r\nEngland and asserting her position as Queen.\r\n\r\nThe Queen, meanwhile, had left Rome, where she had been staying for\r\nsome time and where she complained of the want of deference shown to\r\nher by the Papal authorities.  She was hurrying back to England, and\r\nhad written to Brougham requesting him to meet her at Saint Omer, and\r\nthere accordingly Brougham met her.  Whether he was very urgent in his\r\nadvice to her to accept the terms it is not easy to know; but, at all\r\nevents, it is quite certain that she refused point-blank to make any\r\nconcessions, that she left Brougham with positive abruptness, and\r\nhastened on her way to England.  Among her most confidential advisers\r\nwas Alderman Wood, the head of a great firm in the City of London, a\r\nleading man in the corporation of the City, and a member of the House\r\nof Commons.  Many eminent Englishmen--among whom were Wilberforce,\r\nCanning, and Denman, afterwards Lord Chief Justice--were {6} were warm\r\nsupporters of her cause, for the good reason that they sincerely\r\nbelieved her to be innocent of the more serious charges against her and\r\ndeeply wronged by the conduct of the King.  Even her most resolute\r\nenemies had to admit that whether her conduct in thus rushing back to\r\nEngland and forcing herself on public notice were wise or unwise, from\r\nthe worldly point of view, it certainly seemed at least like the\r\nconduct of a woman proudly conscious of her own innocence, and\r\ndetermined to accept no compromise which might put her in the position\r\nof a pardoned sinner.  The nearer she came to England the more cordial\r\nwere the expressions of sympathy she received, and from the moment she\r\nlanded on English shores her way to London became like a triumphal\r\nprocession.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1820--The King's divorce proceedings]\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the King and his ministers had come to an agreement\r\nwhich was exactly what the King had struggled for from the first, an\r\nagreement that steps should be taken in the ordinary way, according to\r\nthe legal conditions then existing, for the purpose of obtaining a\r\ndivorce.  The course to be adopted was to bring in a Divorce Bill, and\r\nendeavor to have it passed through both Houses of Parliament.  The\r\nproceedings were to open in the House of Lords, and the Queen's leading\r\ndefenders--for her cause was of course to be defended by counsel as in\r\nan ordinary court of law--were Brougham and Denman.  The Queen's\r\narrival in London was a signal for the most tumultuous demonstrations\r\nof popular devotion and favor towards her, and popular anger, and even\r\nfury, against all who were supposed to be her enemies.  The house in\r\nwhich she took up her abode was constantly surrounded by vast throngs\r\nof her sympathizers, and she used to have to make her appearance at the\r\nwindows at frequent intervals and bow her acknowledgments to the crowds\r\nbelow.  Sometimes the zeal of her admirers found a different way of\r\nexpressing itself, and the window-panes of many houses were broken\r\nbecause the residents were known to be on the side of the King and not\r\nof the Queen.  Conspicuous public men who were known, or were believed,\r\nto have taken part against her were mobbed in the streets, and even the\r\nDuke {7} of Wellington himself was more than once the object of a\r\nhostile demonstration.  So widely spread, so deeply penetrating was the\r\nfeeling in favor of the Queen that it was said to have found its way\r\neven into the ranks of the army, and it was believed that some soldiers\r\nof regiments quartered in London itself were to be found carousing to\r\nthe health of Queen Caroline.  A crowd of Italian witnesses had been\r\nbrought over to bear evidence against the Queen, and these foreign\r\ninvaders, nearly all of humble rank, had to be sheltered in buildings\r\nspecially erected for their protection in the near neighborhood of\r\nWestminster Hall, and had to be immured and guarded as if they were\r\nmalefactors awaiting trial and likely to escape, in order that they\r\nmight be safe from the outbreaks of popular indignation.\r\n\r\nIt told heavily for the case of the Queen, in the minds of all\r\nreasonable and impartial people, that while the King's foreign\r\nwitnesses were drawn for the most part from a class of persons who\r\nmight be supposed easily open to subornation and corruption, a great\r\nnumber of distinguished men and women came from various parts of Europe\r\nin which the Queen had resided to give evidence in her favor, and to\r\nspeak highly of her character and her conduct.  The manner in which the\r\nproceedings against the Queen were pressed on by the Ministry had one\r\nimmediate result to their disadvantage by depriving them of the\r\nservices of George Canning, then one of the most rising of European\r\nstatesmen.  Canning was strongly impressed with a belief in the Queen's\r\ninnocence and he could not consent to become one of her formal public\r\naccusers, which he must have done were he to remain a member of the\r\nadministration.  Canning, therefore, after a time, gave up his place as\r\na member of the Government, and he left the work of the prosecution, as\r\nit may be called, to be carried on by men less chivalrous and less\r\nscrupulous.  It is not necessary to go at any length into the story of\r\nthe proceedings before the House of Lords.  These proceedings would\r\nhave been made memorable, if there were nothing else to make them so,\r\nby the speeches which Brougham and {8} Denman delivered in defence of\r\nthe Queen.  Never perhaps in the course of history have the ears of a\r\nmonarch's advisers been made to tingle by such sentences of magnificent\r\nand scathing denunciation poured out in arraignment of the monarch's\r\npersonal conduct.  Denman, indeed, incurred the implacable hostility of\r\nGeorge because, in the course of his speech, he introduced a famous\r\ncitation from Roman history which, although intended to tell heavily\r\nagainst the King, was mistakenly believed by some of the King's friends\r\nto convey a much darker and deeper imputation on the sovereign than\r\nthat which was really in Denman's mind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1821--Queen Caroline and the King's coronation]\r\n\r\nThe case may be briefly said to have broken down.  In the House of\r\nLords, where the friends of the sovereign were most powerful, there was\r\nonly a majority of nine for the third reading of the Bill of Divorce,\r\nand the Bill if persevered in would yet have to encounter the House of\r\nCommons.  The Government, therefore, made up their minds to abandon the\r\nproceedings, and thereupon the friends of the Queen exulted\r\ntumultuously over the victory they had won.  But the struggle was not\r\nby any means at an end.  The royal coronation had yet to come, and the\r\nKing was anxious that the ceremonial should be got through at as early\r\na date as possible.  The Queen announced her determination to present\r\nherself on the Day of Coronation and claim her right to be crowned as\r\nQueen Consort of George the Fourth.  Then the advisers on both sides\r\nwent to work anew with the vain hope of bringing about something like a\r\ncompromise which might save the sovereign, the Court, and the country\r\nfrom scandalous and tumultuous scenes.  Again the Queen was offered the\r\nallowance which had been tendered to her before, on the old conditions\r\nthat she would behave quietly and keep herself out of sight.  Again she\r\ninsisted that her name must be included in the Royal Liturgy, and again\r\nthe King announced his resolve to make no such concession.  Then the\r\nQueen once more made it known that her resolve was final, and that she\r\nwould present herself at Westminster Abbey on the Coronation Day.\r\nGeorge had been advised {9} that all historical precedents warranted\r\nhim in maintaining that the King had an absolute right to direct the\r\nforms of the ceremonial to be used on such an occasion, and he declared\r\nthat he would not allow the Queen to take any part in the solemnity or\r\neven to be present during its performance.  The Queen wrote letters to\r\nthe King which she sent to him through his Prime Minister, Lord\r\nLiverpool.  George sent back the letters unopened to Lord Liverpool,\r\nwith the announcement that the King would read no letter addressed to\r\nhim by the Queen, and would only communicate with her through the\r\nordinary official medium of one of his ministers.\r\n\r\nThe letters thus written on both sides have long since been published,\r\nand the perusal of them will probably impress most readers with the\r\nidea of a certain sincerity on the part of both the principal writers,\r\nthe King and Queen.  Let us speak as harshly and as justly as we may of\r\nthe King's general conduct, of his mode of living, and of the manner in\r\nwhich he had always treated the Queen, we shall find it hard not to\r\nbelieve that there was in the depth of George's mind a fixed conviction\r\nthat he had real cause of complaint against his unhappy wife.  Let us,\r\non the other hand, give the fullest recognition to the fact that\r\nalthough the scandalous levities in the conduct of the Queen abroad\r\ntold heavily against her, we are none the less compelled to admit that\r\nher letters to the King, and her demand to be included in the\r\nCoronation ceremonies, seemed to be part of the conduct of a woman who\r\nwill not and cannot admit that she has done anything to forfeit her\r\nplace at her husband's side.\r\n\r\nThe whole story seems now so preposterously out of keeping with all the\r\nassociations of a modern Court that it startles our sense of historical\r\ncredibility when we find by the actual dates that men and women are\r\nstill living who might have been carried by their nurses to see the\r\ncrowds round Westminster Abbey on the Coronation Day of King George the\r\nFourth.  The Coronation took place on July 19, 1821, and the whole\r\nceremony was got up in the most costly, the most gorgeous, and, as it\r\nwould seem now {10} to a calm and critical reader of history, in the\r\nmost theatrical style.  The poor Queen did, indeed, make an attempt to\r\ntake the place which she claimed in the performances at Westminster\r\nAbbey.  \"It was natural,\" says Miss Martineau, \"that one so long an\r\noutcast and at length borne back into social life by the sympathies of\r\na nation should expect too much from these sympathies and fail to stop\r\nat the right point in her demands.\"  Miss Martineau adds, however, and\r\nher words will carry with them the feelings of every reader now, \"It\r\nwould have been well if the Queen had retired into silence after the\r\ngrant of her annuity and the final refusal to insert her name in the\r\nLiturgy.\"  The Queen, of course, failed to obtain an entrance to\r\nWestminster Abbey.  It had been arranged by orders of the King that no\r\none was to be allowed admission, even to look on at the ceremonial,\r\nwithout a ticket officially issued and properly accredited with the\r\nname of the bearer.  The Queen, therefore, was allowed to pass through\r\nthe crowded streets, but when she came to the doors of the Abbey the\r\nsoldiers on guard asked for her ticket of admission, and of course she\r\nhad none to present.  Some of the friends who accompanied her\r\nindignantly asked the soldiers whether they did not recognize their\r\nQueen, the Queen of England; but the officers in command replied that\r\ntheir orders were strict, and the unhappy Caroline Amelia was literally\r\nturned away from the Abbey door.  The King had accomplished his object.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1821--Death of Queen Caroline]\r\n\r\nThe poor woman's story comes to an end very soon.  On August 2, only a\r\nfew days after the Coronation, it was made known to the public that the\r\nQueen was seriously ill.  She was suffering, it appears, from internal\r\ninflammation, and the anxieties, the excitements, the heart burnings,\r\nthe various agonies of emotion she had lately been undergoing must have\r\nleft her poorly prepared.  On August 7 her condition became so alarming\r\nto those around her that it was thought right to warn her of her\r\ndanger.  She quietly said that she had no wish to live, that she hoped\r\nnot to suffer much bodily pain in dying, but that she could leave life\r\nwithout the least regret.  She {11} died that day, having lived more\r\nthan fifty-two years.  It was her singular fate, however, that even in\r\nher death, which otherwise must have brought so much relief, she became\r\na new source of trouble to her royal husband.  George had made up his\r\nmind to pay a visit after his coronation to his subjects in Ireland, to\r\n\"the long cherished isle which he loved,\" as Byron says, \"like his\r\nbride.\"  He had got as far as Holyhead on his way when the news reached\r\nhim of the Queen's illness, and he thought that it would be hardly\r\nbecoming for him to make his first public appearance in Ireland at such\r\na moment, and to run the risk, perhaps, of having his royal entrance\r\ninto Dublin accompanied by the news that his Queen had just died.\r\nThen, when the news of her death did actually reach him, it was still\r\nnecessary to make some little delay--joy bells and funeral bells do not\r\nring well together--and thus George, even as a widower, found his wife\r\nstill a little in the way.  The remains of Caroline Amelia were carried\r\nback to her native Brunswick, and there ended her melancholy story.  It\r\nis impossible not to regard this unhappy woman as the victim, in great\r\nmeasure, of the customs which so often compel princes and princesses to\r\nleave reciprocal love out of the conditions of marriage.  \"The birds\r\nwhich live in the air,\" says Webster's immortal \"Duchess of Malfi,\"\r\n\r\n  On the wild benefit of nature, live\r\n  Happier than we, for they can choose their mates.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther women, indeed, might have struggled far better against the\r\nadverse conditions of an unsuitable marriage and have borne themselves\r\nfar better amid its worst trials than the clever, impulsive,\r\nlight-hearted, light-headed Caroline Amelia was able to do.  There\r\nseems no reason to doubt that she had a good heart, a loving nature,\r\nand the wish to lead a pure and honorable life.  But she was too often\r\nthoughtless, careless, wilful, and headstrong, and, like many others\r\nwho might have done well under fair conditions, she allowed the worst\r\nqualities of her nature to take the command just at the very moment\r\nwhen there {12} was most need for the exercise of all that was best in\r\nher.  Even with regard to George himself, it seems only fair and\r\nreasonable to assume that he, too, might have done better if his\r\nmarriage had not been merely an arrangement of State.  Perhaps the\r\nwhole history of State marriages contains no chapter at once more\r\nfantastic and more tragic than that which closed with the death of\r\nCaroline Amelia, wife of George the Fourth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Napoleon Bonaparte]\r\n\r\nWhile the joy-bells of London were already chiming for the coronation\r\nof George the Fourth, the most powerful enemy George's country had ever\r\nhad was passing quietly away in St. Helena.  On May 5, 1821, the\r\nEmperor Napoleon died in his island exile.  No words could exaggerate\r\nthe sensation produced through the whole world by the close of this\r\nmarvellous career.  He was unquestionably one of the greatest figures\r\nin history.  As a conquering soldier he has no rival in the modern\r\nworld, and indeed all the history we know of, ancient or modern, can\r\ngive but very few names which may bear comparison with his.  Unlike\r\nCaesar and Alexander, he had made his way from the humble obscurity of\r\ncommon life, and, unlike Caesar, he did not seem to have had in him the\r\nintellectual greatness which must have made him, under any conditions,\r\na master of men and of hemispheres.  So far as mere dramatic effect is\r\nconcerned, he was less fortunate than Caesar in his disappearance from\r\nthe world's stage.  Napoleon was doomed to pine and wither away on a\r\nlonely island in the South Atlantic for years and years, and there was\r\nsomething like an anticlimax in the closing scenes of that marvellous\r\nlife-drama.  It is pitiful and saddening now to read of the trumpery\r\nannoyances and humiliations to which his days of exile were subjected,\r\nand to read, too, of the unceasing complaints with which he resented\r\nwhat he regarded as the insults offered to him by his jailers.  There\r\nwas, indeed, much that was ignoble in the manner of his treatment by\r\nthose who had him in charge, in the paltry indignities which he had to\r\nendure, and which he could not endure in the patient dignity of\r\nsilence.  The mere refusal to allow to him his title of Emperor, and to\r\ninsist {13} that he should only be addressed as General Bonaparte, was\r\nas illogical as it was ungenerous; for if revolutionary France had not\r\nthe right to make him an Emperor, she certainly could not have had the\r\nright to make him a General.  Every movement he made and every movement\r\nmade by any of his friends on the island was watched as jealously and\r\nas closely as if he had been some vulgar Jack Sheppard plotting with\r\nhis pals for an escape through the windows or the cellars of his prison.\r\n\r\nOne cannot but regret that Napoleon could not have folded himself in\r\nthe majestic mantle of his dignity and his fame, could not even, if it\r\nwere needed, have eaten out his own heart in silence, and left his\r\ncaptors to work their worst upon him without giving them the\r\nsatisfaction of extorting a word of querulous remonstrance.  His\r\ncaptors, no doubt, were perpetually haunted by the dread that he might\r\nsomehow contrive to make his escape, and that if he once got away from\r\nSt. Helena the whole struggle might have to begin all over again.  No\r\ndoubt, too, his captors would have said, speaking in the spirit of the\r\ntimes, that Napoleon was not to be trusted like an honorable prisoner\r\non parole, and that there was no way of securing the peace of the world\r\nbut by holding him under close and constant guard.  The whole story of\r\nthose years of captivity is profoundly sad, and is one which may\r\nprobably be read with less pain even by Frenchmen than by high-minded\r\nEnglishmen.  There has lately been given to the world in the pages of\r\nan American magazine, _The Century_, a continuation of the record once\r\nmade by Dr. Barry E. O'Meara of his conversations with Napoleon during\r\nNapoleon's exile in St. Helena.  Dr. O'Meara was a surgeon in the\r\nEnglish navy, and was serving in the _Bellerophon_ when Napoleon came\r\non board.  He was allowed to take care of Napoleon by the British\r\nGovernment, and, as he was an Irishman, he felt a certain sympathy with\r\nNapoleon and came to be treated by the fallen Emperor as a friend.  He\r\npublished a volume called \"A Voice from St. Helena,\" in which he gave a\r\ndetailed account of his talks with the great Emperor.  The book was\r\nmuch read {14} at the time of its publication, and created a deep\r\ninterest wherever it was read.  From this work O'Meara left out many of\r\nthe memoranda he had written down, probably because he thought they\r\nmight give offence needlessly to living persons; but the withheld\r\nmemoranda were all carefully preserved and passed into the hands of\r\nsome of his descendants in New Jersey, and have after this long lapse\r\nof time been published at last.  They tell us with painful accuracy of\r\nthe petty annoyances constantly inflicted upon Napoleon, and of the\r\nimpatience and fretfulness with which, day after day, he resented them\r\nand complained of them.  We seem to live with the great dethroned\r\nEmperor in his hours of homeliest complainings, when every little\r\ngrievance that burns in his heart finds repeated expression on his\r\nlips.  Few chapters in the history of fallen greatness can be more\r\ntouching than these pages.\r\n\r\nNot all that Napoleon said about England, however, was mere complaint\r\nand disparagement.  The world of London may be interested in learning\r\nfrom these reminiscences how Napoleon told Dr. Barry O'Meara that if\r\nhe, Napoleon, had had any authority over the English Metropolis, he\r\nwould have long ago taken measures for constructing an embankment on\r\nboth sides of the Thames as it passed between Middlesex and Surrey.  If\r\nDr. O'Meara had embodied this suggestion in his public volume, Napoleon\r\nmight unconsciously have become the projector of the Thames Embankment.\r\n_Fas est ab hoste_--the proverb is somewhat musty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{15}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIV.\r\n\r\nPOPULAR ALARMS--ROYAL EXCURSIONS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1820--The Cato Street conspiracy]\r\n\r\nThe plot which has been already mentioned as one of the unpropitious\r\nevents that marked the opening of George the Fourth's reign was the\r\nfamous Cato Street conspiracy.  The conspiracy was nothing less than a\r\nplot for the assassination, all at once, of the whole of his Majesty's\r\nministers.  The principal conspirator was a man named Thistlewood, a\r\ncompound of half-crazy fanaticism and desperate villany--a creature who\r\nbelieved that he had private vengeance to satisfy, and who had, at the\r\nsame time, persuaded himself that no good could come to the people of\r\nEngland until an example had been made of the King's official advisers\r\nby the avenging hand of the lover of liberty.  The novelty as well as\r\nthe audacity of the plot created a perfect consternation all through\r\nEngland, and it became, for a while, the sincere conviction of a vast\r\nnumber of reasonable Englishmen that the whole political and social\r\nsystem of the kingdom was undermined by such plots, and that only the\r\nmost strenuous exertions made by the champions of law and order could\r\nprotect the realm from an outbreak of horrors far transcending any of\r\nthose that had convulsed France during the worst days of the\r\nRevolution.  It was soon made clear enough that Thistlewood's plot was\r\na conspiracy which included only a very small number of men, and it has\r\nnever been quite certain whether it was not originally put in motion by\r\nthe machination of some of the paid spies and informers whom it was\r\nbelieved, at that time, to be the duty of the Ministry to keep in its\r\nservice for the detection and the frustration of revolutionary\r\nconspiracy.  It was the common practice of spies and informers, in\r\nthose days, to go {16} about secretly in quarters where revolutionary\r\nconspiracy was believed to be in existence, to represent themselves to\r\nsome of the suspected plotters as fellow-revolutionists and\r\nbrother-conspirators, and thus to get into their confidence, and even\r\nto suggest to them some new form of conspiracy, in order that their\r\nwillingness to accept the suggestion might mark them out as proper\r\nsubjects for a Government prosecution and obtain for the informers the\r\ncredit of the detection.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1820--Origin of the conspiracy]\r\n\r\nThistlewood had been engaged in popular agitation for some sort of\r\nreconstitution of political society, and he had been once put on his\r\ntrial for some alleged offence arising out of such an agitation.  More\r\nlucky than many other of his contemporaries under similar conditions,\r\nhe was brought before a jury who found him not guilty of the charge\r\nmade against him.  Now, if Thistlewood had been a sane member of even\r\nan Anarchist organization, he might have been softened in his feelings\r\ntowards the existing order of things by finding that a jury had\r\nactually recognized the possibility of his being formally charged with\r\nan offence against the Crown and yet not being guilty.  But Thistlewood\r\nregarded the bare fact that a charge had been made against him as a\r\ncrime calling out for vengeance, and in his frenzy he got the idea into\r\nhis head that Lord Sidmouth, the Home Secretary, was the person on whom\r\nhe was bound to take revenge.  Accordingly, the unfortunate creature\r\nactually sent a challenge to Lord Sidmouth, inviting and defying him to\r\nmortal combat.  Perhaps Lord Sidmouth would have acted wisely if he had\r\ntaken no notice whatever of this preposterous challenge, but, at the\r\nsame time, it is only fair to remember that Lord Sidmouth might think\r\nit dangerous to the public peace to allow a person to go unrebuked who\r\nhad sent a challenge to a Minister of the Crown.  Criminal proceedings\r\nwere, therefore, taken against Thistlewood, and, instead of being\r\ncommitted to the protection of a lunatic asylum, the author of the\r\nchallenge was sentenced to a year's imprisonment.  When his prison time\r\nwas over, Thistlewood came out a man inflamed with a desire for\r\nvengeance on all the ruling classes {17} in general, and on Ministers\r\nof the Crown in particular.  Like the murderer in \"Macbeth,\" he thought\r\nhimself one whom the vile blows and buffets of the world had so\r\nincensed that he was reckless what he did to spite the world.  He soon\r\ngot around him a small gang of agitators as ignorant and almost as\r\ncrazy as himself, and he initiated them into a grand scheme for dealing\r\na death-blow to all the ministers at once, and then seizing on the\r\nBank, Mansion House, and Tower of London, and from these strongholds\r\nproclaiming the existence of a provisional government.\r\n\r\nNow the whole notion of such a plot as this, and any possible success\r\ncoming out of it, may seem, at first sight, too crazy to be accepted by\r\nany set of men, however ignorant or however wicked, who were not\r\ndownright lunatics.  But it is certain that Thistlewood did find a\r\nsmall number of men who were not actually lunatics, and who yet were\r\nready to join with him and to risk their lives in his enterprise.  The\r\nfirst act in the plot was to be the assassination of the King's\r\nministers.  One of the professional spies in the employment of the\r\nauthorities, a man named Edwards, was already in communication with\r\nThistlewood and his friends.  The plot had been for a considerable time\r\nin preparation, and it was put off for a while because of the death of\r\nGeorge the Third, and the hopes entertained by the conspirators that\r\nthe new King might go back to the political principles of his earlier\r\nyears, discard Lord Liverpool, Lord Sidmouth, and his other Tory\r\nadvisers, and thus render it unnecessary for patriotic men to put them\r\nto death in order to save the country.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, it became apparent that George the Fourth was to keep\r\naround him the ministers who had served him when he was Prince Regent,\r\nit was determined that the work must go on.  Edwards, the spy, was able\r\nto make it known to Thistlewood that there was to be a dinner of the\r\nmembers of the Cabinet on February 23, 1820, and the opportunity was\r\nthought to be placed by a kindly fate in the hands of the conspirators.\r\nMeanwhile the minister at whose house the dinner was to take place,\r\nLord {18} Harrowby, was kept fully informed of all that was going on,\r\nand he wisely resolved to take no public notice of the scheme until the\r\nday for the dinner should arrive, when the instruments of the wholesale\r\nmurder-plot could be suddenly arrested at the moment of their attempt\r\nto carry out their design.  Thistlewood and most of his companions had\r\ntheir headquarters in the garrets of a house in Cato Street, Edgware\r\nRoad, and there it was arranged among them that they should remain\r\nuntil one or two of their accomplices, who were kept at watch for the\r\npurpose, should come to them and report that the doomed dinner-guests\r\nhad assembled.  Then the conspirators were to repair to the\r\nneighborhood of Lord Harrowby's house in Grosvenor Square.  One of the\r\noutpost men was to knock at Lord Harrowby's door, and the moment the\r\ndoor was opened all the gang were to rush in and put the ministers to\r\ndeath.  Lord Harrowby took good care not to have any guests that\r\nevening, but the outpost men of the conspiracy were deceived by the\r\nfact that a dinner-party was actually going on at the house of the\r\nArchbishop of York next door, and when they saw carriages arriving\r\nthere they felt sure this was the dinner-party for which they were\r\nwaiting.  They waited there until the last of the guests appeared to\r\nhave arrived, and then set out to give notice to Thistlewood and his\r\ncompanions.  Before the outpost men had got back to Cato Street the\r\npolice were already there, and an attempt was made to arrest the whole\r\nof the conspirators.  A scuffle took place, in which Thistlewood\r\nstabbed one of the policemen to the heart.  The constituted authorities\r\nhad contrived to make almost as much of a bungle as the conspirators\r\nhad done; the military force did not arrive in time, and Thistlewood\r\nand some of his accomplices succeeded, for the moment, in making their\r\nescape.  It was only for the moment.  Thistlewood was arrested next\r\nday.  There was nothing heroic or dramatic about the manner of his\r\ncapture.  He had sought refuge at the house of a friend in Moorfields,\r\nand he was comfortably asleep in bed when the house was surrounded and\r\nhe was made prisoner.  He was put on trial soon after, and, {19} with\r\nfour of his accomplices, was sentenced to death, and on May 1 the five\r\nwere executed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1820--The government and the conspiracy]\r\n\r\nThe evidence at the trial made it clear to any reasonable mind that the\r\nplot was confined altogether to the small knot of ignorant desperadoes\r\nwho held their councils in Cato Street, and to the informer Edwards,\r\nwho had been in communication with them.  The public were never allowed\r\nto know what had become of this man Edwards.  Had he been pensioned by\r\nthe Government and been allowed to pass into honorable and comfortable\r\nretirement, or was he to be arrested and put on his trial like other\r\nconspirators?  Several attempts were made to get at the truth by means\r\nof questions to the ministers in the House of Commons, but no\r\nsatisfactory reply could be extracted or extorted.  Indeed, it seemed\r\nquite probable that the general feeling among the ruling classes at the\r\ntime would have been that the Government had done a very good thing by\r\nemploying a man to help in working up murderous conspiracies in order\r\nthat such conspiracies should be frightened out of existence, and that\r\nit was quite right to protect and reward the emissaries who had\r\nrendered such faithful service.  For a time there was a widespread and\r\nsincere belief that the Cato Street conspiracy was only one in a vast\r\nnetwork of conspiracies from which nothing but the severest measures of\r\nrepression could save England.  The King himself in his royal message\r\nto Parliament was careful to make use of the Cato Street conspiracy as\r\nanother and a crowning evidence of the necessity which existed for the\r\nwholesale application of the criminal law in order to save the State\r\nfrom the triumph of anarchy.  A season of absolute panic set in and the\r\nmost trivial political disturbance arising in any part of the country\r\nwas magnified into another attempt of the emissaries of revolution to\r\nupset the Throne, pull down the Church, and turn the State into the\r\nrepublic of a rabble.\r\n\r\nIt is quite clear now to all readers of history that such attempts as\r\nthose planned by the Cato Street conspirators can only exist at a time\r\nwhen stern and savage restrictions are set upon all efforts to obtain a\r\nfree public hearing for {20} the discussion of political and social\r\ngrievances.  Where political wrongs can be arraigned in the open day,\r\nthere is no occasion for the work of the midnight conspirator.  Already\r\nin England public men were coming forward who were filled with the\r\nnoble and patriotic desire to give the philosophy of history some share\r\nin the guidance of political life.  Popular education had been totally\r\nneglected in England, and, indeed, the too common impression among the\r\nruling classes was that the lower orders of the people could never be\r\nkept in due obedience to their superiors if they were permitted to make\r\nthemselves unfit for their station by learning how to read and write.\r\nEven the criminal laws themselves bore terrible testimony to the\r\nprevailing ideas, by the fact that property was proclaimed as sacred a\r\npossession as life itself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1820--Offences that entailed the death penalty]\r\n\r\nIn the early days of George the Fourth's reign Sir James Mackintosh,\r\nthe famous historian, philosopher, and philanthropist, brought into the\r\nHouse of Commons a measure for abolishing the punishment of death in\r\ncases of the stealing of property to the value of five shillings, and\r\nhe succeeded in carrying his measure through Parliament.  Up to that\r\ntime men and women had been executed, year after year, for stealing\r\nfrom a shop any goods of the value of five shillings, were the goods\r\nbut a few loaves of high-priced bread carried off for the purpose of\r\nrelieving the sufferings of a hungry family.  Sir James Mackintosh's\r\nmeasure aimed at the abolition of the death penalty in a large number\r\nof other minor offences, but he only succeeded in robbing the gallows\r\nof its victims in two other classes of small offences as well as that\r\nwhich has just been mentioned.\r\n\r\nAt this time of day one reads with amazement the arguments which men\r\nlike Lord Chancellor Eldon directed against the humane measures\r\nintroduced by Sir James Mackintosh.  Parliament and the country were\r\nsolemnly warned that if such relaxation of the death punishment were\r\nsanctioned by law, the smaller class of tradesmen would have to give up\r\ntheir shops and their business altogether, because it would be utterly\r\nimpossible for them {21} to keep any goods in their windows or on their\r\nshelves if the punishment of death were not maintained for the theft of\r\na shawl or a snuff-box.  At the same time it was well known to\r\neverybody who had eyes to see or ears to hear that numbers of\r\nshoplifters escaped punishment altogether because humane juries\r\nrefused, even on the plainest evidence, to find a verdict of guilty\r\nwhere such a verdict would send the prisoner from the dock to the\r\ngallows.  Many a jury, too, when it was impossible to doubt that a\r\ntheft had been committed, acted on the ingenious plan of declaring in\r\ntheir verdict that the articles stolen, whatever their obvious market\r\nworth, were under the value of five shillings, thereby saving the\r\noffender from the doom of death.  Thus the repressive power of the law\r\nwas necessarily diminished by the uncertainty which common humanity put\r\nin the way of its regular enforcement, and that very barbarity of\r\npunishment which was intended to keep men back from crime by its mere\r\nterrors gave to the criminal only another chance of escape.\r\n\r\nSir James Mackintosh had brought in his measures as successor, in that\r\nline of philanthropic reform, to the lamented Sir Samuel Romilly, whose\r\nmelancholy death, already referred to, had created a profound sensation\r\nthroughout England and abroad towards the close of the late reign.\r\nAbout the time when Mackintosh was thus making his partly successful\r\nattempt to put some check on the application of the death penalty,\r\nHenry Brougham was arousing the attention of Parliament and the country\r\nto the lamentable and disgraceful absence of anything like a system of\r\nnational education.  On June 28, 1820, Brougham brought forward the\r\nfirst definite proposal submitted to the House of Commons for a scheme\r\nof national education designed to apply to England and Wales.  A\r\nparliamentary committee had been sitting for some time to make\r\ninquiries and receive evidence as to the state of education in the\r\npoorer districts of the land.  This, too, was owing almost altogether\r\nto the energy and the efforts of Brougham, but the inquiries of the\r\ncommittee were resulting in nothing very practical, and Brougham\r\ntherefore {22} went a step further than he had previously gone and\r\nbrought forward his definite scheme for national education.  It is\r\nhardly necessary to say that he did not succeed in carrying his\r\nmeasure, and that generations had yet to pass away before any real and\r\ncomprehensive effort wag made by the State to establish such a system\r\nof popular education in these countries as had been known to Prussia\r\nand other European nations almost for time out of mind.  But Brougham\r\nhad at least started the question, and he never ceased to keep it\r\nmoving during his long life.  Other reformers, too, as well as\r\nMackintosh and Brougham, were making their voices heard above, or at\r\nall events through, the din and clamor of the controversy between the\r\nfriends of the King and the champions of the Queen.  Lord John Russell\r\nmay be said to have then begun his noble career as reformer of the\r\nsystem of parliamentary representation, and Mr. Lambton, afterwards to\r\nbe better known as Lord Durham, made more than one bold effort in the\r\nsame direction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1821--George the Fourth visits Ireland]\r\n\r\nRussell and Lambton were both unsuccessful just then.  The time had not\r\nyet come when the question of parliamentary reform was to break up\r\nministries, set the country aflame with agitation, and put a\r\nthick-witted Sovereign to the necessity of choosing between submission\r\nto the popular demand or facing the risk of revolution.  But it might\r\nhave been clear to reflective men that the days of unconditional\r\nloyalty to the will of a monarch had nearly run their course in\r\nEngland, and that the demand for a reform in the criminal law, a\r\nrelaxation of the repression of free speech, the establishment of some\r\nsystem of popular education, and the adoption of a really\r\nrepresentative principle in the construction of Parliament was destined\r\nbefore long to prove irresistible.  The case of the reformers was\r\nemphasized by the widespread agricultural distress from which the\r\ncountry had long been suffering.  The inevitable reaction had set in,\r\ntoo, after the spasmodic inflation of trade and commerce which had\r\naccompanied the long period of war.  Even if the governing system of\r\nEngland had been as wise and humane as it was {23} unenlightened and\r\nharsh, the condition of the country would, of itself, have favored\r\nalmost any demand for reform.  As the Government system actually was,\r\nonly a national prosperity of universal and impossible sleekness could\r\nhave kept the people of England much longer indifferent to the\r\nnecessity for reform in almost every department of the political and\r\nsocial system.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the new King was paying his round of State visits to Ireland,\r\nto Hanover, and to Scotland.  We have seen already how the royal\r\nprogress to Ireland was delayed by the inconvenient occurrence of the\r\nQueen's death.  George soon, however, felt it proper to put away all\r\naffectation of grief, and to pay his visit to Ireland.  Great hopes\r\nwere entertained there for the beneficent results of the royal visit.\r\nGeorge had been during his earlier days in political sympathy as well\r\nas boon companionship with Fox and with Sheridan.  Fox had always shown\r\nhimself a true friend to Ireland.  The Irish national poet, Thomas\r\nMoore, had, in one of his songs, described the Banshee as wailing over\r\nthe grave of him \"on whose burning tongue truth, peace, and freedom\r\nhung.\"  It was fondly believed in Ireland that the King was returning\r\nto the sympathies of his earlier days, and that his coming to the\r\nisland must bring blessings with it.  Daniel O'Connell, the orator and\r\ntribune of the Irish people, appears to have been thoroughly impressed\r\nwith the same hopes and the same conviction, and he brought on himself\r\nsome satirical lines from Byron in scorn of his credulity and his\r\nconfidence.  We shall soon have occasion to see what return O'Connell\r\ngot for his loyalty and his devotion.\r\n\r\nThe last of the great Irish patriots of the past age, Henry Grattan,\r\nhad been buried in Westminster Abbey the year before George's visit to\r\nIreland.  It was well that so pure-minded and austere a lover of his\r\ncountry should have been spared the necessity of taking any part in the\r\nceremonials of welcome which attended the arrival of the new Sovereign\r\nin Ireland.  George undoubtedly received what seemed to be a thoroughly\r\nnational welcome, for it was fully believed all through the country\r\nthat his visit was {24} to open a new era of peace, prosperity, and\r\nwell-merited loyalty to Ireland.  King George threw himself thoroughly\r\ninto the spirit of the occasion.  He acted his part with admirable\r\neffect.  He was sympathetic, he was convivial, he was pathetic, he was\r\nboisterous, exactly as the theatrical effect of the moment seemed to\r\ncall for the display of this or that emotion.  In truth, the character\r\nof George the Fourth never can be thoroughly understood unless we are\r\nable to see how much of the artistic, in a certain sense, there was in\r\nhis temperament.  He had that peculiar gift which has lately come to be\r\ncalled \"artistic\"--sincerely by some critics, satirically by\r\nothers--the gift which enables a man to throw his whole soul and spirit\r\ninto any part which the occasion calls on him to act.  George was\r\nalmost always playing a part, but it was his artistic temperament which\r\nenabled him to believe that he actually felt at the moment the very\r\nemotions which he tried to express.  The favorite dramatic type of the\r\nconscious hypocrite and the deliberate self-recognized deceiver is much\r\nless common in real life than it was believed to be at one period of\r\nour literary history.  We may take it for granted that George fully\r\nbelieved himself to be acting with perfect sincerity on most of the\r\noccasions in his life when he had to utter eloquent sentiments\r\nappropriate to the scene and the hour, or to fling himself into the\r\ndifferent humors of those whom, at different times, he was anxious to\r\nplease.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1821--The King's reception in Ireland]\r\n\r\nDuring his public performances--for thus they may properly be\r\ncalled--in Ireland, George was sometimes grave, sometimes gay; shed\r\ntears in some places, indulged in touches of buffoonery in others; and\r\nwherever he went seemed to be giving to those around him only the most\r\nsincere outpouring of his own humor and of his own heart.  He appears\r\nthoroughly to have enjoyed his popularity, and to have regarded\r\nhimself, for the hour, as the justly idolized hero of the land which he\r\nhad come to redeem and to bless.  The harbor where he first landed in\r\nIreland, which was called Dunleary then, has been called Kingstown ever\r\nsince, for its name was changed in honor of the monarch's {25} visit to\r\nhis Irish subjects.  The tourist who has just arrived at Kingstown by\r\nthe steamer from Holyhead, and who takes his seat in the train for\r\nDublin, may see from the window of the railway carriage an obelisk, not\r\nvery imposing either in its height or in its sculptured form, which\r\nseems a little out of place amid the ordinary accessories of a railway\r\nand steamboat station.  This is the monument which the grateful\r\nauthorities of the Irish capital erected to commemorate the spot on\r\nwhich George the Fourth had set his august feet when he landed on the\r\nshores of Ireland.  Except for the obelisk and the change of name there\r\nwas not much done to keep the memory of the King green in the\r\nrecollections of the Irish people.\r\n\r\nOn August 12 George landed at Dunleary, where anxious and enthusiastic\r\ncrowds had long been waiting to welcome him.  He was received with\r\nuniversal cries of \"The King!  God bless him!\" to which he replied by\r\nwaving the foraging-cap which he had been wearing, and crying out, \"God\r\nbless you all; I thank you from my heart.\"  Then he got into his\r\ncarriage, and with a cavalcade of his attendants and a concourse of\r\nadmiring followers he drove to the Viceregal Lodge in Phoenix Park,\r\nsome eight or nine miles' distance.  When he arrived at the Lodge he\r\nalighted from the carriage and proclaimed to the crowd, \"In addressing\r\nyou I conceive that I am addressing the nobility, gentry, and yeomen of\r\nIreland.  This is one of the happiest moments of my life.  I feel\r\npleased being the first of my family that set foot on Irish ground.\r\nEarly in my life I loved Ireland, and I rejoice at being among my\r\nbeloved Irish friends.  I always considered them such, and this day\r\nproves to me I am beloved by them.\"  Then he went on to say that\r\n\"circumstances of a delicate nature,\" to which it was needless to\r\nadvert, had prevented him from visiting them earlier.  Rank, station,\r\nand honor were nothing to him, but \"to feel that I live in the hearts\r\nof my Irish subjects is to me the most exalted happiness.\"  He wound up\r\nwith the touching words, \"I assure you, my dear friends, I have an\r\nIrish heart, and will this night give a proof of my affection towards\r\nyou, as I am sure you will towards {26} me, by drinking your health in\r\na bumper of whiskey punch.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1821--The King and the Primacy of all Ireland]\r\n\r\nThis speech may be taken as the keynote of George's behavior throughout\r\nthe entire visit.  On the 17th of the month he made his grand state\r\nentrance into Dublin in an open carriage drawn by eight horses, and he\r\nwore in his hat an enormous bunch of shamrocks, to which, by repeated\r\ngestures, he kept incessantly calling the attention of the crowd.  More\r\nthan once as he gazed upon his admiring followers he was observed to\r\nshed tears.  Afterwards he attended reviews, showed himself at the\r\ntheatre, was present at a great ball at the Mansion House, received an\r\nentertainment at Trinity College, and visited the residences of some of\r\nthe Irish nobility.  He talked to everybody, and sometimes in his\r\nconversation showed much of the good sense and shrewdness which really\r\nbelonged to him, but in his demeanor towards the general multitude he\r\nalways enacted the part of an enthusiastic Sovereign whose enthusiasm\r\nsometimes showed itself in the form of what might have been called, if\r\nhe were not a Sovereign, outrageous mountebankcry.  On Monday,\r\nSeptember 3, he quitted the shores of Ireland.  Just before his\r\ndeparture he received a deputation headed by Daniel O'Connell, who fell\r\nupon his knees, and in that attitude of loyal devotion presented his\r\nMajesty with a laurel crown.  The King was particularly gracious to\r\nO'Connell, shook him warmly by the hand, and accepted gratefully the\r\ngift offered to him, and, for the time, O'Connell divided the applause\r\nof the crowd with the monarch.  There was a renewed interchange of good\r\nwishes and blessings, and then the King got into his barge to be\r\nconveyed to the steamer, and several loyal Irishmen, in their\r\nenthusiasm, rushing to see the last of him, tumbled into the sea, and\r\nwith some difficulty rescued themselves, or were rescued, from drowning.\r\n\r\nThis may be said to have ended the royal visit so far as history is\r\nconcerned, for, although the King's return to England was delayed for\r\nseveral days by contrary winds, he had nothing more to do with his\r\nIrish subjects.  Byron {27} wrote some satirical verses, which he\r\nprefaced with the words of Curran, the great Irish advocate and orator,\r\ndescribing Ireland like \"a bastinadoed elephant kneeling to receive the\r\npaltry rider,\" and in which he made mockery of O'Connell's loyalty,\r\npaid a just and generous tribute to Grattan, and proclaimed sincerely\r\nhis own love for Ireland and his thorough appreciation of her national\r\ncause.  Then the royal visit was over, and the Irish people were soon\r\nto learn the value of the King's profession of sympathy with the wishes\r\nand the wants of his devoted Irish subjects.  A curious illustration of\r\nthe sincerity of these royal sentiments may be found in a letter\r\nwritten by the King not very long after to his Prime Minister, Lord\r\nLiverpool, and marked \"Most secret and confidential.\"  The letter had\r\nreference to the appointment of a new occupant to the exalted office of\r\nPrimate of All Ireland, and the King says, \"I do not like, I cannot\r\nreconcile myself to have the Primacy of Ireland filled by an Irishman.\"\r\nThe King, when writing this letter, appears to have been in one of his\r\ndeeply religious moods.  \"I am too far advanced in life,\" he says, \"not\r\nto give subjects of this description the most serious and attentive\r\nconsideration.  It is, alas! but too true that policy is too often\r\nobliged to interfere with our best intentions, but I do think where the\r\nhead of the Church is concerned, especially at such a moment, we ought\r\nalone to be influenced by religious duty.  Do not be surprised at this\r\nscrupulous language, for I am quite sincere.\"  Very likely King George\r\nwas quite sincere in this momentary burst of religious emotion.  It was\r\na part of his artistic nature to be able thus to fill himself with any\r\nemotion which helped out the performance he had in hand; but it is at\r\nleast an odd comment on his recent emotions of love for the Irish\r\npeople and absolute trust in their loyal devotion, that he could not\r\nreconcile himself to the idea of allowing any Irishman to occupy the\r\nposition of Primate of All Ireland.  There was no question in this of\r\nProtestant against Roman Catholic, and that Coronation Oath, which had\r\nin the former reign proved so formidable an obstacle to the recognition\r\nof any Catholic {28} claims, was in no wise brought into question.\r\nNobody suggested that a Roman Catholic bishop should be made Primate of\r\nAll Ireland, but it was strange that soon after George's reiterated\r\nprofessions of love for his Irish people, and absolute trust in them,\r\nhe could not reconcile himself to the idea of any Protestant bishop,\r\nhowever meritorious, being raised to such an office if the Protestant\r\nbishop happened to be an Irishman.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1822--George the Fourth visits Scotland]\r\n\r\nKing George had to leave his capital again in order to visit other\r\nlands where he had subjects to gratify with the pleasure of his\r\npresence.  He paid a visit to Hanover, and then to Scotland.  George,\r\nit need hardly be said, was King of Hanover as well as of England, and\r\nhe thought it right that he should illumine the Hanoverians with the\r\nlight of his royal countenance.  So he made his way to Hanover, taking\r\nBrussels in his course.  He was accompanied thus far by the Duke of\r\nWellington and other eminent persons, and he took the opportunity of\r\nsurveying the field of Waterloo, and having all the striking points of\r\nthe battle-field pointed out and explained to him by the Duke of\r\nWellington.  It would appear that the sovereign's personal survey of\r\nthe field on which Napoleon's last great battle had been fought only\r\nserved to strengthen the impression on his mind that he had himself\r\ntaken a part, and even a distinguished and heroic part, in that\r\nimmortal struggle.  Here again the artistic nature asserted itself.  No\r\ndoubt it had long seemed to George that the heir to the English throne\r\nought to have taken a leading part in a battle which was a\r\nturning-point in the history of England, and by degrees he had\r\ncontrived to persuade himself into the belief that he had actually done\r\nthe deeds required by the dramatic fitness of things, for it was well\r\nknown that, at certain seasons of inspiration, he had described himself\r\nas leading a desperate charge at Waterloo.  Then he pursued his way to\r\nHanover, and he made much the same demonstrations of deep emotion as\r\nthose which had delighted the crowds at Dunleary and in Dublin.  Again\r\nand again he protested his love and his devotion for his Hanoverian\r\nsubjects, again and again he accompanied {29} with voice and with\r\ngesture the singing of patriotic hymns, and on more than one occasion\r\nthe royal eyes were seen to be streaming over with sympathetic tears.\r\n\r\nAll this, however, did not prevent him from sometimes making it known\r\nto the more intimate companions of his journey that he was greatly\r\nbored by the Germans in general, and that he was particularly disgusted\r\nwith the Hanoverians.  George had always some chosen favorite holding\r\nimportant personal office in his courtly retinue, and to him, in\r\nmoments of relaxation, he occasionally let out his real feelings with\r\nregard to the ceremonial performances which he believed it his duty to\r\nget through.  Then he visited Scotland, and was welcomed by\r\nenthusiastic crowds at Leith and in Edinburgh.  While he was still on\r\nboard the royal vessel at Leith he was waited on by several\r\ndistinguished representatives of Scottish feeling, and among others by\r\nno less a personage than Sir Walter Scott.  George was very gracious in\r\nhis reception of the great novelist, and assured Sir Walter that he was\r\nthe one man in Scotland whom he most wished to see.  As had been the\r\nfashion during his visit to Ireland, there was a good deal of\r\nspirit-drinking when the King came to testify his gratitude for the\r\nloyal welcome given to him by his Scottish subjects.  His Majesty\r\npoured out with his own hand some cherry brandy into a glass, which he\r\ntendered to Sir Walter Scott, and Sir Walter not merely drank off the\r\nliquid thus commended to him, but asked permission to keep the glass as\r\na perpetual relic of the royal giver and of the august occasion.\r\nThackeray tells the story of the incident in his lecture on George the\r\nFourth, and we cannot do better than describe it in his own words:\r\n\"When George the Fourth came to Edinburgh,\" says Thackeray, \"a better\r\nman than he went on board the royal yacht to welcome the King to his\r\nkingdom of Scotland, seized a goblet from which his Majesty had just\r\ndrunk, vowed it should remain forever as an heirloom in his family,\r\nclapped the precious glass in his pocket, and sat down on it and broke\r\nit when he got home.\"  One can easily imagine how the sudden fate of\r\nthe precious relic must have amused {30} and delighted the satirical\r\ngenius of Thackeray, who could not quite forgive even Sir Walter Scott\r\nfor having lent himself to the fulsome adulation which it was thought\r\nproper to offer to George the Fourth on the occasion of his visit to\r\nhis kingdom of Scotland.\r\n\r\nThackeray, indeed, seems to have been a little too hard upon George,\r\nand to have regarded him merely as a worthless profligate and buffoon,\r\nwho never really felt any of the generous emotions which the sovereign\r\nfound it convenient to summon up at the appropriate seasons.  Our own\r\nstudy of the character leads us to the opinion already expressed, that\r\nGeorge did actually believe for the time in the full sincerity of the\r\nfeelings he thought proper to call into action on the occasion of an\r\nimportant ceremonial, and that the feelings were no less genuine at the\r\nmoment than those which came on him when the performance was over, and\r\nhe had an opportunity of showing the new state of his mind in the\r\nreaction of weariness caused by the whole tiresome proceedings.  George\r\nwent through the usual rounds of visits in Scotland, and put on an\r\nappearance of absolute enjoyment during the public entertainments and\r\npopular acclamations which he had brought upon himself.  He displayed\r\nhimself frequently in a suit of Stuart tartan when he did not array\r\nhimself in his costume as a field-marshal.  We read that during the\r\nsinging of royal songs he not only beat time to the chorus, but\r\nactually accompanied it with his voice.  His parting words when he was\r\nleaving the shores of Scotland were the deep-toned and thrilling\r\nbenediction, \"God bless you all!\"  The loyal chroniclers of the time\r\nproclaimed that the visit to Scotland was a perfect success, and if the\r\nloyal chroniclers at the time were not in a position to know, how can\r\nwe of a later date, who had not the advantage of being present at the\r\nscene, or even of being alive at the time, pretend to dispute the\r\naccuracy of their estimate?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{31}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXV.\r\n\r\nGEORGE CANNING.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1720-87--Canning and the King]\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note: the above dates are what were in the book, but\r\n1820-37 would seem more logical.]\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the course of the proceedings taken against the Queen\r\ndeprived the Liverpool Ministry of the services of its most brilliant\r\nmember, George Canning.  Canning had made up his mind from the beginning\r\nthat he could not appear as one of the Queen's accusers, although he had\r\nconsented, as a compromise, to the omission of her name from the Royal\r\nLiturgy.  He had consented to this compromise because, although he did\r\nnot believe in the worst of the charges against the Queen, he could not\r\nhelp admitting that there was much in her conduct which rendered her\r\nunsuitable as the reigning consort of the King; and at the time he did\r\nnot understand that the King's disapproval of her actions was to take the\r\nform of a prosecution and a demand for divorce.  He had applied to the\r\nKing for leave to resign his office in the Ministry, and had only been\r\ninduced to remain on the understanding that he was not expected to take\r\nany part in the public proceedings against the unhappy Caroline.  When,\r\nhowever, it became evident that the whole question would be raised in the\r\nHouse of Commons, and that he must either give a silent assent to the\r\ncourse taken by the King's advisers or publicly condemn it there, he felt\r\nit his duty to send in his resignation of his place in the Ministry and\r\nto stand by his resolve.  Canning withdrew from office and became, for\r\nthe time, merely a private member of the House of Commons.  King George\r\ngot it into his mind that his former minister had deserted his cause at\r\nan anxious and critical moment, and the King, who was flighty enough in\r\nmost of his purposes, seldom forgot what he regarded as an injury.  He\r\nnever forgave Canning, {32} although the time was now coming when hardly\r\nany choice was left him but to take Canning back into his service again,\r\nand under conditions that gave Canning a greater influence over public\r\naffairs than he had ever had before.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1720-87--The early life of Canning]\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note: see the note on page 31.]\r\n\r\nAfter the group of illustrious men, which included the elder and the\r\nyounger Pitt, Fox, Burke, and Sheridan, had disappeared from English\r\npublic life, Canning was through the whole of his career the greatest\r\nParliamentary orator and leader in England.  Up to the time at which we\r\nhave now arrived, he had not yet won his highest reputation as a\r\nstatesman.  He was born under conditions which might have been depressing\r\nand disheartening to one of different mould.  His father was a man of old\r\nfamily and well connected, who had in his earlier years developed some\r\ntaste for literature, and was regarded by most of his relatives as one\r\nwho merely brought discredit on his kindred by his mean ambition to\r\ndevote himself to the profession of letters.  The elder Canning does not\r\nseem, however, to have had a capacity for making a real success in that\r\nway, and, indeed, it would appear as if he had too much of the often\r\nfatal gift of the amateur in his composition to allow him to concentrate\r\nhis energies on any one pursuit.  He sought for success in various fields\r\nand never found it, and he died soon after his son, George Canning, was\r\nborn.  The mother of the future statesman was thus left a widow while she\r\nwas still young, and, as she had great beauty and believed that she had a\r\nvocation for the stage, she did her best to make a living for herself and\r\nher child by becoming a professional actress.  She was not much of an\r\nactress, however, and, being unable to make any mark in London, she\r\npassed for a time into the provinces, and at last married an actor and\r\ndisappeared from historical notice.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the education of George Canning the son had been provided for\r\nby his uncle, a wealthy merchant and banker, Stratford Canning, whose son\r\nwas afterwards famous as Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, the \"great Elchi\"\r\nof Kinglake.  This uncle seemed anxious to make reparation for the manner\r\nin which his dead brother had been {33} treated by the family in general.\r\nThe young Canning was sent to Eton and to Oxford, and began to study for\r\nthe bar, but he displayed such distinct talents for literature and for\r\npolitics that there seemed little likelihood of his devoting himself to\r\nthe business of law.  He soon became known at Oxford as a charming poet,\r\na keen and brilliant satirist, and a public speaker endowed with a voice\r\nof marvellous intonation and an exquisite choice of words.  He made the\r\nacquaintance of Sheridan and of Burke; by Burke he was introduced to\r\nPitt, and by Sheridan to Fox, and it is believed to have been on the\r\nsuggestion of Pitt that he resolved to devote himself to a Parliamentary\r\ncareer.  He married a woman who had a large fortune, and he obtained a\r\nseat in the House of Commons.  In that House he remained silent for a\r\nwhole session after his election, and devoted himself to a close study of\r\nthe rules, the usages, and the manners of the representative chamber.  In\r\nthose far-off days it was considered becoming on the part of a young\r\nmember of the House to observe a modest silence for a great part of his\r\nfirst session, and to make himself familiar with the assembly before he\r\nventured on any public display of his eloquence.  The time had not yet\r\ncome when it was considered humanly possible for a member of Parliament\r\nto make his first speech on the very day of his first introduction to the\r\nHouse of Commons.\r\n\r\nCanning's first speech was a distinct success.  He was thought by some\r\ncritics to have imitated too closely the magnificent rhetorical style of\r\nBurke, but the exquisite voice and the noble elocution of Canning were\r\nall his own and certainly could not have been improved by any imitation\r\nof the voice and manner of Burke.  Many of Canning's friends took it for\r\ngranted that the young member would ally himself with the Whig\r\nOpposition, but Canning at once presented himself as the devoted follower\r\nof Pitt.  Canning was afterwards the foremost among the creators of the\r\n_Anti-Jacobin_, a famous satirical periodical set up to throw ridicule on\r\nthe principles and sentiments of the French Revolution, and of all those\r\nwho encouraged its levelling theories or who aped its exalted professions\r\nof {34} humanity and of universal brotherhood.  Canning made his way\r\nrapidly in public life, and became an Under-Secretary of State three\r\nyears after his election to the House of Commons.  His next appointment\r\nwas that of Treasurer to the Navy, and in 1807 he became Secretary of\r\nState for Foreign Affairs.  A quarrel began between him and Lord\r\nCastlereagh, one of his colleagues, arising out of the unfortunate\r\nWalcheren expedition, and the quarrel resulted in a duel, after the\r\nfashion of the day, in which Canning received a wound.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1822--Canning and the governorship of India]\r\n\r\nThe policy of Castlereagh made as strong a contrast with the policy of\r\nCanning as even the contrast which was brought under the notice of every\r\nlistener by the Parliamentary speeches of the two men.  Canning was\r\nmaster of a polished eloquence which, at the time, had no rival in either\r\nHouse of Parliament.  Castlereagh was one of the most singular and\r\nstriking illustrations of the fact that a man may sometimes become a\r\npower in the House of Commons without the slightest gift of eloquence.\r\nCanning was a master of phrase, tone, and gesture.  Castlereagh's\r\nlanguage was commonplace, uncouth, and sometimes even ridiculous, and it\r\nhappened only too often that in his anxiety to get his words out he\r\nbecame positively inarticulate.  His policy represented the ideas of the\r\nHoly Alliance in their narrowest and most reactionary meaning; while\r\nCanning, although entirely opposed to the principles of mere revolution,\r\nhad an utter contempt for the notion that a conclave of European\r\nsovereigns could lay down limits and laws for the growth and the\r\ngovernment of all the European nationalities.  The policy of Castlereagh\r\nhas long since ceased to have any believers even among the advisers of\r\nautocratic sovereigns, while the policy of Canning is the recognized\r\ncreed of statesmanship all over the civilized world.\r\n\r\nCanning resigned his office as Foreign Secretary in 1809, and was for a\r\nshort time sent on a special embassy to the Court of Lisbon.  Then he\r\nbecame President of the Board of Control, which may be said to have\r\ndivided at that time the management of our Indian possessions with the\r\nEast {35} India Company, and he held this important office for about four\r\nyears.  Meanwhile he had resigned his seat for Newport, in the Isle of\r\nWight, and had been elected as representative of the great and growing\r\nport of Liverpool in the House of Commons.  The visitor to Liverpool at\r\nthe present day can hardly go far through the great city without meeting\r\nsome memorial of the veneration in which the illustrious name of Canning\r\nis held by the dwellers on the Mersey.  A vacancy arose in the office of\r\nGovernor-General of India, and the directors of the East India Company\r\ninvited Canning to accept the splendid and commanding position.  Canning\r\nat once made up his mind to close with the offer.  The position would in\r\nmany ways have suited his genius, his deep interest in the government of\r\nstates, and the freshness of his ideas on all subjects connected with the\r\ngrowth of the Empire.  Moreover, he knew that he had offended the King,\r\nand that George was not a man likely to forgive such an offence, and he\r\nthought he had reason to believe that, for the present at least, there\r\nwas not much prospect for him of advancement in English political life.\r\nMany of his friends endeavored to persuade him against accepting a\r\nposition which would make him an exile from England at a time when\r\nEngland's interests on the European continent required just such a genius\r\nas his to guide her foreign policy, and they felt sure that the time\r\ncould not be far distant when he must be invited to resume his former\r\nplace in the Administration.  Canning, however, held to his purpose,\r\naccepted the offer of the East India Company, and went to Liverpool in\r\norder to take farewell of his constituency before setting out on his\r\nvoyage to the scene of his new duties.\r\n\r\nHe stayed while in Liverpool at Seaforth House, the residence of Mr. John\r\nGladstone, one of the merchant princes of Liverpool, whose son William\r\nEwart Gladstone was afterwards to make the name of the family famous in\r\nhistory.  During his stay at Seaforth House, Canning used to spend much\r\nof his time gazing out upon the sea, while the little boy William Ewart\r\nGladstone played on the lawn near him.  It was here that Canning heard\r\nthe news {36} which led to an entire change in his purpose, and opened\r\nthe way to his greatest success.  His late colleague, his late rival,\r\nCastlereagh, was dead--had died by his own hand.  Castlereagh had lately\r\nsucceeded to his father's title, and had become Marquis of Londonderry;\r\nbut as the marquisate was only an Irish peerage, he could still sit in\r\nthe House of Commons as the chosen representative of an English\r\nconstituency.  His mind had seemed, for some time, to be darkened by\r\ntroubles of which he gave no account to his friends, and he suddenly\r\ncommitted suicide.  There are many conjectures and suggested explanations\r\nas to the immediate cause of the act, but all we know for certain is that\r\nthe strong mind seemed suddenly to give way, and that Castlereagh could\r\nendure life no longer.  Seldom, indeed, has the death of a public man in\r\nmodern times been received with any such demonstrations as those which in\r\nmany places followed the news that Castlereagh had done himself to death.\r\nIn every community all over the country, and indeed all over Europe and\r\nthe civilized world, there were those who proclaimed that the death of\r\nsuch a man was a positive blessing to the human race.  Wherever men were\r\nstruggling against despotism and suffering from tyranny, there were those\r\nwho felt and who declared that the departure of Castlereagh from this\r\nworld was a benefit to humanity at large.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1822--Canning as Foreign Secretary]\r\n\r\nYet the man himself had not a cruel or an ignoble nature.  He had through\r\nall his life friends who loved him, and whose love his private character\r\nand conduct had well deserved.  But he had made himself the English\r\nrepresentative of the policy of the Holy Alliance at a time when every\r\nlover of liberty, and every believer in the development of free\r\ninstitutions and the beneficent results of their working, must have felt\r\nthat even the excesses of the French Revolution gave no excuse for the\r\ndeliberate setting-up of the doctrine of combined despotism.  Men of\r\nliberal opinions were in an especially angry mood just then because\r\nEngland seemed to have gone in deliberately for the policy which\r\nauthorized the \"crowned conspirators,\" as Sydney Smith called them, to\r\nimpose their edicts {37} on the whole continent of Europe.  This\r\ncondition of things may help to explain the cry of rejoicing with which\r\nthe news of Castlereagh's suicide was received in so many places.  The\r\nLondon crowd who followed the funeral procession to Westminster Abbey\r\ngreeted the removal of the coffin with yells of execration.  Byron wrote\r\nverses of savage bitterness about the dead man and his deed of\r\nself-murder--wrote some verses which no English publisher now would put\r\ninto print.\r\n\r\nThe death of Castlereagh became a turning-point in the career of Canning.\r\nThe whole voice of Liberal public opinion at once proclaimed that Canning\r\nwas the only man left in the country who was capable of redeeming\r\nEngland's foreign policy from the discredit and disgrace brought upon it\r\nby Castlereagh's Administration.  Even Lord Liverpool himself soon came\r\nto see that there was no other course left to him than to recommend the\r\nKing to offer to Canning the place of Foreign Secretary.  The King at\r\nfirst fought hard against the advice of his Prime Minister.  The letters\r\nwhich passed between him and Lord Liverpool are a curiosity in their way.\r\nGeorge had evidently persuaded himself that Canning was a monster of\r\ningratitude, who had committed a positively unpardonable offence against\r\nhis lord and master.  Indeed, it was only by playing upon the King's\r\npersonal vanity that Lord Liverpool at last brought him to accept the\r\nwholesome advice tendered to him.  Lord Liverpool reminded George again\r\nand again that one of the noblest of a monarch's prerogatives was his\r\npower to grant forgiveness to any repentant sinner.  George was probably\r\nbeginning to be weary of the discussion, and perhaps had natural\r\nshrewdness enough to see that it could only end in one way.  He therefore\r\nseemed to be taken by the appeal made to his generosity for pardon to a\r\npenitent offender, and he consented to make approaches to Canning with\r\nregard to the office of Foreign Secretary.  At first, however, the King\r\nmade so ostentatious a profession of his magnanimous desire to pardon the\r\nremorseful wrong-doer that Canning could not bring himself to accept the\r\nabject position which {38} his sovereign was arranging for him.  He\r\ntherefore declined at first to take any office under such conditions, and\r\nthe King had to come down from his high horse and treat with his subject\r\nin less arrogant fashion.  The King, at last, so far modified his\r\nlanguage as to leave the prerogative of mercy out of the question, and\r\nCanning, by the advice of all his friends and supporters, consented to\r\nbecome once more a member of the Administration and to undertake the\r\nduties of Foreign Secretary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1822-27--Canning's fitness for Foreign Minister]\r\n\r\nThis, we have said, was the turning-point in the career of Canning.  It\r\nwas also a turning-point in the modern history of England.  The violence\r\nof the reaction against the principles of the French Revolution had spent\r\nitself, and the public mind of this country was beginning to see that the\r\nturbulence of democracy was not likely to be safely dealt with by the\r\nsetting-up of despotism.  Canning himself was a living illustration of\r\nthe manner in which many great intellects had been affected by the course\r\nof events between the fall of Napoleon and the death of Castlereagh.\r\nCanning in his earlier days was in sympathy with the theories and\r\ndoctrines of popular liberty, and we have seen that up to the time of his\r\nactually entering Parliament it was generally believed he would rank\r\nhimself with the Whig Opposition.  But, like many other men who loved\r\nliberty too, he had been alarmed by the aggressive policy of Napoleon,\r\nand he believed that the position of England was best guaranteed by the\r\nlater policy of Pitt.  Then came the Congress of Vienna, and the\r\ndeliberate attempt to reconstruct the map of continental Europe, and to\r\ndecree the destinies of nations according to the despotic principles of\r\nthe Holy Alliance.\r\n\r\nCanning soon recognized the fact, obvious enough, one might have thought,\r\neven to a man of intellect far lower than that of Canning, that the\r\ntraditions, the instincts, and the feelings of a people must count for\r\nsomething in the form and manner of their government, and that there are\r\nforces at work in the hearts and minds of peoples which can no more be\r\ngoverned by imperial and royal decrees than can the forces of physical\r\nnature itself.  He {39} had unconsciously anticipated in his own mind\r\nthat doctrine of nationalities which afterwards came to play so momentous\r\nand so clearly recognized a part in the politics of the world.  He saw\r\nhow the policy of Castlereagh had made England the recognized ally of all\r\nthe old-world theories of divine right and unconditional loyalty, and had\r\nmade her a fellow-worker with the sovereigns of the Holy Alliance for the\r\nrestoration of tyranny all over the European continent.  He understood\r\nthe nature and the meaning of the new forces which were coming up in\r\npolitical life; he saw that the French Revolution was not destined to end\r\nin the mere restoration of mediaeval despotism.  He saw that the American\r\nRevolution had opened a new chapter in the history of the modern world,\r\nand that no man, whether he called himself Tory or Whig, was fit to be\r\nintrusted with the administration of England's foreign policy who had not\r\nlearned the lessons taught by the closing years of the eighteenth and the\r\nopening years of the nineteenth century.  Canning had much of that\r\nimaginative faculty without which there can hardly be any real\r\nstatesmanship.  Even his gift of humor helped him in this way.  He was\r\nable to understand the feelings, the tempers, and the conditions of men\r\nwith whom he had little opportunity of personal contact.  He could bring\r\nhimself into sympathy with the aspirations of peoples who were wholly\r\nforeign in race to him, and who would have been mere foreigners and\r\nnothing else in the eyes of many of his political colleagues.\r\n\r\nIf Lord Londonderry had lived and had continued, as no doubt he would\r\nhave done, to hold the Foreign Office, he would have been England's\r\nrepresentative at the Congress of Verona.  The new chances opened by his\r\ndeath inspired that demand for the services of Canning which compelled\r\nthe King at last to yield and invite Canning back to his old place.  The\r\nCongress of Verona was in fact a reassembling of the Holy Alliance for\r\nthe purpose of taking once more into consideration the disturbed state of\r\nEurope, and laying down once more the lines of the only policy which,\r\naccording to the judgment of the despotic {40} sovereigns and their\r\nministers, could restore peace to the Continent.  The disturbances arose\r\nsimply from the fact that some of the European populations were rising up\r\nagainst the policy of the Holy Alliance, and were agitating for the\r\nprinciples of constitutional government.  The immediate and ostensible\r\nobject for the summoning of the Congress was the fact that Greece had\r\nbeen trying to throw off the yoke of Turkey, and that the leading members\r\nof the Holy Alliance believed it was their business and their right to\r\nsay what was to be done with Greece, and whether or not it was for their\r\nconvenience that she should be held in perpetual bondage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1822-27--England and the Congress of Verona]\r\n\r\nBut there were troubles also in Spain, because the Spanish sovereign had\r\nbeen giving way to the desire of his people for a system of\r\nconstitutional government and for the recognition of the principle that a\r\npeople has something to do with the making as well as with the obeying of\r\nlaws.  The restored Bourbon Government in France declared that it saw\r\ndangers to its own rights and its own security in these concessions to\r\npopular demand, made in a country which was only divided from French\r\nterritory by the barrier of the Pyrenees.  It was intimated in the\r\nclearest manner that the Bourbon Government of France would be prepared,\r\nif necessary, to undertake armed intervention in the affairs of Spain in\r\norder to prevent the Spaniards from thus setting a bad example to the\r\nsubjects of the Bourbon dynasty.  Then the condition of Poland was giving\r\nsome alarm to the despotic monarchs of the Continent everywhere; for, if\r\nPoland were to rise and were allowed to assert its liberty, who could\r\ntell on what soil, sacred to despotism, other rebellious movements might\r\nnot also break out.  Therefore, the monarchs of the Holy Alliance were\r\nmuch perturbed, and came to the conclusion that, as the Congress of\r\nVienna had not succeeded in enforcing all its edicts, the only wise thing\r\nwould be to call together another Congress, to be held this time at\r\nVerona, and there go over all the work again with greater vigor and\r\ndetermination.\r\n\r\nNow it was unavoidable that England should be invited {41} to take part\r\nin this Congress, seeing that, but for the assistance given by England,\r\nthere would never have been a chance for even the Congress of Vienna to\r\nmake any attempt at the regulation of Europe.  Besides, it was well known\r\nthat Lord Londonderry had been a main instrument in the formation and\r\nexecution of the plans laid down by the Congress of Vienna, and although\r\nEngland, on that occasion, had not been able to go quite as far as her\r\nallies would have wished her to accompany them, yet it was not thought\r\npossible to leave England without an invitation to be represented at the\r\nCongress of Verona.  On the death of Lord Londonderry it was resolved by\r\nthe English Government to send the Duke of Wellington to Verona.  The\r\nDuke had never professed any particular ideas of his own with regard to\r\nforeign policy, but he was the most loyal of men in obeying the\r\ninstructions of those who were properly authorized to direct his\r\nmovements, and in whom he could place his confidence.  When Canning\r\nconsented to accept office the Duke at once put himself into\r\ncommunication with the new Foreign Secretary, and wrote to him from Paris\r\ninforming Canning of his belief that the Spanish question would be\r\nbrought, in some shape or other, under the consideration of the Congress,\r\nand asking Canning for instructions as to the course which he ought to\r\nadopt.  Canning despatched a reply to the Duke, one passage of which may\r\nbe regarded as a full illustration of the new principle which he had\r\ndetermined to establish in England's foreign policy.  The words of the\r\ngreat statesman cannot be read with too close an attention.  Canning\r\ndeclares that, \"If there be a determined project to interfere by force or\r\nby menace in the present struggle in Spain, so convinced are his\r\nMajesty's Government of the uselessness and danger of any such\r\ninterference, so objectionable does it appear to them in principle as\r\nwell as in practical execution, that when the necessity arises--or, I\r\nwould rather say, when the opportunity offers--I am to instruct your\r\nGrace at once frankly and peremptorily to declare that to any such\r\ninterference, come what may, his Majesty will not be a party.\"\r\n\r\n{42}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1822-27--Canning and the Bourbons]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington faithfully obeyed the instructions which had been\r\ngiven to him.  He made it clear to the Congress of Verona that England\r\nwould not sanction any project for the interference of foreign sovereigns\r\nwith the domestic affairs of Spain.  When the Duke found that his\r\narguments and his remonstrances were of no avail, he withdrew from the\r\nCongress altogether and left the members of the Holy Alliance to take on\r\nthemselves the full responsibility of their own policy.  Now it would be\r\nhardly possible to overrate the importance of the step thus taken by\r\nEngland at a great crisis in the public affairs of Europe.  The reign of\r\nGeorge the Fourth would be memorable in history if it had been\r\nconsecrated by nothing but this event.  The utter disruption between the\r\nold state policy and the new was proclaimed by the instructions which\r\nCanning sent to the Duke of Wellington, and which were faithfully carried\r\nout by the Duke.  No English Government has, in later days, ventured to\r\nprofess openly any other foreign policy than that announced by Canning.\r\nOther ministers in later times may have attempted, now and then, to\r\nswerve from it in this direction and in that, and to cover their evasion\r\nof it by specious pleas, but the new doctrine set up by Canning has never\r\nsince his time found avowed apostates among English statesmen.  It would\r\nhave been well if such a principle could have inspired the foreign policy\r\nof England in the days when the French Revolution broke out, and if\r\nEngland had then proclaimed that she would be no party to any attempt\r\nmade by foreign States to prevent the people of France from settling\r\ntheir own systems of government for themselves.  Europe might have been\r\nsaved a series of disastrous wars.  France might have been relieved from\r\ncounter-revolutions, seasons of anarchy, and seasons of military\r\ndespotism.  England might long have had friendly neighbors where even yet\r\nshe has perhaps only concealed enemies.\r\n\r\nThe designs of the Holy Alliance soon made themselves manifest.  The\r\nFrench Government had brought so much pressure to bear on the feeble King\r\nof Spain that he revoked the Constitution which, at a better moment, he\r\nhad {43} granted to his people.  There was an attempt at revolution in\r\nSpain, and the attempt was put down by the strong hand with the\r\nassistance of France, and the leading rebels were at once conducted to\r\nthe scaffold.  Portugal still kept those free institutions which England\r\nhad enabled her to preserve, and still retained her sympathy with\r\nfreedom.  Canning soon saw that a part of the policy of the French\r\nGovernment was to bring Portugal also into subjection, and against this\r\ndanger he provided by a bold announcement of policy.  He declared in the\r\nHouse of Commons that if Portugal were, of her own accord, to engage\r\nherself in a war with France, the English Government would not feel bound\r\nto take any active part in the struggle, but that if the King of Spain\r\nwere to accept or call in the assistance of the King of France to\r\nsuppress Portugal, the Government of England would put its armies into\r\nthe field to maintain its ancient ally.  Then there arose a great\r\nquestion concerning the Spanish colonies and possessions across the\r\nAtlantic.  The policy of France was to enable Spain to reconquer some of\r\nher American colonies which had long been withdrawing themselves from\r\ntheir condition of subjection, and the scheme of French statesmen\r\nevidently was that Spain would hand over some of her American possessions\r\nas a tribute of gratitude to France for the services she had rendered to\r\nthe cause of absolutism in Spain.\r\n\r\nOn this question, too, Canning announced to the House of Commons a\r\ndetermination on the part of the English Government which put an\r\neffectual stop to this audacious policy.  Canning declared that, although\r\nSpain had long since lost any real control over her transatlantic\r\ncolonies, yet if she were to attempt their actual reconquest for herself\r\nEngland, however little in sympathy with such a purpose, might not feel\r\nthat it was any part of her business to interfere by force of arms.  But\r\nhe went on to tell the House that, if Spain should claim the right to\r\nhand over any of those colonies to France as a part of the policy\r\narranged between France and Spain, the English Government would then\r\nintervene directly and at once on behalf {44} of the Spanish-American\r\ncolonies.  This was the course of action which Canning described to the\r\nHouse of Commons in an immortal phrase when he told the House \"that he\r\nhad called in the New World to redress the balance of the Old.\"  No words\r\nemployed by an English minister during the last century have been more\r\noften quoted, and none have ever more thoroughly justified themselves in\r\nhistory.  The schemes of the French and the Spanish Bourbons were\r\nblighted in the bud by Canning's memorable declaration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1822-27--The Monroe Doctrine]\r\n\r\nCanning had indeed called in the New World to redress the balance of the\r\nOld in a sense more complete than the accepted meaning of his words, at\r\nthe time, appeared to signify.  He had secured for his policy the moral\r\nco-operation of the New World's greatest power--the Republic of the\r\nUnited States.  It was on the inspiration of Canning that the President\r\nof the United States embodied in a message to Congress that declaration\r\nof principle which has ever since been known as the Monroe doctrine.\r\nPresident Monroe, who knew well that he was proclaiming no doctrine which\r\nhis influence and his authority with his country would not enable him to\r\ncarry out, made known to Congress that it was his intention to warn\r\nEuropean sovereigns against the danger of setting up their systems in any\r\npart of the New World.  The United States, according to President\r\nMonroe's declaration, had no idea of interfering with existing systems,\r\nbut if European sovereigns were to set up governments of their own on any\r\nother part of the American continents and against the wishes of the\r\npopulations, the United States must regard any such attempt as a menace\r\nand a danger to the American Republic.  This is in substance the meaning\r\nof that Monroe doctrine which has often been criticised unfairly or\r\nignorantly on this side of the Atlantic, and its proclamation was\r\nundoubtedly due, at the time, to the advice which came from George\r\nCanning.  President Monroe never meant to say that the Government of the\r\nUnited States had any idea of interfering with British North America or\r\nwith the Empire of Brazil.  The {45} Canadian provinces of Great Britain\r\nwere, of course, perfectly free to remain a loyal part of the British\r\nEmpire so long as it suited the interests and the inclinations of the\r\nCanadians.  If the people of Brazil chose to be governed by an emperor,\r\nthe United States Government did not assert any right to interfere with\r\ntheir choice.  But what the Monroe doctrine did declare was that if any\r\nforeign sovereigns attempted to bring liberated American colonies again\r\nunder their sway, or to set up by force new subject colonies on American\r\nshores against the wishes of the populations concerned, the United States\r\nmust regard such action as a menace and a danger to the American\r\nRepublic, and must not be expected to look quietly on without any attempt\r\nat intervention.  This was, in the truest sense, the announcement of a\r\npolicy of peace, for it frankly made known to the despotic rulers of the\r\nOld World what their risk must be if they ventured on the futile\r\nexperiment of setting up despotic states on the shores of the New World.\r\n\r\nIt would have been well indeed if European monarchs at a later day had\r\nalways remembered the warning and rightly estimated its weight.  It would\r\nhave been well for Louis Napoleon if at the zenith of his imperial\r\nsuccess he had studied that message of President Monroe and properly\r\ninterpreted its meaning.  Such a course would have prevented him from\r\nmaking his ill-starred attempt to set up a Mexican Empire by the force of\r\nFrench arms on the ruins of a subjugated Mexican Republic.  It would have\r\nsaved him from defeat and disaster, and would have saved the unhappy,\r\nill-advised, and gallant Maximilian, his puppet emperor, from a tragic\r\nfate.  The attempt to retrieve the disgrace of his enforced withdrawal\r\nfrom Mexico led Louis Napoleon into that policy of the desperate\r\ngambler's last throw which ended in the occupation of Paris and the fall\r\nof the Second Empire.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the policy of Canning had accomplished its purpose.  The\r\nCongress of Verona had been an idle piece of business, the sovereigns of\r\nthe Holy Alliance had found that their day was done, and the New World\r\nhad been successfully called in to redress the balance of the Old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{46}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE CLOSE OF CANNING'S CAREER.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1820-30--Sir William Knighton]\r\n\r\nThe King was at first disposed to show some alarm at the bold policy of\r\nCanning.  George, to do him justice, was in general a lover of peace,\r\nand for a while he did not see how the declarations of his Foreign\r\nMinister could lead to anything less than an outbreak of war on the\r\npart of the Continental sovereigns, who thus seemed to be challenged to\r\nassert what they believed to be their rights.  His doubt and dread took\r\nthe form of more or less concealed grumblings against Canning, and\r\nefforts to induce his other ministers to make a common cause with him\r\nagainst the adventurous Foreign Minister.  Canning, however, saw that\r\nthe crisis which he had to face was one which makes a bold and resolute\r\npolicy, frankly avowed on the part of a strong Government, the best or\r\nthe only means of securing peace.  He was able, after a while, to\r\nimpress his royal master with the justice of his belief, and the King\r\ngraciously received the envoy accredited to his Court on behalf of one\r\nof the new American Republics.  Then the rest of the work went on\r\nsmoothly, the lines of the new policy were laid down, and the\r\nsovereigns of the Holy Alliance did not venture to transgress them.\r\n\r\nThe King was, at all times, much in the habit of attempting to make\r\nencroachments on the proper domain of any minister who had the courage\r\nand the strength to oppose him, and Canning had to endure a good deal\r\nof interference of this kind.  The Foreign Minister patiently and\r\nsteadfastly held his own, and George did not see his way to come to any\r\nopen rupture.  The King found it hard to make up his mind to settle\r\ndown to the part of a purely constitutional sovereign.  Perhaps the\r\npart had not yet {47} been clearly enough evolved from the conditions\r\nof the time, and George, even when he had the best intentions, was\r\nalways lapsing back into the way of his predecessors.  George was a\r\ngreat letter-writer.  To adopt a modern phrase, he \"fancied himself\" as\r\na composer of State papers.  It seems marvellous now that a man so lazy\r\nby nature should have found the time to pen so many documents of the\r\nkind.  Perhaps even in the most commonplace ways of life we are often\r\ncompelled to wonder at the amount of work a man habitually lazy can\r\nsometimes contrive to cram into his day's doings.  George was now as\r\nmuch addicted to indolence, to mere amusement, and to pleasures as he\r\nhad been during earlier seasons of his career.  He was just as fond of\r\nthe society of his intimates and of all the pastimes and social\r\nenjoyments in which he and they delighted.  He had not reformed any of\r\nhis habits, and his growing years did not bring him any steady resolve\r\nto apply himself to the actual business of his position.  Yet he seemed\r\nto be frequently inspired by fitful desires to display himself as the\r\ngenuine ruler of a State and to let his ministers know they must not\r\nattempt to do without him.\r\n\r\nOne of the King's prime favorites was Sir William Knighton, who had\r\nbegun by being a physician, had made his way into Court circles, and\r\nbecome the private and confidential adviser of the King.  Sir William\r\nKnighton had been appointed to the office of Keeper of the Royal Purse,\r\nand in that capacity he had rendered much service to George by\r\nendeavoring with skill and pertinacity to keep income and expenditure\r\non something more nearly approaching to a balance than had been the way\r\nin former days.  Knighton's was not exactly a State office and it gave\r\nhim no position among ministers, but the King constantly used him as a\r\ngo-between when he desired to have private dealings with any of his\r\nrecognized advisers, and Knighton was the recipient of his most\r\nconfidential communications.  From the letters and memoranda which\r\nbelong to this time we are enabled to learn much of the real feelings\r\nof King George towards some of his ministers, and to {48} understand\r\nthe difficulties with which Canning had to deal while endeavoring to\r\nmake his enlightened policy the accepted and recognized policy of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1822-27--The war of Greek independence]\r\n\r\nThe condition of Greece began to be a serious trouble to the statesmen\r\nof Europe.  Greece was under the sway of the Sultan of Turkey, and its\r\npeople may fairly be described as in a state of chronic insurrection.\r\nThe Greeks, even in their lowest degree of national decadence, were far\r\ntoo intelligent, too ready-witted, and too persevering ever to become\r\nthe mere slaves of an Ottoman ruler.  There was something\r\ninextinguishable in the national life of the country, and it seemed as\r\nif no pressure of tyranny, no amount of humiliation, could make the\r\nGreeks forget the history of their glorious days and the deeds of their\r\nancestry, or compel them to stifle, even for a season, their hopes of\r\nnational independence.  A great struggle broke out against the Ottoman\r\nrule, and it roused the passionate sympathy of the lovers of freedom\r\nall over the world.  Byron threw his whole soul into the cause, and\r\nstirred the hearts of his countrymen by his appeals on behalf of the\r\nGreek struggle for independence.  Numbers of brave Englishmen gladly\r\nrisked their lives to help the Greeks.  Lord Cochrane, who was\r\nafterwards described as the last of the English sea-kings, rushed over\r\nto Greece to give his genius and his daring to the help of the Greeks\r\nin their struggle against overwhelming odds.  A speech of Lord John\r\nRussell's which he delivered in the House of Commons within the hearing\r\nof living men described with admirable effect the enthusiasm which was\r\naroused in England for the cause of Greece and the efforts which were\r\nopenly made even by members of the ruling class to raise money and to\r\nsend out soldiers and sailors to enable the Greeks to hold their own\r\nagainst the Ottoman enemy.  Many Englishmen bearing historic names\r\njoined with Byron and Cochrane in giving their personal help to the\r\nstruggling Greeks, and indeed from every civilized country in the world\r\nsuch volunteers poured in to stand by Bozzaris and Kanaris in their\r\ndesperate fight for the rescue of Greece.  The odds, however, were\r\nheavily against the Greeks.  Their {49} supply of arms, ammunition, and\r\ngeneral commissariat for the field was poor and inadequate, and they\r\nwere sadly wanting in drill and organization.  Splendid feats of\r\nbravery were displayed on land and on sea, but it seemed only too\r\ncertain that if the Greeks were left to their own resources, or even if\r\nthey were not sustained by the open support of some great foreign\r\nState, the Ottoman Power must triumph before long.\r\n\r\nThe best part of the war on the side of Turkey was carried on by\r\nIbrahim Pasha, the adopted son of Mehemet Ali, who ruled over Egypt as\r\na vassal sovereign to the Sultan of Turkey.  Ibrahim Pasha had great\r\nmilitary capacity; he was full of energy, resource, and perseverance,\r\nand the Turkish Sultan could not have had a better man to undertake the\r\ntask of conducting the campaign.  The sympathies of Russia went\r\nstrongly with the Greeks, or perhaps it might be more correct to say\r\nthat the policy of Russia was directed against the Turks.  At that\r\ntime, as in later days, the public opinion of Western Europe was not\r\nalways certain whether the movements of Russian statesmanship were\r\ngoverned more by the desire to strengthen Greece or by the desire to\r\nweaken Turkey.  Canning had always been a sympathizer with the cause of\r\nGreece.  In his early days his sympathy had taken poetic form, and now\r\nat last it had an opportunity of assuming a more practical shape.  He\r\nwould have wished well to any effort made by Russia for the\r\nemancipation of Greece, but he feared that if the effort were to be\r\nleft to Russia alone the result might be a great European war, and his\r\npolicy was above all things a policy of peace.  His idea was to form an\r\nalliance which should exercise so commanding an influence as to render\r\nany prolonged resistance impossible.  He succeeded in impressing his\r\nideas and his arguments so effectively upon the Governments of France\r\nand Russia as to induce them to enter into a treaty with England for\r\nthe avowed purpose of watching events in Eastern Europe, endeavoring to\r\nkeep the conduct of the war within the limits of humanity, and bringing\r\nit to as early a close as possible.\r\n\r\n{50}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1824--Death of Lord Byron]\r\n\r\nThe combined fleets of the three Powers were sent into the\r\nMediterranean for the purpose of watching the movements of the Turkish\r\nand Egyptian fleets, which were threatening the shores of Greece.  Sir\r\nEdward Codrington, the British Admiral, was in command of the\r\nexpedition, and his instructions enjoined on him, in the usual official\r\nway, the necessity of caution and circumspection in all his movements.\r\nSomething happened which brought the policy of caution to a speedy end.\r\nA report, which found some credit at the time, gave out that Sir Edward\r\nCodrington had received an unofficial hint that there was no necessity\r\nfor carrying caution too far; but, however the event may have been\r\nbrought about, it is certain that a collision did take place between\r\nthe allied fleets and those which were championing the authority of the\r\nSultan, and the result was that the Turkish and Egyptian war vessels\r\nwere destroyed.  This was the battle of Navarino, which was afterwards\r\ndescribed in the language of British authority as \"an untoward event.\"\r\nUntoward, in fact, it was not, for the purposes which Canning had in\r\nview, because it put an end to all the resistance of the Ottoman Power,\r\nand the independence of Greece as a self-governing nation was\r\nestablished, and recognized.  We have been somewhat anticipating events\r\nin order not to break up the story of the Greek struggle for\r\nindependence, but it has to be said that Canning did not live to see\r\nthe success of his own policy.  Before the battle of Navarino had been\r\nfought, the career of the great statesman had come to an end.  We shall\r\nhave to retrace our steps, for there is much still left untold in the\r\nstory of Canning's career.\r\n\r\nThat struggle for Greek independence will always be remembered in the\r\nhistory of English literature.  It cost England the life of one of her\r\ngreatest modern poets.  Lord Byron died of fever in the swamps of\r\nMissolonghi on April 19, 1824, not long after he had left the Greek\r\nIslands to conduct his part of the campaign on the mainland of Greece.\r\nIt was not his good fortune to die sword in hand fighting on the\r\nbattle-field for the cause which he loved so well.  It was not his good\r\nfortune even to have had a {51} chance of doing much of a soldier's\r\nwork in that cause.  There can be no doubt that if he had been graced\r\nwith opportunity he would have shown that he had a leader's capacity as\r\nwell as a soldier's courage--that, as Fortinbras says of Hamlet, \"He\r\nwas likely had he been put on to have proved most royally.\"  He had\r\nonly completed his thirty-sixth year shortly before his death, and the\r\npoem in which he commemorated his birthday can never be read without\r\nfeelings of genuine emotion.  His death created a profound sensation,\r\nnot only in England, but all through the civilized world.  Not long\r\nsince we were all favored with an opportunity of hearing how the boy,\r\nafterwards to be famous as Alfred Tennyson, was thrilled by the news of\r\nByron's death, and how it seemed to him to be like the ending of the\r\nworld.  The passion of partisanship for and against Byron as a poet and\r\nas a man has long since died away, and indeed it might perhaps be said\r\nthat the reaction which, for a time, followed the outburst of his fame\r\nhas spent itself as well.  It may be taken now as the common judgment\r\nof the world that Byron was one of the great forces of modern poetry,\r\nand that his political sympathies sometimes had, as well as his poetic\r\nefforts, the inspiration of genius to guide them.\r\n\r\nWe must now return to the career of Canning as we left it at the time\r\nwhen he had made his great declaration of policy with regard to the\r\nrevolted colonies of Spain on the American shores, and when he was as\r\nyet engaged in shaping the policy which was destined to end in the\r\nemancipation of Greece.  There were questions of home government coming\r\nmore and more to the front every day, which much disturbed the mind of\r\nKing George, and made the business of keeping an Administration\r\ntogether more and more difficult for his advisers.  The financial\r\npolicy of the country had been gradually undergoing a change, owing to\r\nthe foresight and enlightenment of some few among English statesmen.\r\nLord Liverpool, to do him justice, was always a man of somewhat\r\nadvanced views on questions of finance, although an inveterate Tory in\r\nall that related to popular representation and freedom of speech.\r\nCanning and his {52} friend William Huskisson were leading the way in\r\nthe movement towards an enlightened financial system.  Huskisson had\r\ndone more than any other man, with the exception of Canning himself, to\r\nimprove the systems of taxation.  What may perhaps be called the\r\nscientific principle in the raising of revenue was only in process of\r\ndevelopment, and to many statesmen no better idea of increasing\r\nsupplies seemed to have occurred than the simple plan of increasing the\r\nrate of custom or excise duty on the first article of general\r\nconsumption which came under notice.  Huskisson represented the new\r\nideas, and put them into action whenever he was allowed a fair chance\r\nof making such an experiment.  He had often held administrative office,\r\nhad been Secretary of the Treasury, President of the Board of Trade,\r\nand Secretary for the Colonies, and had accomplished the removal of\r\nmany restrictions on the commercial dealings of the colonies with\r\nforeign countries and the reduction of many antiquated and embarrassing\r\nimport duties.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1770-1830--Daniel O'Connell]\r\n\r\nCanning and Huskisson were always close friends and often ministerial\r\ncolleagues, and they two may be said to have led the way towards the\r\nsystem of free trade to which the time had not yet come for Robert Peel\r\nto give his complete adhesion.  The great question of electoral reform\r\nwas coming up, and Charles Grey and Henry Brougham were among its most\r\nconspicuous leaders.  Canning did not take to Parliamentary reform,\r\nalthough he was what might be described as an advanced Liberal on most\r\nother questions of national importance.  The Duke of Wellington was\r\nstrongly opposed to any proposals for a change in the Parliamentary\r\nsystem, and this was one of the few great questions on which Canning\r\nand he were in habitual agreement.  Then there was the still more\r\npressing question of political equality for the Catholics of the three\r\nkingdoms.  Lord John Russell succeeded later on in carrying the repeal\r\nof the Test and Corporation Acts which precluded Protestant Dissenters\r\nfrom holding political or municipal office, but the attempt to obtain\r\nthe rights of equal citizenship for subjects of the King who belonged\r\n{53} to the Church of Rome had to encounter much greater difficulties.\r\n\r\nAs might easily be expected, Ireland became the main battle-field of\r\nthis struggle.  We have already recorded the fact that Pitt had been\r\ngreatly assisted in passing the Act of Union between Great Britain and\r\nIreland and abolishing Grattan's Parliament by the hopes which he held\r\nout that the union of the legislatures would be followed by a complete\r\nmeasure of Catholic emancipation.  George the Third refused point-blank\r\nto give his assent to any such measure, or even to listen to any\r\nproposal for its introduction, declaring again and again that his\r\ncoronation oath absolutely forbade him to entertain an idea of the\r\nkind.  In the end, as we have seen, Pitt gave in and undertook never\r\nagain to worry the mind of his conscientious sovereign by any talk\r\nabout relief to George the Third's Roman Catholic subjects.  But it\r\nsoon became evident that in this as in other instances the resolve of\r\nthe most headstrong monarch, and the promise of the most yielding Prime\r\nMinister, cannot always induce a population to put up passively with a\r\nmanifest grievance.  In Ireland, where six out of every seven of the\r\npeople belonged to the Church of Rome, and where the demand for\r\nCatholic Emancipation had long been championed by the greatest and the\r\nmost patriotic of Protestant Irishmen, it was utterly impossible that\r\nany King and any minister could impose submission on such a question.\r\nBy the time at which we have now arrived the Catholics of Ireland had\r\nfound a political leader of their own faith.\r\n\r\nDaniel O'Connell was undoubtedly one of the greatest advocates a\r\npopular cause has ever had in modern times.  He was an Irishman who had\r\nbecome one of the most successful advocates in the Irish law courts,\r\nand as a popular orator he had no rival in his own country.  He had\r\nmade himself the leader in Ireland of the movement for Catholic\r\nEmancipation, and he had kindled an enthusiasm there which any English\r\nstatesman of ordinary intelligence and foresight might easily have seen\r\nit would be impossible to extinguish so long as there was a struggle to\r\nbe fought.  {54} Canning had always been in favor of Catholic\r\nEmancipation.  Lord Liverpool was, of course, entirely opposed to it,\r\nand almost until the last the Duke of Wellington held out against it.\r\nGeorge the Fourth, for all his earlier associations with Fox and\r\nSheridan, declared himself now to have inherited to the full his\r\nfather's indomitable conscientious objection to any measure of Catholic\r\nEmancipation.  George seemed, in fact, to have suddenly become filled\r\nwith a passionate fervor of Protestant piety when any one talked to him\r\nabout political equality for his Catholic subjects.  He declared again\r\nand again that no earthly consideration could induce him to fall away\r\nfrom the religious convictions of his father on this subject, and the\r\ncoronation oath had again become, to use Erskine's satirical phrase,\r\n\"one of the four orders of the State.\"  When reading some of George's\r\nletters and discourses on the subject, it is almost impossible not to\r\nbelieve that he really must have fancied himself in earnest when he\r\nmade such protestations.  In private life he frequently delivered long\r\nspeeches, sometimes with astonishing fluency, sometimes with occasional\r\ninterruptions of stammering, in vindication of his hostility to any\r\nproposal for Catholic Emancipation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1827--Lord Liverpool's successor]\r\n\r\nIn the common language of the political world of that time the members\r\nof a Government who opposed the Catholic claims were called Protestant\r\nministers, and the members in favor of the Catholic claims were\r\ndescribed as Catholic ministers.  In fact, it has had to be explained,\r\nfor the sake of clearness, by some recent writers, that the word\r\n\"Catholic\" was constantly used in George the Fourth's time merely to\r\nsignify pro-Catholic.  When Canning was spoken of as a Catholic\r\nstatesman there was not the least idea of describing him as a member of\r\nthe Church of Rome, and, indeed, the words \"Roman Catholic\" hardly come\r\nup in the controversies of those days.  When Mr. Lecky spoke during a\r\nrecent Parliamentary debate of Catholics and Protestants, he was\r\ngravely rebuked by some divines of the Established Church who were\r\nunder the impression that he was in some way or other truckling to the\r\n{55} claims of the Papacy when he used the word \"Catholic\" to describe\r\nthe worshippers in the Church of Rome.  Mr. Lecky was put to the\r\ntrouble of explaining that he used the words \"Protestant\" and\r\n\"Catholic\" in the ordinary significance given to them during long\r\ngenerations of political controversy.\r\n\r\nA crisis was suddenly brought about by the illness of Lord Liverpool.\r\nThe Protestant statesman was stricken down by an attack which for a\r\ntime deprived him of consciousness, and even after his partial recovery\r\nleft him in a state which made it clear to all his friends that his\r\nwork as an administrator was done.  There was no hope whatever of his\r\nresuming official work, and the question which mainly occupied the mind\r\nof the King and of those around him was not what was to become of Lord\r\nLiverpool, but whom it would be most convenient for the King to appoint\r\nas his successor.  Naturally every eye was turned on Canning, whether\r\nin hope or in fear.  As Lord Palmerston said of himself many years\r\nlater, so it might be said of Canning, he was the \"inevitable man.\"\r\nThe whole civilized world was filled with his fame.  His course of\r\npolicy had made England stronger than she had ever been since the death\r\nof the younger Pitt.  Even King George could not venture to believe in\r\nthe possibility of passing him over, and King George's chief objection\r\nto him was found in the fact that Canning was in favor of the Catholic\r\nclaims.  George thought the matter over a few days, consulted Lord\r\nEldon and other advisers, and found that nobody could inspire him with\r\nany real hope of being able to form an enduring Ministry without\r\nCanning.\r\n\r\nThen the King sent for Canning, and Canning made his own course quite\r\nclear.  He came to the point at once.  He assumed that the great\r\ndifficulty was to be found in the pressure of the Catholic question,\r\nand he advised the King to form a Ministry of his own way of thinking\r\non that subject and to do the best he could.  The King, however,\r\nexplained that it would be futile for him to think that any Ministry so\r\ncomposed could carry on the work of administration just then, and he\r\ngave Canning many {56} assurances of his own entire approval of his\r\nforeign policy, and declared that no one knew better than he did how\r\nmuch the power of England had increased with Continental States since\r\nCanning had obtained the conduct of her foreign affairs.  Thus urged,\r\nCanning consented to undertake the formation of a Ministry, but he did\r\nso on the express condition that he should not only have the King's\r\nfull confidence and be free to take his own course, but that he should\r\nbe known to hold such a position and to have the absolute authority of\r\nthe sovereign to sustain him.  Canning's mind was, in fact, clearly\r\nmade up.  He would either be a real Prime Minister, or he would have no\r\nplace in the new Administration, and would become once again an\r\nindependent member.  There was nothing else to be done, and the King\r\ngave Canning full authority to make his own arrangements.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1827--Defection among Canning's supporters]\r\n\r\nThe task which Canning had nominally undertaken was the reconstruction\r\nof the Ministry, but no one knew better than he did that it really\r\namounted to the formation of a new Ministry.  Canning was well aware\r\nthat the Duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel would not consent to\r\nserve under him in any Administration.  The Duke of Wellington was at\r\nthis time entirely opposed to any recognition of the Catholic claims,\r\nand, more than that, he had never been in favor of the principles of\r\nforeign policy adopted and proclaimed by Canning.  Between the two men,\r\nindeed, there was very little political sympathy, and Canning had got\r\nit into his mind, rightly or wrongly, that the Duke of Wellington had\r\ndone his best to disparage him and to weaken his authority as Foreign\r\nMinister.  Sir Robert Peel occupied a somewhat different position.  He,\r\ntoo, was opposed to the Catholic claims; but he was a statesman of a\r\nfar higher order than the Duke of Wellington, and it might always\r\nsafely be assumed of him that he would rightly estimate the force of\r\npublic opinion, and that when a great movement of political reform had\r\nproved itself to be irresistible Peel would never encourage a policy of\r\nfutile resistance.\r\n\r\nPeel's attitude is well described in the admirable life of {57} George\r\nCanning published by Mr. Frank Harrison Hill in 1887.  \"Peel,\" says Mr.\r\nHill, \"did not believe in governing against Parliamentary and public\r\nopinion.\"  \"To him the art of government was the measurement of social\r\nforces, and the adaptation of policy to their direction and intensity.\r\nWhen it was clear to him that a thing must be done, and that his help\r\nwas essential to the doing of it, his duty was plainly marked out.\"  Up\r\nto this time, however, Peel did not see that the Catholic question had\r\nreached such a stage, and he probably did not believe that it would\r\never reach such a stage.  He had opposed Catholic claims thus far\r\nwhenever the opportunity arose, and he could not undertake to serve\r\nunder a Prime Minister who was openly in favor of recognizing those\r\nclaims.  We shall have to tell, before long, in the course of this\r\nhistory, how Peel came to see that Canning was right in his policy, and\r\nhow he came to be the Prime Minister by whom it was carried to success,\r\nand how he brought the Duke of Wellington along with him.  But at the\r\ntime which we have now reached Peel still believed his own policy on\r\nthe subject of Roman Catholic Emancipation to be the rightful policy\r\nfor the guidance of the sovereign and the State, and he therefore found\r\nit impossible to serve in the new Administration.  Five other members\r\nof the existing Government, besides Sir Robert Peel, resigned their\r\nplaces on the same grounds.  One was, of course, the Duke of\r\nWellington, and another was Lord Chancellor Eldon.  Some influential\r\npeers who were not members of the Government made it known that they\r\ncould not give their support to any Administration which admitted the\r\npossibility of recognizing the Catholic claims.\r\n\r\nCanning's heart might well have sunk within him for a time when he\r\nfound himself abandoned by such colleagues and thrown over by such\r\nsupporters.  He actually waited upon the King, and asked his permission\r\nto give up the undertaking for the formation of a new Ministry.  The\r\nKing, however, probably felt that he had gone too far in his support of\r\nCanning to draw back at such a moment.  It is very likely that he was\r\ndispleased by the pertinacity of {58} the resistance which men like\r\nWellington and Peel and Eldon offered to any act of policy approved by\r\nhim, and he had undoubtedly by this time come to have a strong faith,\r\nnot only in Canning's capacity, but also in Canning's good fortune.\r\nWhatever may have been his chief inspiration, he certainly had an\r\nopportune season of enlightenment, and he refused to allow Canning to\r\nwithdraw from the task assigned to him.  Accordingly Canning became\r\nPrime Minister, and united in his own person the offices of First Lord\r\nof the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1827--Canning and Lord Grey]\r\n\r\nSir John Copley, raised to the peerage under the title of Lord\r\nLyndhurst, became Lord Chancellor in succession to Lord Eldon, and the\r\nHouse of Lords thus obtained a member who was destined to be one of its\r\nforemost orators, to maintain a rivalry in Parliamentary debate with\r\nBrougham and the great Tory orator and leader, Lord Derby, and to be\r\nlistened to with admiration by men still living, who are proud to\r\nremember that they heard some of his great speeches.  It may be\r\nobserved that Lord Eldon, whose retirement made way for Lord Lyndhurst,\r\nhad been Lord Chancellor for twenty-six years, with the exception of\r\none year when he was out of office.  Huskisson became Treasurer of the\r\nNavy and President of the Board of Trade in the new Administration.\r\nLord Palmerston was Secretary at War, and Frederick Robinson, now made\r\nLord Goderich, who was in thorough sympathy with Canning and Huskisson\r\non questions of financial policy, was Colonial and War Secretary, the\r\nlatter office according to the arrangements of that time a position\r\nhaving quite different functions from those of the Secretary of War.\r\nThe arrangements for the new Ministry were completed in April, 1827.\r\nCanning had now reached the highest point of his career.  His policy\r\nhad already been marked out for him, for England, and for Europe.  The\r\ntreaty between England, France, and Russia for the protection of\r\nGreece, which became a formal instrument after his accession to the\r\noffice of Prime Minister, was the result of the efforts which he had\r\nmade before Lord Liverpool's sudden illness {59} led to the break-up of\r\nthe Liverpool Administration.  Canning had little time left him to turn\r\nhis new and great position to account.  Fame, as Mr. Hill well says,\r\nwas a sucked orange to George Canning when he accepted the office of\r\nPrime Minister.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties against which the new Ministry had to contend were\r\nmany and great.  Canning had the support of such Whigs as Brougham in\r\nthe House of Commons, but in the House of Lords he had many powerful\r\nopponents, and the influence of the House of Lords then counted for\r\nmore than it does at present.  In the House of Lords, too, Lord Grey\r\nbitterly and pertinaciously opposed him.  Grey was then one of the\r\nleading advocates of Parliamentary reform, and Canning could not see\r\nhis way to ally himself with the Parliamentary reformers.  Lord Grey,\r\nmoreover, seems to have distrusted the sincerity of Canning's support\r\nof Catholic emancipation, a distrust for which no possible reason can\r\nbe suggested; and, indeed, Grey would appear to have had a feeling of\r\npersonal dislike to the great statesman.  Accordingly he made several\r\nattacks on Canning and Canning's policy in the House of Lords, and Grey\r\nwas an eloquent speaker, whose style as well as his character carried\r\ncommand with it.  Canning was a man of singularly sensitive nature.\r\nLike many other brilliant humorists and satirists, he was somewhat\r\nthin-skinned and very quick of temper.  He could bear a brilliant and\r\neven a splendid part in the Parliamentary battle, but it was a pain to\r\nhim to endure in silence when he had no chance of making a retort.  The\r\nattacks of Lord Grey exasperated him beyond measure, and it is believed\r\nthat he had at one time a strong inclination to accept a peerage and\r\ntake a seat in the House of Lords, thereby withdrawing forever from the\r\ninspiriting battle-ground of the House of Commons for the mere sake of\r\nhaving an opportunity of replying to the attacks of Lord Grey, and\r\nmeasuring his strength against that of the great Whig leader.  The\r\nfates, however, denied to Canning any chance of making this curious\r\nanticlimax in his great political career.  His health had always been\r\nmore or less delicate, and he was {60} never very careful or sparing in\r\nthe use of his physical powers.  He was intensely nervous by\r\nconstitution, and was liable to all manner of nervous seizures and\r\nmaladies.  In the early days of 1827 he caught a severe cold while\r\nattending the public funeral of the Duke of York in the Chapel Royal,\r\nWindsor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1827--Death of Canning]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of York was the second son of George the Third, and for some\r\ntime had been regarded as heir-presumptive to the crown.  The Duke's\r\npublic career was in almost every way ignoble.  He had proved himself\r\nan utterly incapable commander, although a good War Office\r\nadministrator, and his personal character was about on a level with his\r\nmilitary capacity.  His death in January, 1827, may be said to have had\r\ntwo serious consequences at least--it made the Duke of Clarence the\r\nnext heir to the crown, and it brought on Canning the severe cold from\r\nwhich he never recovered.  It may be mentioned here, although the fact\r\nis of little political importance, that Canning when he became Prime\r\nMinister made the Duke of Clarence Lord High Admiral.  The office was\r\nprobably bestowed as a token of Canning's gratitude to the King who had\r\nstood by him, not indeed to the last, but at the last.  It certainly\r\ncould not have been given because of any conviction in Canning's mind\r\nthat the Duke of Clarence was likely to render signal benefit to the\r\nroyal navy, to the State, or to the country by his services in such an\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nCanning seemed for a while to rally from the cold which he had caught\r\nat the Duke of York's funeral, but the months of incessant anxiety\r\nwhich followed cast too heavy a burden on his shattered nerves and\r\nfeeble physical frame.  It was hoped by his friends that the\r\nadjournment of the Houses of Parliament, which took place after the\r\nMinistry had been formed, might give him rest enough from official work\r\nto allow him to repair his strength.  But Canning's was not a nature\r\nwhich admitted of rest.  The happy faculty which he had once possessed\r\nof getting easily to sleep when the day's work was done had long since\r\ndeserted him, and of late he took his official cares to bed with him,\r\nand they kept him long awake.  The early {61} summer of 1827 brought\r\nhim no improvement, and his friends already began to fear for the\r\nworst.  He suffered from intense agonies of nervous pain, and the\r\nagonies seemed to grow worse and worse with each return.  The Duke of\r\nDevonshire offered him the use of a summer residence which he had at\r\nChiswick, and Canning gladly accepted the offer.  It was remarked at\r\nthe time by some of his friends that an evil omen hung over this summer\r\nretreat.  The former Duke of Devonshire, father of Canning's friend,\r\nhad offered the same villa as a temporary retreat to Charles James Fox;\r\nthe offer was accepted by him, and Fox actually died in the bedroom\r\nwhich was now occupied by Canning.\r\n\r\nThe omen soon made good its warning.  Canning gradually sank under the\r\ninfluence of his fatal illness.  He said to a friend that during three\r\ndays he had suffered more pain than all that had been compressed into\r\nhis life up to that time, and we know that his was a frame which was\r\nalways liable to acute pain.  He sank and sank, and on August 7 he\r\ntalked for the last time coherently and composedly to those who were\r\naround him.  Then he met his approaching death with a resigned and\r\ncheerful spirit, and his latest words showed that he knew where to\r\nrepose his trust for the great change which was so near.  Shortly\r\nbefore four o'clock on the morning of August 8, 1827, the struggle was\r\nover and the great statesman was at rest.  Even at that early hour the\r\nvilla was surrounded by a large crowd of anxious watchers, who could\r\nnot leave the grounds until they heard the last tidings that were to\r\ncome from the sick-chamber.  The funeral of Canning in Westminster\r\nAbbey, although it was in name a private ceremonial, was followed by a\r\nthrong of sorrowing admirers, among whom were princes and nobles,\r\nstatesmen and prelates, politicians of all orders, and men and women of\r\nall ranks down to the very poorest, who thus bore their spontaneous\r\ntribute to the services and the memory of the great Prime Minister, and\r\nexpressed in the only way left to them their sense of the loss which\r\nhis country and the cause of peace and freedom had sustained by his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n{62}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1827--Canning and the English ministers]\r\n\r\nCanning had only just completed his fifty-seventh year when his career\r\ncame to a close.  He died before his old friend and colleague whose\r\nsudden illness had left open to him the place of Prime Minister, for\r\nLord Liverpool did not die until December 4 of the following year.  The\r\nplace of Canning in English history is more clear to us now than it was\r\nto the world even when the anxious crowd was watching round the villa\r\nat Chiswick and when the throng followed his remains to Westminster\r\nAbbey.  He was, as we have already said, the founder of that system of\r\nforeign policy which English statesmanship has professed ever since his\r\ntime.  His was that doctrine of conditional non-intervention for which,\r\nin later days, men like John Stuart Mill contended as the doctrine\r\nwhich ought to be the governing principle of a great council of\r\nEuropean States, if such could be established.  Canning's idea was not\r\nthat England should proclaim such a principle of non-intervention as\r\nthat which Cobden and Bright, and other men equally sincere and\r\npatriotic, endeavored to impress on public opinion at a later day.\r\nCanning's principle was that England should not intervene even on the\r\nright side of any Continental struggle in which she had no direct\r\nconcern, unless some other State equally free from any direct share in\r\nthe controversy were making preparation to intervene on the wrong side.\r\nThen, according to his doctrine, England was bound to say to the\r\ninterposing State: \"If you, an outsider to this controversy, are making\r\nup your mind to intervene on what we believe to be the wrong side, then\r\nit may become our duty to intervene on what we believe to be the right\r\nside.\"  It was in accordance with this principle that Canning prevailed\r\nupon the Governments of France and Russia to enter into that engagement\r\nwith England which secured the independence of Greece, as it was in\r\naccordance with this principle that he had made the proclamation of\r\npolicy which secured the independence of the Spanish-American colonies,\r\nand thus called in the New World to redress the balance of the Old.\r\n\r\nCanning must, on the whole, be ranked among great Liberal statesmen,\r\nalthough there were some passages in {63} his career which showed that\r\nhe had not advanced quite so far in Liberal principles as some of the\r\nstatesmen of his own day.  It is hard now to understand how such a man\r\ncould have stood out against the principle of Parliamentary reform and\r\npopular suffrage, and could have resisted the efforts to give full\r\nrights of citizenship to the members of dissenting denominations.  It\r\nis especially hard to understand why a man who was in favor of\r\nabolishing religious disqualifications in the case of Roman Catholics\r\nshould have thought it right to maintain them in the case of Protestant\r\nDissenters.  The explanation of this latter inconsistency may be found,\r\nperhaps, in the assumption that when Canning thought of the grievance\r\nto Roman Catholics he had in his mind the grievances to the Roman\r\nCatholics of Ireland, a separate country with a nationality and\r\ntraditions of her own, and a country in which the vast majority of the\r\npopulation belonged to the one religious faith.  He may have thought\r\nthat the English Protestant Dissenters who did not see their way to\r\nclass themselves with the Protestants of the English State Church had\r\nnot so distinct a claim to the recognition of their grievance.  It may\r\nseem strange that a mind like Canning's could have been beguiled from\r\nthe acceptance of a great principle by a curious distinction of this\r\nkind, but it must be remembered that down to a much later day many of\r\nthe professed supporters of religious equality contended for some\r\nlimitation of the principle where political privileges were concerned,\r\nand that only in our own time has admission to the House of Commons\r\nbeen left open to the professors of every religious faith, and even to\r\nthose who profess no religious faith at all.  So far as Parliamentary\r\nreform in the ordinary sense of the words is concerned, we may feel\r\nquite sure that if Canning had lived a few years longer his mind would\r\nhave accepted the growth of public opinion and the evidences which\r\njustified that growth, and he would not have been found among the\r\nunteachable opponents of popular suffrage and a well-adjusted\r\nParliamentary representation.\r\n\r\nAs a financial reformer he was distinctly in advance of {64} his time,\r\nand even such men as Sir Robert Peel only followed slowly in the path\r\nwhich Canning and Huskisson had opened.  Canning's fame as a\r\nParliamentary orator is now well assured.  He has been unduly praised,\r\nand he has been unduly disparaged.  He has been described as the\r\ngreatest Parliamentary orator since the days of Bolingbroke, and he has\r\nbeen described as a brilliant and theatric declaimer who never rose to\r\nthe height of genuine political oratory.  The common judgment of\r\neducated men now regards him as only inferior, if inferior at all, to\r\nthe two Pitts and Fox among great Parliamentary orators, and the rival\r\nof any others belonging to his own, or an earlier, or a later day in\r\nthe history of the English Parliament.  Of him it may fairly be said\r\nthat his career made an era in England's political life, and that the\r\ngreat principles which he asserted are still guiding the country even\r\nat this hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{65}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVII.\r\n\r\n\"THE CHAINS OF THE CATHOLIC.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1827--Lord Goderich]\r\n\r\nDuring the closing days of Canning's life he was speaking to Sir\r\nWilliam Knighton of the approaching end, and he said, quietly: \"This\r\nmay be hard upon me, but it is still harder upon the King.\"  There was\r\nsomething characteristic in the saying.  Canning had been greatly\r\ntouched by the manner in which the King had, at last, come round to him\r\nand stood by him against all who endeavored to interpose between him\r\nand his sovereign; and to a man of Canning's half-poetic temperament\r\nthe sovereign typified the State and the people, to whom the Prime\r\nMinister was but a devoted servant.  It was certainly hard upon the\r\nKing, at least for the time.  George must have had moments of better\r\nfeelings and better inspirations than those which governed the ordinary\r\ncourse of his life, and he had lately come to realize the value of the\r\nservices which Canning had rendered to England.  We shall see, before\r\nlong, that a secession of Canning's followers from the party in power\r\ntook place, and that the seceding men were called, and called\r\nthemselves, the \"Canningites.\"  George already appears to have become a\r\nCanningite.\r\n\r\nThe King had a good deal of trouble in forming an Administration.  Lord\r\nGoderich became Prime Minister, with Lyndhurst again as Lord\r\nChancellor, and Huskisson in Goderich's former place at the War and\r\nColonial Office.  Lord Goderich, as we have seen, had been sent into\r\nthe House of Lords when Canning became Prime Minister.  Up to that time\r\nhe was Mr. Frederick John Robinson, generally known by the nickname of\r\n\"Prosperity Robinson.\"  This satirical designation he obtained from the\r\nfact that while he was President of the Board of Trade, and {66} still\r\nlater when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, he had always made it\r\nhis business in each session to describe the country as in a condition\r\nof unparalleled prosperity.  More than that, he always insisted on\r\ndeclaring that the particular schemes of taxation that he brought\r\nforward were destined, beyond all possibility of doubt, to increase\r\nstill further that hitherto unexampled prosperity.  It had been his\r\nfortune, in his early official career, to propose and carry some\r\nschemes of taxation which met with such passionate opposition in some\r\nparts of the country as to lead to serious rioting and even to loss of\r\nlife.  But all the time he saw only prosperity as the result of his\r\nfinancial enterprises, and hence the nickname, which is still\r\nremembered in England's Parliamentary history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1828--The struggle for religious equality]\r\n\r\nLord Goderich was not a man of remarkable political capacity, and he\r\nwas a poor, ineffective, and even uninteresting speaker, except when\r\nthe audacity of his statements, and his prophecies, and the tumult of\r\ninterruptions and laughter that they created, lent a certain\r\nParliamentary interest to his orations.  He had an immense amount of\r\nthat sort of courage which, in the colloquial language of our times,\r\nwould probably be described as bumptiousness.  He had an unlimited\r\nfaith in his own capacity, and he saw nothing but success, personal and\r\nnational, where observers in general could discern only failure.  He\r\nwas one of a class of men who are to be found at all times of\r\nParliamentary history, and who manage somehow, nobody quite knows how,\r\nto make themselves appear indispensable to their political party.  He\r\nwas not, however, without any faculty for improvement, and of late\r\nyears he had derived some instruction from Canning's teaching and\r\nexample in politics and in finance.  Such as he was, his appointment as\r\nPrime Minister in succession to Canning seemed about the safest\r\ncompromise the King could make under all the existing conditions.  His\r\nposition as a stop-gap was maintained but a very short time.  During\r\nhis Administration, or perhaps it ought rather to be called his nominal\r\nAdministration, the substantial result of Canning's recent foreign\r\npolicy was seen in the destruction {67} of the Turkish and Egyptian\r\nfleets at the battle of Navarino, which led almost immediately to the\r\nSultan's acknowledgment of the independence of Greece.\r\n\r\nSome differences of opinion on financial questions soon broke out in\r\nthe Cabinet, and Huskisson and certain of his colleagues threatened to\r\nresign; and Lord Goderich, seeing little or no chance of maintaining\r\nhimself long in his position, got out of the difficulty by tendering\r\nhis own resignation.  The King accepted the resignation, and there was\r\nthen really only one man, the Duke of Wellington, to whom George could\r\nlook for the construction of a Government.  Accordingly, the Duke\r\nbecame First Lord of the Treasury, and Huskisson retained, for the\r\ntime, his former position.  During this Administration Lord John\r\nRussell brought forward his motion for the repeal of the Test and\r\nCorporation Acts; the object of the motion being to abolish all the\r\nconditions which rendered it impossible for the members of any\r\nProtestant dissenting denomination to hold State or municipal office,\r\nunless they were willing to accept a test-oath, which acknowledged the\r\nspiritual supremacy of the Church of England.  Lord John Russell's\r\nmotion was carried in the House of Commons by a majority of 237 to 193,\r\nand a Bill founded on the principle of the motion was passed through\r\nboth Houses of Parliament.  This may be described as the first of the\r\ngreat measures accepted by Parliament for the purpose of establishing\r\nthe principle of religious equality, in admission to the rights of\r\ncitizenship, among the inhabitants of these countries.  Of course, the\r\nestablishment of religious equality was yet a good long way off, and it\r\nis a curious fact that the measure that was founded on Lord John\r\nRussell's motion did something very distinct in itself to make new\r\nbattle-grounds for those who advocated the full recognition of the\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nThe new measure proposed to admit the members of all recognized\r\nProtestant denominations, whether inside or outside the Church of\r\nEngland, to the rights of citizenship, but it took good care to affirm\r\nthat it had no intention of admitting any one else.  The Act provided\r\nthat all {68} persons presenting themselves as candidates for election\r\nto political or municipal office should subscribe a declaration \"on the\r\ntrue faith of a Christian.\"  This, of course, excluded Jews and\r\nFreethinkers, while the Roman Catholics were shut out by a special\r\noath, directed exclusively against themselves, and to which it was\r\nimpossible that any professing Catholic could subscribe.  Lord John\r\nRussell, however, had begun his great career well when he carried the\r\nLegislature with him, even thus far, on the way to religious equality,\r\nalthough he was not himself destined to see the last fight which had to\r\nbe fought before the principle had been completely established.  It is\r\nalmost needless to say that the new form of pledge introduced by the\r\nmeasure was no part of Lord John Russell's plan, but he accepted the\r\nBill as amended in the House of Lords rather than sacrifice, for the\r\ntime, the whole purpose of his motion.  The motion, it may be added,\r\nwas strongly opposed in the House of Commons, not only by Robert Peel,\r\nbut by Huskisson.  Peel's opposition is easily to be understood,\r\nbecause up to this time he had not risen above the convictions with\r\nwhich he started in public life in favor of the general practice of\r\nmaking the political and civic rights of citizenship conditional upon\r\nwhat he believed to be religious orthodoxy.  In the case of Huskisson,\r\nwho was a strong supporter of the admission of Roman Catholics to full\r\nequality of political and civic rights with the members of the State\r\nChurch, the explanation probably was that he feared if the Dissenters\r\nreceived their rights in advance they might become less zealous than\r\nmany of them had been for the full recognition of the Catholic claims.\r\nSome of the archbishops and bishops in the House of Lords were liberal\r\nenough to give their support to the Bill, much to the consternation of\r\nLord Eldon, who could not understand how any prelate of the State\r\nChurch could be so far led away from the sacred duties of his position\r\nas to lend any countenance to a measure admitting the unorthodox to the\r\nplace in society which ought to be the right only of orthodox believers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1828--The Catholic Association]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to notice that a protest was entered {69} against the\r\nintroduction of the words \"on the true faith of a Christian\" by Lord\r\nHolland, who represented the principles of Charles James Fox.  The\r\npeers, it should be said, enjoy the privilege, which is not allowed to\r\nmembers of the representative chamber, of recording their formal\r\nprotest on the books of their House against any motion or measure which\r\nhas been carried in spite of their opposition, and of setting forth\r\nreasons on which their objection is founded.  Many of the protests thus\r\nrecorded form important contributions to political history.  Lord\r\nHolland vindicates his protest in words which are well worth quoting:\r\n\"Because the introduction of the words 'upon the true faith of a\r\nChristian' implies an opinion in which I cannot conscientiously concur,\r\nnamely, that a particular faith in matters of religion is necessary to\r\nthe proper discharge of duties purely political or temporal.\"  Lord\r\nEldon strongly condemned the action of the prelates who had voted in\r\nfavor of the measure, and he used some words which showed that, however\r\nobtuse his bigotry may have been, he clearly saw what must inevitably\r\ncome from the concession to religious liberty which was made by the\r\npassing of such a measure.  \"Sooner or later,\" he said, \"perhaps in\r\nthis very year, almost certainly in the next, the concessions to the\r\nDissenters must be followed by the like concessions to the Roman\r\nCatholics.\"  The Roman Catholic claims were already asserting\r\nthemselves with a force which appealed irresistibly to the minds of all\r\nenlightened men.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic Association had been formed in Ireland for the purpose of\r\nadvocating the claims of the vast majority of the Irish people, and it\r\nhad found for its leader a man who must have made a great figure in the\r\npolitical life of any era, and who was especially qualified to take a\r\nleading place in such an agitation.  Daniel O'Connell was one of the\r\nmost remarkable men of his time.  He was the first Irish political\r\nleader of modern days who professed the faith which may be called the\r\nnational creed of his people.  The leaders of great Irish movements\r\njust before his time--the Fitzgeralds, the Tones, and the Emmets--had\r\n{70} had been, like Grattan himself, members of the Established Church.\r\nO'Connell had, moreover, no sympathy whatever with the sentiments of\r\nthe French Revolution.  He had passed a few of his early years in\r\nFrance, he had seen some of the later excesses of the revolutionary\r\nperiod, and he had been inspired with a horror as great as that felt by\r\nEdmund Burke for the extravagances of the revolutionary era.  He\r\nbelonged to the landlord class, but his sympathies had always been with\r\nthe popular and national movements of his countrymen.  He had practised\r\nat the Irish bar, and had become the greatest advocate in the Irish law\r\ncourts, and was thus enabled to combine with all the fire and energy of\r\na born popular leader the subtlety and craft of a trained and practised\r\nlawyer.  O'Connell was one of the greatest orators of a day when\r\npolitical oratory could display some of its most splendid\r\nillustrations.  He had a commanding presence, indeed a colossal form,\r\nand a voice which was marvellous alike for the strength and the music\r\nof its varied intonations.  Such men as Disraeli and Bulwer Lytton have\r\nborne enthusiastic tribute to the magic of that voice, and have\r\ndeclared it to be unrivalled in the political eloquence of the time.\r\nO'Connell made his voice heard at many great public meetings in England\r\nand in Scotland, as well as in Ireland, and his political views had,\r\nindeed, much in common with those of English and Scottish advanced\r\nLiberals.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: O'Connell and the Parliamentary Oath]\r\n\r\nThe Catholic Association was made, at one period of its career, the\r\nsubject of an Act of Parliament which declared it to be, for a certain\r\ntime, an illegal organization, and the period was now approaching when\r\nthe prohibitory Act would have to be renewed or allowed to drop out of\r\nexistence.  In consequence of some ministerial rearrangements a vacancy\r\nhad arisen in the Parliamentary representation of the county of Clare\r\nin Ireland, and O'Connell resolved on taking a bold and what then\r\nseemed to many a positively desperate step.  He announced himself as a\r\ncandidate for the vacancy in opposition to its former occupant, who,\r\nhaving been appointed to ministerial office, was compelled to resign\r\nhis place in the House of {71} Commons and offer himself to his former\r\nconstituents for re-election.  O'Connell was not disqualified by\r\npositive enactment from becoming a candidate for a seat in Parliament;\r\nthat is to say, there was no law actually declaring that a Roman\r\nCatholic, as such, could not enter the House of Commons.  But, as we\r\nhave explained already, it was the law of the land that no man could\r\ntake his seat in that House until he had subscribed an oath which it\r\nwas perfectly impossible for any Roman Catholic to accept, an oath\r\ndisavowing and denouncing the very opinions which are an essential part\r\nof the Roman Catholic's faith.  O'Connell, therefore, could not be\r\nprevented from becoming a candidate for the representation of Clare,\r\nand when the contest came on it ended in his being triumphantly\r\nreturned by an overwhelming majority.  O'Connell presented himself at\r\nthe table of the House of Commons, and was called upon to subscribe the\r\nusual oath, which, of course, he absolutely refused to do.  He was then\r\nordered to withdraw, and he did withdraw, and the seat was declared\r\nvacant.  O'Connell returned to Clare, again offered himself as\r\ncandidate, and was again elected by a triumphant majority.  Then,\r\nindeed, men like Lord Eldon must have begun to think that the old world\r\nwas really coming to an end.  King George and the Government found\r\nthemselves face to face with a crisis to which there had been no\r\nparallel in the memory of living statesmen.\r\n\r\nThe progress of events was, meanwhile, making a deep impression on the\r\nreceptive mind of Sir Robert Peel, now Home Secretary, and by far the\r\nmost rising and powerful member of the Administration.  Huskisson, it\r\nshould be said, had by this time ceased to belong to the Duke of\r\nWellington's Government.  There had been some misunderstanding between\r\nhim and the Duke, arising out of a speech made by Huskisson in\r\nLiverpool, which was understood to contain a declaration that Huskisson\r\nhad only accepted office on the express understanding that the policy\r\nof the Duke's Government was to be the policy of Canning.  The Duke\r\ntook exception to this, and declared that he had entered into no\r\nunderstanding as to his general {72} policy, but that what Huskisson\r\nprobably had said was that he had accepted the composition of the\r\nGovernment as a guarantee in itself that a sound national policy was to\r\nbe carried out.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1828--Demand for Catholic emancipation]\r\n\r\nHuskisson accepted the explanation, and explained that this was what he\r\nreally had said, and no doubt this was really the purpose of that\r\npassage in his speech; but the incident led to some friction between\r\nthe two men, and was the beginning of other misunderstandings.  Some\r\ndifference of opinion afterwards arose on minor questions of policy,\r\nand Huskisson sent to the Duke a somewhat hasty letter announcing his\r\nresignation.  The letter was intended to be only a conditional\r\nintimation of his purpose, but the Duke took it as positive and final,\r\nand announced it as such to the King.  There was no course left open to\r\nHuskisson but to resign.  The incident created much talk at the time,\r\nand gave rise to a good deal of satirical comment.  Several other\r\nmembers of the Government, among whom was Lord Palmerston, resigned\r\nalong with Huskisson, and they formed themselves into an independent\r\nparty, bearing the name of the Canningites.  It is curious to notice\r\nthat the reconstructions caused in the Government by these\r\nresignations, and the new appointments which had to be made, led to\r\nthat vacancy in the county of Clare which gave O'Connell an opportunity\r\nof coming forward as a candidate for the seat and being elected.\r\n\r\nPeel saw that the Duke of Wellington's Government had lost some of its\r\nmost influential members.  Other events, too, had been turning his\r\nattention towards the growth of the agitation in Ireland.  The Marquis\r\nof Wellesley, elder brother of the Duke of Wellington, had been Viceroy\r\nof Ireland.  Wellesley had been a distinguished statesman, and as\r\nViceroy of India had conducted to a successful issue, with the help of\r\nhis younger brother, the great Mahratta war.  When he became Viceroy of\r\nIreland he had gone over to that country as a strong opponent of the\r\nCatholic claims, but his experience there soon convinced him that it\r\nwould be impossible to resist those claims much longer, and at the same\r\ntime {73} to keep Ireland in tranquillity.  Therefore, when the Duke of\r\nWellington, on coming into office as Prime Minister, refused to\r\nrecognize the Catholic claims, Lord Wellesley resigned his place.  He\r\nwas succeeded by the Marquis of Anglesey, a soldier who had done\r\nbrilliant service in the wars against Napoleon, and was well known as a\r\ndetermined opponent of the demands made by the advocates of Catholic\r\nemancipation.  Lord Anglesey, too, became satisfied during his time of\r\noffice in Ireland that there was no alternative between emancipation\r\nand an armed rebellion among the Irish Catholics, a large number of\r\nwhom were actually serving in the ranks of the army.  His opinions were\r\nagain and again impressed on the Government, and the course he took\r\nonly led to his recall from the Viceroyalty.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons an event took place which had a great effect on\r\nthe mind of Peel.  Early in 1828 Sir Francis Burdett, who held a very\r\nprominent place among the more advanced reformers of the time, and who\r\nrepresented Westminster in the House of Commons, brought forward a\r\nresolution inviting the House to consider the state of the laws\r\naffecting the Roman Catholics of the two islands, \"with a view to such\r\na final and conciliatory settlement as may be conducive to the peace\r\nand strength of the United Kingdom, to the stability of the Protestant\r\nEstablishment, and to the general satisfaction and concord of all\r\nclasses of his Majesty's subjects.\"  The resolution was supported by a\r\npowerful speech from Brougham, in which he dwelt on the fact that not\r\none of those who opposed the motion had expressed any conviction that\r\nthe existing state of things could long continue, and that it was\r\nimpossible to overlook or deny the great advance which the movement for\r\nCatholic Emancipation had been making in and out of Parliament.  Peel\r\nwas greatly impressed by this argument, and also by the fact that the\r\nmen who supported Burdett and Brougham in the House of Commons\r\nrepresented the best part of the intellect and statesmanship of that\r\nHouse.  The resolution was carried by 272 votes against 266 on the\r\nother side, a small majority, {74} indeed, but a majority that at such\r\na time was large enough to show a man of Peel's intellect the practical\r\nprogress which the demand for Catholic Emancipation had already made.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1828--Peel and Catholic emancipation]\r\n\r\nWe find in Peel's own correspondence the most interesting evidences of\r\nthe influence which all these events were making on his clear and\r\nthoughtful mind.  The man whom O'Connell had defeated in Clare, Mr.\r\nVesey Fitzgerald, had represented the constituency for many years, had\r\nalways supported by speeches and votes the claims of the Catholics, and\r\nwas the son of one who had stood by the side of Grattan and Sir John\r\nParnell in resisting the Act of Union.  No one could have been more\r\npopular up to that time among Irishmen, and the election of O'Connell\r\nwas obviously due to the fact that O'Connell had made himself the\r\nleader of a movement which had for its object to bring about a great\r\ncrisis, and to compel the Parliament and the Government to surrender at\r\nonce or encounter a civil war.  Peel asked himself--we quote his own\r\nwords--\"whether it may not be possible that the fever of political and\r\nreligious excitement which was quickening the pulse and fluttering the\r\nbosom of the whole Catholic population--which had inspired the serf of\r\nClare with the resolution and the energy of a free man--which had in\r\nthe twinkling of an eye made all considerations of personal gratitude,\r\nancient family connections, local preferences, the fear of worldly\r\ninjury, the hope of worldly advantage subordinate to the one absorbing\r\nsense of religious obligation and public duty--whether, I say, it might\r\nnot be possible that the contagion of that feverish excitement might\r\nspread beyond the barriers which under ordinary circumstances the\r\nhabits of military obedience and the strictness of military discipline\r\nopposed to all such external influences?\"\r\n\r\nPeel became gradually convinced that the Marquis of Anglesey was right\r\nin his views, and that there was no choice between a recognition of the\r\nCatholic claims and the outbreak of a civil war in Ireland.  The more\r\nhe thought over the question, the more he became convinced that it\r\nwould not be possible to rely on the loyalty of all {75} the Catholic\r\nsoldiers in the ranks of the army in Ireland if they were called upon\r\nto join in shooting down their own brothers and friends because these\r\nhad risen in rebellion against the oppressive laws which excluded a\r\nCatholic from the full rights of citizenship.  Peel was not a\r\nphilosopher or a dreamer, but above all things a practical statesman,\r\nand when he had to choose between civil war and the concession of a\r\nclaim which was admitted to be right and just by some of the most\r\nenlightened Englishmen and Scotchmen who sat near him on the benches of\r\nthe House of Commons, and by some of the most enlightened Englishmen\r\nand Scotchmen outside the House, he could not bring himself to believe\r\nthat claims thus advocated could be so essentially unjust or\r\nunreasonable as to make their continued refusal worth the cost of so\r\nterrible a struggle.\r\n\r\nPeel made up his mind to the fact that Catholic Emancipation must, as\r\nsoon as possible, become the work of Parliament.  But he did not yet\r\nbelieve that he was the right man to undertake the task.  It seemed to\r\nhim that one who had always been regarded as the determined opponent of\r\nEmancipation would not be likely to win over many supporters among his\r\nTory friends for such a sudden change of policy.  He did not think\r\nhimself well suited, and he was not inclined, to conduct the\r\nnegotiations which would be necessary between any Government attempting\r\nsuch a task and the Irish advocates of Emancipation.  His idea was that\r\nLord Grey, as the head of the reforming party, would be the statesman\r\nbest qualified to undertake such an enterprise and most likely to carry\r\nit to an early success.  His first business, however, would clearly be\r\nto convince the Duke of Wellington that Catholic Emancipation was\r\ninevitable, and this work he at once set himself to accomplish.  He had\r\nsome trouble in bringing the Duke over to his own opinions, but the\r\nDuke became convinced in the end, and, indeed, both at that time and\r\nafter, the Duke was always inclined to follow Peel's guidance, on the\r\nplain, practical, soldierly principle that Peel understood political\r\naffairs much better than he did, {76} and that Peel's advice was always\r\nsure to be sound and safe.  So the Duke, too, became convinced that\r\nCatholic Emancipation must be accepted as inevitable, and that the\r\nsooner it was carried through the better.  But Wellington was strongly\r\nopposed to the idea of handing over the work to Lord Grey.  He showed\r\nthat it would be hardly possible to induce King George to accept the\r\nservices of Lord Grey for such a purpose.  The King was known to\r\ndislike Lord Grey, whose stern, unbending manners could not be welcome\r\nto a sovereign unaccustomed to the dictation of so uncourtierlike an\r\nadviser as the leader of the Whig party.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1828--The Oath of Supremacy]\r\n\r\nWellington's idea was that, as the thing had to be done, it had better\r\nbe done by Peel and himself, and he almost implored Peel not to desert\r\nhim at such a crisis.  Peel could not resist the personal and brotherly\r\nappeal thus made to him by one for whom he had so profound a respect,\r\nand the result was that the two agreed to work together as they had\r\nbeen doing, and to make Catholic Emancipation the business of their\r\nGovernment.  But then the King had to be won over, and nobody knew\r\nbetter than Wellington did how difficult this task must be.  Yet he did\r\nnot despair.  He had had some experience of the King's resistance and\r\nthe only means by which it could be got over.  Again and again he had\r\nhad occasion to urge on the sovereign the adoption of some course to\r\nwhich George, at first, was obstinately opposed, and he knew that quiet\r\npersistence was the only way of carrying his point.  His plan was to\r\navoid argument as much as possible, to state his case concisely to the\r\nKing, and allow the King to take his full time in pouring forth his\r\nprotestations that he never could and never would consent to such a\r\npolicy.  The King was very fond of hearing himself talk, and loved on\r\nsuch occasions to display all that eloquence which he fully believed\r\nhimself to possess, and which he had no opportunity of letting out on\r\nany Parliamentary or public platform.  Then, when the King had\r\nexhausted himself in repeating over and over again his reasons for\r\nrefusing the demands made upon him, Wellington would quietly return to\r\nthe fact that there was no practical way out of the difficulty but to\r\nassent to {77} the proposition.  The King usually gave way, and the\r\ninterview had a satisfactory close.  The King was appeased by the sound\r\nof his own eloquence, and the taciturn minister had his way.\r\n\r\nThis course of policy Wellington resolved to adopt with regard to the\r\nquestion of Catholic Emancipation.  He listened to all the talk about\r\nthe coronation oath and the declaration that George would rather retire\r\nto his kingdom of Hanover, abdicate the throne of England, and leave\r\nthe English people to find a Catholic--that is, a pro-Catholic--king in\r\nthe Duke of Clarence, and then merely pointed out to the sovereign that\r\nsomething had to be done, and that his Majesty's advisers could think\r\nof nothing else but the course which they proposed for his acceptance.\r\nThe King gave way to a certain extent, but he put his foot down, as the\r\nmodern phrase goes, on the maintenance of the Oath of Supremacy in its\r\nexisting form.\r\n\r\nThere is an interesting account given of the final interview which the\r\nDuke of Wellington, Lord Lyndhurst, and Robert Peel had with their\r\nroyal master on this subject.  Without an alteration in the terms of\r\nthe Oath of Supremacy it was absolutely impossible that Roman Catholics\r\ncould enter the House of Commons, for the oath contained the very words\r\nno Catholic could possibly consent to utter or subscribe.  The King\r\nabsolutely and vehemently refused to give his consent to any alteration\r\nof the oath, and he then asked his three ministers what, under the\r\ncircumstances, they proposed to do.  The ministers informed the\r\nsovereign that they proposed to ask his permission for them to make\r\nannouncement in the two Houses of Parliament that they had ceased to\r\nhold office and were no longer responsible for the work of\r\nadministration.  George took the announcement at first with gracious\r\ncomposure, and told them he supposed he could not find any fault with\r\nthem for their act of resignation.  He carried his kindness even\r\nfurther, for, as we learn on the authority of one of the three\r\nministers, \"the King took leave of us with great composure and great\r\nkindness, gave to each of us a salute on each cheek, and accepted our\r\nresignation of office.\"\r\n\r\n{78} Thackeray, in his lecture on George the Fourth, turned this record\r\nto most amusing account, and delighted his audience by a comical\r\ndescription of the King's paternal benediction imprinted in kisses on\r\nthe cheeks of Wellington, Lyndhurst, and Peel.  But when the kissing\r\nwas over and the three statesmen had departed, the King began to find\r\nthat he was left practically without a Government.  What was to be\r\ndone?  It would be impossible to form a Government after his own heart\r\nwithout such men as Wellington, Lyndhurst, and Peel, and even if he\r\ncould have got over his own personal dislike to Lord Grey, it was\r\nimpossible to suppose that Lord Grey would become the head of any\r\nGovernment which did not undertake Catholic Emancipation.  The King\r\nfound himself in the awkward position of having either to announce to\r\nhis subjects that he intended to govern without any ministers, and to\r\ndirect the affairs of the State entirely out of his own head, or to\r\ncall back to office the men whom he had kissed and sent away.  Even\r\nGeorge the Fourth could not hesitate when such a choice was forced upon\r\nhim.  He wrote to the Duke of Wellington, telling him that he must once\r\nmore put himself in the hands of the Duke and his colleagues, and let\r\nthem deal as they thought best with Catholic Emancipation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1829--The Forty-shilling Freeholders]\r\n\r\nThe Catholic Relief Bill was at once brought in, and consisted in\r\nsubstance of the enactment of a new oath, which admitted Roman\r\nCatholics to Parliament and to all political and civil offices\r\nexcepting merely those of Regent, Lord Chancellor, and Lord Lieutenant\r\nof Ireland.  The Bill was passed rapidly through both Houses of\r\nParliament.  The third reading was carried in the House of Commons by\r\n320 votes to 142, and in the House of Lords by 213 to 109, and the\r\ngreat controversy was happily at an end.  The settlement, however, was\r\nnot effected with as complete and liberal a spirit as Peel would\r\ncertainly have infused into it if he could have had his way.\r\n\r\nO'Connell, who had been twice elected for Clare, was not allowed to\r\ntake his seat under the new measure until he had returned to his\r\nconstituents and submitted himself for {79} re-election--a ceremonial\r\nabsolutely unnecessary, and only impressing the civilized world as an\r\nevidence of the ungenerous and ungracious manner in which the\r\ninevitable had been accepted.  Then, again, an Act of Parliament was\r\npassed disfranchising the class of voters in Ireland who were called\r\nthe Forty-shilling Freeholders, who formed a large proportion of\r\nO'Connell's constituents.  This was done no doubt to put some\r\nobstacles, at all events, in the way of the Irish Catholic population\r\nif they should hope ever again to make the representation of any\r\nnational claims as effective as they had done in the Clare election.\r\nIt may be taken for granted that Peel would not have marred the effect\r\nof an act of mere justice by niggardly qualifications of any kind, but\r\nhe knew he had to deal with a Tory House of Lords, and was content to\r\naccept some compromise as long as he could carry the main object of his\r\npolicy.  The first great chapter in the modern history of political\r\nreform had come to a thrilling close.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{80}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST OF THE GEORGES.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1829--Wellington fights Lord Winchilsea]\r\n\r\nOne incident connected more or less directly with the Catholic\r\nEmancipation question deserves historical record, if only for the curious\r\nlight it throws upon the contrast between the manners of that day and the\r\nmanners of more recent times.  Shortly before the passing of the Catholic\r\nRelief Bill, the Earl of Winchilsea wrote a letter which was published in\r\none of the newspapers strongly denouncing the conduct of the Duke of\r\nWellington, and declaring him guilty of having joined in a conspiracy to\r\noverthrow the Church and the Constitution of England under false\r\npretences.  This letter was addressed to the secretary of a committee\r\nformed for the establishment of King's College in London, and Lord\r\nWinchilsea had apparently assumed that the subject under consideration\r\nwarranted him in expressing his views with regard to the conduct of the\r\nPrime Minister on the Catholic relief question.  In more recent times, of\r\ncourse, such a letter might have been written by anybody, whether peer or\r\ncommoner, and published in all the newspapers of the country without\r\ncalling for the slightest notice on the part of a Prime Minister.  The\r\nDuke of Wellington, however, lived at a time when a different code of\r\nhonor and etiquette prevailed.  He wrote to Lord Winchilsea a letter, the\r\nprincipal passage of which is worth quoting to illustrate the peculiar\r\nsense of duty which could, at the time, direct the conduct of a man like\r\nthe Duke of Wellington.  \"The question for me now to decide is this: Is a\r\ngentleman who happens to be the King's Minister to submit to be insulted\r\nby any gentleman who thinks proper to attribute to him disgraceful or\r\ncriminal motives for his conduct as an individual?  I cannot {81} doubt\r\nof the decision which I ought to make on this question.  Your Lordship is\r\nalone responsible for the consequences.\"  This was, of course, a\r\nchallenge to Lord Winchilsea to withdraw his accusation or to fight a\r\nduel forthwith.\r\n\r\nNow, to the cool, philosophic mind, at least in later times, it might\r\nwell seem obvious that whether Lord Winchilsea's charge against the Duke\r\nof Wellington was just or unjust, its justice or injustice could not in\r\nany way be made clear by the discharge of bullets from the pistols of the\r\nchallenger and the challenged.  The cool, philosophic observer of a later\r\ntime might wonder also how the Duke's sense of public responsibility\r\ncould allow him to peril a life which he must have known to be of the\r\nhighest value to his country, for the sake of taking part in a combat\r\nwith an antagonist whose personal opinion of the Duke and of the Duke's\r\nconduct could not be of the slightest importance to the vast majority of\r\nthe Duke's countrymen.  But the Duke of Wellington was not in any case a\r\ncool, philosophic observer, and he lived at a time when the established\r\nor tolerated code of what was called personal honor seemed to have\r\nnothing to do either with Christian morals, with political expediency, or\r\nwith ordinary common-sense.  Wellington accepted without question the\r\ndictates of the supposed code of honor, and he sent his challenge.  Lord\r\nWinchilsea, it will be seen, did not intend to stand by his gross and\r\npreposterous charge against the Duke, but he did not think that the code\r\nof honor allowed him to say so like a man, and tender an apology like\r\nwhat we should now call a gentleman, without first subjecting himself to\r\nthe fire of his wrongfully accused antagonist.  So the Duke and the Earl\r\nwent out with their seconds and met at Wimbledon.  The victor of Waterloo\r\nwas not destined to kill or be killed in this absurd contest.  When the\r\nparties to the duel were placed on the ground and the word was given.\r\nLord Winchilsea reserved his fire, the bullet from the Duke's pistol\r\npassed him without doing any harm, and Lord Winchilsea then discharged\r\nhis pistol in the air, and authorized his second to make known his\r\nretraction of his {82} charge against the Duke, and his apology for\r\nhaving made such a charge.  The retraction and the apology were published\r\nin the newspapers, and there, to use a form of words which was very\r\ncommon at the time after such an incident, the affair ended with equal\r\nhonor to both parties.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1829--Comments upon Wellington's duel]\r\n\r\nIt seems hard now to understand how any man, in the position and with the\r\nresponsibilities of the Duke of Wellington, could bring himself to think\r\nthat he was called upon to risk his life for the mere sake of resenting\r\nan imputation which no rational man in his senses could possibly have\r\nregarded as of any consequence to the Duke's public or private character.\r\nThe whole incident seems to us now one more properly belonging to comic\r\nopera than to serious political life.  We can hardly conceive the\r\npossibility of the Marquis of Salisbury insisting on fighting a duel with\r\nsome hot-headed member of the House of Lords who had chosen to describe\r\nhim as a conspirator against the Constitution and the Church of England.\r\nThe Duke of Wellington, however, must be judged according to the ways of\r\nhis own time, and the code of political and personal honor in which he\r\nhad been nurtured.  There has not been in modern political history a more\r\nconscientious and high-minded statesman than Robert Peel, and yet not\r\nvery long before the Winchilsea business Robert Peel had only been\r\nprevented by the interference of the law from going out to fight a duel\r\nwith Daniel O'Connell, and O'Connell himself had killed his man in\r\nanother affair of honor, as it was called.  We who live in these islands\r\nat the present time may be excused if we indulge in a certain feeling of\r\nself-complacency when we contemplate the advance towards a better code of\r\npersonal honor and a better recognition of the teachings of Christianity\r\nwhich has been made here since the days when the Duke of Wellington\r\nthought that for him, as a gentleman, there was no other course to take\r\nthan to risk his life because an insignificant person had made a\r\nridiculous charge against him.\r\n\r\nStill, it is something to know that there were cool observers even at the\r\ntime who thought the Duke of Wellington had done wrong.  Charles\r\nGreville, in commenting on {83} the duel, says that \"everybody, of\r\ncourse, sees the matter in a different light; all blame Lord Winchilsea,\r\nbut they are divided as to whether the Duke ought to have fought or not.\"\r\n\"Lord Winchilsea is such a maniac, and has so lost his head, that\r\neverybody imagined the Duke would treat what he said with silent\r\ncontempt.\"  Greville utterly condemns Lord Winchilsea for having made the\r\nattack on the Duke, and for not having sent an apology when it was first\r\nrequired of him, but he adds: \"I think, having committed the folly of\r\nwriting so outrageous a letter, he did the only thing a man of honor\r\ncould do in going out and receiving a shot and then making an apology,\r\nwhich he was all this time prepared to do, for he had it ready written in\r\nhis pocket.\"  Most of us at this time of day would be inclined to think\r\nthat if Lord Winchilsea was willing to make the apology and had it ready\r\nwritten in his pocket, he might have acted according to a better code of\r\nhonor by not exposing the Duke to the chance of killing him.  However, we\r\nmust not expect too much from Greville, and it is well to know, as his\r\nfinal verdict on the whole affair, that \"I think the Duke ought not to\r\nhave challenged him; it was very juvenile, and he stands in far too high\r\na position, and his life is so much _publica cura_ that he should have\r\ntreated him and his letter with the contempt they merited.\"  The King, it\r\nseems, approved of the Duke of Wellington's conduct in making the letter\r\nthe subject of a challenge and meeting his opponent in a duel.  Greville\r\ngoes on to remark that somebody said \"the King would be wanting to fight\r\na duel himself,\" whereupon some one else observed, \"He will be sure to\r\nthink that he has fought one.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington had a great deal to trouble him after the passing\r\nof the Catholic Relief Bill.  There was great distress all over the\r\ncountry, and the discontent was naturally in proportion to the distress.\r\nWellington had lost much of his popularity with the more extreme members\r\nof his own party, who could not lift their minds to an understanding of\r\nthe reasons which had compelled him to change his old opinions on the\r\nCatholic question.  It cannot be doubted, too, that he sometimes felt\r\ndisappointed {84} with the results which were following from his policy\r\ntowards Ireland.  Members of his own party were continually dinning into\r\nhis ears their declaration that the measure passed in favor of the Roman\r\nCatholics had not put a stop to agitation in Ireland, and that, on the\r\ncontrary, O'Connell was now beginning to agitate for a repeal of the Act\r\nof Union.  At that time, as at all times, the opponents of any great act\r\nof justice were eager to make out that its concession must have been an\r\nutter failure, because instead of satisfying everybody forever it had\r\nonly led other people to demand that other acts of justice should also be\r\ndone.  Some members of Wellington's own party were now inclined for the\r\nfirst time to become advocates of Parliamentary reform, on the ground\r\nthat nothing but a reduced franchise in England could save the State\r\nChurch from being overthrown by the emancipated Roman Catholics.  Those\r\nwho had trembled before at the possibility of revolutionary sentiments\r\nleading to the subversion of the throne, now declared themselves in\r\nterror lest the spread of Roman Catholic doctrine should lead to the\r\nsubversion of the Protestant altar.  The truth is, and it is a truth of\r\nwhich governments have to be reminded even in our own times, that the\r\nlong delay of justice was alone answerable for any alarm which might have\r\nbeen caused by its sudden concession.  The arguments in favor of Catholic\r\nEmancipation were just as strong, and ought to have been just as clear,\r\nto all rational men before it became evident to Wellington and Peel that\r\nthere was no choice but between emancipation and civil war.  The plain\r\nduty of a civilized government is to redress injustice at the earliest\r\npossible moment, and not to wait idly or ignorantly until the danger of a\r\npopular uprising makes instant redress inevitable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1829--Need for radical reforms]\r\n\r\nThe great distress in many parts of the country was in the mean time\r\nleading to new forms of crime.  The burning of corn-ricks and farm-houses\r\nwas becoming in many districts the terrible form in which hunger and want\r\nof work made wild war against property.  The Game Laws, which were then\r\nat their highest pitch of severity, led to {85} ferocious and frequent\r\nstruggles between the patrons and the enemies of legalized monopoly.\r\nPoachers were killed by game preservers, and game preservers were killed\r\nby poachers.  Every assize court told this same story.  An entirely new\r\nform of crime broke out in the murders which were committed for the sake\r\nof obtaining bodies to be sold for the purposes of dissection.  The price\r\nof food was often made enormously high by the purely artificial\r\nrestrictions imposed upon its importation, and even in some cases on its\r\nmere production, and in ordinary human society increase of poverty always\r\nmeans increase of crime.  A large proportion of the population was sunk\r\nin absolute ignorance, and as yet no systematic attempt whatever was made\r\nto establish any form of national education.  The luxury and the\r\nextravagance of the rich were enormous, and were greatly stimulated by\r\nthe example of the sovereign and the Court.  Under the influence of the\r\nspasmodic and unreal impulse given to commercial activity by the late\r\nwars the rich seemed to be growing richer, while by the increased\r\ntaxation which was the result of these wars the poor were certainly made\r\nto grow poorer.  The demand for Parliamentary reform was beginning to\r\nexpress itself in systematic movements.   Lord John Russell and Henry\r\nBrougham made their voices heard in the House of Commons and throughout\r\nthe country.  Daniel O'Connell went so far as to declare that nothing\r\nwould satisfy him short of universal suffrage--manhood suffrage, that is\r\nto say--vote by ballot, and triennial Parliaments.  This was thought at\r\nthe time by most people to be the mere raving of a madman or the wild\r\noutcry of a revolutionary demagogue.  We are not very far from the full\r\naccomplishment of the programme just now.  The agitation against slavery\r\nand the slave trade was becoming an important movement.  The time, in\r\nfact, was one of storm and high pressure.  The shapes of great coming\r\nchanges were daily seen upon the horizon, and part of the community\r\nregarded as the portents of coming national destruction what others\r\nwelcomed as the bright signs of approaching prosperity, education, and\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n{86}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1830--Death of George the Fourth]\r\n\r\nOne coming change all men looked forward to with the conviction that it\r\nwas near.  The end of the reign was close at hand.  The King's health and\r\nstrength had wholly given way of late years, and it was beyond the reach\r\nof medical science to do much for the prolongation of his life, even if\r\nGeorge had been the sort of man to give medical science any chance of\r\ndoing much for him.  Preparations, however, were still being made for his\r\nbirthday celebration in April, and nothing was done by any official\r\nannouncement to give strength to the general prevailing impression that\r\nthe end was near at hand.  When, on April 15, a bulletin was at last\r\nissued, it merely announced that the King was suffering from a bilious\r\nattack accompanied by a slight difficulty in breathing, but nothing was\r\nsaid to intimate that the King's physicians were in any alarm for the\r\nresult.  The royal physicians still kept issuing bulletins, but they were\r\nso vague in their terms that it is impossible to believe they were not\r\nmade purposely deceptive.  It would appear that King George, like many\r\nbraver and better men, had a nervous objection to any admission by\r\nhimself or on his behalf that there was the slightest reason for alarm as\r\nto the state of his health.  Greville, who was then in Rome, notes on May\r\n12 that: \"Everybody here is in great alarm about the King, who I have no\r\ndoubt is very ill.\"  Then Greville adds, in characteristic fashion: \"I am\r\nafraid he will die before I get home, and I should like to be in at the\r\ndeath, and see all the proceedings of a new reign.\"  But he makes up his\r\nmind that he must not hurry his departure on the ground that \"I shall\r\nprobably never see Rome again, and I have a good chance of seeing at\r\nleast one king more leave us.\"\r\n\r\nDays and days went on and the public were still kept in doubt, until on\r\nMay 24 a message was sent in the King's name to both Houses of Parliament\r\nto say that the King no longer found it convenient to sign State papers\r\nwith his own hand, and hoped some means might be found for relieving him\r\nfrom the necessity of making any attempt to discharge the painful duty.\r\nThis announcement made it clear enough to everybody that the King was in\r\na very {87} weak condition, but there was naturally some difficulty about\r\ndevising an entirely satisfactory method of dispensing him from the duty\r\nof appending his sign-manual to important documents.  Not a very long\r\ntime had passed away since the throne of England was nominally occupied\r\nby an insane sovereign.  It was thought quite possible that insanity\r\nmight show itself in the present King, and it was absolutely necessary\r\nthat the utmost care should be taken to provide against any chance of the\r\nroyal authority being misused by those who surrounded the sovereign.  It\r\nwas arranged, therefore, that the sign-manual should be affixed in the\r\nKing's presence, and in obedience to his order given by word of mouth,\r\nand that the document thus stamped must be endorsed by three members of\r\nthe Privy Council.  All this was to be provided for by an Act of\r\nParliament, and the Act was only to be in operation during the session\r\nthen going on, in order that if the King's malady should last the renewal\r\nof the regular authority must be formally sought from the Legislature.\r\nThe Bill for this purpose became law on May 28, and it remained in\r\noperation but for a very short time.  On June 26, about three in the\r\nmorning, the reign of George the Fourth came to an end.  The death was\r\nsudden, even when we consider that there had been for some time no hope\r\nleft of the King's recovery.  George was sitting up in bed, and to all\r\noutward appearance was not any worse than he had been for some days\r\nbefore, when suddenly a startled expression came over his face, he leaned\r\nhis head on the shoulder of one of his attendants, was heard to say, \"O\r\nGod, this is death,\" and then all was over.\r\n\r\nThe rupture of a blood-vessel proved to have been the immediate cause of\r\ndeath, but ossification of some of the vessels near the heart had begun\r\nyears before and a complication of disorders had been gradually setting\r\nin.  The King's mode of life was not one which gave him any chance of\r\nrallying against such disorders.  He was reckless in his food and drink,\r\nand had long been in the way of cheering and stimulating himself by\r\nglasses of cherry-brandy taken at any moment of the day when the impulse\r\ncame upon {88} him.  Shortly before his death George made an earnest\r\nrequest to the Duke of Wellington, who was in constant attendance, that\r\nhe should be buried in the night-shirt which he was wearing at the time.\r\nThe Duke was somewhat surprised at this request, for one reason among\r\nothers that the garment in question did not seem likely to commend itself\r\nas a shroud even to a sovereign less particular as to costume than George\r\nthe Fourth had been.  During his later years, however, as we learn from\r\nthe testimony of Wellington himself, the King, who used to be the very\r\nprince of dandies where his outer garments were concerned, had got into\r\nthe way of sleeping in uncleanly nightshirts and particularly dirty\r\nnight-caps.  When the King was dead, Wellington noticed that there was a\r\nred silk ribbon round his neck beneath the shirt.  The ribbon was found\r\nto have attached to it a locket containing a tiny portrait of Mrs.\r\nFitzherbert, perhaps the one only woman he had ever loved, perhaps, too,\r\nthe woman he had most deeply wronged.  It seemed that at one period of\r\ntheir love story the King and Mrs. Fitzherbert had exchanged small\r\nportraits, each covered by half a cut diamond, and no doubt there was an\r\nunderstanding that each should rest forever on the breast of its wearer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1830--The character of George the Fourth]\r\n\r\nNothing in the story of George the Fourth's worthless and erring life is\r\nmore discreditable and dishonorable to him than the manner in which he\r\nbehaved to Mrs. Fitzherbert, and the utter falsehood of the denial which\r\nhe had given to the reports that a marriage ceremony had taken place\r\nbetween them--a falsehood which, be it remembered, he had declared to\r\nCharles Fox upon his honor to be a truthful statement.  The moralist may\r\nbe a little puzzled how to make up his mind as to the bearing of this\r\nincident upon the character of George the Fourth.  Does it relieve the\r\nmurky gloom of George's life by one streak of light if we find that,\r\nafter all, he did love Mrs. Fitzherbert to the last, and that in his\r\ndying moments he wished her portrait to go with him to the tomb?  Or does\r\nit darken the stain upon the man's life to know that he really did love\r\nthe woman whom nevertheless he could deliberately consign {89} to an\r\ninfamous imputation?  We do not know whether any writer of romance has\r\nventured to introduce into his pages an incident and a problem such as\r\nthose which are thus associated with the death-bed of George the Fourth.\r\nIt is something to know that the King's brother, the Duke of Clarence,\r\nwhom that death-bed had made King of England, was kind and generous to\r\nMrs. Fitzherbert, and did all in his power to atone to her for the trials\r\nwhich her love and her royal lover had brought upon her life.\r\n\r\nGeorge was in his sixty-eighth year when he died.  It would not be easy\r\nto find anywhere the story of a life which left so little of good to be\r\nremembered.  George seems to have had some generous impulses now and\r\nthen, and he probably did some kindly acts which could be set off against\r\nhis many errors, imperfections, ignoble selfishnesses, and grave\r\noffences.  But the record of his career as history gives it to us is that\r\nof a life almost absolutely surrendered to self-indulgence.  It is only\r\nfair to remember when we consider all the unworthy acts of his manhood\r\nthat the unwise and harsh restraints imposed upon him in his early years\r\nare accountable, at least to a certain extent, for the follies and the\r\nvices to which he yielded himself up when he became, as Byron says of one\r\nof his characters, \"Lord of himself, that heritage of woe.\"  Heritage of\r\nwoe it certainly was in the case of George the Fourth.  In his early\r\nmanhood he appears to have had the gift of forming close friendships with\r\nmen of genius and of noble impulse, but their example never told upon\r\nhim, and as one cause or other removed them from his side his career bore\r\nwith it no trace of their influence or their inspiration.  No one ever\r\nseems to have loved him except Mrs. Fitzherbert alone, and we have seen\r\nhow that love was repaid.  Even those who were most devoted to him in his\r\nlater years, because of their devotion to the royal house and to the\r\nState of which he was the representative, found themselves compelled to\r\nbear the heaviest testimony against his levity, his selfishness, his lack\r\nof conscience, his utter indifference to all the higher objects and\r\npurposes of life.\r\n\r\nGeorge must have had some natural talents and some {90} gifts of\r\nintellect, for he would otherwise not have chosen such friends as those\r\nwhom in his better days he chose out and brought around him.  We are told\r\nthat he had marvellous powers of conversation, that he had a ready wit,\r\nand a keen insight into the humors and the weaknesses of those with whom\r\nhe was compelled to associate.  We are told that he could compete in\r\nrepartee with the recognized wits of his time, and that he could shine as\r\na talker even among men whose names still live in history because of\r\ntheir reputations as talkers.  Of course it will naturally occur to the\r\nmind that the guests of the Prince Regent might be easily inclined to\r\ndiscover genuine wit in any repartee which came from the Prince Regent,\r\nbut it is certain that some at least of the men who surrounded him were\r\nnot likely to have been betrayed into admiration merely because of the\r\nrank of their royal entertainer.  Burke was held to have spoken\r\ndisparagingly of George when he described him as \"brilliant but\r\nsuperficial.\"  To one of Burke's deep thought and wide information a man\r\nmight well have seemed superficial in whom others nevertheless believed\r\nthat they saw evidences of intellect and understanding, but if Burke\r\nthought a man brilliant it is only reasonable to assume that that man's\r\nconversation must have had frequent flashes of brilliancy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1830--The Third and Fourth Georges contrasted]\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly George was capable sometimes of appreciating thoroughly the\r\nqualities of greatness in other men, but the appreciation never left any\r\nabiding influence upon his character or his career.  He certainly did not\r\nmake himself the cause of so much injury to the best interests of the\r\nState as George the Third had done, but it has also to be observed that\r\nwhen George the Third went wrong and obstinately maintained a wrongful\r\ncourse he was acting in dogged obedience to what he believed to be his\r\nconscience and the teachings of his creed.  George the Fourth had\r\nabsolutely no conscience and no law of life, and when he talked most\r\nvehemently and loudly about his coronation oath those who were accustomed\r\nto deal with him knew quite well from experience that when he had\r\nexhausted his humor by a {91} sufficient outpouring of eloquence he would\r\nbe sure to take the advice given to him and to trouble himself no more\r\nabout the question of conscience.  In this way, of course, George the\r\nFourth did less harm to the State than his father had done, but when we\r\ncome to compare the moral character of the two men we must admit that the\r\nobstinacy of the father deserves the recognition which we cannot give to\r\nthe spasmodic and ephemeral self-assertion of the son.  Nobody for a\r\nmoment believed that George the Fourth had the slightest idea of actually\r\nabdicating his royal position in England and betaking himself to\r\nperpetual boredom in Hanover rather than consent to the passing of\r\nCatholic Emancipation.  But at times of trial those who were around\r\nGeorge the Third had good reason to believe that if he were driven to\r\nchoose between his throne and his conscience he would have come down\r\ndeliberately from the throne and followed his conscience whithersoever it\r\nmight lead him.  With George the Fourth the only question was how long he\r\nwould stand the wear and tear of having to defend his position, and how\r\nsoon he would begin to feel that the inconvenience of giving in would be\r\nless troublesome than the inconvenience of holding out.  Even the most\r\ncourtly historian would be hard put to it if he were set to find out any\r\npassage in the whole of George the Fourth's matured life which compels\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\nGeorge seems to have been an absolutely self-centred man.  He was to all\r\nappearance constitutionally unable to import into his mind any\r\nconsiderations but those which affected his own personal comforts and\r\nlikings and indulgences and occasional love of display.  There were times\r\nwhen he evidently thought he was acting a great part, and when it filled\r\nhim with joy to believe that he was thus making himself an object of\r\npublic admiration; but no higher consideration, no thought beyond him and\r\nthe applause he believed himself to be winning, appear to have entered\r\nhis mind even at such moments of exaltation.  We read in history of\r\nprinces who believed themselves qualified by nature to be great actors or\r\ngreat singers, and who made absurd exhibitions of themselves accordingly\r\nand accepted {92} the courtly and venal applause as genuine tributes to\r\nartistic genius.  In the same way, and only in the same way, George the\r\nFourth sometimes believed himself to be playing a great part, and it\r\ngratified his vanity to act the part out until it became tiresome to him\r\nand he found it a relief to go back to the ordinary delights of his easy,\r\nlazy, and sensuous nature.  Perhaps the best that can be said of him is\r\nthat he had possibly some gifts which under other conditions might have\r\nbeen turned to better account.  Perhaps if he had had to work for a\r\nliving, to make a career in life for himself, to depend for his success\r\nentirely on the steady use of his own best qualities, and to avoid the\r\nidleness and self-indulgence which would have condemned him to perpetual\r\nstint and poverty, he might have made a respectable name in some career\r\nwhere intelligence and application count for much.  But a hard fortune\r\nhad condemned him to be a king, and to begin by being the son of a king,\r\nand thus to find as the years went on increasing opportunity of\r\ngratifying all his meanest tastes and finding always around him the ready\r\nhomage which accords its applause to the most ignoble caprices and the\r\nmost wanton self-indulgence.  The reign of George the Fourth saw great\r\ndeeds and great men; it could have seen few men in all his realm less\r\ndeserving a word of praise than George the Fourth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1830--Events in the reign of George the Fourth]\r\n\r\nThe reign saw the beginning of many great enterprises in practical\r\nscience, the uprising of many philanthropic combinations, and the first\r\nmovements of political and social reform.  It saw the earliest attempts\r\nmade in a systematic way towards the spread of education among the\r\nmultitude, and the close of many a bright career in literature and the\r\narts.  Bishop Heber died in 1826.  The death of Byron has already been\r\nrecorded in these pages, and at even an earlier period of the reign two\r\nother stars of the first magnitude in the firmament of literature ceased\r\nto shine upon the earth in bodily presence with the deaths of Keats and\r\nShelley.  John Kemble, probably the greatest English tragic actor from\r\nthe days of Garrick to the uprising of Edmund Kean, died while George the\r\nFourth was {93} King.  Sir Thomas Lawrence, Flaxman, Fuseli, and\r\nNollekens ceased to work for art.  Sir Humphry Davy, Dugald Stewart, and\r\nPestalozzi were lost to science.  The reign saw the foundation of the\r\nRoyal Society of Literature, which, to do him justice, George the Fourth\r\nhelped to establish; the beginning of Mechanics' Institute, and the\r\nopening of some new parks and the Zoological Gardens.  It is doubtful if\r\nthe Thames Tunnel can be described as a really valuable addition to the\r\ntriumphs of engineering, and it will perhaps be generally admitted that\r\nBuckingham Palace was not an artistic addition to the architectural\r\nornaments of the metropolis.  The Society for the Diffusion of Useful\r\nKnowledge was set on foot owing chiefly to the energy and the instincts\r\nof Henry Brougham.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the foreign policy of Canning opened a distinctly new\r\nchapter in English history, and it may be observed that owing to the\r\ninfluence of that policy the principle of neutrality was maintained under\r\ndifficult conditions, and even where the general sympathy of England went\r\ndistinctly with one of the parties to a foreign dispute.  This policy\r\nmight well have been followed with credit and advantage to England on\r\nmore than one critical occasion at a much later time.  The reign saw the\r\nbeginning of the movement towards free trade as a distinct international\r\npolicy, and saw the removal of some of the most cramping and antiquated\r\nrestrictions on the commerce of the kingdom and the colonies.  The\r\ncrusade against slavery and the slave-trade may be said to have begun its\r\nmarch in anything like organized form during this reign.  The political\r\nprinciples which we now describe as Liberal became a new force in the\r\nState during the same time.  The idea that even beneficent despotism can\r\nbe counted on as an enduring or an endurable form of government began to\r\ndie out, and the principle came to be more and more distinctly and loudly\r\nproclaimed that the best form of government must be not only for, but by,\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nThese things are in themselves enough to show that in the sphere of\r\npolitical and social reform as well as in that {94} of practical science\r\nthe reign of George the Fourth was at least a reign of great beginnings.\r\nThe student of history may perhaps draw an instructive and a moral lesson\r\nfrom the knowledge forced upon him of the fact which seems lamentable in\r\nitself that to the ruler of the State little or nothing was due for the\r\nachievements which give the reign its best claim to be honored in\r\nhistory.  The reign of George the Fourth teaches us that in a country\r\nlike modern England, while a good sovereign may do much to forward the\r\nintellectual, political, and social progress of the people, even the\r\nworst sovereign could no longer do much to retard it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1830: The Georges and the Stuarts]\r\n\r\nThe Four Georges had come and gone.  A famous epoch in English history\r\nhad ended.  Four princes of the same race, of the same name, had ruled in\r\nsuccession over the English people.  Practically, the reigns of the four\r\nnamesakes may be said to coincide with, to comprehend, and to represent\r\nthe history of the eighteenth century in England.  The reign of George\r\nthe Fourth may be regarded as a survival from the eighteenth into the\r\nnineteenth century, as the reign of Anne was a survival from the\r\nseventeenth into the eighteenth century.  In all the changes of that long\r\nand eventful age one change is very memorable and significant.  The\r\nposition of the dynasty was very different when George the Fourth died\r\nfrom what it was when his great-great-grandfather came over unwillingly\r\nfrom Germany to grasp the sceptre.  When the Elector of Hanover became\r\nKing of England, the Stuart party was still a power in political life and\r\nthe Stuart cause the dearest hope of a very large number of devoted\r\nEnglishmen.  It might well be hard for men to realize in the days of\r\nGeorge the Fourth that in the reign of the first George and in the reign\r\nof the second George the throne reeled beneath the blows which the armed\r\nadherents of the exiled Stuart princes struck at the supremacy of the\r\nsovereigns of the House of Brunswick.  Even when the third George came to\r\nthe throne there were still desperate dreamers who hoped against hope\r\nthat something, anything, might happen which would allow the King--the\r\nKing over the {95} water--to enjoy his own again.  When the last of the\r\nGeorges passed away, the Stuart cause had been buried for nearly half a\r\ncentury in that grave in Rome which encloses the remains of the last and\r\nperhaps the most unhappy of the Stuart princes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{96}\r\n\r\nWILLIAM THE FOURTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIX.\r\n\r\nKING WILLIAM THE FOURTH.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1830--The career of William the Fourth]\r\n\r\nWilliam the Fourth, as the Duke of Clarence had now become, was nearing\r\nthe completion of his sixty-fifth year when the death of his brother\r\nraised him to the throne.  He had surely had full time in which to\r\nprepare himself for the business of a monarch, for during a long period\r\nit was well known that nothing was likely to stand between him and the\r\nsuccession except the life of his elder brother, the Duke of York.  But\r\nWilliam's tastes did not allure him to any study of the duties which\r\nbelonged to a throne.  The Navy was assigned to him as a profession,\r\nand he actually saw some service in America and in the West Indies, but\r\nhe obtained his promotion as a matter of course until he reached the\r\nposition of Lord High Admiral, which may be described as the main-top\r\nof his naval career.  The story is told of him, and will probably,\r\nwhether it be accurate or not, be told as long as his history comes\r\nunder public recollection, that he had something to do with the\r\npromotion of the great naval battle of Navarino, which led to the\r\nemancipation of Greece.  The combined fleets of England, France, and\r\nRussia, under command of Admiral Sir Edward Codrington, were watching\r\nthe Turkish and Egyptian fleets, in order to protect Greece against\r\nthem.  But the actual course to be taken by the allies was supposed to\r\ndepend upon many serious political considerations.  The British\r\nAdmiralty issued a solemn official despatch to Sir Edward Codrington,\r\nenjoining on him the necessity of great care and caution in any action\r\nhe might take.  This {97} document was forwarded in due course by the\r\nLord High Admiral, and the story goes that the Duke of Clarence\r\nscribbled at the end of it in his own hand the encouraging words, \"Go\r\nit, Ned.\"  Whether it was fought under this inspiration or not, it is\r\ncertain that the battle was fought, that the Turkish and Egyptian\r\nfleets were destroyed, and that the independence of Greece was won.\r\n\r\nThe English public generally would have been none the less inclined to\r\nwelcome the accession of the Duke of Clarence as William the Fourth\r\neven although it had been part of authentic history that the new King\r\nhad lately borne an important, if an underhand, part in the rescue of\r\nGreece from Ottoman oppression.  But there was little else in the\r\ncareer of the Duke of Clarence to command popular respect or affection.\r\nHe had lived openly, or almost openly, for many years with the\r\ncelebrated actress Mrs. Jordan, who had borne him ten children, and\r\nthis connection had been made the subject of free and frank allusion in\r\nsome of the verses of Robert Burns.  The British public, however, were\r\ninclined, as Robert Burns was, to look forgivingly on the doings of the\r\nPrince, for he was still a young man when his acquaintance with Mrs.\r\nJordan began.  The British public liked him because he was a sailor, if\r\nfor nothing else, and men's eyes turned hopefully to him when it became\r\napparent that not much good was any longer to be looked for from George\r\nthe Fourth.  In 1818 William married the eldest daughter of the Duke of\r\nSaxe-Meiningen, and had two daughters, both of whom died in their\r\ninfancy.  The Duke of Clarence had been noted, during the greater part\r\nof his career, for his roughness of manner, and many anecdotes of him\r\nwere spread about which might have suited well the fun of some\r\nhistorian belonging to the school of Brantôme, or some compiler of\r\nmemoirs after the fashion of Saint-Simon.  Still he was the Sailor\r\nKing, and England had always, and naturally, loved sailors; and \"go to\r\nthen,\" as might have been said in the days of Shakespeare, what further\r\nexplanation could be needed of the fact that William the Fourth opened\r\nhis career of royalty under favoring {98} auspices?  It might seem to\r\nthe mind of some philosophical observer rather hard to get into\r\ntransports of enthusiasm about a new monarch aged sixty-five who during\r\nall his previous career had done nothing of which to be particularly\r\nproud, and had done many things of which a respectable person in\r\nprivate life would have felt heartily ashamed.  Still, the Duke of\r\nClarence had become William the Fourth, and was on the throne, and\r\ngreat things might possibly be expected from him even yet, although he\r\nwas pretty well stricken in years.  At all events, he was not George\r\nthe Fourth.  So the public of these countries was in the mood to make\r\nthe best of him, and give him a loyal welcome, and wait for events with\r\nthe comfortable faith that even at sixty-five a man may begin a new\r\nlife, and find time and heart and intellect to do things of which no\r\npromise whatever had been given during all his earlier years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1830--The pocket boroughs]\r\n\r\nWilliam had been supposed up to the time of his accession to lean\r\ntowards the Whig, or what we should now call the Liberal party.  His\r\nmanners were frank, familiar, and even rough.  He cared little for\r\nCourt ceremonial of any kind, and was in the habit of walking about the\r\nstreets with his umbrella tucked under his arm, like any ordinary\r\nLondoner.  All this told rather in his favor, so far as the outer\r\npublic were concerned.  There was supposed to be something rather\r\nEnglish, something rather typical of John Bull in the easy-going\r\nmanners of the new sovereign, which gave people an additional reason\r\nfor welcoming him.  The new sovereign, however, had come in for times\r\nof popular excitement, and even of trouble.  There came a new\r\nrevolution in France--only a dynastic revolution, to be sure, and not a\r\nnational upheaval, but still it was a change which dethroned the newly\r\nrestored legitimate line of sovereigns.  The elder branch of the\r\nBourbons was torn away and flung aside.  There were to be no more kings\r\nof France, but only kings of the French.  Charles the Tenth was\r\ndeposed, and Louis Philippe, son of Philippe Egalité, was placed on the\r\nthrone.  Charles the Tenth was the last of the legitimate kings of\r\nFrance so far, and there does not {99} seem much chance in the\r\nimmediate future for any restoration of the fallen dynasty.\r\n\r\nThe overthrow of legitimacy in France had a strong effect on popular\r\nopinion in England.  It was plain that Charles the Tenth and his system\r\nhad come to ruin because the sovereign and his ministers would not move\r\nwith the common movement of the times over the greater part of the\r\nEuropean continent, and popular reformers in England took care that the\r\nlesson should not be thrown away over here.  Great changes had been\r\naccomplished by popular movements even during the enfeebling and\r\ndisheartening reign of George the Fourth.  Great progress had been made\r\ntowards the establishment of religious equality, or at all events\r\ntowards the removal of religious disqualifications among the Dissenters\r\nand the Roman Catholics.  There was a loud cry almost everywhere for\r\nsome measure of political reform.  The conditions of the country had\r\nbeen gradually undergoing a great change.  England had been becoming\r\nless and less dependent for her prosperity on her mere agricultural\r\nresources, and had been growing more and more into a great\r\nmanufacturing community.  Huge towns like Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds,\r\nBirmingham, and Sheffield were arising in the Northern and Midland\r\nregions.  Liverpool was superseding Bristol as the great seaport of\r\ncommercial traffic.  Yet in most cases the old-fashioned principle\r\nstill prevailed which in practice confined the Parliamentary\r\nrepresentation of the country to the members who sat for the counties,\r\nand for what were called the pocket boroughs.  The theory of the\r\nConstitution, as it was understood, held that the sovereign summoned at\r\nhis own discretion and pleasure the persons whom he thought best\r\nqualified to form a House of Commons, to consult with him as to the\r\ngovernment of the empire.  The sovereign for this purpose conferred the\r\nright of representation on this or that town, or district, or county,\r\naccording as he thought fit, and this arrangement had gone on from\r\ngeneration to generation.  Now it sometimes happened that a place that\r\nhad been comparatively popular and prosperous at the period when it\r\nobtained the {100} right of representation had seen its prosperity and\r\nits population gradually ebb away from it, and leave it little better\r\nthan a bare hill-side, and yet the bare hill-side retained the right of\r\nrepresentation, and its owner could send any one he pleased into the\r\nHouse of Commons.  There were numberless illustrations of this curious\r\nanomaly all over the country.  The great families of landed proprietors\r\nnaturally monopolized among them the representation of the counties,\r\nand many of them enjoyed also the ownership of the small decaying or\r\ntotally decayed boroughs which still retained the right of returning\r\nmembers to Parliament.  On the other hand, the development of\r\nmanufacturing energy had caused the growth of great and populous towns\r\nand cities, and most of these towns and cities were actually without\r\nrepresentation or the right of representation in the House of Commons.\r\nThus a condition of things had arisen which was certain to prove itself\r\nincompatible with the spread of education and the growth of public\r\ninterest in all great questions of domestic reform.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1830--The Princess Victoria]\r\n\r\nWe have already seen in this history how the Whig party in Parliament,\r\nand the popular agitators out of Parliament, had long been rousing the\r\nnational intelligence and the national conscience to a sense of the\r\ngrowing necessity for some complete change in all that concerned the\r\nrepresentation of the people.  The Duke of Wellington was at the head\r\nof the Administration when George the Fourth died and William came to\r\nthe throne.  The new King, as has been said, was supposed to have\r\nLiberal inclinations as regarded political questions, and there was a\r\ncommon expectation that he might begin his reign by summoning a new set\r\nof ministers.  The King, however, did nothing of the kind.  He sent\r\nmessages to the Duke of Wellington telling him, in his usual familiar\r\nand uncouth way, that he had always liked the Duke uncommonly well, and\r\ndid not see any reason why he should not keep him on as his Prime\r\nMinister.  This was, to begin with, a disappointment to the majority of\r\nthe public.  The first royal speech from the throne contained other\r\nmatter of disappointment.  There was great distress all over the {101}\r\ncountry.  The enormous expense of the long wars was still making itself\r\nfelt in huge taxation.  The condition of agriculture was low, and many\r\ndistricts were threatened with something like famine.  Trade was\r\nsuffering from the reaction which always follows a long and exhausting\r\nwar.  It was confidently expected that the royal speech would take some\r\naccount of the widespread national distress and would foreshadow some\r\nmeasures to deal with it.  The speech, however, said nothing on the\r\nsubject.  Then there was another omission which created much\r\ndissatisfaction and even some alarm.  The speech made no mention of any\r\nmeasures to be taken for the establishment of a regency in the event of\r\nthe King's death.  The King was sixty-five years old, and had led a\r\nlife which even the most loyal and hopeful of his subjects could not\r\nregard with confidence as likely to give promise of a long reign.  Now\r\nthe heir-presumptive to the throne was the Princess Alexandrina\r\nVictoria, a child then only eleven years old.  The Princess Victoria,\r\nas she was commonly called, was the daughter of the Duke of Kent, the\r\nfourth son of George the Third.  Any attack of illness, any serious\r\naccident, might bring the life of King William to a sudden close, and\r\nthen if no previous arrangement had been made for a regency Parliament\r\nand the country might be involved in some confusion.\r\n\r\nThere was one very grave and even ominous condition which had to be\r\ntaken into account.  If the King were to die suddenly, and with no\r\nprovision made for a regency, the girl, perhaps the child, who\r\nsucceeded him would in the ordinary course of things be left under the\r\nguardianship of her eldest uncle, the Duke of Cumberland.  Now it is\r\nonly stating a simple fact to say that the Duke of Cumberland was then\r\nthe most unpopular man in England.  He was not merely unpopular, he was\r\nan object of common dread and detestation.  He was regarded as a\r\nreckless profligate and an unprincipled schemer.  There must have been\r\nmuch exaggeration about some of the tales that were told and accepted\r\nconcerning him, for it is hard to believe that at a time so near to our\r\nown a prince of {102} the Royal House of England could have lived a\r\nlife the story of which might seem to have belonged to the worst days\r\nof the Lower Empire.  But, whatever allowance be made for exaggeration,\r\nit is certain that the Duke of Cumberland was almost universally hated,\r\nand that many people seriously considered him quite capable of any plot\r\nor any crime which might secure his own advancement to the throne.\r\nSanguine persons, indeed, saw a gleam of hope in the fact that the Duke\r\nof Cumberland was in any case the heir to the crown of Hanover.  In the\r\nHouse of Hanover the succession is confined to the male line, and the\r\nPrincess Victoria had nothing to do with it.  The hope, therefore, was\r\nthat the Duke of Cumberland would be content with the prospect of his\r\nsuccession to the throne of Hanover, and that when the time arrived for\r\nhim to become King of Hanover he would betake himself to his new\r\nkingdom and trouble England no more.  Still the fact remained that just\r\nas yet he was not King of Hanover, and that if no proper provisions\r\nwere made against a contingency he might become the guardian of the\r\ngirl, or the child, who was to succeed William the Fourth on the\r\nEnglish throne.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1830--The death of Huskisson]\r\n\r\nKing William, however, did not trouble himself much about all these\r\nconsiderations.  He did not see any reason why people should expect him\r\nto die all of a sudden, and he could hardly be got to give any serious\r\nattention to the question of a regency.  It was then part of the\r\nconstitutional practice of the monarchy that a dissolution of\r\nParliament should take place when a new sovereign had come to the\r\nthrone.  The practice has since ceased to be a part of our\r\nconstitutional usages, but in the days when William the Fourth came to\r\nthe throne it was a matter of course.  The King, for some reason or\r\nother, was anxious that a dissolution should take place as soon as\r\npossible.  It may be that he was merely desirous to find out how far\r\nthe existing Ministry had the support of the country, although it does\r\nnot seem quite likely that William's intelligence could have carried\r\nhim so near to the level of statesmanship as to make this elementary\r\nquestion a {103} matter of consideration in his mind.  The King's\r\nprincipal ministers were the Duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel.\r\nThe most powerful among the leaders of Opposition were Charles, Earl\r\nGrey, in the House of Lords and Henry Brougham and Lord John Russell in\r\nthe House of Commons.  There was some doubt as to the position which\r\nmight be taken up by Canning and Huskisson and their friends.  Some of\r\nthe Tories believed that they might be won over to support the Duke of\r\nWellington, in order to assist him in counteracting the efforts of the\r\nmore ardent and liberal reformers, like Grey and Brougham and Russell.\r\nFate soon settled the question so far at least as Huskisson was\r\nconcerned.  The opening of the line of railway from Liverpool to\r\nManchester, the first line of any considerable length completed in\r\nEngland, took place on September 15, 1830.  The Duke of Wellington, Sir\r\nRobert Peel, and Huskisson were among the distinguished visitors who\r\nwere present at the opening of the railway.  The friends alike of the\r\nPrime Minister and of the great expert in finance were anxious that the\r\ntwo should come together on this occasion, and make a personal if not a\r\npolitical reconciliation.  The train stopped at a station; the Duke and\r\nHuskisson both got out, and were approaching to meet each other, the\r\nDuke holding out his hand, when an alarm was raised about the approach\r\nof a locomotive.  A rush was made for the carriages, and in the\r\nconfusion Huskisson was struck down by an open door in the moving\r\ntrain, and suffered such injuries that his death almost immediately\r\nfollowed.  Huskisson was, beyond doubt, one of the most enlightened\r\nstatesmen of his time in all that concerned the financial arrangements\r\nof the country.  He might have been called a Liberal, just as we might\r\ncall Canning a Liberal, when we think of the general direction taken by\r\nthe policy of either man.\r\n\r\nThe dissatisfaction with which the speech from the throne was received\r\nfound its expression in no severer form, so far at least as Parliament\r\nwas concerned, than a motion by Lord Grey in the one House, and Lord\r\nAlthorp in the other, for a short delay to enable both Houses to {104}\r\nconsider the address in reply to the royal speech.  It was made evident\r\nthat the delay sought for had to do with the question of a regency,\r\nconcerning which, as has been said, the King had not troubled himself\r\nto make any announcement.  Now the constitutional system of England had\r\ntaken no account, except through the provision of a regency, of the\r\nfact that a child might become sovereign of the realm.  Therefore, if\r\nParliament did not establish a regency during the lifetime of King\r\nWilliam, and if the King were soon to die through any accident or\r\nmalady, the child Princess would come to the throne under no further\r\nconstitutional restraints than those which belonged to the position of\r\na full-grown sovereign.  There was another trouble, however, and one of\r\nstill graver political importance, awaiting the Ministry of the Duke of\r\nWellington.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1830--Brougham and Reform]\r\n\r\nHenry Brougham gave notice in the House of Commons that on an early day\r\nhe would bring forward a motion to raise the whole question of reform\r\nin the representative system of the country.  Brougham, at this time,\r\nwas regarded as the most strenuous and powerful champion of reform in\r\nthe House of Commons.  Lord John Russell had not yet had an opportunity\r\nof proving how steadfast were his principles as a reformer, and how\r\ngreat were the Parliamentary gifts which he had brought to the main\r\npurpose of his life.  Moreover, Lord John Russell never had any of the\r\nkind of eloquence which made Brougham so powerful in and out of\r\nParliament.  Brougham on a popular platform could outdo the most stormy\r\nmob orator of the time.  He was impassioned, boisterous, overwhelming\r\nto a degree of which we can find no adequate illustration even in the\r\nmost tumultuous Trafalgar Square demonstrations of our later days.\r\nEven in the House of Commons, and afterwards in what might be regarded\r\nas the deadening atmosphere of the House of Lords, Brougham was\r\naccustomed to shout and storm and gesticulate, to shake his fist and\r\nstamp, after a fashion which was startling even in those days, and of\r\nwhich now we have no living illustration.  Brougham was at this time\r\nalmost at the very zenith of his popularity among the reformers all\r\nover the country, {105} and more especially in the North of England.\r\nWhen, therefore, Brougham announced that he was determined at the\r\nearliest opportunity to raise the whole question of reform in the House\r\nof Commons it became evident that the new reign was destined to open\r\nwith a momentous and long constitutional struggle, a struggle that\r\nmight be counted upon to mark an epoch in the history of England.  The\r\nnews that the French legitimate monarchy had fallen and that Louis\r\nPhilippe reigned as King of the French--King of the barricades he was\r\ncommonly called--came in time to quicken men's hopes and animate their\r\npassions for the approaching trial of strength between the old forms\r\nand the new spirit.\r\n\r\nThe Government refused to agree to the one day's delay which was asked\r\nfor by the leaders of Opposition.  On a division being taken there was\r\na majority for Ministers in both Houses, and the Duke of Wellington had\r\nscored thus far.  He had shown that he was personally determined not to\r\nconcede any point to the Opposition, and he had secured a victory.\r\nParliament was dissolved within a few days and the country was plunged\r\ninto a general election.  At that time, it should be remembered, an\r\nelection was a very different sort of event from that which bears the\r\nsame name at the present day.  An election contest could then,\r\naccording to the extent and nature of the constituency, run on for a\r\ntime not exceeding fifteen days, and it was accompanied by a practice\r\nof bribery, lavish, open, shameless, and profligate, such as is totally\r\nunknown to our more modern times, and such as our habits and feelings,\r\nno more than our laws, would tolerate.  Intimidation and violence were\r\nalso parts of every fiercely contested election, and those whom the law\r\nexcluded from any part in the struggle as electors were apt to find, in\r\nthat very exclusion, only another reason for taking part in it by the\r\nuse of physical force.  Just at the time which we are now describing\r\nthere are many conditions which made a general election likely to be\r\nespecially stormy and turbulent.\r\n\r\nThe distress which prevailed throughout the country had in many\r\ndistricts called up a spirit of something like {106} desperation, which\r\nexhibited itself in a crime of almost entire novelty, the burning of\r\nhayricks on farms.  This offence became so widespread throughout large\r\nparts of the country that it gave rise to theories about an organized\r\nconspiracy against property which was supposed to be, in some vague\r\nsort of way, an outcome of the socialistic excesses which had taken\r\nplace during the French Revolution and had been revived by the more\r\nrecent commotions in France.  The probability is that the rick-burning\r\noffences were, in the first instance, the outcome of sheer despair\r\nseeking vengeance anywhere and anyhow for its own sufferings, and then\r\nof the mere passion for imitation in crime which finds some manner of\r\nillustration here and there at all periods of history.  However that\r\nmay be, it is certain that the offences became very common, that they\r\nwere punished with merciless severity, and that the gallows was kept in\r\nconstant operation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1830--A change in constitutional systems]\r\n\r\nNow, it may be taken almost as a political axiom that whenever there is\r\ngreat distress at the time of a general election it is certain to give\r\nrise to some feeling of hostility against a Ministry, especially if the\r\nMinistry had been for any length of time in power.  A considerable\r\nportion of the Tories had been turned against the Duke of Wellington\r\nbecause, under the advice of Sir Robert Peel, he had yielded at last to\r\nthe demand for Catholic Emancipation, even although, as Peel and the\r\nDuke himself declared, the concession had been made merely as a choice\r\nbetween Catholic Emancipation and civil war.  Some influential Tories\r\nall over the country were asking whether Ireland had been pacified or\r\nhad shown herself in the least degree grateful because an instalment of\r\nreligious freedom had been granted to the Roman Catholics, and they\r\ninsisted that the Duke had surrendered the supremacy of the Established\r\nChurch to no purpose.  It was certain, indeed, that O'Connell had not,\r\nin the slightest degree, slackened the energy of his political movement\r\nbecause the emancipating Act had been passed.  Among the opponents of\r\nreform, at all times, there are some who seem to hold that the granting\r\nof one reform ought to be enough to put a stop to all demands for any\r\n{107} other, and that it is mere ingratitude on the part of a man who\r\nhas just obtained permission to follow his own form of worship if he\r\nwants also to be put on an equality with his neighbors as regards the\r\nassertion of his political opinions.  Therefore, the Ministry found, as\r\nthe elections went on, that they had not merely all the reformers\r\nagainst them, but that a certain proportion of those who, in the\r\nordinary condition of things, would have been their supporters were\r\nestranged from them merely because they had, under whatever pressure,\r\nconsented to introduce any manner of reform.\r\n\r\nWhen the elections were over it seemed to reasonable observers very\r\ndoubtful indeed whether King William, however well inclined, would be\r\nable to retain for any length of time the Duke of Wellington and Sir\r\nRobert Peel as the leading advisers of the Crown.  The country just\r\nthen may be described as in a state of transition from one\r\nconstitutional system to another.  It was growing more clear, day by\r\nday, that the time had gone by when the sovereign could hold to any one\r\nparticular minister, or set of ministers, in defiance of the majority\r\nin the representative chamber and the strength of public opinion\r\nout-of-doors.  On the other hand, the time had not yet arrived when the\r\nsystem introduced and established by the present reign could be relied\r\nupon as part of the Constitution, and the sovereign could be trusted to\r\naccept, without demur, the judgment of the House of Commons as to the\r\nchoice of his ministers.  The new Parliament was opened on November 5,\r\nand the Royal Speech gave but little satisfaction to reformers of any\r\nclass.  It contained no recommendation of constitutional reform, and\r\nindeed congratulated the whole population on having the advantage of\r\nliving under so faultless a political system.  It concerned itself in\r\nno wise about the distress that existed in the country, except that it\r\nexpressed much satisfaction at the manner in which the criminal laws\r\nhad been called into severe action for the repression of offences\r\nagainst property.\r\n\r\nThe King conceded so much to public opinion as to recommend the\r\nappointment of a regency, in order to {108} make provision for the\r\npossibility of his life being cut short; but even this was only done in\r\na fashion that seemed to say, \"If you really will have it that I am\r\nlikely to die soon you may humor yourselves by taking any course that\r\nseems to satisfy your scruples--it is not worth my while to interfere\r\nwith your whims.\"  The reformers therefore had clearly nothing to\r\nexpect so far as the Royal Speech could deal with expectations.  But\r\nthey found that they had still less to expect from the intentions of\r\nthe Ministry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1830--Wellington as a politician]\r\n\r\nIn the debate on the address, in reply to the speech from the throne,\r\nLord Grey took occasion to ask for some exposition of Ministerial\r\npolicy with regard to reform of the representative system.  Then the\r\nDuke of Wellington delivered a speech which may be described as unique\r\nin its way.  It would be impossible to put into words any statement\r\nmore frankly opposed to all Parliamentary reform.  The greatest orator\r\nthat ever lived, the profoundest judge who ever laid down the law to a\r\njury, could not have prepared a statement more comprehensive and more\r\nexact as a condemnation of all reform than that which the victor of\r\nWaterloo was able to enunciate with all confidence and satisfaction.\r\nHe laid it down that it would be utterly beyond the power of the wisest\r\npolitical philosopher to devise a Constitution so near to absolute\r\nperfection as that with which Englishmen living in the reign of his\r\npresent Majesty, William the Fourth, had been endowed by the wisdom of\r\ntheir ancestors.  He affirmed that he had never heard any suggestion\r\nwhich contained the slightest promise of an improvement on that\r\nConstitution.  He repeated, in various forms of repetition, that\r\nEnglishmen already possessed all the freedom that it was good for men\r\nto have, that the rights of all classes were equally maintained, that\r\nthe happiness of every one was secured, so far as law could secure it,\r\nand that the only thing for reasonable Englishmen to do was to open\r\ntheir eyes and recognize the advantages conferred upon them by the\r\nConstitution under which they were happy enough to live.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington probably knew nothing of {109} Voltaire's\r\nphilosopher who maintained that everything was for the best in this\r\nbest of all possible worlds, but he seemed to be pervaded by the same\r\nsentiment of complete satisfaction when he contemplated the British\r\nConstitution.  Finally, he declared that, so far from having any\r\nintention to touch with irreverent hand that sacred political structure\r\nfor the vain purpose of improvement, he was determined to resist to the\r\nuttermost of his power every effort to interfere with the\r\nconstitutional arrangements which had done so much for the prosperity\r\nand the glory of the empire.  We do not quote the exact words of the\r\nDuke of Wellington's speech, but we feel sure we are giving a faithful\r\nversion of the meaning which he intended to convey and succeeded very\r\nclearly in conveying.  The Duke of Wellington was undoubtedly one of\r\nthe greatest soldiers the world has ever seen.  As a soldier of\r\nconquest he was not indeed to be compared with an Alexander, a Caesar,\r\nor a Napoleon, but as a soldier of defence he has probably never had a\r\nsuperior.  As an administrator, too, he had shown immense capacity both\r\nin India and in Europe, and had more than once brought what seemed\r\nabsolute chaos into order and shape.  But he had no gift for the\r\nunderstanding of politics, and it was happy for him, at more than one\r\ncrisis of his career, that he was quite aware of his own political\r\nincapacity and was ready to defer to the judgment of other men who\r\nunderstood such things better than he did.  We have already seen how he\r\naccepted the guidance of Peel when it became necessary to yield the\r\nclaim for Catholic Emancipation, and he was commonly in the habit of\r\nsaying that Peel understood all such matters better than he could\r\npretend to.  He was not, therefore, the minister who would ruin a State\r\nor bring a State into revolution by obstinate adhesion to his own views\r\nin despite of every advice and every warning, and no doubt when he was\r\ndelivering his harangue against all possible schemes of reform he felt\r\nstill convinced that he was merely expressing the unalterable opinion\r\nof Peel and every other loyal subject whose judgment ought to prevail\r\nwith a law-abiding people.\r\n\r\n{110}\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons Brougham gave notice that on an early day he\r\nwould bring forward a motion on the subject of political reform.  Thus,\r\ntherefore, the trumpet of battle was sounded on both sides.  The\r\nstruggle must now be fought out to the end.  Nothing, however, could be\r\ndone until the Ministry had been driven from office, and it was not by\r\nany means certain that in the House of Commons, as it was then\r\nconstituted, a direct vote on the question of reform would end in a\r\ndefeat of the Duke of Wellington's Government.  Something that seemed\r\nalmost like an accident brought about a crisis sooner than had been\r\nanticipated.  Sir Henry Parnell brought forward a motion for the\r\nappointment of a select committee to inquire into, and report upon, the\r\nestimates and amounts submitted by his Majesty with regard to the civil\r\nservice.  This motion had the support of the Liberal leaders and was\r\nstrongly opposed by the Government.  No one could have been surprised\r\nat the opposition offered by the Government, for Sir Henry Parnell's\r\nwas just the sort of motion which every Ministry is sure to oppose.  A\r\ngovernment prepares its own estimates, and is not apt to be in favor of\r\nthe appointment of an outside committee to inquire into their amount\r\nand their appropriation.  Still, the whole question was not one to be\r\nregarded as of capital importance in ordinary times, and therefore,\r\nalthough the debate was one of great interest both inside and outside\r\nthe House of Commons, it did not seem likely to lead to any momentous\r\nand immediate consequences.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1830--Ministerial resignations]\r\n\r\nSir Henry Parnell was a man of ability and character, and was regarded\r\nin the House as an authority on financial questions.  He belonged to\r\nthe family of Parnell the poet, the friend of Swift and Pope, and he\r\nafterwards became the first Lord Congleton, taking his title from that\r\npart of Cheshire where the poet and his ancestors had lived.  In years,\r\nmuch later years, that belonged to our own times another member of the\r\nParnell family made for himself a conspicuous place in the House of\r\nCommons and in Imperial politics, the late Charles Stewart Parnell, the\r\nfamous leader of the Irish National party.  Sir Henry {111} Parnell\r\ncarried his motion by a majority of twenty-nine in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nNow in the ordinary course of things there was nothing in such an event\r\nto compel the resignation of a Ministry.  It would have been quite\r\nreasonable for any Government to express a willingness to meet the\r\nwishes of the House on such a subject, to agree to the appointment of a\r\ncommittee, and then go on as if nothing particular had occurred.  But\r\nit sometimes happens that a Government is willing, or even anxious, to\r\naccept defeat on a side issue, although of minor importance, in order\r\nto escape from, or at all events to postpone, a decision on some\r\nquestion of vital import.  Sometimes, too, there are reasons, well\r\nknown to all members of a Government but not yet in the knowledge of\r\nthe public, which incline a Ministry to find a reason for resigning\r\noffice in the result of some casual division which cannot be said to\r\namount to a vote of want of confidence.  Not many years have passed\r\nsince a Liberal Government, which might have seemed to ordinary\r\nobservers to be secure in its position, thought it well to accept a\r\nvote on the supply of cordite in the army stores as a vote of want of\r\nconfidence, and accordingly went out of office.  The Duke of Wellington\r\nand Sir Robert Peel appear to have come to the conclusion that the\r\nsuccess of Sir Henry Parnell's motion would furnish them with a\r\nplausible excuse for withdrawing at a convenient moment from an\r\nunpromising position.  Henry Brougham, as we have already said, had\r\ngiven formal notice in the House of Commons that he would bring forward\r\na motion for leave to introduce a definite scheme of Parliamentary\r\nreform.  Now everybody knew that Brougham was at that time thoroughly\r\nearnest on the subject of reform, and that he had, during the recent\r\ngeneral election, the best possible reasons for knowing that the great\r\nmajority in the North of England, at all events, was behind him.  On\r\nthe other hand, ministers themselves had had ample opportunities of\r\nfinding out, during the elections, that a large number of those whom at\r\nother times they might have regarded as their own supporters were\r\nestranged from them or had actually turned {112} against them.  The\r\nDuke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel probably thought that their\r\nwisest course would be to let Lord Grey and Brougham and their friends\r\ntry what they could do with the monstrous spectre of reform which they\r\nhad conjured up, and wait till the country had recovered its senses\r\nbefore again undertaking to act as ministers of the Crown.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1830--Wellington and Peel resign]\r\n\r\nAn odd and rather absurd incident, which created much scandal and alarm\r\nat the time, and soon passed out of public recollection, had helped no\r\ndoubt to bring the Duke of Wellington and Peel to their decision.  The\r\nKing and Queen had been invited to dine with the Lord Mayor and the\r\nCorporation at the Guildhall on November 9, and had accepted the\r\ninvitation.  The Duke of Wellington and the other ministers were to be\r\namong the guests.\r\n\r\nShortly before the appointed day the Duke of Wellington got a letter\r\nfrom the Lord Mayor-elect, telling him that he had received private\r\ninformation about some mysterious organized attempt to be made against\r\nthe Duke himself on the occasion of his visit to the City, and urging\r\nthe Duke to have the streets well guarded with soldiers, in order to\r\nprevent the success of any such lawless and atrocious enterprise.  Now\r\nthe Duke was not a man to care much, personally, about an alarm of this\r\nkind, but he thought it would be rather an unseemly spectacle if the\r\nstreets of the City had to be guarded by troops when the new sovereign\r\nwent to be the guest of the Lord Mayor at the Guildhall.  The attempt,\r\nto be sure, was said to be directed against the Duke himself and not\r\nagainst the King; but still it would hardly do, it would scarcely have\r\na happy effect on public opinion at home and abroad, if the first visit\r\nof the Sailor King, the popular William, to the City were to be made\r\nthe occasion of a murderous attack on the King's Prime Minister.  It\r\nmight get into the public mind that what had happened in Paris was\r\nlikely to happen in London, and the effect on Europe might be most\r\ndamaging to the credit of the country.  So the banquet was put off; the\r\nsovereign and his Prime Minister did not visit the City.  A vague panic\r\nraged everywhere, {113} and the Funds went alarmingly down.  The story\r\nwhich had impressed the Lord Mayor-elect was in all likelihood only a\r\nmere scare.  But it had, no doubt, some effect in deciding the action\r\nof the Ministry.  At all events, the Duke of Wellington and his\r\ncolleagues determined to try what strength the reformers had behind\r\nthem.  They tendered their resignation; the King was prevailed upon to\r\naccept it, and it was announced to Parliament and the public that the\r\nDuke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel were no longer in office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{114}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXX.\r\n\r\nLE ROI D'YVETOT.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1830-37--Eccentricities of William the Fourth]\r\n\r\nWe may turn for a moment from the path of politics to mention a fact\r\nthat is worth mentioning, if only because of the immense difference\r\nbetween the accepted usages of that time and any usages that would be\r\npossible in our days.  King William shortly after his accession created\r\nhis eldest son Earl of Munster, and conferred upon all his other sons\r\nand daughters the rank that belongs to the younger children of a\r\nmarquis.  The King's living children, as has been said before, were all\r\nillegitimate.  In raising them to the rank of the peerage King William\r\nwas only following the example of many or most of his predecessors.\r\nPeople thought none the less of him, at the time, because he had\r\nbestowed such honor upon his progeny.  Charles Greville, the famous\r\nClerk of the Council to George the Fourth and William the Fourth,\r\ndescribes the new sovereign with characteristic frankness and lack of\r\nreverence.  \"Altogether,\" says Greville, writing about a fortnight\r\nafter the King's accession, \"he seems a kind-hearted, well-meaning, not\r\nstupid, burlesque, bustling old fellow, and if he doesn't go mad may\r\nmake a very decent king, but he exhibits oddities.\"\r\n\r\nThe early bringing-up of the new King had certainly not tended much to\r\nfill him with the highest aspirations or to qualify him for the most\r\ndignified duties of royalty.  \"Never,\" says Greville, \"was elevation\r\nlike that of King William the Fourth.  His life has hitherto been\r\npassed in obscurity and neglect, in miserable poverty, surrounded by a\r\nnumerous progeny of bastards, without consideration or friends, and he\r\nwas ridiculous from his grotesque ways and little, meddling curiosity.\"\r\n\r\n{115}\r\n\r\nHe appears to have been a man of rather kindly, and certainly not\r\nungenerous, disposition, and it is decidedly to his credit, in one\r\nsense, that the expectations of most of the Whigs were disappointed\r\nwhen he came to the throne.  During his career in the Navy he had a way\r\nof disregarding orders, and when in command of a squadron would\r\nsometimes take his own vessel on an expedition according to his own\r\nfancy, and leave the remainder of the vessels under his charge to do as\r\nwell as they could without him until it pleased him to return.  Some of\r\nhis later exploits in this way drew down on him a marked expression of\r\ndisapproval from the Duke of Wellington, then at the head of the\r\nGovernment, and for this reason it was thought by many, when William\r\ncame to the throne, that he would be sure to dismiss from his service\r\nthe Prime Minister who once had offended him so deeply.  A man with a\r\nmore malevolent turn of mind would very likely have acted as public\r\nexpectation seemed to foreshadow, but William, as we have seen, soon\r\nmade it clear that he had no fault to find with the Duke of Wellington,\r\nthat he cherished no ill-will and was quite ready to let bygones be\r\nbygones.  There can be no doubt that William, although he had no great\r\ndefects of any deep or serious nature, no defects at least which are\r\nnot common enough among the sovereigns of his time, was yet as\r\nundignified a figure for a throne as even the modern comic opera itself\r\ncould imagine.\r\n\r\nHe was eccentric to a degree that sometimes seemed to suggest a lurking\r\ntendency to insanity.  He was fussy, garrulous, excitable, noisy,\r\noverbearing, apt to take strong likes and dislikes and to express his\r\nlikings and his dislikings with an utter disregard for the accepted\r\nconventionalities of social life.\r\n\r\nHe could explode at a moment's notice into a burst of rage which\r\nsometimes made itself felt for hours, and perhaps when the next day\r\ncame he had forgotten all about it and greeted those who were its\r\nespecial objects with hilarious good-humor.  There were many anecdotes\r\ntold about him in the days not long before his accession to the throne\r\nwhich were commonly believed by those who knew him, {116} and which it\r\nwould not be possible to reproduce in the modest pages suitable to our\r\nown times.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1830-37--Some strange doings of the King]\r\n\r\nNow it would certainly be most unfair to accept every story told by\r\ngossip about some exalted personage as a story worthy of credit and\r\nqualified to take its place in authentic history, but, at the same\r\ntime, it is quite fair and reasonable when forming an estimate of the\r\nexalted personage's character to take some account of the sayings of\r\ncontemporary gossip.  We may be sure that there were stories told about\r\nthe father of Frederick the Great, about Catherine of Russia, about a\r\nlate King of Bavaria, which were not true, but none the less the\r\nhistorian is undoubtedly helped to form an estimate of the ways and\r\ndoings of these exalted personages by the collective testimony of the\r\nstories that are told about them and believed in their own time.\r\nWilliam the Fourth could not, when he ascended the throne, suddenly\r\nshake off all the rough manners and odd ways which he had allowed\r\nhimself to foster during his long career as a Prince of the Blood\r\nRoyal, as a sailor, and as a man much given to the full indulgence of\r\nhis humors, whatever they might happen to be.\r\n\r\nAfter he had become King, and it was part of his royal duty to give\r\ngreat State dinners, it was sometimes his way to behave himself on the\r\noccasions of those festivities after a fashion which even W. S. Gilbert\r\nnever could have caricatured in any \"Mikado\" or other such piece of\r\ndelightful burlesque.  The King was fond of making speeches at his\r\nState dinners, and it was his way to ramble along on all manner of\r\nsubjects in the same oration.  Whatever idea happened to come uppermost\r\nin his mind he usually blurted out, without the slightest regard for\r\ntime, place, or company.  This habit of his became very embarrassing\r\nnow and then when some of the ambassadors of great European States\r\nhappened to be guests at his dinner-table.  In the presence of the\r\nFrench Ambassador, for instance, the King, while delivering his\r\nafter-dinner speech, would suddenly recall some of his recollections of\r\nthe days when the great Napoleon held the Imperial throne of France,\r\nand he would then, perhaps, close a sentence {117} with an exultant\r\nreference to the glorious triumphs we had obtained over our enemies the\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion when Leopold, King of the Belgians, was dining with him\r\nthe King suddenly observed that his royal guest was drinking water, and\r\nhe called to him with an oath and demanded what he was drinking that\r\nsort of stuff for; and not content with the poor King's plea that he\r\ndrank water because he liked it better than wine, William insisted\r\nthat, in his house at least, his royal brother must swallow the juice\r\nof the grape.  One day when Talleyrand was among his guests King\r\nWilliam favored the company with a very peculiar sort of speech, and he\r\nconcluded the speech by proposing a toast which is described by those\r\nwho heard it as utterly unsuited for publication.  One of the guests\r\nwas Charles Greville.  He was anxious to know what impression this\r\nextraordinary performance had made upon Talleyrand.  He asked\r\nTalleyrand in a whisper if he had ever heard anything like that before.\r\nBut Talleyrand, who had listened to the oration and the toast with\r\nunmoved composure, was not to be thrown off his balance or drawn into\r\nany expression of opinion by an indiscreet question.  He merely\r\nanswered that it was certainly \"bien remarquable.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duchess of Kent and the young Princess Victoria were dining with\r\nthe King one day, and some of the guests, although not all, were well\r\naware that there had been differences of opinion lately between William\r\nand his sister-in-law.  The guests, however, were amazed indeed when\r\nthe King rose and delivered a speech in which he raked up all his old\r\ngrievances against the Duchess of Kent, and complained of her and\r\ndenounced her as if he were the barrister, the hero of the old familiar\r\nstory, who, having no case, is advised to abuse the plaintiff's\r\nattorney.  The child Princess Victoria is said to have been so\r\ndistressed by some parts of this unexpected oration that she burst into\r\ntears; but the Duchess, her mother, retained self-control, and sat as\r\ncomposedly silent as if the King had been taking his part in some\r\ndignified State ceremonial.\r\n\r\n{118}\r\n\r\nKing William sometimes broke the conventionalities of royal deportment\r\nin a quite different sort of way, in a way which undoubtedly shocked\r\nthe traditional sensibilities of the older officials of the Court, but\r\nwith which the lovers of modern and more simple manners are inclined\r\nsometimes, perhaps, to have a sort of wilful sympathy.  He would\r\nsometimes insist on dropping some great royal visitor from abroad at\r\nthe door of his hotel, just as if he were an ordinary London resident\r\ngiving a lift in his carriage to a friend from the country.  At the\r\nmost solemn State ceremonial he would bustle about irresponsibly, and\r\ntalk in a loud voice to any one who might seem to him at the moment to\r\nbe an attractive person with whom to have a pleasant chat.  It might\r\nhappen that some great State functionary or some dignified ambassador\r\nfrom a foreign capital, who ought to have been spoken to long before,\r\nwas kept waiting until the unconcerned sovereign had had his talk out\r\nwith some comparatively insignificant personage who had been known to\r\nthe King in former days, and whose appearance brought with it certain\r\nearly and jovial associations.  Many of the King's minor offences in\r\nthis way seem now to the unconcerned reader about as venial as that by\r\nwhich Marie Antoinette in her early Court days broke through the\r\nestablished rules of etiquette among the ladies of her bedchamber by\r\nsnatching her chemise one morning with her own hands instead of\r\nallowing it to pass in its regular order from the lowest to the highest\r\ndegree of the attendant women.  But it certainly was perhaps a little\r\ntoo much of a departure from the usages of a Court when the monarch,\r\nabout to sign an important document in the presence of his State\r\nCouncil, flung down the quill with which he had begun to write and\r\nproclaimed it to be a damned bad pen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1830-37--Béranger's King of Yvetot]\r\n\r\nEvery day the King was sure to astonish those around him by some breach\r\nof Court conventionality, little or great.  He was liable to strong\r\nlikings and dislikings, and he took no pains to conceal his sentiments\r\nin either case.  He seems to have had an affectionate regard for his\r\nyoung niece, the Princess Victoria, and a strong dislike to her {119}\r\nmother.  The Duchess of Kent would appear to have had no particular\r\nliking for him, and she very much objected to be brought into familiar\r\nassociation with the sons and daughters of the eccentric sovereign.\r\nPerhaps it is not to William's discredit that he always treated these\r\nchildren as if they were his legitimate descendants.  It was no fault\r\nof theirs if the ceremony of marriage had not preceded their coming\r\ninto the world, and the King apparently did not see why even the most\r\nrighteous person should feel any objection to their frequent presence.\r\nBut one can understand that the Duchess of Kent must have often wished\r\nthat the sense of public decorum, which was even already growing up in\r\nEnglish society, should not be shocked by the too frequent reminder\r\nthat the King had several children who were not born in wedlock.\r\nBéranger, the once popular French lyric poet, satirized a certain royal\r\npersonage, a contemporary of William the Fourth, as the King of Yvetot.\r\nThere was a French legend which told of the conditions under which the\r\ndescendants of a certain lord of the manor in Brittany had been created\r\nby Clotaire kings of Yvetot.  Béranger's monarch is described by him as\r\none having made little mark of his own in history, who could live very\r\ncomfortably without troubling himself about glory, and who liked to be\r\ncrowned with a simple cotton nightcap.  This monarch, the poet tells\r\nus, could enjoy his four meals a day, and liked very often to lift his\r\nglass to his lips.\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons, we are told, why some of his subjects might\r\nhave called him a father to his people, but the name was not applied by\r\nthe poet in the ordinary metaphorical sense of the word.  He never\r\ndesired to trouble his neighbors, and never disturbed his mind with any\r\nprojects for the increase of his dominions, and, like a true model to\r\nall potentates, found his ambition quite satisfied in the indulgence of\r\nhis own pleasures while desiring as little as possible to interfere\r\nwith the pastimes of his people.  Every verse of the ballad ends by\r\ntelling us what a good little king was this sovereign of Yvetot.  With\r\ncertain slight alterations Béranger's satirical verses might {120} have\r\nserved as a picture of William the Fourth.  But our good little King of\r\nYvetot was not destined altogether to have quite an easy time of it,\r\nalthough he was more successful in that way than the monarch for whom\r\nBéranger intended his satire.  William had come in for the age of\r\nreform.  The whole course of English history hardly tells us of any\r\nreign, of anything like equal length, into which so many reforms were\r\ncrowded.  William the Fourth, we may be sure, would never have troubled\r\nhimself or any of his subjects about any projects of improvement in the\r\npolitical or social conditions of his realm.  He would have been quite\r\ncontent to let things go on just as they had been going in the days\r\nbefore he came to the throne, and would probably have asked no higher\r\ntitle of affection from the loyalty of his subjects than the familiar\r\nname that they gave him of the Sailor King.  When for a while he began\r\nto be called the Patriot King he must have associated the title with a\r\nsense of all the worry and trouble brought upon him by the incessant\r\npreparation of patriotic projects for the improvement of everything all\r\nover the country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1830-37--Lord Grey and William the Fourth]\r\n\r\nIt seems like a curious freak of fate that such a sovereign, at such a\r\ntime, should have had to get rid of the Duke of Wellington and accept\r\nLord Grey as his Prime Minister.  The Duke of Wellington was himself\r\nsimple, plain, and occasionally rough in manners, with little taste for\r\nCourt ceremonial and little inclination for the exchange of stately\r\nphrase and inflated language.  There are many anecdotes told of\r\nWellington which show that he had no more liking or aptitude for the\r\nways dear to a Court functionary than King William himself had.  Lord\r\nGrey was a man of the most stately bearing and the most refined style.\r\nHis manner was courtly without the slightest affectation; he was\r\ncourtly by nature, and dignity was an element of his every-day\r\ndemeanor.  He had been in constant companionship with some of the\r\ngreatest statesmen and orators of his time, but even his devotion to\r\nCharles James Fox had never beguiled him into any of Fox's careless,\r\nfree-and-easy ways.  He was sorely tried, as all {121} contemporary\r\naccounts tell us, by the abrupt and overbearing manners of his\r\nson-in-law, Lord Durham, but he always contrived, in public at least,\r\nto bear Durham's eccentricities with unruffled temper and undisturbed\r\ndignity.  Such a statesman must have had a hard time of it with King\r\nWilliam of Yvetot; but let it be freely admitted that King William of\r\nYvetot must have had a hard time of it with such a minister as Lord\r\nGrey.  William would probably, if left to his own inclinations, have\r\nmade up his mind to hold on to the Duke of Wellington, join with the\r\nDuke in opposing all schemes of reform, and face the music, if we may\r\nadopt a familiar modern phrase.  But there was good sense enough in\r\nWilliam's head, for all his odd ways and his unkingly humors, to teach\r\nhim that he had better not begin his reign by setting himself against\r\nthe public opinion of the great majority of his subjects, and therefore\r\nour good King of Yvetot consented to become, if not the head, at least\r\nthe figure-head of a great historical movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{122}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXI.\r\n\r\nREFORM.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1830--Brougham and the ministry]\r\n\r\nThe King had no other course left open to him than to send for Lord\r\nGrey and invite him to form an Administration.  Lord Grey was quite\r\nready for the task, and must, for some time back, have had his mind\r\nconstantly occupied with plans for such an arrangement.  About some of\r\nthe appointments there was no difficulty whatever.  It was obvious that\r\nLord Melbourne, Lord Althorp, and Lord John Russell would be invited to\r\ntake office, but there was a certain difficulty about Brougham.  The\r\ndifficulty, however, was not about offering a place to Brougham; the\r\nonly trouble was to find the place which would suit him, and his\r\nacceptance of which would also suit his leaders and his colleagues.\r\nNothing could be more certain than the fact that Brougham must be\r\ninvited to a place in the new Administration.  He was a strong man with\r\nthe country, and he now had a distinct following of his own.\r\n\r\nAmong the yet unenfranchised districts, especially in the North of\r\nEngland, Brougham probably counted for more, so far as the question of\r\nreform was concerned, than all the other reformers in Parliament put\r\ntogether.  It would be idle to think of creating a Reform Ministry just\r\nthen without Henry Brougham.  The new Administration could not possibly\r\nget on without him.  But then it was by no means certain that the new\r\nAdministration could get on with him, and no one could understand this\r\ndifficulty better than the stately and aristocratic Lord Grey.  Grey\r\nhad simply to choose between encountering an uncertainty or undertaking\r\nan impossibility, and of course he chose the former alternative.  He\r\nhad to invite Brougham to take office, but the question was what office\r\nit was {123} most advisable to ask him to take.  Brougham was offered\r\nthe position of Attorney-General, the acceptance of which allows a man\r\nto retain his seat in the House of Commons, while it puts him directly\r\non the way to a high promotion to the judicial bench.  Brougham flatly\r\ndeclined the offer, and seemed to be somewhat offended that it should\r\nhave been made to him.  Then Lord Grey thought of offering him the\r\ndignified position of Master of the Rolls, coupled with the exceptional\r\narrangement that he was still to retain his seat in the House of\r\nCommons.  Lord Grey was naturally very anxious to conciliate Brougham,\r\nand looked with much dread to the prospect of Brougham breaking off\r\nfrom the negotiations altogether and retaining his seat in the House as\r\nan independent critic of the Ministry.  Nothing could well be more\r\nalarming to the head of the new Administration than the thought of\r\nBrougham thus sitting as an independent critic, prepared at any minute\r\nto come down with the force and fury of his eloquence on this or that\r\nsection of the new Reform Bill, and to denounce it to the country as\r\nutterly inadequate to satisfy the just demands of the people.  The\r\nKing, however, suggested, with some good sense, that Brougham as a\r\ndissatisfied Master of the Rolls still sitting in the House of Commons\r\nmight prove an inconvenient and dangerous colleague.\r\n\r\nLord Grey thought the matter over once more, and began to see another\r\nway of getting out of the difficulty.  Why not give to Brougham the\r\nhighest legal appointment in the service of the Crown, and thus promote\r\nhim completely out of the House of Commons?  Why not make him Lord\r\nChancellor at once?  This offer could not but satisfy even Brougham's\r\nwell-known self-conceit, and it would transplant his eloquence to the\r\nquieter atmosphere of the House of Lords, where little harm could be\r\ndone to the surrounding vegetation by its too luxuriant growth.  In\r\nplain words, it might be taken for granted that the House of Lords\r\nwould reject any reform measure, however moderate, when it was first\r\nintroduced to the notice of the peers, and therefore no particular harm\r\ncould come from Brougham's presence in the hereditary assembly.  But\r\n{124} Brougham in the House of Commons might, at any time, be so far\r\ncarried away by his own emotions, and his own eloquence, and his own\r\nmasterful temperament as to bring his colleagues into many a\r\ndifficulty, and force on them the unpleasant alternative of having to\r\nchoose between going further than they had intended to go or failing to\r\nkeep up with Brougham as the accredited and popular promoter of reform.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1830--Brougham as Lord Chancellor]\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Grey next conferred with the King he was not a little\r\nsurprised to hear from the sovereign's own lips a suggestion that\r\nBrougham might be offered the position of Lord Chancellor.  Grey told\r\nthe King that he had been almost afraid to start such a proposition,\r\ninasmuch as William had discouraged the idea of making Brougham Master\r\nof the Rolls; but the King with shrewd good sense directed Grey's\r\nattention to the fact, which had been already an operative force in\r\nGrey's own mind, that to make Brougham Master of the Rolls, and yet\r\nkeep him in the House of Commons, might still leave him a very\r\ndangerous colleague, while by making him Lord Chancellor the King and\r\nhis Prime Minister could get him practically out of the way altogether.\r\n\r\nSo it was agreed between the King and his Prime Minister that Lord\r\nBrougham should be made Lord Chancellor, and thus forfeit his right to\r\nsit in the House of Commons.  If we speak with literal accuracy it is\r\nnot quite correct to say that a man by becoming Lord Chancellor becomes\r\nnecessarily, and at once, a member of the House of Lords.  The Lord\r\nChancellor of course presides over the sittings of the House of Lords,\r\nbut he is not necessarily, from the first, a member of the hereditary\r\nassembly.  He sits on the woolsack, which, though actually in the House\r\nof Lords, is not technically to be described as occupying such a\r\nposition.  If a Lord Chancellor who is actually a peer desires to take\r\npart in a debate he has to leave the woolsack and stand on some part of\r\nthe floor which is technically within the Chamber.  On more than one\r\nhistoric occasion some inconvenience has arisen from the fact that a\r\nnewly created Lord Chancellor had not yet been {125} made a peer, and\r\ntherefore was not entitled to take part in a debate, or even to speak\r\nfor some ceremonial purpose within the Chamber on behalf of the House\r\nof Lords.  Brougham as a matter of fact was not made a peer until a\r\nlittle time after he had become Lord Chancellor.\r\n\r\nAll this, however, is only mentioned here as a matter of curious and\r\ntechnical interest to the reader of Parliamentary history.  Brougham\r\nwas made a peer soon enough for all purposes, and in the mean time he\r\nwas removed altogether from the House of Commons.  Brougham did not\r\naccept his new position without some grumbling.  Probably he had the\r\nidea that Lord Grey and others of his colleagues were glad to have him\r\nsafely provided for out of the range of the representative assembly,\r\nwhere his eloquence might now and then become an inconvenient\r\ninfluence.  He accepted the position, however, and became a member of\r\nthe House of Lords.  From that time his real influence over the country\r\nmay be said to have come to an end.  After he ceased to be Lord\r\nChancellor he remained simply an eloquent, overbearing member of the\r\nHouse of Lords, often delighting the galleries and the public with his\r\nmeteoric flashes of eloquence; but his power as a reformer was gone,\r\nand for the greater part of his remaining career, when one or two\r\nimportant questions to which he was pledged had been disposed of, he\r\ntook little interest in any movement of reform.\r\n\r\nLord Althorp became Chancellor of the Exchequer.  Lord Althorp, who was\r\nleader of the House of Commons as well as Chancellor of the Exchequer,\r\nwas an influential person in those days, but is almost forgotten in our\r\ntime.  He was a model country gentleman, devoted to the duties and the\r\ndelights of such a position; had a natural gift for farming and no\r\nnatural inclination whatever for politics.  Not merely did he make no\r\npretensions to oratory, but, even for a country gentleman, he could not\r\nbe regarded as a particularly good speaker.  Yet he undoubtedly was a\r\nman of much weight in the Parliamentary life of his time.  He was\r\nthoroughly straightforward and disinterested; he was absolutely\r\ntruthful and honorable; his word was his bond, {126} and the House of\r\nCommons and the country in general could always feel sure that any\r\nadvice given by Lord Althorp was guided by the light of his own\r\njudgment and his own conscience, and that he was never unduly swayed by\r\nfear, favor, or affection, whether towards sovereign or party.  Lord\r\nMelbourne was Home Secretary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1830--The Reform Administration]\r\n\r\nIf we glance down the list of this Reform Administration to-day we\r\nshall all probably be struck by the fact that the men who were regarded\r\nas juniors and something like beginners have come to occupy, in many\r\ncases, a higher position in political history than their elders and\r\nleaders.  Lord John Russell, for instance, was not a member of Lord\r\nGrey's Cabinet; he only held the office of Paymaster of the Forces.\r\nFrom his first entrance into the House of Commons Lord John Russell had\r\ndistinguished himself as a reformer.  In 1819 he had brought forward a\r\nmotion for a reform in the Parliamentary system, and he had renewed the\r\nmotion in almost every succeeding year.  He had been a steady supporter\r\nof the movement for the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, which\r\nimposed an unjust and utterly irrational disqualification on\r\nDissenters, and had been a zealous advocate of the measures for the\r\nemancipation of Roman Catholics.  All his early life had been a\r\ntraining for statesmanship.  He had been associated with scholars and\r\nthinkers, with poets and historians.  He had gone through Spain while\r\nthe war with Napoleon was still going on, and had been welcomed by the\r\nDuke of Wellington in his camp.  He had visited Napoleon at Elba, and\r\nhad talked over politics and war with the fallen Emperor.  As Disraeli\r\nsaid of him many years later, he had sat at the feet of Fox and had\r\nmeasured swords with Canning.  Lord Palmerston became for the first\r\ntime Foreign Secretary in the Grey Administration.  He had been a\r\njunior Lord of the Admiralty in a former Government, and he had more\r\nlately been Secretary at War; but at the time that he first became\r\nForeign Secretary under Lord Grey few indeed could have anticipated\r\nthat he was destined to become one of the most powerful English\r\nstatesmen known to the century.  Sir James Graham became First Lord of\r\nthe Admiralty, and {127} some of us can still remember him as one of\r\nthe foremost debaters in the House of Commons.  Lord Durham, Grey's\r\nson-in-law, accepted what may almost be called the nominal office of\r\nLord Privy Seal.\r\n\r\nAt that time Durham was regarded as a brilliant, eccentric sort of man,\r\na perfervid reformer on whose perseverance or consistency no one could\r\nreckon for a moment--perhaps the comet of a season, but if so then\r\nsurely a comet of a season only.  We now recognize Durham as the man of\r\nstatesmanlike foresight and genius who converted, at a great crisis, a\r\nCanada burning with internal hatred between race and sect, and the one\r\ncommon hatred of Imperial rule, into the Canada which we now know as\r\none of the most peaceful, prosperous, and loyal parts of the British\r\nEmpire.  Mr. Stanley, afterwards Lord Derby, the famous \"Rupert of\r\ndebate,\" became Chief Secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland.\r\nGrey appointed Lord Plunket Lord Chancellor for Ireland, and the name\r\nof Lord Plunket will always be remembered as that of one of the\r\ngreatest Parliamentary orators known to modern times.\r\n\r\nThe new Ministry was, therefore, well prepared to carry on the battle\r\nof reform.  Lord Grey had made up his mind that Lord John Russell,\r\nalthough not in the Cabinet, was the most fitting member of the\r\nAdministration to conduct the Reform Bill through the House of Commons.\r\nAs soon as Grey had completed his arrangements for the construction of\r\na Ministry, Lord Durham put himself into communication with Lord John\r\nRussell.  Durham told Lord John Russell that Lord Grey wished him to\r\nconsult with Russell as to the formation of a small private committee\r\nwhose task should be to create and put into shape some definite scheme\r\nas the foundation of the great constitutional change which the new\r\nGovernment had been called into power to establish.  Lord John Russell\r\nof course accepted the suggestion, and after some consideration it was\r\nagreed by Lord Durham and himself that Sir James Graham and Lord\r\nDuncannon, then Commissioner of Woods and Forests, should be invited to\r\njoin them, and make a committee of four for the purpose of devising a\r\n{128} comprehensive and practicable measure of reform.  Durham then\r\nasked Lord John to put on paper at once his own idea with regard to the\r\noutlines of such a plan, so that it might be taken into consideration\r\nby the committee at their earliest meeting.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1830--The Reform Bill]\r\n\r\nLord John Russell's book, \"The English Government and Constitution,\"\r\ntells us all what was the central idea in his mind when he set himself\r\nto construct the groundwork of a Reform Bill.  He tells us, alluding to\r\nthe task assigned to him, \"It was not my duty to cut the body of our\r\nold parent into pieces, and to throw it into a Medea's caldron, with\r\nthe hope of reviving the vigor of youth.\"  He thought it his duty not\r\nto turn aside \"from the track of the Constitution into the maze of\r\nfancy or the wilderness of abstract rights.\"  \"It was desirable, in\r\nshort, as it appeared to me, while sweeping away gross abuses, to avail\r\nourselves, as far as possible, of the existing frame and body of our\r\nConstitution.  Thus, if the due weight and influence of property could\r\nbe maintained, by preserving the representation of a proportion of the\r\nsmall boroughs with an improved franchise, it was desirable rather to\r\nbuild on the old foundations than to indulge our fancy or our conceit\r\nin choosing a new site and erecting on new soil--perhaps on sand--an\r\nedifice entirely different from all that had hitherto existed.\"\r\n\r\nNo Reformer who understood the general character of the English people,\r\nand who had studied the development of political growth in England,\r\ncould have gone more prudently and wisely about the work of bringing\r\nthe existing Constitution into harmony with the altering conditions,\r\nand removing out of its way all difficulties that might interfere with\r\nits gradual and safe development in the future.  But Russell was\r\nclearly of opinion, and in this he was entirely in accordance with Lord\r\nGrey, that nothing but a large and comprehensive measure would be of\r\nany real use, and that \"to nibble at disfranchisement and cramp reform\r\nby pedantic adherence to existing rights would be to deceive\r\nexpectation, to whet appetite, and to bring about that revolution which\r\nit was our object to {129} avert.\"  Russell drew up a sketch of his\r\nproposed Reform Bill, which he submitted to Lord Durham, and on the\r\ndraft of the measure thus submitted to him Lord Durham offered some\r\nsuggestions and alterations of his own.  Russell's speech was written\r\non a single piece of letter-paper, and is reproduced with Lord Durham's\r\nnotes in Russell's book, \"The English Government and Constitution.\"\r\nThe opening paragraph proposes that \"the fifty boroughs having the\r\nsmallest population according to the latest census should be\r\ndisfranchised altogether.\"  This proposal had Lord Durham's full\r\napproval, and he noted the fact that according to his calculation it\r\nwould disfranchise all boroughs having a population of not more than\r\n1400.  The second paragraph proposed that fifty other boroughs of the\r\nleast considerable population, above the line already drawn, should be\r\nallowed to send only one member each to the House of Commons.  This\r\nproposal also had the approval of Lord Durham, and he notes it would\r\napply to boroughs not having more than 3000 inhabitants each.\r\n\r\nThen came a paragraph which proposed that all persons qualified to\r\nserve on juries should have the right of voting, and to this clause\r\nLord Durham objected, regarding it probably as an embodiment of the\r\nprinciple of what were called in later days \"fancy franchises.\"  The\r\nfourth paragraph recommended that no person should be entitled to vote\r\nin cities or boroughs, except in the City of London, in Westminster,\r\nand in Southwark, unless he were a householder rated at ten pounds a\r\nyear, and unless, moreover, he had paid his parochial taxes for three\r\nyears, within three months after they became due, and had lived in the\r\nconstituency for six months previous to the election at which he\r\nclaimed to vote.  The fifth clause proposed that the unrepresented\r\nparts of London should have among them four or six additional members,\r\nthat eighteen large towns should have representation--and let the\r\nreader try to realize for himself what the supposed representation of\r\nthe country could have been when at least eighteen large towns were, up\r\nto that time, wholly unrepresented--and that twenty counties should\r\nsend two additional members {130} each to the House of Commons.\r\nAnother paragraph limited the right of voting in the newly enfranchised\r\ntowns to householders rated at ten pounds a year or persons qualified\r\nto serve on juries.  Lord Durham approved of the rating qualification,\r\nbut, consistently with his objection already mentioned, struck out the\r\nwords which connected the right to vote with the right to serve on a\r\njury.  It is not necessary to go through the whole list of the\r\nproposals set out in the sketch drawn up by Lord John Russell.  Those\r\nwhich we have already mentioned possess a peculiar historical interest\r\nand illustrate in the most precise and effective manner the whole\r\nnature of the system which, up to that time, had passed off as\r\nconstitutional government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1831--Vote by ballot]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that, on the whole, Lord Durham was a more advanced\r\nreformer than even Lord John Russell.  The entire scheme, as drawn out\r\nby Russell, consisted of ten paragraphs or clauses, and it was at once\r\nsubmitted to the consideration of the four men who formed the\r\ncommittee.  There was much discussion as to the borough qualification\r\nfor voters, and the committee finally agreed to recommend that it\r\nshould be uniform, and thus get rid of what were called the freemen and\r\nthe scot-and-lot voters, a class of persons endowed with antiquated and\r\neccentric qualifications which possibly might have had some meaning in\r\nthem and some justification under the conditions of a much earlier day,\r\nbut which had since grown into a system enabling wealthier men to\r\ncreate in constituencies a body of thoroughly dependent or positively\r\ncorrupt voters.  The desire of the committee was to extend the voting\r\nprivilege as far as possible consistently with due regard for the\r\nprinciple that the voters ought to be men of substance enough to insure\r\ntheir independence.  This security they believed they could attain by\r\nestablishing the ten-pound franchise.  This seems, no doubt, to modern\r\neyes a somewhat eccentric and haphazard line of demarkation; but it\r\nmust be remembered that even until much later days the ten pounds\r\nrating principle in boroughs held its own, and was believed to be\r\nabsolutely essential to the {131} maintenance of an independent and\r\nupright body of voters, and to the securing of such a body against the\r\ndanger of being \"swamped,\" according to the once familiar word, by the\r\nvotes of the dependent and the corrupt.\r\n\r\nThere were some slight differences of opinion between Lord John Russell\r\nand Lord Durham as to the extent to which the total or partial\r\ndisfranchisement of the small boroughs ought to go, but the scheme, as\r\nfinally shaped, had on the whole the thorough approval of the\r\ncommittee.  One important proposal, brought forward, it was understood,\r\nby Lord Durham, was agreed to and formally adopted by the committee,\r\nbut not without strong opposition on the part of Lord John Russell.\r\nThis was the proposal for the introduction of the vote by ballot.  When\r\nLord Grey's Cabinet came to consider the draft scheme the proposal for\r\nthe introduction of the vote by ballot was struck out altogether.  The\r\ntime, in fact, had not come for the adoption of so great a reform.\r\nForty years had to pass before the mind of the English public could be\r\nbrought to recognize the necessity for such a change.  Statesmanship\r\nhad still to learn how much the value of a popular suffrage was\r\ndiminished or disparaged by the system which left the voter at the\r\nabsolute mercy of some landlord or some patron who desired that the\r\nvote should be given for the candidate whom he favored.  The ballot\r\neven then was demanded by the whole body of the Chartists.  Orator\r\nHunt, one of the most popular heroes of the Chartist agitation, had\r\nonly just defeated Mr. Stanley at Preston.  Daniel O'Connell was in\r\nfavor of the ballot, because he saw that without its protection the\r\nIrish tenant farmer would have to vote for his landlord's candidate or\r\nwould be turned out of his farm.  But the general feeling among\r\nstatesmen, as well as among the outer public, was that there was\r\nsomething un-English about the ballot system, and it was contended that\r\nthe true Englishman ought to have the courage of his opinion and to\r\nvote as his conscience told him, without caring whom he offended.\r\nEdmund Burke in one of his speeches tells us that the system which is\r\nfounded on the heroic virtues is sure to have its {132} superstructure\r\nin failure and disappointment, meaning thereby that every system is\r\ndoomed to failure which assumes as its principle the idea that all men\r\ncan at all times be up to the level of the heroic mood.  Some of us can\r\nwell remember the days when English statesmen still declared that the\r\ncompulsion of education was un-English, and that it ought to be left to\r\nthe free choice of the English parent whether he would have his\r\nchildren taught or leave them untaught.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1831--Lord John Russell and the Reform Bill]\r\n\r\nLord Grey's Cabinet would have nothing to do with the ballot.  With\r\nthis exception the draft scheme as submitted by Lord John Russell was\r\naccepted by Lord Grey and his colleagues.  Then it was laid before the\r\nKing, and the King, according to Lord John Russell, gave it his ready\r\nand cheerful sanction.  There were indeed some observers at the time\r\nwho believed that the King had cheerfully sanctioned the whole scheme\r\nof reform as proposed, because he still confidently believed that\r\nnothing but the wreck of the Ministry was to come of it.  However that\r\nmay have been, it is certain that the King did give his full sanction\r\nto the measure, and the Government prepared to introduce the first\r\nReform Bill.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that the conduct of the Bill in the House of Commons\r\nshould be placed in the hands of Lord John Russell.  This arrangement\r\ncreated, when the Bill was actually brought forward, a good deal of\r\nadverse criticism in the House and in the country.  Some prominent\r\nmembers of the Opposition in the House of Commons persuaded themselves,\r\nand tried to persuade their listeners, that Lord Grey's Cabinet, by\r\nadopting such an arrangement, showed that there was no sincerity in the\r\nprofessed desire for reform.  If the members of the Cabinet, it was\r\nargued, are such believers in the virtue of reform, why do they not\r\nselect one of their own body to introduce the measure?  Lord John\r\nRussell was only Paymaster of the Forces, and had not a seat in the\r\nCabinet, and if he was taken out of his place and put into the most\r\nprominent position it could only be because no member of the Cabinet\r\ncould be found who was willing to undertake the task.  {133} The answer\r\nwas very clear, even at the time, and it is obvious indeed to the\r\ngenerations that had an opportunity of knowing how eminently Lord John\r\nRussell was qualified for the work which had been entrusted to his\r\nhands.  He was a member of one of the greatest aristocratic families in\r\nthe land, and one of the practical dangers threatening the Reform Bill\r\nwas the alarm that might spread among the wealthier classes at the\r\nthought of a wild democratic movement upsetting the whole principle of\r\naristocratic predominance in the English constitutional system.  Still\r\nmore important was the fact that Lord John Russell, who had\r\ndistinguished himself already as the most devoted promoter of\r\nconstitutional reform, was a man peculiarly qualified by intellect and\r\nby his skill in exposition to pilot such a measure through the House of\r\nCommons.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell had not yet won reputation as a great Parliamentary\r\norator; nor did he, during the whole of his long career, succeed in\r\nacquiring such a fame.  But he was a master of the art which consists\r\nin making a perfectly clear statement of the most complicated case, and\r\nin defending his measure point by point with never-failing readiness\r\nand skill throughout the most perplexing series of debates.  It was\r\npointed out also, at the time, that if Lord John Russell was selected\r\nto introduce the Reform Bill, although he was only Paymaster of the\r\nForces and had not a seat in the Cabinet, thus too had Edmund Burke\r\nbeen selected to introduce the East India Bill, although he, like Lord\r\nJohn Russell, was only Paymaster of the Forces and had not a seat in\r\nthe Cabinet.  Indeed, to us, who now look back on the events from a\r\nlong distance of time, the impression would rather be that Lord Grey\r\nhad little or no choice in the matter.  He was not himself a member of\r\nthe House of Commons, and therefore could not introduce the Bill there.\r\nBrougham had ceased to be a member of the House of Commons, and was\r\ntherefore out of the question.  Lord Althorp, who had not yet succeeded\r\nto the peerage, and had a seat in the representative chamber, was, as\r\nwe have already said, the poorest of {134} speakers, and utterly\r\nunsuited for the difficult task of steering so important a measure\r\nthrough the troublous sea of Parliamentary debate.  Lord Grey, of\r\ncourse, was thoroughly well acquainted with Russell's great abilities\r\nand his peculiar fitness for the task assigned to him, and could, under\r\nno circumstances, have made a better choice.  But our only possible\r\ndifficulty now would be to say what other choice, under the existing\r\nconditions, he could possibly have made.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1831--Need for secrecy about the Reform Bill]\r\n\r\nTuesday, March 1, 1831, was the day fixed for the introduction of the\r\nReform Bill in the House of Commons.  In the mean time, as we learn\r\nfrom all who can be considered authorities on the subject, the nature\r\nand the plan of the proposed reforms were kept a profound secret, not\r\nonly from the public at large, but even from members of the House of\r\nCommons itself, with the exception of those who belonged to the\r\nAdministration.  Ministerial secrets, it is only fair to say, are\r\ngenerally well kept in England, but instances have undoubtedly occurred\r\nin which the nature of some approaching measure, which ought to have\r\nbeen held in the profoundest secrecy until the time came for its\r\nofficial revelation, has leaked out and become fully known to the\r\npublic in advance.  There is, of course, great difficulty in preventing\r\nsome inkling of the truth getting prematurely out.  Cabinet Ministers\r\ngenerally have wives, and there are stories of such wives having caught\r\nstray words from their husbands which put them on a track of discovery,\r\nand not having the grace to keep strictly to themselves the discovery\r\nwhen made.  No such mischance, however, appears to have attended the\r\npreparation of the Reform Bill.  It is said that there must have been\r\nmore than thirty persons who had official knowledge of the Ministerial\r\nplans, and yet it does not appear that any definite idea as to their\r\nnature was obtained by the public.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be asked whether there was any solid reason for\r\nattaching so much importance to the keeping of a secret which on a\r\ncertain fixed and near-approaching day must, as a matter of fact, be a\r\nsecret no more.  Of course the imperative necessity of secrecy would be\r\nobvious {135} in all cases where some policy was in preparation which\r\nmight directly affect the interests of foreign States.  In such a case\r\nit is clear that it might be of essential importance to a Government\r\nnot to let its plans become known to the world before it had put itself\r\ninto a condition to maintain its policy.  In measures that had to do\r\nwith commercial and financial interests it might often be of paramount\r\nimportance that no false alarm or false expectations of any kind should\r\nbe allowed to disturb the business of the country before the fitting\r\ntime came for a full declaration.  But in the case of such a measure as\r\nthe Reform Bill it may be asked if any great advantage was to be gained\r\nby keeping the nature of the measure a complete secret until the hour\r\ncame for its full and official explanation.  With regard to this Reform\r\nBill there were many good reasons for maintaining the profoundest\r\npossible secrecy.  If any premature reports got out at all they would\r\nbe sure to be imperfect reports, indiscreet or haphazard revelations of\r\nthis or that particular part of the Bill, utterly wanting in balance,\r\nsymmetry, and comprehensiveness.  The whole thing was new to the\r\ncountry, and there would have been much danger in fixing public\r\nattention upon some one part of the proposed reform until the public\r\ncould be in a position to judge the scheme as a complete measure.\r\n\r\nLord Grey's Government had to deal with two classes of men who were\r\nnaturally and almost relentlessly opposed to each other--the more\r\nclamorous reformers and the enemies of all reform.  It was of immense\r\nimportance that the latter class should, if possible, be prevailed upon\r\nto see--at least the more intelligent and reasonable among them--that\r\nthe Government had not gone so far in the direction of reform as to\r\nmake it seem a threatened revolution.  It was, on the other hand, of\r\nimmense importance to prevail upon the former class to see that the\r\nGovernment had not so stunted and dwarfed its proposed reform as to\r\nrender it incapable of anything like a political and constitutional\r\nrevolution.  Any sudden explosion of feeling on either side brought\r\nabout by some premature {136} and imperfect revelation might have\r\ncaused the most serious trouble in the country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1831--Introduction of the Reform Bill]\r\n\r\nMoreover, none of the ministers could possibly profess to be quite\r\ncertain as to the genuine wishes and purposes of his Majesty King\r\nWilliam the Fourth with regard to the Reform Bill.  The King was not\r\nalways in the same mood on the same subject for any two days in\r\nsuccession, or indeed for any two hours of the same day.  If the\r\nopponents of all reform were to get a knowledge of the clauses in the\r\nBill least favorable to their own ideas as to their interests, and were\r\nto make a commotion among the owners of the soil, the immediate effect\r\nmight be to discourage the King altogether, to fill his mind with a\r\nstrong desire for escape from the uncongenial part of a reformer and an\r\novermastering anxiety to get rid of his reforming Ministry.  If, on the\r\nother hand, the Peterloo men, the Chartists generally, and the\r\npopulations of the northern towns were to get into their minds through\r\nsome imperfect revelation that the Ministerial Bill was not intended to\r\ndo half so much for them as they were demanding, and if in consequence\r\nthere were to be a stormy agitation throughout the country, then it was\r\nquite possible that the King might take alarm and tell his ministers\r\nthat it was hopeless to think of conciliating such agitators, and that\r\nthe safety of the State, and especially of the monarchy, could only be\r\nprovided for by postponing reform until some more favorable\r\nopportunity.  For all these reasons, and many others, the leaders of\r\nthe Government had their hearts set on keeping well their secret until\r\nthe right hour should come for its official disclosure, and it is a\r\nfact of some historical interest, even to readers of the present day,\r\nthat the secret was faithfully kept.\r\n\r\nThe 1st of March, 1831, was a day of intense excitement and even tumult\r\nin and around the House of Commons.  We are told that never before in\r\nthat generation had there been so great a crowd of persons struggling\r\nfor seats in the galleries of the House of Commons.  It is recorded, as\r\nan illustration of this intense eagerness on the part of the public,\r\nthat every available seat in the House {137} was occupied for hours\r\nbefore the business of the day began.  This, however, is not a\r\nstatement that could fill with surprise any reader of the present day.\r\nWe have been accustomed lately to read of occasions when not merely\r\ncrowds of strangers anxious to obtain seats, but crowds of members\r\npositively entitled to get seats, have had to take their stand at the\r\nouter gates of the House of Commons hours before daybreak on the\r\nmorning of the day when some great measure was to be introduced, that\r\nthey might get a reasonable chance of a place, in order to hear a\r\nspeech which could not possibly begin before four o'clock in the\r\nafternoon.  Certainly the House of Commons did not then consist of\r\nnearly as many members as it has at present, and the reformed House of\r\nCommons has not even yet been so reformed as to impress it with the\r\nidea that there ought to be so many seats for so many members.  However\r\nthat may be, it is quite certain that there was intense interest\r\nmanifested by the public on the day when the Reform Bill was to be\r\nintroduced; that immense crowds of people made for the Parliament\r\nbuildings, and that the approaches to the House of Commons were\r\nbesieged by an excited and tumultuous crowd.  There was, in fact, such\r\na rush made to secure the seats in the galleries available for the\r\npublic, so much noisy struggling and quarrelling for seats, that the\r\nSpeaker was at last compelled to intervene and to declare that if quiet\r\nwas not at once restored it would be his duty to have the House cleared\r\nof all strangers.  Order was thus restored after a time, and at last\r\nthe moment arrived for Lord John Russell to introduce the Reform Bill.\r\nThat was indeed a moment of genuine historical interest.\r\n\r\nThe descriptions given at the time by listeners tell us that Russell\r\nbegan his speech in tones which were unusually quiet, low, and reserved\r\neven for him.  It may be said at once that throughout his whole career\r\nin Parliament Russell's manner had been peculiarly quiet and repressed,\r\nand that his eloquence seldom had any fervor in it.  That he was a man\r\nof deep feeling and warm emotions is certain, but both in public and\r\nprivate life there {138} was a coldness about him which often led\r\nstrangers into the quite erroneous belief that he kept apart from the\r\ncrowd because he was filled with a sense of his aristocratic position\r\nand wished to hold himself aloof from contact with ordinary mortals.\r\nAs a Parliamentary debater he was singularly clear, concise, and\r\nunaffected.  He was a great master of phrases, and some odd\r\nepigrammatic sentences of his still live in our common speech, and are\r\nquoted almost every day by persons who have not the least idea as to\r\nthe source from which they come.  His speech on the introduction of the\r\nReform Bill was even for him peculiarly calm, deliberate, and\r\nrestrained.  It contained some passages which will always live in our\r\nhistory, and will illustrate to the reader, more effectively than a\r\nmass of statistics or political tracts might do, the nature and\r\nproportions of the absurd anomalies which Russell was endeavoring to\r\nabolish.  It may be well to mention the fact that it was this speech\r\nwhich, for the first time, introduced and adopted the word \"Reformer\"\r\nas the title of the genuine Whig, and applied the term \"Conservative,\"\r\nin no unfriendly sense, to the Tory party.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1831--Lord John Russell's speech]\r\n\r\nLord John Russell opened his speech by a vindication of the\r\nrepresentative principle as the first condition of the English\r\nconstitutional system.  He made it clear that in the early days of our\r\nParliaments this principle had been distinctly acknowledged, and, to a\r\ncertain extent, had been carried out in practice.  Then he showed how\r\nthe principle had come to be less and less recognized in the\r\narrangement of our constituencies and the allotment of representatives,\r\nuntil at last there had ceased to be any manner of proportion between\r\nrepresentatives and population or any practical acknowledgment of the\r\nmain purpose for which representatives were to be selected.  Everything\r\nhad tended, in the mean time, to make the owners of the soil also the\r\nowners and masters of the representation.  Lord John Russell employed a\r\nseries of illustrations, at once simple and striking, to impress upon\r\nhis audience a due understanding of the extraordinary manner in which\r\nthe whole principle of representation had been diverted.  {139} from\r\nits original purpose.  He assumed the case of some inquiring and\r\nintelligent foreigner, a stranger to our institutions but anxious to\r\nlearn all about them, who had come to England for the purpose of\r\nobtaining information on the spot.  The stranger has the nature and the\r\npurpose of our Parliamentary system explained to him, and he is assured\r\nthat it rests on the representative principle.  He is told that the\r\nHouse of Commons is assembled for the purpose of enabling the sovereign\r\nto collect the best advice that can be given to him as to the\r\ncondition, the wants, and the wishes of his subjects.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons is to be in that sense representative; it is to be\r\nthe interpreter to the King of all that his people wish him to know.\r\nThen the stranger is naturally anxious to learn how the constituencies\r\nare formed, by whose selection the representatives are sent to\r\nParliament, in order to render to the King a faithful message from his\r\npeople.  The stranger is taken to a grassy mound, let us say, in the\r\nmidst of an expanse of silent, unpeopled fields, and he is told that\r\nthat grassy mound sends two members to the House of Commons.  He is\r\nshown a stone wall with three niches in it, and he is informed that\r\nthose three niches are privileged to contribute two members to the\r\nrepresentative assembly.  Lord John Russell described with force and\r\nmasterly humor a variety of such sights which were pointed out to the\r\nstranger, each description being an accurate picture of some place\r\nwhich long since had lost all population, but still continued to have\r\nthe privilege of sending representatives to Parliament.  Then Lord John\r\nRussell changed his form of illustration.  He took his stranger to some\r\nof the great manufacturing and commercial cities and towns of England,\r\nand described the admiration and the wonder with which the intelligent\r\nforeigner regarded these living evidences of the growth and the\r\ngreatness of the nation.  Here then, no doubt, the stranger begins at\r\nlast to think that he can really understand the practical value of the\r\nrepresentative principle.  Thus far he has only been bewildered by what\r\nhe has seen and heard of the empty stretches of land which are {140}\r\nendowed with a right to have representatives in the House of Commons,\r\nbut now he begins to acknowledge to himself that a people with such\r\ngreat manufacturing communities can send up to London representatives\r\nenough from their own centres to constitute a Parliament capable of\r\nadvising with any monarch.  Then, to his utter amazement, the\r\ndistracted foreigner learns that these great cities and towns have no\r\nright whatever to representation in the House of Commons, and have\r\nnothing whatever to do with the election of members.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1831--The proposed reforms]\r\n\r\nThe imaginary foreigner who knew nothing about the principle of the\r\nworkings of our Constitution before his arrival in the country might\r\nwell have been amazed and confounded, and might have fancied, if he had\r\nbeen a reader of English literature, that he had lost his way somehow,\r\nand instead of arriving in England had stumbled into the State of\r\nLaputa.  He might well indeed be excused for such bewilderment, seeing\r\nthat an English student of the present day finds it hard to realize in\r\nhis mind the possibility and the reality of the condition of things\r\nwhich existed in this country within the lifetime of men still living.\r\nLord John Russell then went on to describe the manner in which the\r\nGovernment proposed to deal with the existing defects of the whole\r\nParliamentary system.  He laid it down as the main principle of the\r\nreforms he was prepared to introduce that a free citizen should not be\r\ncompelled to pay taxes in the imposition and levying of which he was\r\nallowed to have no voice.  The vast majority of free citizens could in\r\nany case only express their opinions as to this or that financial\r\nimpost through their representatives in the House of Commons.  This\r\nprinciple had of late been allowed to fail so grossly and so widely in\r\nits application that the House of Commons had almost entirely ceased to\r\nrepresent the will of the people.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell explained that the chief evils with which the\r\nGovernment had to deal were three in number.  The first was the\r\nnomination of members of Parliament by individual patrons.  The second\r\nwas the nomination of members by close corporations.  The third was the\r\n{141} enormous expense of elections, which was principally caused by\r\nthe open bribery and corruption which had almost become a recognized\r\naccompaniment of every contest.  He proposed to deal with the first\r\nevil by abolishing altogether the representation of the nominal\r\nconstituencies, the constituencies that had no resident inhabitant, the\r\nboroughs which at some distant time had had houses and inmates, but of\r\nwhich now only the faintest traces were visible to the eye of the\r\ntraveller--like, for instance, the extinct communities of whose\r\nexistence some faint memorial evidence might be traced on Salisbury\r\nPlain.  The Census last taken, that of 1821, the Government had\r\nresolved to accept as a basis of operations, and Lord John Russell\r\nproposed that every borough which, at that date, had less than 3000\r\ninhabitants should cease any longer to send a member to the House of\r\nCommons.  All boroughs that had not more than 4000 inhabitants should\r\nsend in future only one member each to Parliament.  The principle of\r\nnomination by individuals or by corporations was to come to an end.\r\nThe \"fancy franchises\" were to be got rid of altogether.  In the\r\nboroughs every householder paying rates on houses of the yearly value\r\nof ten pounds and upwards was entitled to have a vote.\r\n\r\nThe Government, however, proposed to deal mercifully, so far as\r\npossible, with the existing interests of voters, although the process\r\nof extinction was summary and complete with regard to the so-called\r\nrights of patrons and of corporations.  For instance, resident voters,\r\nunder the old qualifications, were to be allowed to retain their right\r\nduring their lives, but with the lapse of each life the qualification\r\nexpired and the owner of such a vote could have no successor.  When\r\ndealing with the counties Lord John Russell announced that copyholders\r\nto the value of ten pounds a year and leaseholders for not less than\r\ntwenty-one years at an annual rent of fifty pounds and upwards were to\r\nhave the franchise.  The abolition of the small boroughs and the\r\nuninhabited constituencies would reduce the number of members in the\r\nHouse of Commons by 168, and Lord John Russell explained that the\r\nGovernment did not {142} propose to fill up all these vacancies, being\r\nof opinion that the House was already rather overflowing in its numbers\r\nand had a good deal too many members for the proper discharge of its\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1831--The principles of the Reform Bill]\r\n\r\nSome of the vacant seats were, however, to be assigned to the cities\r\nand towns which were then actually unrepresented in the House of\r\nCommons.  Seven of these towns were to have two representatives each,\r\nand twenty smaller but still goodly towns were to have one\r\nrepresentative each.  Even at this day it may still come as a matter of\r\nsurprise to some readers to learn that the seven towns which in 1831\r\nwere wholly unrepresented, and to which the Bill proposed to give two\r\nmembers each, were Manchester, which was to include Salford;\r\nBirmingham, Leeds, Greenwich, Wolverhampton, Sheffield, and Sunderland.\r\nThe Government proposed to give eight additional members to the\r\nmetropolis itself--that is to say, two members each to the Tower\r\nHamlets, Holborn, Finsbury, and Lambeth.  The three Ridings of\r\nYorkshire were to have two members each, and twenty-six counties\r\nalready represented, and in each of which there were more than 150,000\r\ninhabitants, were each to have two additional members.  It is not\r\nnecessary to go more fully into the details of the scheme which Lord\r\nJohn Russell expounded elaborately to the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland and in Scotland there were some slight differences as to the\r\nscale of the qualification from those that were proposed for England;\r\nbut in the three countries the principle was the same, and the right to\r\nvote was associated with a certain occupation of land or payment of\r\nhousehold rating, and new constituencies were created where towns,\r\nunrepresented before, had grown up into recognized importance.  By the\r\nchanges that the Bill proposed to make no less than half a million of\r\nnew voters were to be created throughout Great Britain and Ireland.\r\nFor the purpose of diminishing the enormous expense of elections it was\r\nproposed that the poll should be taken at the same time in separate\r\ndistricts, so that no voter should have to travel more than fifteen\r\nmiles in order to record his vote, and {143} that the time over which\r\nan election contest could be spread should be greatly reduced, and\r\nreduced in proportion to the size of the constituency.  It is as well\r\nto say at once that that part of the Reform Bill which aimed at the due\r\nreduction of election expenses to their legitimate and necessary\r\nproportions proved an utter failure.  No reduction in the amount of\r\nwhat may be called working expenses could have diminished, to any\r\nsatisfactory degree, the evil from which the country was suffering at\r\nthat time, and from which it continued to suffer for more than another\r\ngeneration.  Bribery and corruption were the evils which had to be\r\ndealt with, and the Reform Bill of 1831 left these evils as it had\r\nfound them.  The Bill, however, did, in its other provisions, do much\r\nto establish a genuine principle of Parliamentary representation.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it proclaimed the principle of representation as the\r\nlegal basis of the whole Parliamentary system.  It abolished the\r\nnomination of members, whether by individual persons or by\r\ncorporations.  It laid down as law that representation must bear some\r\nproportion to the numbers represented.  It made actual, or at least\r\noccasional, residence a qualification for a voter.  These were the main\r\nprinciples of the measure.  The attention of readers will presently be\r\ndrawn to the manner in which the Bill failed to answer some of the\r\ndemands made upon the Government by the spreading intelligence of the\r\ncountry, and left these demands to be more adequately answered by the\r\nstatesmen of a later generation.  Enough to say that with all its\r\ndefects the Bill, as Lord John Russell explained it, was, for its time,\r\na bold and broad measure of reform, and that it laid down the lines\r\nalong which, as far as human foresight can discern, the movement of\r\nprogress in England's political history will make its way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{144}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXII.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT DEBATE.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1831--Sir Robert Inglis and Reform]\r\n\r\nThe debate which followed Lord John Russell's motion for leave to bring\r\nin the Bill contained, as well might be expected, some very remarkable\r\nspeeches.  Three of these deserve the special attention of the student\r\nof history.  The first illustrated the views of the extreme Tory of\r\nthat day, and is indeed a political curiosity which ought never to be\r\nconsigned to utter oblivion.  This speech was made by Sir Robert Harry\r\nInglis, who represented the University of Oxford.  Sir Robert Inglis\r\nwas a living embodiment of the spirit of old-world Toryism as it had\r\ncome down to his day, Toryism which had in it little or nothing of the\r\npicturesque, half poetic sentiment belonging to the earlier wearers of\r\nthe rebel rose, the flower symbolic of the Stuart dynasty.  Sir Robert\r\nInglis was a man of education, of intelligence, and of high principle.\r\nHis sincerity was unquestioned, and his opinion would probably be well\r\nworth having on any question which was not concerned with the\r\nantagonism between Whig and Tory.  Sir Robert argued boldly in his\r\nspeech that the principle of representation had never been recognized\r\nby the Constitution as the Parliamentary system of England.  He\r\ninsisted that the sovereign had a perfect right to choose any\r\nrepresentative he pleased from any constituency which it suited him to\r\ncreate.  The King could delegate to any nobleman or gentleman his right\r\nof nominating a representative.  Sir Robert scouted the idea that a\r\nlarge, prosperous, and populous town had any better claim to be\r\nrepresented in the House of Commons than the smallest village in the\r\ncountry.  It was all a matter for the sovereign, and if the sovereign\r\nthought fit he had as good a right to invite any one he {145} pleased\r\nto represent an unpeopled plain as to represent Manchester, Leeds, or\r\nSheffield.  He denounced Russell's proposal to disfranchise the small\r\nnomination boroughs, and he used an argument which was employed in the\r\nsame debate and by much wiser men than he in defence of the pocket\r\nboroughs and the whole system of nomination.  Some of the most\r\nbrilliant, gifted members of the House of Commons, he contended, had\r\nbeen sent into that House by the patrons and owners of such boroughs,\r\nand otherwise never could have got into Parliament at all, for they\r\ncould not have borne the enormous expense of a county contest.\r\n\r\nWe have heard that argument over and over again in days much more\r\nrecent.  It would, of course, have been hard to dispose of it\r\ncompletely if it could be shown that there was no possible way by which\r\nthe expenses of elections could be reduced to a reasonable amount; if\r\nit could be shown that there was any human system so bad as to have no\r\ncompensating advantages whatever; and finally if it could be shown that\r\nwith the spread of education and the growth of popular intelligence a\r\nman of great and commanding ability without money would not have a much\r\nbetter chance of election at the hands of a large constituency than by\r\nthe mere favor of some discerning patron.  Sir Robert Inglis also used\r\nan argument which is even still not unfamiliar in political debate,\r\nwhether inside or outside Parliament.  He contended not merely that the\r\nEnglish population had no real grievances to complain of, but that none\r\namong the English population would have fancied that they were\r\nsuffering from grievances if it had not been for the evil advice and\r\nturbulent agitation of mob orators.  To these wicked persons, the mob\r\norators, Sir Robert ascribed all the disturbances which were setting\r\nthe country in commotion.  If only these mob orators could be kept from\r\nspouting everything would go well and no subject of the sovereign would\r\never get it into his head that he was suffering from the slightest\r\ngrievance.\r\n\r\nThis is an argument which had just been used with regard to Catholic\r\nEmancipation; which was afterwards to {146} be used with regard to\r\nfree-trade and the introduction of the ballot and household suffrage;\r\nand which will probably be used again and again so long as any sort of\r\nreform is demanded.  Of course it need hardly be said that when Sir\r\nRobert Inglis referred to mob orators he used the phrase as a term of\r\ncontempt applying to all speakers who advocated principles which were\r\nnot the principles represented by the Tory aristocracy.  A Tory\r\nlandlord spouting any kind of nonsense to the most ignorant crowd would\r\nnot have been, according to this definition, a mob orator; he would\r\nhave been a high-bred Englishman, instructing his humbler brethren as\r\nto the way they ought to go.  Sir Robert also indulged in the most\r\ngloomy prophecies about the evils which must come upon England as the\r\ndirect result of the Reform Bill if that Bill were to be passed into\r\nlaw.  The influence of rank and property would suddenly and completely\r\ncease to prevail; education would lose its power to teach and to guide;\r\nthe House of Commons would no longer be the place for men of rank,\r\nculture, and statesmanship, but would be occupied only by mob orators.\r\nArt after art would go out and all would be night, if we may adopt the\r\nfamous line of Pope's which Sir Robert somehow failed to introduce.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1831--Peel's speech on the Reform Bill]\r\n\r\nThe second speech in the debate to which we may refer was that of Sir\r\nRobert Peel.  It was a necessity of Peel's position just then, and of\r\nthe stage of political development which his mind had reached, that he\r\nshould oppose the Reform Bill.  But in the work of opposition he had to\r\nundertake a task far more difficult to him in the artistic sense than\r\nthe task which the destinies had appointed for Sir Robert Inglis to\r\nattempt.  Inglis, although a man of ability and education, as\r\ncollegiate education then went, was so thorough a Tory of the old\r\nschool that the most extravagant arguments he used came as naturally\r\nand clearly to his mind as if they had been dictated to him by\r\ninspiration.  But a man of Peel's high order of intellect, a man who\r\nhad been gifted by nature with the mind of a statesman, must sometimes\r\nhave found it hard indeed to convince himself that some of the\r\narguments he used against reform {147} were arguments which the history\r\nof the future would be likely to maintain.  Peel's genius, however, was\r\nnot one which readily adopted conclusions, especially when these\r\nconclusions involved a change in the seeming order of things.  We have\r\nseen already that he was quite capable of taking a bold decision and\r\naccepting its responsibilities when the movement of events seemed to\r\nsatisfy him that a choice one way or the other could no longer be\r\npostponed.\r\n\r\nThe whole story of his subsequent career bears evidence of the same\r\neffect.  His genius guided him rightly when the fateful moment arrived\r\nat which a decision had to be made, but when left to himself his\r\ninclinations always were to let things go on in their old way.  He had\r\nnot yet seen any necessity for a complete system of Parliamentary\r\nreform, nor was he likely, in any case, to have approved of some of the\r\nproposals contained in the Bill brought in by Lord John Russell.  The\r\nspeech he delivered appears, by all the accounts which reach us, to\r\nhave been a genuine piece of Parliamentary eloquence.  Peel did not, as\r\nmay well be imagined, commit himself to some of the extravagances which\r\nwere poured forth in absolute good faith by Sir Robert Inglis.  But the\r\nvery nature of his task compelled him sometimes to have recourse to\r\narguments which, although put forward with more discretion and more\r\ndexterity than Inglis had shown, seemed nevertheless to belong to the\r\nsame order of political reasoning.\r\n\r\nIt is not, perhaps, surprising that Peel should have found much to say\r\nfor the existence of the small nomination boroughs, seeing that the\r\nsame arguments were made use of a whole generation afterwards by no\r\nless a person than Mr. Gladstone.  These arguments, we need hardly say,\r\nwere founded on the familiar assumption that a Burke or a Sheridan, a\r\nCanning or a Plunket, would have no chance whatever of getting into the\r\nHouse of Commons if some appreciative patron did not generously put a\r\nborough at his disposal.  In our own days we have seen, again and\r\nagain, that a man of high political character and commanding eloquence,\r\nbut having no money or other such influence to back him, would have a\r\nfar better chance at {148} the hands of a great popular constituency\r\nthan he would be likely to have in some small borough, where local\r\ninterests might easily be brought to conspire against him.  But at the\r\ntime when Peel was making his speech against the Reform project the\r\npatronage system still prevailed in politics, if no longer in letters,\r\nand the unendowed child of genius would have little chance indeed if he\r\nwere to try to get into Parliament on his own mere merits.  On the\r\nwhole, it must be owned that Sir Robert Peel made as good a case\r\nagainst the Bill as could have been made from the Conservative point of\r\nview, and it may be added that an equally ingenious case might have\r\nbeen made out by a man of his capacity against any change whatever in\r\nany system.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1831--The second reading of the Reform Bill]\r\n\r\nThe third speech to which we think it necessary to refer was that\r\ndelivered by the Irish orator and agitator, Daniel O'Connell.\r\nO'Connell promised the Bill all the support in his power, but he took\r\ncare to explain that he supported it only because he believed it was\r\nthe best Bill he could obtain from any Government at that moment.  He\r\ndescribed clearly and impressively the faults which he found with Lord\r\nJohn Russell's measure; and it has to be noticed that the objections\r\nwhich he raised were absolutely confirmed by our subsequent political\r\nhistory.  He found fault with the Bill because it did not go nearly as\r\nfar as such a measure ought to go in the direction of manhood suffrage,\r\nor, at all events, of household suffrage.  He contended that no Reform\r\nBill could really fulfil the best purposes for which it was designed\r\nwithout the adoption of the ballot system in the voting at popular\r\nelections.  He advocated shorter Parliaments and much more\r\ncomprehensive and strenuous legislation for the prevention of bribery\r\nand corruption.  In short, O'Connell made a speech which might have\r\nbeen spoken with perfect appropriateness by an English Radical of the\r\nhighest political order at any time during some succeeding generations.\r\nO'Connell's opinions seem to have been at that time, save on one\r\npolitical question alone--the question of Repeal of the Union--exactly\r\nin accord with those of the Radical party down to the days of Cobden\r\nand Bright.\r\n\r\n{149}\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned, as a matter of some historical interest, that,\r\nvindicating the true theory of popular representation, he complained\r\nthat successive English Governments had abandoned the constitutional\r\nposition taken up by the glorious Revolution of 1688.  Readers of the\r\npresent day may be inclined to think, not without good reason for the\r\nthought, that statesmanship in the days of Lord Grey's first Reform\r\nBill, and for many years after, might have had less trouble with\r\nIreland if it had taken better account of the opinions and the\r\ninfluence of O'Connell.\r\n\r\nThe debate on the motion for leave to bring in the Bill lasted several\r\ndays.  In accordance, however, with the usual practice of the House of\r\nCommons, no division was taken and the Bill was read a first time.  In\r\nthe House of Commons it is not usual to have a long debate on the\r\nmotion for leave to bring in a Bill, which amounts in substance to a\r\nmotion that the Bill be read for the first time.  When, however, a\r\nmeasure of great importance is introduced there is sometimes a\r\nlengthened and very often a discursive debate or conversation on the\r\nmotion; but it is rarely so long and so earnest a discussion as that\r\nwhich took place when Lord John Russell brought in the Reform Bill.\r\nOne result of the length of the debate which preceded the first reading\r\nwas that when the motion for the second reading came on the leading\r\nmembers of the Opposition were found to have expressed fully their\r\nopinions already, and the discussion seemed little better than the\r\nretelling of an old story.\r\n\r\nWhen the motion for the second reading came to be put to the vote it\r\nwas found that the Opposition had got together a very full gathering of\r\ntheir numbers, and the second reading was only carried by a majority of\r\none.  The hearts of many of the reformers sank within them for the\r\nmoment, and the hopes of the Tories were revived in an equal degree.\r\nEven already it seemed clear to all of Lord Grey's colleagues that a\r\nmeasure carried on its second reading by such a bare majority had not\r\nthe slightest chance of forcing its way through the House of Lords,\r\neven if it should be fortunate enough to pass without serious {150}\r\ndamage through the House of Commons.  Lord Grey and his colleagues were\r\nalready beginning to think that nothing worth accomplishing was likely\r\nto be achieved until a general election should have greatly\r\nstrengthened the Reform party in Parliament.  The movement for reform\r\nhad of late been growing steadily in most parts of the country.  Some\r\nof the more recent elections had shown that the reform spirit was\r\nobtaining the mastery in constituencies from which nothing of the kind\r\nhad been expected a short time before, and it seemed to most of the\r\nWhig leaders that the existing Parliament was the last bulwark against\r\nthe progress of reform.  When the time came for the motion to enable\r\nthe Bill to get into committee--that is, to be discussed point by point\r\nin all its clauses by the House, with full liberty to every member to\r\nspeak as many times as he pleased--General Gascoigne, one of the\r\nrepresentatives of Liverpool, proposed an amendment to the effect that\r\nit was not expedient, at such a time, to reduce the numbers of knights,\r\ncitizens, and burgesses constituting the House of Commons, and this\r\namendment was carried by a majority of eight.  Now the carrying of this\r\namendment could not possibly have been considered as the destruction of\r\nany vital part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1831--William the Fourth and Reform]\r\n\r\nLord John Russell had argued for the reduction of the numbers in the\r\nHouse as a matter of convenience and expediency; but he had not given\r\nit to be understood that the Government felt itself pledged to that\r\nparticular proposition, and had made up his mind not to accept any\r\nmodification in that part of the plan.  The authors of the Reform Bill,\r\nhowever, read very wisely in the success of General Gascoigne's\r\namendment the lesson that in the existing Parliament the Tories would\r\nbe able to take the conduct of the measure out of the hands of the\r\nGovernment during its progress through committee, and to mar and\r\nmutilate it, so as to render it entirely unsuited to its original\r\npurposes.  Therefore Lord Grey and the other members of his Cabinet\r\nmade up their minds that the best course they could take would be to\r\naccept the vote of the House of Commons as a distinct defeat, and to\r\nmake an {151} appeal to the decision of the constituencies by an\r\ninstant dissolution of Parliament.\r\n\r\nOne important question had yet to be settled.  Would the King give his\r\nassent to the dissolution?  No one could have supposed that the King\r\nwas really at heart a reformer, and the general conviction was that if\r\nWilliam cared anything at all about the matter his personal inclination\r\nwould be in favor of good old Toryism, or that, at the very least, his\r\ninclination would be for allowing things to go on in the old way.  At\r\nthat time the principle had not yet been set up as a part of our\r\nconstitutional system that the sovereign was bound to submit his own\r\nwill and pleasure to the advice of his ministers.  It would have been\r\nquite in accordance with recognized precedents since the House of\r\nHanover came to the throne if the King were to proclaim his\r\ndetermination to act upon his own judgment and let his ministers either\r\nput up with his decision or resign their offices.\r\n\r\nFor some time, indeed, it appeared as if the King was likely to assert\r\nhis prerogative, according to the old fashion.  The disagreeable and\r\nalmost hazardous task of endeavoring to persuade the King into\r\ncompliance with the desire of his Ministry was entrusted to Lord\r\nBrougham, who was supposed, as Lord Chancellor, to be keeper of the\r\nsovereign's conscience.  Brougham was not a man who could be described\r\nas gifted with the bland powers of persuasion, but at all events he did\r\nnot want courage for the task he had to undertake.  William appears at\r\nfirst to have refused flatly his consent to the wishes of the Ministry,\r\nto have blustered a good deal in his usual unkingly, not to say\r\nungainly, fashion, and to have replied to Brougham's intimation that\r\nthe ministers might have to resign, with words to the effect that\r\nministers, if they liked, might resign and be--ministers no more.  The\r\nKing, however, was at last prevailed upon to give his assent, but then\r\na fresh trouble arose when he found that Lord Grey and Lord Brougham,\r\npresuming on his ultimate compliance, had already taken steps to make\r\npreparations for the ceremonials preceding dissolution.  As the {152}\r\nMinistry thought it necessary that there should be no delay whatever in\r\nthe steps required to dissolve Parliament, a message had been sent in\r\norder that the Life Guards should be ready, according to the usual\r\ncustom when the King went to Westminster for such a purpose.  William\r\nfound in this act on the part of the Ministry a new reason for an\r\noutburst of wrath.  He stormed at Brougham; he declared that it was an\r\nact of high-treason to call out the Life Guards without the express\r\nauthority of the King, and he raged in a manner which seemed to imply\r\nthat only the mercy of the sovereign could save Grey and Brougham from\r\nthe axe on Tower Hill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1831--The second Reform Bill]\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was fortunate on the whole for the peaceful settlement of\r\nthe controversy that the King should have found this new and unexpected\r\nstimulant to his anger; for when his wrath had completely exploded over\r\nit, and when Brougham had been able to explain, again and again, that\r\nno act of high-treason had been contemplated or committed, the royal\r\nfury had spent itself; the King's good-humor had returned; and in the\r\nreaction William had forgotten most of his objections to the original\r\nproposal.  It was arranged, then, that the dissolution should take\r\nplace at once.  As a matter of fact, Sir Robert Peel, in the House of\r\nCommons, was actually declaiming, in his finest manner, and with a\r\nvoice that Disraeli afterwards described as the best ever heard in the\r\nHouse, excepting indeed \"the thrilling tones of O'Connell,\" against the\r\nwhole scheme of reform, when the Usher of the Black Rod was heard\r\nknocking at the doors of the Chamber to summon its members to attend at\r\nthe bar of the House of Lords, in order to receive the commands of his\r\nMajesty the King.  The commands of his Majesty the King were in fact\r\nthe announcement that Parliament was dissolved, and that an appeal to\r\nthe country for the election of a new Parliament was to take place at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nThe news was received by Reformers all over the country with the most\r\nexuberant demonstrations of enthusiasm.  In London most of the houses\r\nthroughout the principal streets were illuminated, and many windows\r\nwhich showed {153} no lights were instantly broken by the exulting\r\ncrowds that swarmed everywhere.  The Duke of Wellington received marked\r\ntokens of the unpopularity which his uncompromising declaration against\r\nall manner of reform had brought upon him.  Some of the windows at\r\nApsley House, his town residence--the windows that looked into the\r\nPark--were broken by an impassioned mob, and for years afterwards these\r\nwindows were always kept shuttered, as a sign--so at least the popular\r\nfaith assumed it to be--that the Duke could not forgive or forget this\r\nevidence of public ingratitude to the conqueror of Waterloo.  The King,\r\non the other hand, had grown suddenly into immense popularity.  The\r\nfavorite title given to him at the time of his accession was that of\r\nthe \"Sailor King.\"  Now he was hailed everywhere in the streets as the\r\n\"Patriot King.\"  Wherever his carriage made its public appearance it\r\nwas sure to be followed by an admiring and acclaiming crowd.  The\r\nelections came on at once, and it has to be noted that the amount of\r\nmoney spent on both sides was something astonishing even for those days\r\nof reckless expenditure in political contests.  Neither side could make\r\nany boast of political purity, and indeed neither side seemed to have\r\nthe slightest inclination to set up such a claim.  The only rivalry was\r\nin the spending of money in unrestricted and shameless bribery and\r\ncorruption.  The more modern sense of revolt against the whole\r\nprinciple of bribery was little thought of in those days.  There were\r\nmen, indeed, on both sides of the political field who would never have\r\nstooped to offer a bribe if left to the impulses of their own honor and\r\ntheir own conscience.  But the ordinary man of the world, and more\r\nespecially of the political world, felt that if he himself did not give\r\nthe bribe his rival would be certain to give it, and that nobody at his\r\nclub or in society would think any the worse of him because it was\r\nunderstood that he had bought himself into the House of Commons.  When\r\nthe elections were over the prevalent opinion as to their result was\r\nalmost everywhere that the numbers of the Reform party in the House of\r\nCommons would be much greater than it had been in the {154} House so\r\nlately dissolved.  When the new Parliament was opened, Lord John\r\nRussell and Mr. Stanley appeared as members of the Cabinet.  The new\r\nParliament was opened by King William on June 21.  If William really\r\nenjoyed the consciousness of popularity, as there is every reason to\r\nbelieve he did, he must have felt a very proud and popular sovereign\r\nthat day.  His carriage as he drove to the entrance of the House of\r\nLords was surrounded and followed by an immense crowd, which cheered\r\nitself hoarse in its demonstrations of loyalty.  On June 24 Lord John\r\nRussell introduced his second Reform Bill.  It is not necessary to go\r\nthrough the details of the new measure.  The second Reform Bill was in\r\nsubstance very much the same as its predecessor had been, but of course\r\nits principle was debated on the motion of the second reading with as\r\nmuch heat, although not at such great length, as in the case of the\r\nfirst Reform Bill a few weeks before.  Nothing new came out in this\r\nsecond argument, and the debate on the second reading, which began on\r\nJuly 4, occupied only three nights, a fact which made some members of\r\nthe Opposition think themselves entitled to the compliments of the\r\ncountry.  The Parliamentary opponents of the Reform Bill were, however,\r\nsoon to make it evident that they had more practical and more\r\nperplexing ways of delaying its progress through the House of Commons\r\nthan by the delivery of long orations on the elementary principle of\r\nreform.  The second reading of the Bill was carried by 367 votes in its\r\nfavor and 231 votes against it--that is to say, by a majority of 136\r\nfor the Bill.  Therefore everybody saw that, as far as the House of\r\nCommons in the new Parliament was concerned, there was a large majority\r\nin support of the measure brought forward by the Government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1831--William Cobbett]\r\n\r\nIt was morning, and not very early morning, when the House divided, and\r\nthe Attorney-General had not much time to spare for rest before setting\r\noff for one of the law courts to conduct a prosecution which the\r\nGovernment had thought it well to institute against a man who held a\r\nmost prominent position in England at that time, and whose name, it is\r\nsafe to say, will be remembered as long as good {155} English prose is\r\nstudied.  This man was William Cobbett, and he had just aroused the\r\nanger of the Government by a published article in which he vindicated\r\nthe conduct of those who had set fire to hayricks and destroyed farm\r\nbuildings in various parts of the country.  William Cobbett had begun\r\nlife as the son of a small farmer, who was himself the son of a day\r\nlaborer.  He had lived a strange and varied life.  In his boyish days\r\nhe had run away from a little farm in Surrey and had flung himself upon\r\nthe world of London.  He had found employment, for a while, in the\r\nhumblest kind of drudgery as a junior copying clerk in an attorney's\r\noffice, and then he had enlisted in a regiment of foot.  He was\r\nquartered for a year at Chatham, and he devoted all his leisure moments\r\nto reading, for which he had a passion which lasted him all his\r\nlifetime.  He is said to have exhausted the whole contents of a lending\r\nlibrary in the neighborhood, for he preferred reading anything to\r\nreading nothing.  He was especially fond of historical and scientific\r\nstudies, but he had a love for literature of a less severe kind also,\r\nand he studied with intense eagerness the works of Swift, on whose\r\nstyle he seems to have moulded his own with much success and without\r\nany servile imitation.  Then he was quartered with his regiment for\r\nsome time in New Brunswick, and after various vicissitudes he made his\r\nway to Philadelphia.  During his stay in New Brunswick he had studied\r\nFrench, and had many opportunities of conversing in it with\r\nFrench-Canadians, and when settled for a time in Philadelphia he\r\noccupied himself by teaching English to some refugees from France.  Now\r\nand again he went backward and forward between America and England, but\r\nit was in Philadelphia that he was first known as a writer.  Under the\r\nsignature of Peter Porcupine he published the \"Porcupine Papers,\" which\r\nwere chiefly made up of sarcastic and vehement attacks upon public men.\r\nCobbett had begun as a sort of Tory, or, at all events, as a professed\r\nenemy of all Radical agitators, but he gradually became a Radical\r\nagitator himself, and when he finally settled in England he soon began\r\nto be recognized as one of the most powerful {156} advocates of the\r\nRadical cause in or out of Parliament.  He wrote a strong, simple\r\nAnglo-Saxon style, and indeed it is not too much to say that, after\r\nSwift himself, no man ever wrote clearer English prose than that of\r\nWilliam Cobbett.  He had tried to get into Parliament twice without\r\nsuccess; but at last he succeeded in obtaining a seat as the\r\nrepresentative of the borough of Oldham, a place which he represented\r\nuntil the time of his death, and which was represented by members of\r\nhis family in the memory of the present generation.  He had started a\r\npaper called _The Weekly Political Register_, and in this he championed\r\nthe Radical cause with an energy and ability which made him one of the\r\nmost conspicuous men of the time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1831--The prosecution of Cobbett]\r\n\r\nLord Grey's Government was probably not very anxious to prosecute\r\nCobbett, if a prosecution could have been avoided, but it was feared,\r\nperhaps, by the members of the Cabinet that some of his writings would\r\nbe used by the opponents of reform as an illustration of the principles\r\non which reform was founded, and the practices which it would encourage\r\nif the Government failed to take some decided action.  It was therefore\r\ndecided to institute the prosecution for the article which had been\r\npublished in the previous December.  The Guildhall, where the case was\r\nto be tried, was crowded to excess, and the prisoner was loudly\r\napplauded when he stood in the court.  He was one of the heroes of the\r\nhour with large numbers of the people everywhere, and the court would\r\nhave been crowded this day in any case; but additional interest was\r\ngiven to the sitting by the fact that Cobbett had summoned for\r\nwitnesses for his defence Lord Grey, Lord Brougham, Lord Althorp, and\r\nLord Durham.  The summoning of these witnesses was one of Cobbett's\r\noriginal and audacious strokes of humor and of cleverness, and his\r\nobject was, in fact, to make it out that the leading members of his\r\nMajesty's Government were just as much inclined to countenance violence\r\nas he was when such a piece of work might happen to suit their\r\npolitical purposes.  The stroke, however, did not produce much effect\r\nin this case, for Lord Brougham's evidence, which in any case would\r\nhave been {157} unimportant to the question at issue, would have been\r\nrather to the disadvantage than advantage of the prisoner if it had\r\nbeen fully gone into, and Cobbett relieved Brougham from further\r\nattendance; while Chief Justice Tenterden, the presiding judge, decided\r\nthat the testimony which Cobbett said he intended to draw from the\r\nother noble witnesses had nothing to do with the case before the jury.\r\nThe whole question, in fact, was as to the nature of the article in the\r\n_Political Register_.  The jury could not agree upon their verdict, and\r\nafter they had been locked up for fifteen hours, and there seemed no\r\nchance of their coming to an understanding, the jurors were discharged\r\nand there was an end of the case.  When the result was announced\r\nCobbett received tumultuous applause from a large number of the crowd\r\nin court and from throngs of people outside.  He left the court even\r\nmore of a popular hero than he had been when he entered it.\r\n\r\nNow, in studying the article itself as a mere historical document, the\r\nreader who belongs to the present generation would probably be disposed\r\nto come to the conclusion that, while it was indeed something like a\r\ndirect incentive to violence, it also pointed to evils and to dangers\r\nwhich the wisdom of statesmanship would then have done well to fear.\r\nFor the main purpose of the article was to emphasize the fact that, in\r\nthe existing conditions of things, nothing was ever likely to be done\r\nfor the relief of the hungry sufferers from bad laws and bad social\r\nconditions, unless some deeds of violence were employed to startle the\r\npublic into the knowledge that the sufferings existed and would not be\r\nendured in patience any longer.  It is unfortunately only too true\r\nthat, at all periods of history, even the most recent history of the\r\nmost civilized countries, there are evils that legislation will not\r\ntrouble itself to deal with until legislators have been made to know by\r\nsome deeds of violence that if relief will not come, civil disturbance\r\nmust come.  The whole story of the reign of William the Fourth is the\r\nstory of an age of reform, although no particular credit can be given\r\nto the monarch himself for that splendid fact.  It is a melancholy\r\ntruth {158} that not one of these reforms would have been effected at\r\nthe time or for long after if those who suffered most cruelly from\r\nexisting wrongs had always been content to suffer in law-abiding\r\npeacefulness, and to allow the justice of their cause to prove itself\r\nby patient argument addressed to the reason, the sympathy, and the\r\nconscience of the ruling orders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{159}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE TRIUMPH OF REFORM.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1831--Obstructive tactics in the Commons]\r\n\r\nThe Reform Bill was, then, clearly on its way to success.  It had\r\npassed its second reading in the House of Commons by a large, and what\r\nmight well be called a triumphant, majority.  Now, when a great measure\r\nreaches that stage in the modern history of our Constitution, we can\r\nall venture to forecast, with some certainty, its ultimate fate.  We\r\nare speaking, it need hardly be said, of reform measures which are\r\nmoved by a clear principle and have a strong and resolute band of\r\nfollowers.  Such measures may be defeated once and again by the House\r\nof Lords, and may be delayed in either or both Houses for a\r\nconsiderable time; but it only needs perseverance to carry them in the\r\nend.  Some of the more enlightened and intelligent Conservatives must\r\nhave begun already to feel that the ultimate triumph of the reform\r\nmeasure was only a question of time; but then those who were opposed to\r\nevery such reform were determined that, at all events, the triumph\r\nshould be put off as long as possible.  The House of Lords would, no\r\ndoubt, throw out the Bill when it came for the first time within the\r\nrange of their power; but it was resolved, meanwhile, to keep the Bill\r\nas long as possible in the House of Commons.  Therefore there now set\r\nin a Parliamentary campaign of a kind which was almost quite new to\r\nthose days, but has become familiar to our later times--a campaign of\r\nobstruction.  After the second reading of the new Reform Bill there set\r\nin that first great systematic performance of obstruction which has\r\nbeen the inspiration, the lesson, and the model to all the obstructives\r\nof later years.  The rules and the practices of the House of Commons\r\noffered in those times, and, {160} indeed, for long after, the most\r\ntempting opportunities to any body of members who were anxious to\r\nprolong debate for the mere purpose of preventing legislation.  For\r\nexample, it was understood until quite lately that any motion made in\r\nthe House, even the most formal and technical, might be opposed, and,\r\nif opposed, might be debated for any length of time, without the\r\nSpeaker having the power to intervene and cut short the most barren and\r\nmeaningless discussion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1831--Parliamentary procedure]\r\n\r\nWhen the House goes into committee, according to the formal\r\nParliamentary phrase, the temptation to obstruct becomes indefinitely\r\nmultiplied, for in committee a member can speak as often as he thinks\r\nfit on the subject--or, at least, such was his privilege before the\r\nalterations adopted in very recent years.  It may be well to explain to\r\nthe general reader the meaning of what takes place when the House goes\r\ninto committee.  When a Bill has passed through its first and second\r\nreading it is understood that the main principles of the measure have\r\nbeen agreed upon, and that it only remains for the House to go into\r\ncommittee for the purpose of considering every clause and every minute\r\ndetail of the Bill before it comes up to the House again for its third\r\nand final reading.  Now the House, when it goes into committee, is\r\nstill just the same House of Commons as before, except that the Speaker\r\nleaves the chair and the assembly is presided over by the Chairman of\r\nCommittees, who sits not in the Speaker's throne-like chair, but in an\r\nordinary seat at the table in front of it.  There is, however, the\r\nimportant difference that, while in the House itself, presided over by\r\nthe Speaker, a member can only speak once on each motion, in the\r\ncommittee he can speak as often as he thinks fit, and for the obvious\r\nreason that, where mere details are under consideration, it was not\r\nthought expedient to limit the number of practical suggestions which\r\nany member might desire to offer as the discussion of each clause\r\nsuggested new possibilities of improvement.  By the alterations\r\neffected recently in the rules of procedure the Speaker of the House,\r\nor the Chairman of Committees, obtains a {161} certain control over\r\nmembers who are evidently talking against time and for the sake of\r\nwilful obstruction; but in the days of Lord John Russell's Reform Bill\r\nno such authority had been given to the presiding officer.\r\n\r\nThe very motion--in ordinary times a purely formal motion--which had to\r\nbe passed in order that the House might get into committee, gave to the\r\nopponents of reform their first opportunity of obstruction.  The motion\r\nwas that the Speaker do now leave the chair, and the moment that motion\r\nwas put it was immediately met by an amendment.  A Tory member raised\r\nthe question that there was a mistake in one of the returns of\r\npopulation in the constituency which he represented, and he proposed\r\nthat his constituent should be allowed to show cause in person or by\r\ncounsel at the bar of the House for a rectification of the error.  Lord\r\nJohn Russell admitted that there appeared to have been some mistake in\r\nthe return, but he contended that the motion to enable the House to go\r\ninto committee was not the proper time at which such a question could\r\nbe raised.  Every one in the House knew perfectly well the motive for\r\nraising the question just then, and after some time had been wasted in\r\nabsolutely unnecessary discussion the obstructive amendment was\r\ndefeated by a majority of 97.  That, however, did not help matters very\r\nmuch, for the House had still to divide upon the question that the\r\nSpeaker do now leave the chair.  This was met by repeated motions for\r\nadjournment, and on every one of these motions a long discussion was\r\nkept up by some leading members of the Opposition and by their faithful\r\nfollowers.  The reader will remember that until the motion had been\r\ncarried for the Speaker to leave the chair it was still the House, and\r\nnot the committee, that was sitting, and therefore no member could\r\nspeak more than once on the same subject.  But then this fact did not\r\nsecure even that particular stage of the debate against obstruction,\r\nfor there were several different forms in which the motion for\r\nadjournment might be made, and on each of these several proposals a\r\nmember was entitled to speak even although he had already spoken on\r\neach motion previously proposed {162} to the same practical effect.\r\nPerhaps it may be as well to bring the condition of things more clearly\r\nand more practically within the understanding of the general reader,\r\nseeing that the Parliamentary obstruction which may be said to have\r\nbegun with the Reform Bill became afterwards so important an instrument\r\nfor good or for evil in our legislative system.  The motion then is\r\nmade that Mr. Speaker do now leave the chair.  Thereupon Mr. Brown,\r\nTory member, moves as an amendment that the House do now adjourn, and\r\nMr. Brown sets forth in a lengthened speech his reasons for thinking\r\nthat the House ought not to sit any longer that night.  Some member of\r\nthe Ministry rises and gives his reason for urging that the Speaker\r\nshould be allowed to leave the chair at once, and that the House go\r\ninto committee in order to consider the details of the measure.\r\nThereupon several of Mr. Brown's friends arise, and one after another\r\nexpound, at great length, their reason for supporting Mr. Brown.  The\r\nministers, by this time, have made up their minds that the best course\r\nthey can follow is to let Mr. Brown's friends have all the talk to\r\nthemselves, but some independent members on the side of the Government\r\nare sure to be provoked into making speeches denouncing the\r\nobstructives and thereby only helping to obstruct.  At length, when all\r\nMr. Brown's friends have had their say--and Mr. Brown, it will be\r\nremembered, cannot speak again on this particular question--a division\r\nis taken on his amendment, and the amendment is lost.  Then the\r\nquestion is put once more for the Speaker to leave the chair, and\r\ninstantly Mr. Jones, another Tory member, springs to his feet and moves\r\nas an amendment, not that the House do now adjourn, but that this\r\ndebate be now adjourned, which, as every one must see, is quite a\r\ndifferent proposition.  On this new amendment Mr. Brown is quite\r\nentitled to speak, and he does speak accordingly, and so do all his\r\nfriends, and at last a division is taken and the amendment of Mr. Jones\r\nhas the same fate as the amendment of Mr. Brown, and is defeated by a\r\nlarge majority.  Up comes the question once more about the Speaker\r\nleaving the chair, and up gets Mr. Robinson, {163} another Tory member,\r\nand moves that the House do now adjourn, which motion is strictly in\r\norder, for it is quite clear that the House might with perfect\r\nconsistency refuse to adjourn at midnight and yet might be quite\r\nwilling to adjourn at four o'clock in the morning.  On the amendment of\r\nMr. Robinson his friends Brown and Jones are of course entitled to\r\nspeak, and so are all their colleagues in the previous discussions, and\r\nwhen this amendment too is defeated, then Mr. Smith, yet another Tory\r\nmember, rises in his place, as the familiar Parliamentary phrase goes,\r\nand moves that this debate be now adjourned.  This is really a fair\r\nsummary of the events which took place in the House of Commons on this\r\nfirst grand opportunity of obstruction, the motion to enable the House\r\nto get into committee on the details of the Reform Bill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1831--The Reform Bill in committee]\r\n\r\nIt was half-past seven in the morning when the out-wearied House\r\nconsented to adjourn, and the story was told, at the time, that when\r\nSir Charles Wetherell was leaving Westminster Hall with some of his\r\nTory colleagues he observed that a heavy rain was pouring down, and he\r\ndeclared with a vigorous oath that if he had known of that in time he\r\nwould have treated the Government to a few more divisions before giving\r\nthem a chance of getting to their homes.  The Bill, however, did get\r\ninto committee at last, and then the work of obstruction began again\r\nand was carried on after the most systematic fashion.  In committee the\r\nopportunities were ample, for the case of each constituency which it\r\nwas proposed to disfranchise, or each constituency the number of whose\r\nmembers it was proposed to lessen, had to be discussed separately, and,\r\nof course, gave rise to an unlimited number of speeches.  A committee\r\nwas actually formed to prepare, organize, and apply the methods of\r\nobstruction, and of this committee no less a person than Sir Robert\r\nPeel, then one of England's most rising statesmen, afterwards to be one\r\nof her greatest statesmen, was the president.  Sir Robert Peel was\r\nhimself one of the most frequent speakers in the obstructive debates,\r\nand among his rivals were Sir Charles Wetherell and Mr. John Wilson\r\nCroker, a man who has {164} been consigned to a sort of immortality by\r\na famous essay of Macaulay's and by Disraeli's satirical picture of him\r\nas Mr. Rigby in \"Coningsby.\"  The committee of Tory members which has\r\nbeen already mentioned arranged carefully, in advance, the obstruction\r\nthat was to be carried on in the case of each particular constituency,\r\nand planned out in advance how each discussion was to be conducted and\r\nwho were to take the leading parts in it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1831--Determination to pass the Bill]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile popular feeling was rising more and more strongly as each day\r\nof debate dragged on.  Some of the largest constituencies were most\r\nactive and energetic in their appeals to the Government to hold out to\r\nthe very last and not yield an inch to the obstructionists.  A fear\r\nbegan to spread abroad that Lord Grey and his colleagues might endeavor\r\nto save some of the main provisions of their Bill by surrendering other\r\nparts of it to the Opposition.  This alarm found expression in the cry\r\nwhich soon began to be heard all over the country, and became in fact\r\nthe battle-cry of Reformers everywhere--the Bill, the whole Bill, and\r\nnothing but the Bill.  Great public meetings were held in all parts for\r\nthe purpose of urging the Government to make no concessions to the\r\npolitical enemy.  During the summer a meeting of the most influential\r\nsupporters of the Government was held in the Foreign Office, and at\r\nthat meeting Lord Althorp, Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced that\r\nLord Grey and his colleagues were perfectly determined not to give way,\r\nand he declared that the Government were resolved to keep the House of\r\nCommons sitting until December, or, if necessary, until the following\r\nDecember, in order to pass the Bill before the rising of the House for\r\nits recess.  Naturally this firm declaration had some effect on the\r\nobstructionists, especially on the rank and file of the\r\nobstructionists.  Nothing discourages and disheartens obstruction so\r\nmuch, in the House of Commons, as a resolute announcement on the part\r\nof the Ministry that the House is to be kept together until the measure\r\nunder debate, whatever it may be, is disposed of.  It is a hard task,\r\nat any time, to keep the House of Commons together after the regular\r\nseason for its {165} holiday has come on; and if the rank and file of\r\nOpposition can once be brought to believe that a certain measure is to\r\nbe passed no matter what number of weeks or months it may occupy, the\r\nrank and file is very apt to make up its mind that there is no use in\r\nthrowing good months after bad, and that it might be as well to get the\r\nthing done, since it has to be done, without unlimited sacrifice of\r\npersonal comfort.  Still, the leaders of the Tory Opposition were not\r\ndeterred by Lord Althorp's proclamation from maintaining their work of\r\nobstruction for some time yet.  The impatience and anger of the country\r\nrose higher and higher.  A reforming member of the House was in an\r\nunlucky plight indeed if he happened to be caught by one of the\r\namendments proposed from the benches of Opposition and, believing that\r\nit had something reasonable in it, allowed his too sensitive conscience\r\nto persuade him into supporting it by his vote.  Into such a plight\r\nfell a worthy alderman of the City of London--who had been sent into\r\nthe House of Commons as a Radical reformer.  This well-meaning person\r\nhad permitted himself to become satisfied that there was something to\r\nbe said for one of the Opposition amendments, and in a moment of rash\r\ningenuousness he voted for it.  He was immediately afterwards formally\r\ncensured by his constituents and by the body to which he officially\r\nbelonged.  He was informed by solemn resolutions that he had been sent\r\ninto the House of Commons to help the Government in passing the Reform\r\nBill, and it was more or less plainly intimated to him that he had no\r\nmore right to the exercise of his independent opinion on any of the\r\ndetails of the measure than a private soldier on a battle-field would\r\nhave to exercise his individual judgment as to the propriety of obeying\r\nor disobeying the order of his commanding officer.  The poor man had to\r\nmake the most fervid assurances that he had meant no harm in voting for\r\nthe Opposition amendment, that he was thoroughly devoted to the cause\r\nof reform, and to the particular measure then before the House of\r\nCommons, and that never again was he to be induced by any arguments to\r\ngive a vote against the Government on any {166} section or sentence or\r\nline of Lord John Russell's Bill.  Then, and not until then, he was\r\ntaken back into favor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1831--The Reform Bill passes the Commons]\r\n\r\nThe Bill, however, did get through committee at last.  The Government\r\ncontrived by determined resistance and untiring patience to get their\r\nscheme of reform out of committee in substantially the condition they\r\nwished it to have.  Then came the third reading.  It was confidently\r\nassumed on both sides of the House that there would be a long debate on\r\nthe motion that the Bill be now read a third time.  In the House of\r\nCommons, however, it often happens that the assumption of a forthcoming\r\ndebate as a certainty is itself the one cause which prevents the\r\ndebates from being long.  So it happened on this important occasion.\r\nEvery Tory took it for granted that his brother Tories would keep the\r\ndebate going for an indefinite time, and in this fond faith a good many\r\nTories felt themselves in no hurry to get to the House, and were\r\nwilling to leave the first hour or two at the disposal of their\r\ncolleagues.  When the sitting began, and, indeed, when the motion for\r\nthe third reading came on, there were comparatively few Tories in the\r\nHouse, and the great leaders of Opposition were not present.  There was\r\nconfusion in the ranks of the Tories, and the crowded benches of the\r\nReformers thundered with clamorous shouts of \"Divide!  Divide!\"  Now,\r\nit takes a very heroic orator indeed to continue declaiming for a long\r\ntime when a great majority of the members present are bellowing at him\r\nand are drowning, by their united voices, the sounds of the words which\r\nhe is trying to articulate.  The members of Opposition in the House\r\nfound this fact brought home to them, and, being further bewildered by\r\nthe fortuitous absence of their leaders, soon gave up the struggle, and\r\nthe debate collapsed, and the third reading was carried by a large\r\nmajority before Sir Robert Peel, Sir Charles Wetherell, and others came\r\nin leisurely fashion into the House, filled with the assumption that\r\nthere would be ample opportunity for them to carry on the debate.  Even\r\nyet, however, all was not over.  According to the procedure of the\r\nHouse, it was not enough that the motion for the third reading of the\r\n{167} Bill should be carried.  It was still necessary to propose the\r\nmotion that the Bill do now pass.  The moment this motion was proposed\r\nthe torrent of opposition, frozen up for a too-short interval, began to\r\nflow again in full volume.  The nature of the formal motion gave\r\nopportunity for renewed attacks on the whole purpose of the Bill, and\r\nall the old, familiar, outworn arguments were repeated by orator after\r\norator from the Tory benches.  But this, too, had to come to an end.\r\nThe House was no longer in committee, and each member could only speak\r\nonce on this final motion.  Of course, there could be motions for\r\nadjournment, and on each such motion, put as an amendment, there would\r\nbe opportunity for a fresh debate; but the leaders of the Opposition\r\nwere beginning to see that there was nothing of much account to be done\r\nany longer in the House of Commons, and that their hopes of resisting\r\nthe progress of reform must turn to the House of Lords.  So the Reform\r\nBill passed at last through the House of Commons, and then all over the\r\ncountry was raised the cry, \"What will the Lords do with it?\"\r\n\r\nSoon the temper of the more advanced Reformers throughout the country\r\nbegan to change its tone, and the question eagerly put was not so often\r\nwhat will the Lords do with the Bill? but what shall we do with the\r\nHouse of Lords?  At every great popular meeting held throughout the\r\nconstituencies an outcry was raised against the House of Lords as a\r\npart of the constitutional system, and no speaker was more welcome on a\r\npublic platform than the orator who called for the abolition of the\r\nhereditary principle in the formation of legislators.  One might have\r\nthought that the agitation which broke out all over the country, and\r\nthe manner in which almost all Reformers seemed to have taken it for\r\ngranted that the hereditary Chamber must be the enemy of all reform,\r\nmight have put the peers on their guard and taught them the unwisdom of\r\naccepting the imputation against them, and thus proving that they had\r\nno sympathy with the cause of the people.  But the great majority of\r\nthe Tory peers of that day had not yet risen to the idea that there\r\ncould be any {168} wisdom in any demand made by men who had no\r\nuniversity education, who had not what was then described as a stake in\r\nthe country.  The voice of the people was simply regarded as the voice\r\nof the rabble, and the Tory peers had no notion of allowing themselves\r\nto be guided by any appeal coming from such a quarter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1831--The Reform Bill in the Lords]\r\n\r\nThe agitation of which we are speaking had been going on during the\r\nlong reign of obstruction in the Commons, and there was no time lost by\r\nthe Government between the passing of the Bill in the representative\r\nChamber and its introduction in the House of Lords.  On the evening of\r\nthe day when the Bill was passed by the Commons, September 23, 1831, it\r\nwas formally brought into the House of Lords and read a first time.  It\r\nhas already been explained that, according to Parliamentary usage, the\r\nfirst reading of any Bill is taken in the House of Lords as a matter of\r\nright and without a division.  The second reading of the Bill was taken\r\non October 3.  Lord Grey, who had charge of the measure in that House,\r\ndelivered one of the most impressive and commanding speeches which had\r\never come from his eloquent lips, not merely in recommendation of the\r\nmeasure itself, but in solemn warning to the peers in general, and to\r\nthe bishops and archbishops in particular, to pause and consider\r\ncarefully all the possible consequences before committing themselves to\r\nthe rejection of a demand which was made by the vast majority of the\r\nEnglish people.\r\n\r\nLord Grey was a noble illustration of what may be described as the\r\nstately order of Parliamentary eloquence.  He had not the fire and the\r\npassion of Fox; he had not the thrilling genius of Pitt; and, of\r\ncourse, his style of speech had none of the passionate and sometimes\r\nthe extravagant declamation of which Brougham was a leading master.  He\r\nhad a dignified presence, a calm, clear, and penetrating voice, a style\r\nthat was always exquisitely finished and nobly adapted to its purpose.\r\nIt would not be too much to say for Earl Grey that he might have been\r\nthe ideal orator for an ideal House of Lords, if we assume the ideal\r\nHouse of Lords to be an assembly in which appeal {169} was always made\r\nto high principle, to reason, and to justice, not to passion, to\r\nprejudice, or to party.  Lord Grey, so far as we can judge from\r\ncontemporary accounts, never spoke better than in the debate on the\r\nsecond reading of the Reform Bill, and it was evident that he spoke\r\nwith all the sincere emotion of one whose mind and heart alike were\r\nfilled with the cause for which he pleaded.  But the House of Lords\r\njust then was not in a mood to be swayed greatly by argument or by\r\neloquence.  Lord Wharncliffe moved an amendment to the effect that the\r\nBill be read a second time this day six months.  This, at least, was\r\nthe shape that the motion took after some discussion, because Lord\r\nWharncliffe, in the first instance, had concluded his speech against\r\nthe second reading by the blunt motion that the Bill be rejected; and\r\nit was only when it had been pressed upon his attention that such a\r\nmethod of disposing of the measure would be a downright insult to the\r\nCommons that he consented to modify his proposal into the formal and\r\nfamiliar amendment that the Bill be read a second time this day six\r\nmonths.  The effect would be just the same in either case, for no\r\nMinistry would think of retaining office if the discussion of its most\r\nimportant measure were postponed in the House of Lords for a period of\r\nsix months.  During the debate which followed, the Duke of Wellington\r\nspoke strongly against the Bill.  On the morning of October 8 the\r\ndivision was taken.  There were 199 votes for the amendment and 158\r\nagainst it, or, in other words, for the second reading of the Bill.\r\nThe second reading was therefore rejected by a majority of 41.  The\r\nwhole work of legislation during all the previous part of the year had\r\nthus been reduced to nothing, and the House of Lords had shown what it\r\nwould do with the Bill by contemptuously rejecting it, and thus bidding\r\ndefiance to the demand unquestionably made by the vast majority of the\r\npeople of England, Scotland, and Ireland.\r\n\r\nParliament was at once prorogued, and the members who were in favor of\r\nreform hurried off to address great meetings of their constituents, and\r\nto denounce the action of the House of Lords.  Popular enthusiasm was\r\naroused {170} more than ever in favor of the Reform Bill, and popular\r\npassion was stirred in many places to positive fury against the\r\nprincipal opponents of the Bill.  In London several public men who were\r\nconspicuous for their opposition to the Bill were surrounded in their\r\ncarriages as they drove through the streets by suddenly collected\r\ncrowds, who hooted and hissed them, and would have gone much further\r\nthan hooting and hissing in their way of expressing condemnation but\r\nfor the energetic intervention of the newly created police force.  In\r\nsome of the provincial towns, and here and there throughout the\r\ncountry, the most serious riots broke out.  In Derby there were\r\ndisturbances which lasted for several days, and consisted of attacks on\r\nunpopular persons and of fierce fights with the police.  Nottingham was\r\nthe centre of rioting even more serious.  Nottingham Castle, the seat\r\nof the Duke of Newcastle, was attacked by a furious mob and actually\r\nburned to the ground.  In the immediate neighborhood was the estate of\r\nMr. Musters, which was invaded by an excited mob.  The dwelling-house\r\nwas set on fire, and, although the conflagration was not allowed to\r\nspread far, yet it ended in a tragedy which must always have a peculiar\r\ninterest for the lovers of poetry and romance.  The wife of Mr. Musters\r\nwas the Mary Chaworth made famous by Lord Byron in his poem of the\r\n\"Dream,\" and other poems as well--the Mary Chaworth who was his first\r\nlove, and whom, at one time, he believed destined to be his last love\r\nalso.  Mary Chaworth does not seem to have taken the poet's adoration\r\nvery seriously--at all events, she married Mr. Musters, a country\r\ngentleman of good position.  Mrs. Musters was in her house on the night\r\nwhen it was attacked by the mob, and when the fire broke out she fled\r\ninto the open park and sought shelter there among the trees.  The mob\r\nwas dispersed and Mrs. Musters, after a while, was able to return to\r\nher home; but she was in somewhat delicate health, the exposure to the\r\ncold night air of winter proved too much for her, and she became one of\r\nthe most innocent victims to the popular passion aroused by the\r\nopposition to the Reform Bill.\r\n\r\n{171}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1831--The Reform riots]\r\n\r\nBristol was the scene of the most formidable riots during all that\r\nperiod of disturbance.  Sir Charles Wetherell, who had made himself\r\nconspicuous as an opponent of reform, was the Recorder as well as the\r\nrepresentative of Bristol, and his return to the city after the Lords\r\nhad thrown out the Bill became the signal for an outbreak of popular\r\nfury.  Houses were wrecked in various parts of the city; street fights\r\ntook place between the mob and the military, day after day; the Mansion\r\nHouse, where Sir Charles Wetherell was supposed to have taken refuge,\r\nwas besieged, attacked, and almost demolished, and Sir Charles\r\nWetherell himself was rescued, more than once, with the utmost\r\ndifficulty from hostile crowds who seemed thirsting for his blood.  All\r\nthese riots were atoned for dearly soon after by some who had taken\r\npart in them.  The stroke of the law was heavy and sharp in those days,\r\nand many of the rioters in Derby, Nottingham, and Bristol, and other\r\nplaces expiated on the scaffold their offences against peace and order.\r\nSome of the cathedral cities became scenes of especial disturbance\r\nbecause of the part so many of the prelates who were members of the\r\nHouse of Lords had taken against the Reform Bill.  The direct appeal\r\nwhich Earl Grey had made to the archbishops and bishops in the House of\r\nLords to think long and well before opposing the Reform Bill was\r\ndelivered with the highest and sincerest motive, with the desire that\r\nthe Church should keep itself in harmony with the people; but the mere\r\nfact that the appeal was made, and made in vain, seems to have aroused\r\nin many parts of the country, and especially in the cathedral cities, a\r\nstronger conviction than ever that the prelates were, for the most\r\npart, the enemies of popular rights.  Then, again, there was a more or\r\nless general impression that the King himself, in his heart, was not in\r\nfavor of reform and would be glad to get rid of it if he could.  Daniel\r\nO'Connell, addressing a great popular meeting at Charing Cross in\r\nLondon, pointed with his outstretched right arm towards Whitehall, and\r\nawakened a tremendous outburst of applause from the vast crowd by\r\ntelling them that it was there Charles I. had lost his head {172}\r\nbecause he had submitted to the dictation of his foreign wife.  There\r\nwas a popular belief at the time that Queen Adelaide, the wife of King\r\nWilliam, cherished a strong hatred against reform such as Lord Grey and\r\nhis colleagues were pressing on, and that she was secretly influencing\r\nthe mind of her husband her own way, and so it was that O'Connell's\r\nallusion got home to the feelings and the passions of the multitude who\r\nlistened to his words.  Never, in the nineteenth century, had England\r\ngone through such a period of internal storm.  All over the Continent\r\nobservers were beginning to ask themselves whether the monarchy in\r\nEngland was not on the verge of such a crisis as had just overtaken the\r\nmonarchy in France.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1832--The third Reform Bill]\r\n\r\nLord Grey and his ministers still, however, held firmly to their\r\npurpose, and the King, much as he may have disliked the whole reform\r\nbusiness, and gladly as he would have got rid of it, if it were to be\r\ngot rid of by any possible means, had still wit enough to see that if\r\nhe were to give his support to the House of Lords something even more\r\nthan the House of Lords might be in danger.  Parliament was therefore\r\ncalled together again in December, and the Royal Speech from the Throne\r\ncommended to both Houses the urgent necessity of passing into law as\r\nquickly as possible the ministerial measure of reform.  Lord John\r\nRussell brought in his third Reform Bill for England and Wales, a Bill\r\nthat was, in purpose and in substance, much the same as the two\r\nmeasures that had preceded it, and this third Reform Bill passed by\r\nslow degrees through its several stages in the House of Commons.  Then\r\nagain came up the portentous question, \"What will the Lords do with\r\nit?\"  There could not be the least doubt in the mind of anybody as to\r\nwhat the majority of the House of Lords would be glad to do with the\r\nBill if they only felt sure that they could work their will upon it\r\nwithout danger to their own order.  There, however, the serious\r\ndifficulty arose.  The more reasonable among the peers did not attempt\r\nto disguise from themselves that another rejection of the Bill might\r\nlead to the most serious disturbances, and even possibly to civil war,\r\nand they were not {173} prepared to indulge their hostility to reform\r\nat so reckless an expense.  The greater number of the Tory peers,\r\nhowever, acted on the assumption, familiar at all times among certain\r\nparties of politicians, that the more loudly people demanded a reform\r\nthe more resolutely the reform ought to be withheld from them, and\r\nthat, if the people attempted to rise up, the only proper policy was to\r\nput the people down by force.  The opinions and sentiments of the less\r\nheadlong among the Conservative peers had led to the formation of a\r\nparty, more or less loosely put together, who were called at that time\r\nthe \"Waverers,\" just as a political combination of an earlier day\r\nobtained the title of the \"Trimmers.\"  The Waverers were made up of the\r\nmen who held that their best and most patriotic policy was to regard\r\neach portion of the Bill brought before them on its own merits, and not\r\nto resist out of hand any proposition which seemed harmless in itself\r\nsimply because it formed part of the whole odious policy of reform.\r\nKing William is believed, at one time, to have set hopes on the efforts\r\nof the Waverers, and to have cherished a gladsome belief that they\r\nmight get him out of his difficulties about the Reform Bill; as indeed\r\nit will be seen they did in the end, though not quite in the way which\r\nhe would have desired.\r\n\r\nLord Grey introduced the third Reform Bill on March 27, 1832.  The\r\nfirst reading passed, as a matter of course, but when the division on\r\nthe motion for the second reading came on on April 14, there was only a\r\nmajority of 9 votes for the Bill: 184 peers voted for it and 175\r\nagainst it.  Of course Lord Grey and his colleagues saw, at once, that\r\nunless the conditions were to be completely altered there would be no\r\nchance whatever in the House of Lords for a measure of reform which had\r\npassed its second reading by a majority of only 9.  The moment the Bill\r\ngot into committee there would be endless opportunities afforded for\r\nits mutilation, and if it were to get through the House at all, it\r\nwould be only in such a form as to render it wholly useless for the\r\nobjects which its promoters desired it to accomplish.  This dismal\r\nconviction was very speedily {174} verified.  When the Bill got into\r\ncommittee, Lord Lyndhurst moved an amendment to the effect that the\r\nquestion of enfranchisement should precede that of disfranchisement.\r\nNow this proposal was not in itself one necessarily hostile to the\r\nprinciple of the Bill.  It is quite easy to understand that a sincere\r\nfriend to reform might have, under certain conditions, adopted the\r\nviews that Lord Lyndhurst professed to advocate.  But the Ministry knew\r\nvery well that the adoption of such a proposal would mean simply that\r\nthe whole conduct of the measure was to be taken out of their hands and\r\nput into unfriendly hands--in other words, that it would be utterly\r\nfutile to go any further with the measure if the hostile majority were\r\nthus allowed to deal with it according to their own designs and their\r\nown class interest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1832--The Peers and the third Reform Bill]\r\n\r\nLord Lyndhurst was a man of great ability, eloquence, and astuteness.\r\nHe was one of the comparatively few men in our modern history who have\r\nmade a mark in the Law Courts and in Parliament.  As a Parliamentary\r\norator he was the rival of Brougham, and the rivalry was all the more\r\nexciting to the observers because it was a rivalry of styles as well as\r\nof capacities.  Lyndhurst was always polished, smooth, refined, endowed\r\nwith a gift of argumentative eloquence, which appealed to the intellect\r\nrather than to the feelings, was seldom impassioned, and even when\r\nimpassioned kept his passion well within conventional bounds.  Brougham\r\nwas thrilling, impetuous, overwhelming, often extravagant, scorning\r\nconventionality of phrase or manner, revelling in his own exuberant\r\nstrength and plunging at opponents as a bull might do in a Spanish\r\narena.  Lyndhurst's amendment was one especially suited to bring to his\r\nside the majority of the Waverers.  It was plausible enough in itself,\r\nand gave to many a Waverer, who must have had in his mind a very clear\r\nperception of its real object, some excuse for persuading himself that,\r\nin voting for it, he was not voting against the principle of reform.\r\nWhen the division came to be taken on May 7, 151 peers voted for the\r\namendment and 116 against it, thus showing a majority of 35 against\r\n{175} the Government, by whom of course the amendment had been\r\nunreservedly opposed.\r\n\r\nThe country saw that a new crisis had come, and a crisis more serious\r\nthan any which had gone before.  There was only one constitutional\r\ncourse by which the difficulty could be got over, and that was by the\r\nKing giving his consent to the creation of a number of new peers large\r\nenough to carry the Reform Bill through all its subsequent stages in\r\nthe House of Lords.  Other outlet of safety through peaceful means\r\nthere was none.  Lord Grey's Ministry could not possibly remain in\r\noffice and see the measure, on which they believed the peace and\r\nprosperity of the country to depend, left at the mercy of an\r\nirresponsible majority of Tory peers.  The King was most unwilling to\r\nhelp his ministers out of the trouble, especially by such a process as\r\nthey had suggested, and in his heart would have been very glad to be\r\nrid of them and the Reform Bill at the same time.  Charles Greville in\r\nhis Memoirs makes several allusions to the King's well-known dislike\r\nfor the Whig ministers and his anxiety to get the Duke of Wellington\r\nback again.  Lord Grey and his colleagues, finding it hard to get the\r\nKing to recognize the gravity of the situation, and to adopt the advice\r\nthey had offered to him, felt that there was nothing left for them but\r\nto resign office.  And the King was delighted to have a chance of\r\nrecalling the Duke of Wellington to the position of Prime Minister.\r\nUnder the date of May 17, 1832, Greville has some notes which well\r\ndeserve quotation: \"The joy of the King at what he thought to be his\r\ndeliverance from the Whigs was unbounded.  He lost no time in putting\r\nthe Duke of Wellington in possession of everything which had taken\r\nplace between him and them upon the subject of reform and with regard\r\nto the creation of peers, admitting that he had consented, but saying\r\nhe had been subjected to every species of persecution.  His ignorance\r\nand levity put him in a miserable light and proved him to be one of the\r\nsilliest old gentlemen in his dominions.\"  Greville goes on to say:\r\n\"But I believe he is mad, for yesterday he gave a dinner to the Jockey\r\nClub, {176} at which, notwithstanding his cares, he seemed to be in\r\nexcellent spirits, and after dinner he made a number of speeches so\r\nridiculous and nonsensical beyond all belief but to those who heard\r\nthem, rambling from one subject to another, repeating the same thing\r\nover and over again, and altogether such a mass of confusion, trash,\r\nand imbecility, as made one laugh and blush at the same time.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1832--The King seeks a Prime Minister]\r\n\r\nThe poor muddled-headed old King in fact could not understand that the\r\nquestion submitted to him allowed of no middle course of compromise.\r\nHe seemed to think he had gone far enough in the way of conciliation\r\nwhen he offered to allow his ministers to create a certain number of\r\npeers.  No concession, however, could be of the slightest use to the\r\nMinistry unless the power were conceded to them to create as many new\r\npeers as might be necessary to overbear all opposition to the Reform\r\nBill.  The struggle was in fact between the existing House of Lords and\r\nthe vast majority of the nation.  One or other must conquer.  The only\r\nconstitutional way in which the existing opposition of the House of\r\nLords could be overborne was by the creation of a number of new peers\r\ngreat enough to turn the majority of the House of Lords into a minority.\r\n\r\nLord Grey and Lord Althorp were not, it is hardly necessary to say, men\r\nwho shared in the popular sentiment, which would, if it could, have\r\nabolished altogether the hereditary principle in legislation.  But Lord\r\nGrey and Lord Althorp read the signs of the times, and saw clearly\r\nenough that if the House of Lords were allowed to stand much longer in\r\nthe way of the Reform Bill the result would be probably a political\r\nrevolution which would abolish the House of Lords altogether.\r\nTherefore the ministers could make no terms with the King short of\r\nthose which they had offered, and as the King did not see his way to\r\naccept their conditions there was nothing left for them but to resign\r\noffice.  Accordingly Lord Grey tendered his resignation and that of his\r\ncolleagues, and the King, after much indecision and mental flurry,\r\nthought he could do nothing better than to accept the resignation, and\r\ntry to find a set of ministers more suitable to his {177} inclinations.\r\nHe sent for Lord Lyndhurst and entered into conversation with that\r\nastute lawyer and politician, and Lord Lyndhurst advised him to send\r\nfor the Duke of Wellington.  The Duke was sent for, but the Duke had\r\nnot much to say which could lend any help to the King in his\r\ndifficulties.  Wellington saw distinctly enough that there was no\r\nalternative but that which lay in the choice between reform and some\r\nsort of popular revolution.  We have seen already in these volumes how\r\nWellington preferred to accept Catholic Emancipation rather than take\r\nthe risk of plunging the country into civil war.  In the case of the\r\nReform Bill he would have acted, no doubt, upon the same principle if\r\ndriven to the choice, but after the repeated and energetic\r\ndenunciations of reform which he had delivered in the House of Lords he\r\ndid not think that it would be a fitting part for him, even for the\r\nsake of helping the sovereign out of his constitutional trouble, to be\r\nthe Prime Minister by whom any manner of Reform Bill should be\r\nintroduced.  Wellington therefore strongly urged the King to send for\r\nSir Robert Peel, and declared that he himself would lend all the\r\nsupport he possibly could to a Peel Administration.  Peel was sent for\r\naccordingly, but Peel was too far-seeing a statesman to believe that he\r\ncould possibly hold office for many weeks unless he yielded to the full\r\ndemands of the country, and his political principles would not have\r\nallowed him to go so far as that.  He did his best to make it clear to\r\nthe King that no administration but a reform administration could\r\nstand, and that, if a reform administration had to be accepted, there\r\nwas nothing better to be done than to invite Lord Grey and Lord John\r\nRussell back again to office.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the country was aroused to a fervor of enthusiasm in favor of\r\nreform, which seemed only to increase with every delay and to grow\r\nstronger with every opposition.  Public meetings were held in\r\nBirmingham of larger size than had ever been gathered together in\r\nEngland before, and resolutions were passed by acclamation which were\r\nalmost revolutionary in their character.  In many cities and towns\r\nappeals were made for a run on the {178} bank, a run for gold, and\r\nthere were alarming signs that the advice was likely to be followed to\r\nsuch a degree as to bring about utter confusion in the money market.\r\nIn the City of London an immense meeting was held, at which resolutions\r\nwere passed calling on the House of Commons to stop the supplies unless\r\nthe King accepted the councils of the Whig statesmen and gave them\r\nauthority for the election of new peers.  The overwhelming strength of\r\nthe demand for reform may be easily estimated when it is remembered\r\nthat the majority in the great cities and towns, and also in the\r\ncounties, were for once of the same opinion.  In more than one great\r\npolitical controversy of modern times, as in the free-trade agitation\r\nfor example, it has happened that the town population were of one\r\nopinion and the county population of another.  But at the time which we\r\nare now describing the great cities and towns were all nearly\r\nunrepresented, and in their demand for representation they were of one\r\nmind and one spirit with the county populations, which called out for a\r\nreal and not a sham representation.  There will probably always be a\r\nquestion of curious speculation and deep interest to the students of\r\nhistory as to the possibility of a great revolution in England if the\r\nKing had made up his mind to hold out against the advice of the Whig\r\nstatesmen and to try the last chance.  It is certain that the leading\r\nWhig nobles were considering, with profound earnestness, what course it\r\nmight be necessary for them to take if the King were absolutely to\r\nrefuse all concession and to stand by what he believed to be his\r\nsovereign right to set up his own authority as supreme.  If the choice\r\nshould be forced on them, would these Whig nobles stand by the\r\nobstinate King or throw in their lot with the people?  This grave\r\nquestion must have been considered again and again in all its bearings\r\nby the Whig leaders during that time of terrible national crisis.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1832--The Whig nobles and the military]\r\n\r\nIt would seem to be beyond all question that some, at least, of the\r\nWhig nobles were contemplating the possibility of their having to\r\nchoose between the King and the people, and that their minds were made\r\nup, should the worst come {179} to the worst, to side with the people.\r\nMany years afterwards, during the State trials at Clonmel which\r\nfollowed the Young Ireland rebellion of 1848, evidence was brought\r\nforward by the counsel for the defence of Mr. Smith O'Brien and his\r\nfellow-prisoners to prove that the Whig nobles during the reform crisis\r\nin England had been in communication with Sir Charles Napier, the great\r\nsoldier, for the purpose of ascertaining how the army would act if\r\nthere should come to be a struggle between the sovereign claiming\r\ndespotic rights and the people standing up for constitutional\r\ngovernment.  All this, however, is now merely a question of interesting\r\nhistorical speculation.  The King had tried Wellington, had tried Peel,\r\nhad sent for Wellington a second time, and found that Wellington,\r\nthough he dared do all that might become a man, saw nothing to be\r\ngained for sovereign or State by an attempt to accomplish the\r\nimpossible, and William at last gave way.  It was about time that he\r\ndid so.  William was becoming utterly unpopular with the great mass of\r\nhis subjects.  He who had been endowed with the title of the Patriot\r\nKing was now to be an object of hatred and contempt to the crowds in\r\nthe streets with whom from day to day he could not avoid being brought\r\ninto contact.  When his carriage appeared in one of the great London\r\nthoroughfares it was followed again and again by jeering and furious\r\nmobs, who hissed and groaned at him, and it was always necessary for\r\nhis protection that a strong escort of cavalry should interpose between\r\nhim and his subjects.  Even in the London newspapers of the day, those\r\nat least that were in favor of reform, and which constituted the large\r\nmajority, language was sometimes used about the King which it would be\r\nimpossible to use in our days about some unpopular Lord Mayor or member\r\nfor the City.\r\n\r\nAll this told heavily upon poor King William, who was a good-natured\r\nsort of man in his own way if his ministers and others would only let\r\nhim alone, and who rather fancied himself in the light of a popular\r\nsovereign.  He therefore made up his mind at last to accept the advice\r\n{180} of his Whig ministers and grant them the power of creating as\r\nmany new peers as they thought fit, for the purpose of passing their\r\nimportunate Reform Bill.  The consent was given at an interview which\r\nthe King had with Lord Grey and Lord Brougham, Lord Brougham as keeper\r\nof the royal conscience taking the principal conduct of the\r\nnegotiations on behalf of the Government.  The King, as usual on such\r\noccasions, was flurried, awkward, and hot-tempered, and when he had\r\nmade up his mind to yield to the advice of his ministers he could not\r\nso far master his temper as to make his decision seem a graceful\r\nconcession.  Even when he announced that the concession was to be made\r\nthe trouble was not yet quite over.  Lord Brougham thought it necessary\r\nto ask the King for his consent in writing to the creation of the new\r\npeers, and hereupon the wrath of the sovereign blazed out afresh.  The\r\nKing seemed to think that such a demand showed a want of confidence in\r\nhim which amounted to something like an insult, and he fretted and\r\nstormed for a while as though he had been like Petruchio \"aboard\r\ncarousing to his mates.\"  After a while, however, he came into a better\r\nhumor, and perhaps saw the reasonableness of the plea that Lord Grey\r\nand Lord Brougham could not undertake the task now confided to them\r\nwithout the written warrant of the King's authority.  William therefore\r\nturned away and scratched off at once a brief declaration conferring on\r\nhis ministers the power to create the necessary number of peers,\r\nqualifying it merely with the condition that the sons of living peers\r\nwere to be called upon in the first instance.  The meaning of this\r\ncondition was obvious, and its object was not unreasonable from the\r\nKing's point of view, or, indeed, from the point of view of any\r\nstatesman who was anxious that the House of Lords should be kept as\r\nlong as possible in its existing form.  Nobody certainly wanted to\r\nincrease the number of peers to any great extent, and if only the\r\neldest sons of the living peers were to be called to the House of Lords\r\neach would succeed in process of time to his father's title and the\r\nroll of the peerage would become once again as it had been before.\r\n\r\n{181}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1832--Passage of the third Reform Bill]\r\n\r\nThe political crisis was over now.  When once the royal authority had\r\nbeen given for the unlimited creation of new peers there was an end of\r\nall the trouble.  Of course, there was no necessity to manufacture any\r\nnew batches of peers.  As the Reform Bill was to be carried one way or\r\nthe other, whether with the aid of new peers or without it, the Tory\r\nmembers of the House of Lords could not see any possible advantage in\r\ntaking steps which must only end in filling their crimson benches with\r\nnew men who might outvote them on all future occasions.  The Reform\r\nBill passed through all its stages in the House of Lords, not without\r\nsome angry and vehement discussions, during which personal\r\nrecriminations were made that would have been considered disorderly at\r\nthe meeting of a parish vestry.  One noble lord denounced the conduct\r\nof Lord Grey as atrocious, and even the stately Lord Grey was roused to\r\nso much anger by this expression that he forgot his habitual\r\nself-control and dignity and replied that he flung back the noble\r\nlord's atrocious words with the utmost scorn and contempt.\r\n\r\nThe Bill passed its third reading in the House of Lords on June 4,\r\n1832, and received the royal assent on June 7.  The royal assent,\r\nhowever, was somewhat ungraciously given.  King William declined to\r\ngive his assent in person, a performance which, at the time, seemed to\r\nbe expected from him, and it was signified only by the medium of a\r\nformal committee.  The Bill, however, was passed, the third Reform Bill\r\nthat had been introduced since Lord Grey had come into office.  The\r\nReform Bills for Ireland and Scotland which had gone through their\r\nstages in the House of Commons immediately after the Bills relating to\r\nEngland and Wales were then carried through the House of Lords.  The\r\ngreat triumph was accomplished.\r\n\r\nIt is not without historical interest to notice the fact that a long\r\ndiscussion sprang up at this time and was revived again and again,\r\nduring many successive years, with regard to certain words used by Lord\r\nJohn Russell in expressing his satisfaction at the passing of the\r\nReform Bill.  He was endeavoring to calm the apprehensions of timid\r\n{182} people throughout the country who feared that the whole time of\r\nParliament would thenceforward be taken up with the passing of new and\r\nnewer Reform Bills, and he declared that the Government of which he was\r\na member had no intention but that the Reform Act should be a final\r\nmeasure.  It might have seemed clear to any reasonable mind that Lord\r\nJohn had no idea of proclaiming his faith in the absolute finality of\r\nany measure passed, or to be passed, by human statesmanship, but was\r\nmerely expressing the confident belief of his colleagues and himself\r\nthat the Bill they had passed would satisfy the needs and the demands\r\nof the existing generation.  At the time, however, a storm of\r\nremonstrance from the more advanced Liberals broke around Lord John\r\nRussell's head, and he was charged with having declared that the Reform\r\nAct was meant to be a measure for all times, and that he and his\r\ncolleagues would never more set their hands to any measure intended to\r\nbroaden or deepen its influence.  There were indeed popular caricatures\r\nof Lord John to be seen in which he was exhibited with the title of\r\n\"Finality Jack.\"  Lord John's public career proved many times, in later\r\ndays, how completely his meaning had been misunderstood by some of\r\nthose whose cause he had been espousing, for all through his honored\r\nlife he continued to be a leader of reform.  But the common\r\nmisunderstanding of the phrase was in itself significant, for it seemed\r\nto foretell the fact that the Bill, with all the great changes it had\r\nintroduced and the new foundations it had laid for the future system of\r\nconstitutional government, was in itself indeed far from being a final\r\nmeasure.  The authors of the Reform Bill had left what might now be\r\ncalled \"the masses\" almost altogether out of their calculations.  The\r\nrate at which the franchise was fixed for town and country rendered it\r\npractically impossible that the artisan in the town or the laborer in\r\nthe country could have any chance whatever of obtaining a vote.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1832--Some defects in the Reform Bill]\r\n\r\nThis was the one great defect of the Reform Bill introduced by Lord\r\nGrey and Lord John Russell.  Perhaps it would not have been prudent for\r\nthese statesmen, at that {183} time, to enter on the introduction of a\r\nmore comprehensive measure.  Perhaps Lord Grey and Lord John Russell\r\nwould have preferred of their own judgment not to introduce too\r\ncomprehensive a reform measure all at once, and to allow the franchise\r\nto broaden slowly down.  But it is certain that almost immediately\r\nafter the passing of the Reform Bill a profound feeling of\r\ndisappointment began to grow and spread among the classes who found\r\nthemselves excluded from any of its benefits, and who believed, with\r\ngood reason, that they had rendered much practical service in the\r\ncarrying of the measure.  The feeling prevailed especially among the\r\nartisans in the cities and towns.  In some of the towns the Reform Bill\r\nhad distinctly operated as a measure of disfranchisement rather than of\r\nenfranchisement.  In Preston, for instance, there had been so large a\r\nnumber of what we have called, adopting a more modern phrase, \"fancy\r\nfranchises\" that something not very far removed from universal suffrage\r\nwas attainable by the male population.  These fancy franchises could\r\nnot be justified on any principle commending itself to rational minds,\r\nand it was, moreover, an obvious absurdity to have one system of voting\r\nprevailing in this constituency and a totally different system\r\nprevailing in another.  Therefore Lord Grey and Lord John Russell\r\ncannot be censured for their resolve to abolish the fancy franchises\r\naltogether.  They were introducing an entirely new constitutional\r\nsystem, and it was evident that in the new system there must be some\r\nuniform principle as to the franchise.  But it is none the less certain\r\nthat the men who were disfranchised by an Act professedly brought in to\r\nextend the suffrage must have felt that they had good reason to\r\ncomplain of its direct effect upon themselves and upon what they\r\nbelieved to be their rights.  Nearly forty years of agitation had yet\r\nto be gone through before the principal deficiencies in the Reform Act\r\nof 1833 were supplied by Liberal and Tory legislation.\r\n\r\nBefore closing this chapter of history it is fitting to take notice of\r\nthe fact that the debates on the Reform Bill gave opportunity for the\r\npublic opening of a great career in {184} politics and in\r\nliterature--the career of Lord Macaulay.  [Sidenote: 1832--Thomas\r\nBabington Macaulay] Thomas Babington Macaulay was a new member of the\r\nHouse of Commons when the first Reform Bill was introduced by Lord John\r\nRussell.  He was the son of Zachary Macaulay, who was famous in his\r\nday, and will always be remembered as the high-minded philanthropist\r\nand the energetic and consistent opponent of slavery and the slave\r\ntrade.  Macaulay the son had, from his earliest years, given evidence\r\nof precocious and extraordinary intelligence and versatility.  When he\r\nentered Parliament he found that his fame had gone before him, but his\r\nfriends were not quite certain whether he was to be poet, essayist,\r\nhistorian, or political orator.  As years went on, he proved that he\r\ncould write brilliant and captivating poems; that he could turn out\r\nessays which had a greater fascination for the public than many of the\r\ncleverest novels; that he could write history which set critics\r\ndisputing, but which everybody had to read; and that he could deliver\r\npolitical speeches in the House of Commons which, when correctly\r\nreproduced from the newspapers, appeared to belong to the highest class\r\nof Parliamentary eloquence.  It may well be questioned whether any man\r\ncould possibly attain supreme success in the four fields in which, from\r\ntime to time, Macaulay appeared to be successful.  At present we are\r\nonly concerned with the speeches which he delivered in the House of\r\nCommons during the debates on the Reform Bills.  Macaulay's appearance\r\nwas not impressive, and he had a gift of fluency, a rapidity of\r\nutterance which continued, from first to last, to be a most serious\r\ndifficulty in the way of his success as a Parliamentary orator.  He\r\nappears to have committed his speeches to memory, and his memory was\r\none of the most amazing of all his gifts; and when he rose to deliver\r\nan oration he rattled it off at such a rate of speed that the sense\r\nached in trying to follow him, and the reporters for the newspapers\r\nfound it almost impossible to get a full note of what he said.  This\r\nwas all the more embarrassing because his speeches abounded in\r\nillustrations and citations from all manner of authorities, authors,\r\nand historical incidents, and the bewildered {185} reporter found\r\nhimself entangled in proper names which shorthand in the pre-phonetic\r\ndays could but slowly reproduce.  The speeches, when revised by the\r\nauthor, were read with intense delight by the educated public, and with\r\nall the defects of the orator's utterance he soon acquired such a fame\r\nin the House of Commons that no one ever attracted a more crowded and\r\neager audience than he did when it became known that he was about to\r\nmake a speech.  We may quote here a characteristic description given by\r\nGreville of his first meeting with Macaulay in the early February of\r\n1833, while the struggle over Lord Russell's third Reform Bill was\r\nstill going on.  \"Dined yesterday,\" says Greville, \"with Lord Holland;\r\ncame very late and found a vacant place between Sir George Robinson and\r\na common-looking man in black.  As soon as I had time to look at my\r\nneighbor, I began to speculate, as one usually does, as to who he might\r\nbe, and as he did not for some time open his lips except to eat, I\r\nsettled that he was some obscure man of letters, or of medicine,\r\nperhaps a cholera doctor.  In a short time the conversation turned on\r\nearly and late education, and Lord Holland said he had always remarked\r\nthat self-educated men were peculiarly conceited and arrogant, and apt\r\nto look down on the generality of mankind from their being ignorant of\r\nhow much other people knew; not having been at public schools, they are\r\nuninformed of the course of general education.  My neighbor observed\r\nthat he thought the most remarkable example of self-education that of\r\nAlfieri, who had reached the age of thirty without having acquired any\r\naccomplishment save that of driving, and who was so ignorant of his own\r\nlanguage that he had to learn it like a child, beginning with\r\nelementary books.  Lord Holland quoted Julius Caesar and Scaliger as\r\nexamples of late education, said that the latter had been wounded, and\r\nthat he had been married and commenced learning Greek the same day,\r\nwhen my neighbor remarked 'that he supposed his learning Greek was not\r\nan instantaneous act like his marriage.'  This remark and the manner of\r\nit gave me the notion that he was a dull fellow, for it came out in a\r\n{186} way which bordered on the ridiculous so as to excite something\r\nlike a sneer.  I was a little surprised to hear him continue the thread\r\nof conversation, from Scaliger's wound, and talk of Loyola having been\r\nwounded at Pampeluna.  I wondered how he happened to know anything\r\nabout Loyola's wound.  Having thus settled my opinion I went on eating\r\nmy dinner, when Auckland, who was sitting opposite to me, addressed my\r\nneighbor: 'Mr. Macaulay, will you drink a glass of wine?'  I thought I\r\nshould have dropped off my chair.  It was Macaulay, the man I had been\r\nso long most curious to see and to hear, whose genius, eloquence,\r\nastonishing knowledge, and diversified talents have excited my wonder\r\nand admiration for such a length of time, and here I had been sitting\r\nnext to him, hearing him talk, and setting him down for a dull fellow.\"\r\nWe are here only at the opening of Macaulay's great career.  Even at\r\nthis time the world seemed to have made up its mind that Macaulay had a\r\ngreat career before him.  At the present day, when more than forty\r\nyears have passed over his tomb in Westminster Abbey, it is a question\r\nstill keenly contested every now and then, whether Macaulay fully\r\nrealized or barely failed to realize the expectations which men were\r\nforming of him on that day when Charles Greville met him for the first\r\ntime, and was amazed to find, as the conversation went on, that he was\r\nsitting next to Macaulay.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1832--Death of Sir Walter Scott]\r\n\r\nThe year of the Reform Bill was marked by an event forever memorable in\r\nthe history of literature.  That event was the death of Sir Walter\r\nScott.  The later years of Scott's life, as we all know, had been\r\ndarkened by the failure of his publishers, by the money troubles in\r\nwhich that failure had involved him, by the exhausting efforts he had\r\nto make to force his wearied mind into redoubled literary exertion,\r\nand, more than all, by the loss of the wife who had been his devoted\r\ncompanion for so many years.  No words could be more sorrowful and more\r\ntouching in their simplicity than those in which Scott declared that\r\nafter his wife's death he never knew what to do with that large share\r\nof his thoughts which always, in other {187} days, used to be given to\r\nher.  He had gone out to Italy, obeying the advice of his friends, in\r\nthe hope of recovering his health under warmer skies than those of his\r\nnative land, but the effort was futile.  It was of no use his trying to\r\nshake off his malady of heart and body by a change of air.  He carried\r\nhis giant about with him, if we may apply to his condition the\r\nexpressive and melancholy words which Emerson used with a different\r\napplication.  Scott was little over sixty years of age when he died--a\r\ntime of life at which, according to our ideas of longevity at the\r\npresent day, we should regard a man as having hardly passed the zenith\r\nof his powers and his possibilities.  He had added a new chapter to a\r\nhistory of the world's literature.  He had opened a new school of\r\nromance which soon found brilliant pupils in all countries where\r\nromance could charm.  There have been many revolutions in literary\r\nrulership since his time, but Walter Scott has not been dethroned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{188}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE EMANCIPATION OF LABOR.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1832--The slave trade]\r\n\r\nThe statesmen who had carried the Reform Bill soon found that they had\r\ntaken upon themselves a vast responsibility.  They had accomplished so\r\ngreat a triumph that most men assumed them to be capable of any\r\ntriumph.  It has to be remembered that they had succeeded in\r\nestablishing one principle which, up to that time, had never been\r\nrecognized, the principle that a constitutional sovereign in these\r\ncountries cannot any longer set up his own authority and his own will\r\nin opposition to the advice of his ministers.  Up to the days of\r\nWilliam the Fourth, the ministers always had to give way to the\r\nsovereign at the last moment, if the sovereign insisted on maintaining\r\nhis dictatorial authority.  We have seen how one of the greatest of\r\nEnglish statesmen, the younger Pitt, had bowed his judgment and even\r\ncoerced into silence the remonstrances of his own heart and his own\r\nconscience, rather than dispute the authority of an obstinate and a\r\nstupid King.  Lord Grey and his colleagues had compelled their King to\r\nlisten to reason, and probably not even they knew at the time the full\r\nimportance of the constitutional principle which they had thus\r\nestablished.  In our own days, and under the rule of the first really\r\nconstitutional sovereign who ever reigned in these countries, we seem\r\nto have almost forgotten that there ever was a time when the occupant\r\nof the throne was understood to have a right to govern the people\r\naccording to royalty's own inclination or royalty's own notion of\r\nstatesmanship.  When the passing of the Reform Bill was yet the latest\r\nevent in history, the people of these countries commonly, and very\r\njustly, regarded this assertion of the right of a representative\r\nMinistry to exact support from {189} the sovereign as one of the\r\ngreatest triumphs accomplished by Lord Grey's Administration.  The\r\nnatural feeling therefore was to assume that the men who had done these\r\ngreat things could do greater things still, and from all parts of the\r\nrealm eyes were turned upon them, full of confidence in their desire\r\nand their capacity to accomplish new reforms in every department of our\r\nconstitutional and our social system.\r\n\r\nThe time was one especially favorable for such hopes and for such\r\nachievements.  A new era had opened on the civilized world.  New ideas\r\nwere coming up regarding the value and the validity of many of our\r\nconstitutional and social arrangements which had formerly been\r\nconsidered as inspired and sanctified forever by that mysterious\r\ninfluence, the wisdom of our ancestors.  If education had not yet made\r\nmuch way among the masses of the people, at least the belief in popular\r\neducation was becoming a quickening force in the minds of all\r\nintelligent men.  Then, as ever since, the agitation for each great new\r\nreform began outside the walls of Parliament, and had to take an\r\norganized shape before it became a question for the House of Commons.\r\nThe first great work to which the reformed Parliament applied itself,\r\nafter the conditions of Lord Grey's Act had been allowed to take effect\r\nin remoulding the constituencies, was the abolition of negro slavery in\r\nthe colonies of Great Britain.  Domestic slavery and the slave trade\r\nhad already been abolished, but in the minds of a great number of\r\nwell-meaning, well-informed, and by no means hard-hearted men slavery\r\nin our colonies was a very different sort of institution from slavery\r\nin our own islands, or from the actual trade in slaves.  The ordinary\r\nEnglishman, when he troubled himself to consider such questions at all,\r\nhad settled it in his own mind that slavery in England, or in any part\r\nof the British Isles, was incompatible with the free constitution of\r\nthe realm, and that the forcible abduction of men and women from\r\nAfrican sea-shores in order to sell them into slavery was an offence\r\nagainst civilization and Christianity.  But this average Englishman did\r\nnot see that there was anything like the same {190} reason for\r\ninterfering with the system of slave labor as we had found it\r\nestablished, for instance, in our West Indian colonies.  \"We did not\r\nintroduce the system there,\" it was argued; \"we found it established\r\nthere; we inherited it; and its continuance is declared, by all those\r\nwho know, to be absolutely essential to the production of the sugar\r\nwhich is the source of profit and the means of living to the islands\r\nthemselves, and an indispensable comfort, a harmless and healthful\r\nluxury, to millions of civilized beings who never stood under a\r\ntropical sky.\"  The mind of the average Englishman, however, had been,\r\nfor some time, much disturbed by the arguments, the pleadings, and the\r\nagitation of a small number of enlightened Reformers, at first much in\r\nadvance of their time, who were making a pertinacious crusade against\r\nthe whole system of colonial slavery.  Some of these men have won names\r\nwhich will always be honored in our history.  Zachary Macaulay was one\r\nof these.  He was the father of the Macaulay whom we have just heard of\r\nas seated side by side with Charles Greville at Lord Holland's\r\ndinner-table.  Zachary Macaulay had been the manager of a great West\r\nIndian estate, but he had given up the position because his conscience\r\nwould not allow him to have anything to do with the system of slavery,\r\nand he had come home to devote his time, his abilities, and his\r\nearnestness to the generous task of rousing up his countrymen to a full\r\nsense of the horrors which were inseparable from the system.  He was\r\nable to supply men like Brougham, like Fowell Buxton, and like\r\nWhitbread with practical facts beyond dispute to establish the\r\nrealities of slavery in the West Indian colonies.  Among the more\r\nobvious, although not perhaps even the most odious, accompaniments of\r\nthe system were the frightful cruelties practised on the slaves, the\r\nflogging, the mutilation, and the branding of men, women, and children\r\nwhich formed part of the ordinary conditions of a plantation worked by\r\nslave labor.  Over and over again it had been denied by men who\r\nprofessed to know all about the subject and to be authorities upon it\r\nthat any such cruelties were practised on a well-regulated plantation\r\nbelonging to a {191} civilized owner.  It was constantly argued, with\r\nself-complacency, that the planter's own interests would not allow him\r\nthus to mar the efficiency of the human animals who had to do his work,\r\nand that even if the planter had no pity for them, he was sure to have\r\na wholesome and restraining consideration for the physical value of his\r\nown living property.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1832--The horrors of the slave trade]\r\n\r\nZachary Macaulay and the Buxtons, the Wilberforces and the Whitbreads,\r\nwere able to give innumerable and overwhelming proofs that the system\r\nevery day was working such evils as any system might be expected to\r\nwork which left one set of human beings absolutely at the mercy of\r\nanother set of human beings.  Many years after this great controversy\r\nhad won its complete success for the English colonies, a chief justice\r\nof the Supreme Court of the United States laid it down as law that a\r\nslave had no rights which his owner was bound to respect.  Up to the\r\ntime of which we are now writing, it was certainly assumed, in our West\r\nIndian colonies, as a self-evident doctrine, utterly beyond dispute or\r\nquestion, that a slave had no rights which his owner was bound to\r\nrespect.  The band of resolute philanthropists who had taken up the\r\nsubject in England were able to show that frequent flogging of men and\r\nwomen was a regular part of the day's incidents of every plantation,\r\nand that branding was constantly used, not merely as a means of\r\npunishment, but also as a means of identification.  It was a common\r\npractice when a female slave attempted to escape for her owner to have\r\nher branded on the breast with red-hot iron as an easy means of proving\r\nher identity if she were to succeed for a time in getting out of his\r\nreach.  Numbers of advertisements were produced in which the owners,\r\nseeking through the newspapers for the recovery of some of their women\r\nslaves, proclaimed the important fact that the fugitive women were\r\nbranded on both breasts, and that thus there could be no difficulty\r\nabout their identification.  We need not go further into the details of\r\nthe subject, but it may be as well to mention that we have not touched\r\nat all upon the most revolting evidences of the horrors which seemed to\r\n{192} be the inevitable accompaniment of the slave system.  Brougham\r\nwas one of the first among leading Englishmen who threw his heart and\r\nsoul into the agitation against colonial slavery.  Long before that\r\nagitation approached to anything like success he had brought forward a\r\nmotion in the House of Commons, directing attention to the evils and\r\nthe horrors of the system, and calling for its abolition.  For a time,\r\nsuccessive Governments did not see their way to go any further than to\r\nendeavor to bring about or to enforce better regulations for the use of\r\nslave labor on the colonial plantations.  Even these modest measures of\r\nreform had many difficulties to encounter.  Some of the colonies were\r\nunder the direct dominion of the Crown, were governed, in fact, as\r\nCrown colonies, but others had legislative chambers of their own, and\r\nrefused to submit to the dictation of the authorities at home.  These\r\nlegislative chambers in most cases resented the interference of the\r\nhome Government when it attempted to introduce new rules for the\r\ntreatment of negro slaves, and the whole plantation interest rallied in\r\nsupport of the great principle that every owner of slaves had an\r\nabsolute right to deal with them according to his own will and pleasure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1832--Anti-slavery agitation]\r\n\r\nIt was loudly asserted by the planters and by the friends of the\r\nplanters--and of course the planters had friends everywhere in\r\nEngland--that the sugar-growing business could not be carried on with\r\nany profit except by means of slave labor, and that the slaves could\r\nnot be got to work except by the occasional use of flogging or other\r\nsuch needful stimulant.  The negroes, it was loudly declared, would\r\nrise in rebellion if once it became known to them that the English\r\nParliament was encouraging them to consider themselves as slaves no\r\nlonger, and their mode of rising in rebellion would simply be a\r\nsimultaneous massacre of all the planters and their wives and children.\r\n\"See what you are doing!\" many a voice cried out to the anti-slavery\r\nagitators; \"you are preaching a crusade which will not merely end in\r\nthe utter bankruptcy of the West Indian Islands, but in the massacre of\r\nall the planters, their wives, and their children.\"  The agitators,\r\nhowever, were neither {193} dismayed nor disheartened.  It would have\r\ntaken a good deal of sophistry to confuse the conscience of Zachary\r\nMacaulay or Wilberforce.  It would have taken a good deal of bellowing\r\nto frighten Brougham.  The agitation went on with increasing force, and\r\nBrougham continued to denounce \"the wild and guilty phantasy\" that man\r\nhas property in man.\r\n\r\nIn Jamaica the colonial legislature, pressed hard by the Government at\r\nhome, passed an Act with the avowed purpose of mitigating the severity\r\nof the punishments inflicted on slave laborers.  The Act, however, was,\r\neven on the face of it, absurdly inadequate for any humane purpose.\r\nThe home Government had demanded, among other reforms, the entire\r\ndiscontinuance of the flogging of women.  The colonial Act allowed the\r\nflogging of women to go on just as it had done before.  The Jamaica\r\nplanters were indignant at the course taken by the home authorities,\r\nand raved as if they were on the verge of rebellion against the Crown,\r\nand the well-meant interference of the Government at home seemed in\r\nfact to have done more harm than good.  In Demerara, which was the\r\nCrown colony, some of the more intelligent among the negro slaves had\r\nheard scraps of talk which led them to believe that the King of England\r\nand his Government were about to confer freedom upon the colored race,\r\nand these reports spread and magnified throughout certain plantations,\r\nand the slaves on one estate refused to work.  Their refusal was\r\nregarded as an insurrection and was treated accordingly.  The most\r\nsavage measures were employed to crush the so-called insurrection, just\r\nas in more recent, and what ought to have been more enlightened, days\r\nsome local disturbances in Jamaica were magnified into a general rising\r\nof the blacks against the whites, and the horrors perpetrated in the\r\nname of repression startled the whole civilized world.  In Demerara an\r\nEnglish dissenting missionary, the Rev. John Smith, who had been known\r\nas a most kindly friend of the negroes, was formally charged with\r\nhaving encouraged and assisted the slaves to rise in revolt against\r\ntheir masters.  He was flung into prison, was treated with barbarous\r\n{194} rigors such as might have seemed in keeping with some story of\r\nSiberia; he was put through the hurried process of a sham trial in\r\nwhich the very forms of law were disregarded, and he was sentenced to\r\ndeath.  Even at Demerara and at such a time the court-martial which had\r\ncondemned the missionary as guilty of the offence with which he was\r\ncharged had accompanied its verdict with a recommendation to mercy on\r\naccount of the prisoner's previous good character.  But before it could\r\nbe decided whether or not the recommendation was to have any effect,\r\nthe unfortunate man died of the treatment he had received.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1830--Parliamentary action against slavery]\r\n\r\nThe story of the accusation, the trial, and the death created an\r\nimmense sensation in England.  Brougham, Buxton, Sir James Mackintosh,\r\nthe historian and scholar, and many others aroused the public\r\nindignation by their rightful denunciations of the trial and the\r\nverdict.  The Government condemned and reversed the proceedings at the\r\ntrial, and when Brougham brought on a motion in the House of Commons,\r\npublicly branding with just severity the whole conduct of the Demerara\r\nauthorities, his motion was only defeated by a small majority.\r\nMeanwhile, the agitation against the whole system of colonial slavery\r\nwas receiving new impulse and new strength from the teaching of new\r\nevents in the colonies, and in May, 1830, a great meeting was held in\r\nLondon to demand, not the mitigation, but the total abolition of\r\nslavery in every land over which the flag of England floated.  This\r\nmeeting was presided over by the great abolitionist, William\r\nWilberforce, who had been out of public life for some time owing to\r\nsevere ill-health, and who believed that he could not more fitly\r\ncelebrate his return to the active work of philanthropy than by taking\r\nthe chair at such a demonstration.  Mr. Buxton proposed a resolution\r\ncalling on the country to agitate for the total abolition of slavery in\r\nthe colonies, and to be content with nothing else, and the resolution\r\nwas carried by enthusiastic acclamation.  Brougham at once became the\r\nchampion of the great London meeting by a motion which he brought\r\nforward in the House of Commons.  One of the greatest speeches of his\r\nlifetime {195} was made in justifying his appeal to the House for the\r\ntotal abolition of a system which admitted of nothing like partial, or\r\nwhat is called moderate, reform, and must either be swept out of\r\nexistence altogether or remain a curse to those who enforce it as well\r\nas to those against whom it is enforced.  Brougham's motion was\r\ndefeated, of course.  We say of course because it was only a motion\r\nmade by an independent member, as the phrase goes, and was not proposed\r\nby the leader of a strong Government, determined to stake its existence\r\non the carrying of its proposition.  Every great reform, it may almost\r\nliterally be said, is heralded in Parliament by the motions of\r\nindependent members, who are sure to be defeated, but whose determined\r\nefforts have success enough to make the leader of the Government, or\r\nthe leader of the Opposition, feel that the time is near at hand when\r\nthe cause must be taken up by one or other of the great parties in the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nBuxton raised the whole question in the following session; and then\r\nLord Althorp, speaking for the Government, went so far as to offer a\r\nsort of compromise by suggesting that the colonies which in the future\r\nshould give evidence of their sincere resolve to make distinct\r\nimprovement in the condition of their slaves should be rewarded and\r\nencouraged by a permission to send their sugar into English ports at a\r\nreduced rate of duty.  The country, however, had long outgrown the\r\ncondition of mind in which this feeble and ridiculous proposition could\r\nbe regarded as worthy of serious consideration.  The notion of\r\nsacrificing any part of the country's revenues for the purpose of\r\nbribing the planters to deal a little less severely with their slaves\r\nwas not likely to find much favor among the men who had thus far\r\nconducted the great agitation against slavery.  The object of reformers\r\nsuch as Clarkson, Wilberforce, Buxton, Brougham, and Mackintosh was not\r\nmerely that the negroes should be flogged less often, or that the negro\r\nwomen should not be flogged at all, but that the whole abominable\r\nsystem which made men, women, and children the absolute property of\r\ntheir owners should be brought to an end forever.\r\n\r\n{196}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1833--A plan for the abolition of slavery]\r\n\r\nAt last it became evident to the Whig Ministry that something definite\r\nmust be done, and that nothing would be considered definite by the\r\ncountry which did not aim at the total abolition of slavery.  The hour\r\nhad come, and the man who could best turn it to account in the House of\r\nCommons was already in his place.  Lord Stanley, who had joined the\r\nReform Ministry as Secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, had\r\nsince that time been moved to the higher position of Colonial\r\nSecretary, and to him was appropriately confided the task of\r\nintroducing the measures which the Government had determined to take.\r\nThe Lord Stanley of those days was in after years the Earl of Derby,\r\nwhom some of us can still call to mind as one of the most brilliant\r\norators in the House of Lords at a time when Brougham and Lyndhurst\r\nmaintained the character of that assembly for parliamentary eloquence.\r\nThose among us who remember the eloquent Lord Derby, the Rupert of\r\ndebate, remember him as a Tory Prime Minister or the Tory leader of\r\nOpposition in the House of Lords.  But he began his great Parliamentary\r\ncareer as a Whig and as a Reformer, and he was one of the most zealous\r\nof Lord Grey's colleagues in pressing forward the great measure which\r\nwas carried to success in 1832.  Among those who can remember him there\r\nis only one opinion about the high order of his Parliamentary\r\neloquence, and that opinion is that he was a worthy rival of Gladstone\r\nand of Bright.  To him as Colonial Secretary was entrusted the task of\r\nbringing forward, in the House of Commons, the measures of the\r\nGovernment for dealing with the question of slavery in the British\r\ncolonies.  Stanley's speech was such a magnificent blending of reason\r\nand emotion, so close and so powerful in its arguments, so thrilling in\r\nits eloquence, that many of those who heard the speech naturally\r\nexpected that it was destined to announce a bold and a comprehensive\r\npolicy.  A certain feeling of disappointment came up among the\r\nabolitionists when the measures were described which the Government had\r\nresolved to submit to the House of Commons.  What Stanley had to\r\npropose was not a complete measure, but a {197} series of resolutions\r\nembodying the purposes of the Government's policy.  It is enough to say\r\nthat the Government proposed a plan which amounted to a scheme of\r\nabolition by stages.  There was to be a certain period of\r\napprenticeship, a term of fifteen years, during which the slaves, men\r\nand women, were to continue to work for their masters as before, under\r\nconditions gradually relaxing as the slave drew nearer to the time of\r\nemancipation, and then when that hour at length arrived the slave was\r\nto be free forever.  This principle, however, was not to apply to\r\nchildren under six years old at the time of the passing of the measure,\r\nor to any children born after that time.  The idea on which the whole\r\nscheme was founded was the notion, very common at that time and since,\r\nthat the sudden emancipation of any set of human beings could only tend\r\nto bewilder them, and to prevent them from making a proper use of the\r\nfreedom thus abruptly thrust upon them.  \"The fool in the fable,\" said\r\nMacaulay, when dealing with a somewhat similar question, \"declared that\r\nno man ought to go into the water until he had learned to swim.\"  Lord\r\nGrey's Ministry had apparently much the same idea about the perils of\r\nemancipation.  Another part of the scheme proposed that fifteen\r\nmillions should be advanced by the Government as a loan to the West\r\nIndian planters in order to help them over the diminution of income\r\nwhich might be expected to follow any interference with the conditions\r\nof slave labor.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions put forward by the Government were regarded as highly\r\nunsatisfactory by most of the leading abolitionists.  Macaulay indeed\r\nargued with all his usual eloquence and skill in favor of the principle\r\nof gradual abolition, and it is hardly necessary to say that it was not\r\nin that speech he made use of the pithy sentence which we have already\r\nquoted.  Buxton proposed an amendment to the resolution, an amendment\r\nin fact calling for immediate abolition, and the amendment was seconded\r\nby Daniel O'Connell.  Buxton, however, was prevailed upon not to press\r\nhis amendment on the ground that the Government were as eager for\r\nemancipation as any one could {198} be, and that Lord Grey and his\r\ncolleagues were only anxious to bring forward such a measure as might\r\nat once secure the support of the majority and prevent further delay,\r\nwhile securing, at the same time, the ultimate and not distant\r\nsettlement of the whole question.  O'Connell stood firm, argued\r\nstrongly against the proposed compromise, refused to accept it, and\r\nactually pressed Buxton's amendment to a division.  Of course he was\r\ndefeated by a large majority, but he carried a respectable minority\r\nalong with him; and few now can doubt that the amendment which he\r\npressed forward, even after its proposer had abandoned it, was right in\r\nits principle, and that the Government, if forced to it, could have\r\ncarried a plan for immediate abolition with little more difficulty than\r\nwas found in carrying the scheme of compromise.  As the discussion went\r\non the Government made some further concessions to the abolitionists,\r\nby reducing the time and modifying the terms of the apprenticeship\r\nsystem, and the abolitionists in general believed it their wisest\r\npolicy to accept the modified arrangement and thus avoid any further\r\ndelay.  Another alteration of great importance was made by the\r\nGovernment in favor of the planters, and was finally accepted by the\r\nabolitionists and by the country in general.  The friends of the\r\nplanters made strong representations to the effect that the proffered\r\nloan would be of no use whatever to the owners of slaves whose property\r\nwas so soon to pass from their hands into freedom, and that there was\r\nnot the slightest chance of the planters being able to pay back to the\r\nEnglish exchequer the amount that the Government was willing to\r\nadvance.  It was urged, too, with some show of reason, that the\r\nplanters were not themselves responsible for the existence of slave\r\nlabor, that generations of planters had grown up under the system and\r\nhad made a profit by it during the days when civilization had not,\r\nanywhere, set its face against slavery, and that it was hard,\r\ntherefore, to make them suffer in pocket for the recent development in\r\nthe feelings of humanity.  The offer of a loan was abandoned by the\r\nGovernment, and it was proposed instead that a gift of twenty millions\r\nsterling should {199} be tendered as compensation for the losses that\r\nthe planters would be likely to undergo.  This proposal, at first, met\r\nwith some opposition, and by many indeed was looked upon as an\r\nextravagant freak of generosity; but some of the leading abolitionists\r\nwere willing to make allowance for the condition of the planters, and\r\nmost, or all, of them were prepared to make a large sacrifice for the\r\nsake of carrying some measure which promised, even by gradual advances,\r\nthe final abolition of the slave system.  We may condense into a very\r\nbrief space the remainder of the story, and merely record the fact that\r\nthe Government carried their amended measure of emancipation with its\r\nliberal grant to the West Indian planters through both Houses of\r\nParliament, and that it obtained the royal assent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1833--Slavery abolished in British colonies]\r\n\r\nIt may easily be imagined that poor King William must have had some\r\nmental struggles before he found himself quite in a mood to grant that\r\nassent.  If the King ever had any clear and enduring opinion in his\r\nmind, it probably was the opinion, which he had often expressed\r\nalready, against the abolition of slavery.  He had, of course, a\r\ngeneral objection to reform of any kind, but his objection to any\r\nreform which threatened the endurance of the slave system must have\r\nbeen an article of faith with him.  It was the fate of King William the\r\nFourth to live in a reign of reforms, not one of which would appear to\r\nhave touched his heart or been in accordance with his personal\r\njudgment.  The highest praise that history can give him is that he did\r\nnot at least, as one of his predecessors had done, set his own judgment\r\nand his own inclination determinedly and irrevocably against the advice\r\nof the statesmen whom he had called in to carry on the work of\r\nadministration.  The King gave his assent to the amended Bill for the\r\nabolition of slavery, including the generous gift to the planters, and\r\nthe measure became law on August 27, 1833.  Some of the colonies had\r\nthe sense and spirit to discard the apprenticeship system altogether,\r\nand to date the emancipation of their slaves from the day when the\r\nmeasure became an Act of Parliament.  In no colony did the setting free\r\nof the negroes bring about any of the troubles and turmoils, the {200}\r\nlawless outbreaks of blacks against whites, the massacres of the\r\ninnocents, which had been so long and so often pictured as the\r\ninevitable consequences of the legislation demanded by the Clarksons,\r\nthe Wilberforces, the Buxtons, and the Broughams.  It seems to us all\r\nnow so much a matter of course for a civilized and enlightened State to\r\ndecree the extinction of slavery within its limits, that we find it\r\nhard to appreciate at its true value the difficulty and the splendor of\r\nthe achievement which was accomplished by the Grey Ministry.  It has to\r\nbe said, however, that the Ministry and the Parliament were, in this\r\ninstance, only the instruments by which the great charge was wrought.\r\nThe movement carried on out-of-doors, the movement set going by the\r\nleading abolitionists and supported by the people, deserves the chief\r\nhonor of the victory.  All the countries that make up the kingdom,\r\nEngland, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, sent their authorized speakers\r\nto sustain the cause of freedom for the slaves.  The gift, which on the\r\nrecommendation of Lord Grey's Ministry was placed at the disposal of\r\nthe West Indian planters, was indeed a lavish gift; but the public in\r\ngeneral made little complaint on the score of its lavishness, and did\r\nnot calculate too jealously the value of the sacrifice which the State\r\nwas invited to make for the purchase of negro emancipation.  Thirty\r\nyears and more had to pass before the great American republic was able\r\nto free itself from the curse of slavery, and even then the late\r\ndeliverance was only accomplished at the cost of a war which threatened\r\nfor the season a permanent division of the States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1833--Labor legislation]\r\n\r\nThe same year which saw the passing of the measure for the abolition of\r\nslavery in the colonies saw also the passing of an Act which interfered\r\nseriously, for the first time, with something which might almost be\r\ncalled a system of domestic slavery.  We are speaking now of the\r\nmeasure which dealt with the conditions of factory labor in these\r\ncountries.  Factory labor, as it was known in the early days of William\r\nthe Fourth, was the growth of modern civilization.  England had found\r\nthat her main business in life was not the conquest and the subjection\r\nof foreign races, {201} or the building or the navigating of ships, or\r\nthe cultivation of land, or the growth of corn, but the manufacture of\r\ngoods for her own domestic use and for export all over the world.\r\nGreat manufacturing cities and towns were growing up everywhere, and,\r\nwhile the workers on the land were becoming fewer and fewer, the\r\nworkers in the city factories were multiplying every day, so that an\r\nentirely new laboring population was coming up to claim the attention\r\nof the State.  Since the old days, when the whole social organization\r\nwas conducted according to the dictates of some centralized authority,\r\nthere had been growing up, as one of the inevitable reactions which\r\ncivilization brings with it at its successive stages, a sort of vaguely\r\nexpressed doctrine that the State has no right to interfere between\r\ncapital and labor, between the employer and the employed.  This theory\r\nnaturally grew and grew with the growth of the capital invested in\r\nmanufactures and the increase in the number of employers, and it was\r\nfound in later years than those at which we have now arrived, that the\r\ncourse of agitation that Lord Ashley may be said to have begun was\r\nopposed mainly in its progress by the capitalists and the employers of\r\nlabor, many of whom were thoroughly humane men, anxious to do the very\r\nbest they could for the health and the comfort of those whom they\r\nemployed, but who sincerely believed that the civil law had no right to\r\ninterfere with them and those who worked for them, and that the civil\r\nlaw could do only harm and no good by its best-intentioned interference.\r\n\r\nThe whole controversy has now been long settled, and it is a distinctly\r\nunderstood condition of our social system that the State has a right to\r\ninterfere between employer and employed when the condition of things is\r\nsuch that the employed is not always able to protect himself.  At the\r\ntime when Lord Ashley started on his long and beneficent career there\r\nwas practically no law which regulated the hours and the conditions of\r\nlabor in the great factories.  The whole factory system, the modern\r\nfactory system as we understand it, was then quite a new part of our\r\nsocial organization.  The factory, with its little army of workers,\r\n{202} men, women, and children, was managed according to the will and\r\njudgment of the owner, unless in the rare cases where the demand for\r\nlabor far exceeded the supply.  In most places the supply exceeded the\r\ndemand, and the master was therefore free to make any conditions he\r\npleased with his workers.  If the master were a humane man, a just man,\r\nor even a far-seeing man, he took care that those who worked for him\r\nshould be fairly treated, and should not be compelled to work under\r\nconditions dangerous to their health and destructive of their comfort.\r\nBut if he were a selfish man, or a careless man, the workers were used\r\nmerely as instruments of profit by him, or by those immediately under\r\nhim; and it did not matter how soon they were used up, for there could\r\nalways be found numbers enough who were eager to take their places, and\r\nwere willing to undertake any task on any terms, for the sake of\r\nsecuring a bare living.  Lord Ashley raised the whole question in the\r\nHouse of Commons, and brought forward a motion which ended in the\r\nappointment of a commission to inquire into the condition of the men,\r\nwomen, and children who worked in the factories.  The commission was\r\nnot long in collecting a vast amount of information as to the evils,\r\nmoral and physical, brought about by the overworking of women and\r\nchildren in the factories.  The general concurrence of public opinion,\r\neven among those who supported Lord Ashley's movement, did not seem to\r\ngo beyond the protection of women and children.  The adult male, it was\r\nconsidered, might perhaps safely be left to make the best terms he\r\ncould for himself; but the inquiries of the commission left little\r\ndoubt among unprejudiced minds that something must be done to secure\r\nwomen and children from the evils of overwork.  Lord Ashley succeeded\r\nin forcing the whole question on the attention of Parliament, and an\r\nAct was passed in 1833 which did not indeed go nearly as far as Lord\r\nAshley would have carried his principle, but which at least established\r\nthe right of legislative interference for the protection of children\r\nand young persons of both sexes.  The Act limited the work of children\r\nto eight hours a day and {203} that of young persons under eighteen to\r\nsixty-nine hours a week.  This Act may be regarded as the beginning of\r\nthat legislative interference which has gone on advancing beneficially\r\nfrom that time down to our own, and is likely still to keep on its\r\nforward movement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Shaftesbury]\r\n\r\nLord Ashley, whom many of us can well remember as Lord Shaftesbury, may\r\nbe said to have given up the whole of his life to the general purpose\r\nwith which he began his public career--the object of endeavoring to\r\nmitigate the toils and sufferings of those who have to work hard in\r\norder to provide for others the comforts and the luxuries of life.  His\r\nprinciple was that the State has always a right to interfere for the\r\nprotection of those who cannot protect themselves.  He was not a man of\r\ngreat statesmanlike ability, he was not a man of extensive or varied\r\ninformation, he was not a scholar, he was not an orator, he was not in\r\nthe ordinary sense of the word a thinker, but he was a man who had, by\r\na kind of philanthropic instinct, got hold of an idea which men of far\r\ngreater intellect had not, up to his time, shown themselves able to\r\ngrasp.  The story of his life is part of the whole story of the\r\nindustrial development of modern civilization.  Again and again he\r\nworked with success in movement after movement, initiated mainly by\r\nhimself, for the protection and the education of those who toil in our\r\nfactories and in our mines.  Some day no doubt Parliament may have to\r\ndevise legislation which shall do for the women and children employed\r\nin field labor something like that which Lord Ashley did for the women\r\nand children employed in factories and in mines.  We have seen that\r\nalready efforts are made in every session of Parliament to extend the\r\nprinciple of the factory legislation into various industrial\r\noccupations which are common to city life.  For the present, however,\r\nwe have only to deal with the fact that one of the first labors\r\naccomplished by the Reformed Parliament was the establishment of that\r\nlegislative principle with which Lord Ashley's name will always be\r\nassociated.\r\n\r\nLet it be added that, with the establishment of that principle, came\r\nalso the introduction of two innovations in our {204} factory system\r\nwhich lent inestimable value to the whole measure.  One of these was\r\nthe appointment of a number of factory inspectors, who were authorized\r\nto see that the purposes of the Act were properly carried out by the\r\nemployers, and to report to the Government as to the working of the\r\nwhole system and the necessity for further improvements.  The other was\r\nthe arrangement by which a portion of the time of all the younger\r\nworkers in the factories was set apart for educational purposes, so\r\nthat children should no longer be treated as mere machines for the\r\nmaking of goods and the earning of wages, but should be enabled and\r\ncompelled to have their faculties developed by the instruction suited\r\nto their years.  This provision in the Factories Act may be regarded as\r\nthe first step towards that system of national education which it took\r\nso much trouble and so many years to establish in these countries.\r\nLord Ashley had great work still to accomplish; but even if his noble\r\ncareer had closed with the passing of the Factories Act in 1833, his\r\nname would always be remembered as that of a man who, more than any\r\nother, helped to turn the first Reformed Parliament to the work of\r\nemancipating the English laboring classes in cities and towns from a\r\nservitude hardly less in conflict with the best interests of humanity\r\nthan that which up to the same year had prevailed on the plantations of\r\nJamaica and Demerara.  The Reformed Parliament had still much difficult\r\nwork to call out its best energies and to employ its new resources, but\r\nit had begun its tasks well, and had already given the country good\r\nearnest of its splendid future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{205}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXV.\r\n\r\nTHE STATE CHURCH IN IRELAND.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1832--\"Dark Rosaleen\"]\r\n\r\nA saying which has been ascribed to a well-known living Englishman, who\r\nhas made a name for himself in letters as well as in politics, may be\r\nused as the introduction to this chapter.  The saying was that no man\r\nshould ever be sent as Chief Secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant of\r\nIreland who could not prove that he had thoroughly mastered the meaning\r\nof the noble Irish poem rendered by Clarence Mangan as \"Dark Rosaleen.\"\r\nThe author and statesman to whom we refer used to point the moral of\r\nhis observation, sometimes, by declaring that many or most of the\r\npolitical colleagues for whose benefit he had spoken had never heard\r\neither of Clarence Mangan or of \"Dark Rosaleen.\"  Now, as it is barely\r\npossible that some of the readers of this volume may be in a condition\r\nof similar ignorance, it is well to mention that Clarence Mangan was an\r\nIrish poet who was dear to the generation which saw the rise of the\r\nYoung Ireland movement during O'Connell's later years, and that the\r\ndark Rosaleen whom Mangan found in the earlier poet's ballad is\r\nsupposed to typify his native country.  The idea of the author and\r\nstatesman was that no Englishman who had not studied this poem, and got\r\nat the heart of its mystery, so far as to be able to realize the deep\r\npoetic, pathetic love of the Celtic heart for the soil, the traditions,\r\nand the ways of the Celtic island, could attempt with any success to\r\nundertake the government of the country.  We have now come to a period\r\nin this history when the Irish question, as it is called, came up once\r\nagain, and in a new form, to try the statesmanship of English rulers.\r\nWe have told the story of '98, and how the rebellion ended in complete\r\ndefeat and disaster.  Up to the {206} time at which we have now arrived\r\nthere was no more talk of rebellion in the field, but in the sullen\r\nheart of Irish discontent there still lived all the emotions which had\r\nanimated Lord Edward Fitzgerald, Wolfe Tone, and Robert Emmet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1832--The tithe question in Ireland]\r\n\r\nWhen the rebellion was put down the Government of King George the Third\r\nabolished the Irish Parliament, and then all loyal and sensible persons\r\nin Westminster assumed, of course, that there was an end of the matter.\r\nThe rebellion had been put down, the principal rebels had been done to\r\ndeath, Grattan's troublesome and tiresome Parliament had been\r\nextinguished, Ireland had been merged into complete identification with\r\nEngland, and surely nothing would be heard of the Irish question any\r\nmore.  Yet the Irish question seemed to come up again and again, and to\r\npress for answer just as if answer enough had not been given already.\r\nThere was a clamor about Catholic Emancipation, and at last the Irish\r\nCatholics had to be emancipated from complete political\r\ndisqualification, and their spokesman O'Connell had been allowed to\r\ntake his place in the House of Commons.  Sir Robert Peel had carried\r\nCatholic Emancipation, for, although a Tory in many of his ways of\r\nthinking, he was a statesman and a man of genius; and now Lord Grey,\r\nthe head of the Whig Government, had no sooner passed the Reform Bill\r\nthan he found himself confronted with the Irish question in a new\r\nshape.  We could hardly wonder that Sir Robert Peel or Lord Grey did\r\nnot try to inform their minds as to Irish national feeling through a\r\nstudy of \"Dark Rosaleen,\" for the good reason that no such poem had yet\r\nbeen given to the world.  But neither Peel nor Grey was a type of the\r\naverage Englishman of the times, and each had gradually borne in upon\r\nhim, by a study of realities if not of poetic fancies, that the\r\nnational sentiment of the Irishman was not to be eradicated by any Act\r\nof Parliament for his denationalization.  Lord Grey, as the friend and\r\npupil of Fox, who had always been the friend of Ireland, must have\r\nacquired, as a part of his early political training, the knowledge that\r\nIreland's grievances were not all {207} sentimental, and that if they\r\nwere to be dealt with by Acts of Parliament these Acts must take the\r\npart of relief and not of repression.  It may well be questioned\r\nwhether any population is disturbed for very long by mere sentimental\r\ngrievances, and it may be doubted also whether the true instinct of\r\nstatesmanship does not always regard the existence of what is called a\r\nsentimental grievance as the best reason for trying to find out whether\r\nthere is not some practical evil at the root of the complaint.\r\nCertainly, in Lord Grey's time, the grievances were open and palpable\r\nenough to have attracted the attention of any man whose mind was not as\r\nwell contented with the wisdom of his ancestors as that of King William\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nJust at this time, as we have seen, a school of Englishmen was\r\nspringing up: Englishmen whose minds were filled with new ideas, and\r\nwho thoroughly understood the tendencies of the reforming age to which\r\nthey belonged.  The Irish tithe question had come up for settlement.\r\nThe Irish tithe question was only a part of the Irish State Church\r\nquestion.  The Irish State Church was an institution bestowed upon\r\nIreland by her conquerors.  Five-sixths, at least, of the population of\r\nIreland belonged to the Church of Rome and were devoted to the religion\r\nof that Church.  The island was nevertheless compelled to maintain the\r\nState Church, which did not even represent the religious belief of the\r\none-sixth of the population that was not Roman Catholic.  One of the\r\nprivileges of the State Church was to exact tithes from all the farmers\r\nof the country for the maintenance of its clergymen.  Ireland was\r\nalmost altogether an agricultural country, and had but little to do\r\nwith manufacturing industry, and in three out of the four provinces of\r\nIreland the farmers, almost to a man, held to the religion of their\r\nCatholic forefathers and worshipped only at the altars of their faith.\r\nIt would be seen, therefore, that the imposition of tithes for the\r\nsupport of the State Church ministers was not merely a sentimental\r\ngrievance, but a very practical grievance as well.  It was practical\r\nbecause it exacted the payment of a tribute which the farmer believed\r\nhe ought not to be called {208} upon to pay, and it was sentimental\r\nbecause, while it extorted the money from the farmer's pocket, it also\r\ninsulted his nationality and his faith.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1832--Difficulty in collecting the tithes]\r\n\r\nThe result was that a sort of civil war was perpetually going on in\r\nIreland between those who strove to collect the tithes and those from\r\nwhom the tithes were to be collected.  The resistance was sometimes of\r\nthe fiercest character; the farmers and their friends resisted the\r\nforces sent by the Government to seize the cattle of those who refused\r\nto pay, as if they were resisting an army of foreign invaders.  Blood\r\nwas shed freely and lavishly in these struggles, and the shedding of\r\nblood became so common that for a while it almost ceased to be a matter\r\nof public scandal.  Sydney Smith declared that the collection of tithes\r\nin Ireland must have cost in all probability about one million of\r\nlives.  Police, infantry, and dragoons were kept thus in constant\r\noccupation, and yet it could not possibly be contended that those who\r\nclaimed the tithes were very much the better for all the blood that was\r\nshed on their behalf.  For when a farmer's cattle had been seized by\r\nthe police after an obstinate fight with the farmers and their friends,\r\nand when the cattle had been driven off under the escort of infantry\r\nand cavalry soldiers, the clergyman who claimed the tithes was not\r\nalways any nearer to the getting of that which the law declared to be\r\nhis own.  The familiar proverbial saying about the ease with which a\r\nhorse may be brought to the water and the difficulty there may be in\r\ngetting him to drink when he has been brought there was illustrated\r\naptly and oddly enough in the difference between seizure of the\r\nfarmer's cattle and the means of raising any money on them when they\r\nhad been seized.  The captured cattle could not in themselves be of\r\nmuch use to the clergyman who claimed the tithes, and they would\r\nnaturally have to be sold in order that he might get his due, and the\r\nquestion arose who was to bid for them.  All the farmers and the\r\npeasantry of the country were on the one side, and on the other were\r\nthe incumbent, a few of his friends, and the military and police.  It\r\nwas certain that the soldiers and the policemen would not bid for the\r\ncattle, and probably {209} could not pay for them, and the population\r\nof the district would have made the place very uncomfortable for any of\r\nthe clergymen's friends who showed an anxiety to buy up the impounded\r\nbeasts.  In some cases when cattle were sold by public auction no\r\nbidder ventured to come forward but the farmer himself who owned the\r\ncattle, and they had to be knocked down to him at a purely nominal\r\nprice because there was no possible competitor.  The farmer drove home\r\nhis beasts amid the exultation of the whole neighborhood, and the\r\nclergymen was as far off his tithes as ever.  The passive resistance in\r\nfact was harder to deal with, as far as practical results went, than\r\neven the resistance that was active.  Summon together by lawful\r\nauthority a number of soldiers and police, and it is easy to shoot down\r\na few unarmed peasants, and to dispose for the hour of popular\r\nresistance in this prompt and peremptory way.  But what is to be done\r\nwhen the resistance takes the form of a resolute organized refusal to\r\npay up the amounts claimed or to offer any price for the cattle seized\r\nin default of payment?  There were in every district numbers of quiet\r\nCatholic parishioners who would much rather have paid their share of\r\nthe tithes to the Protestant clergymen than become drawn into quarrels\r\nand local disturbances and confusion.  But such men soon found that if\r\nthey paid their tithes they put themselves in direct antagonism to the\r\nwhole mass of their Catholic neighbors.  Intimidation of the most\r\nserious kind was sometimes brought to bear upon them, and in any case\r\nthere was that very powerful kind of intimidation which consists in\r\nmaking the offender feel that he has brought on himself the contempt\r\nand the hatred of nearly all his fellow-parishioners and his\r\nfellow-religionists.  In those days it was not lawful to hold a public\r\npolitical meeting in Ireland, but there were anti-tithe demonstrations\r\ngot up, nevertheless, over three parts of Ireland.  These\r\ndemonstrations took the outward form of what were called hurling\r\nmatches, great rivalries of combatants, in a peculiar Irish game of\r\nball.  Each of these demonstrations was made to be, and was known to\r\nbe, a practical protest against the collection of the tithes.  {210}\r\nWhenever it became certain that the recusant farmer's cattle were to be\r\nseized, a great hurling match was announced to be held in the immediate\r\nvicinity, and the local magistrates, who perhaps had at their disposal\r\nonly a few handfuls of police or soldiery, were not much inclined to\r\norder the seizure in the presence of such a cloud of witnesses.  Nor\r\nwould any Catholic parishioner who had quietly paid up his tithes\r\nwithout resistance have felt very comfortable if he had happened to\r\ncome near the hurling field that day, and to hear the loudly expressed\r\ncomments of his neighbors on his line of conduct.  To make the troubles\r\nstill deeper, it often happened that the claimant of the tithes was an\r\nabsentee--the incumbent of many a parish in Ireland left his curate to\r\nlook after his flock and his tithes alike--and the absentee was almost\r\nas much hated in Ireland as the tithe-collector.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1832--The tithe question in Parliament]\r\n\r\nNow it must not be supposed that there were not many of the Protestant\r\nclergy in Ireland who utterly disapproved of the tithe system.  One\r\nProtestant clergyman in England, from whom we have just quoted, the\r\nRev. Sydney Smith, had denounced the system over and over again in\r\nlanguage the most indignant and the most scornful that even his\r\nscathing humor could command.  But there were numbers of Protestant\r\nclergymen in Ireland who saw and proclaimed its injustice and its\r\nfutility.  The Archbishop of Dublin declared that no Government could\r\never accomplish the collection of tithes in Ireland otherwise than at\r\nthe point of the bayonet.  Protestant country clergy often found that\r\nthe very attempts to collect the tithes only brought increased distress\r\nand hardship upon themselves.\r\n\r\nMany a poor Protestant clergyman saw the utter injustice of the system,\r\nand disliked and detested it almost as much as the Roman Catholics\r\nthemselves could have done.  There were many such men, too, who put up\r\nwith miserable poverty rather than make any attempt to recover such an\r\nincome by force.  Great English speakers and writers were beginning to\r\ndenounce the whole system.  Macaulay stigmatized it as severely as\r\nSydney Smith had done.  George {211} Grote, the historian of Greece,\r\nwho had then a seat in the House of Commons, had not only condemned it,\r\nbut had condemned the whole State Church system of which it was only a\r\npart.  In our own days the ordinary English reader finds it hard to\r\nunderstand how any such system could have been carried on under a\r\ncivilized European Government.  Such a reader will readily admit that\r\nSydney Smith had not gone beyond the limits of sober assertion when he\r\ndeclared that \"there is no abuse like it in all Europe, in all Asia, in\r\nall the discovered parts of Africa, and in all we have ever heard of\r\nTimbuctoo.\"  The subject had been brought up in Parliament by some of\r\nthe advanced reformers of the day, and, indeed, it was bringing itself\r\nbefore the notice of Parliament every week through the official reports\r\nof the disturbances which were taking place in various parts of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe House of Lords had appointed a committee to inquire into the whole\r\nsubject.  The committee reported that a complete extinction of the\r\ntithe system was demanded, not only in the interests of Ireland but in\r\nthe interests of the State Church itself, and suggested, as a means of\r\ngetting out of the difficulty, that the tithes might be commuted for a\r\ncharge upon land or by an exchange for an investment in land.  This\r\nmeant, in other words, that the collection of tithes should be devolved\r\nupon the landlord, leaving him to repay himself by a corresponding\r\naddition to the rent which he asked from his tenants.  The House of\r\nCommons also appointed a committee to inquire into the subject, and the\r\nrecommendation of that committee was in substance very much the same as\r\nthe recommendation made by the committee appointed by the House of\r\nLords.\r\n\r\nThe Government then took up the question, and in 1832 Lord Althorp\r\nannounced that it was the intention of ministers to submit to the House\r\nof Commons a scheme of their own as a temporary settlement of the Irish\r\ntithe question, and out of which was to be developed, in time, a\r\nmeasure for the complete removal of the difficulty.  A very brief\r\ndescription will serve to explain the nature of {212} this measure.\r\nThe Government proposed to advance a certain sum of money for the\r\nrelief of the tithe-owners who had not been able to recover what the\r\nlaw held to be their due, and in the meantime to apply themselves to\r\nthe preparation of some scheme which might transfer the tithe burden\r\nfrom the occupiers to the owners of the land.  The Government thus\r\nadmitted that at the moment they did not see their way altogether out\r\nof the tithe difficulty, but promised to apply their minds to the\r\ndiscovery of some final and satisfactory settlement, and undertook\r\nuntil then to pay to incumbents the arrears of tithes, and to collect\r\nthe money as well as they could from the indebted occupiers.  In point\r\nof fact, Lord Althorp and his colleagues proposed to become the\r\ntithe-collectors themselves and to let any loss that might be incurred\r\nfall, for the time, upon the State and the national taxpayers.  The\r\nplan was tried for a while, and we need hardly say that it proved\r\naltogether unsatisfactory.  The Government had no better means of\r\ncompelling the farmers to pay the tithes than those means which they\r\nhad already vainly put at the disposal of the tithe-owners.  The farmer\r\nwho could not be coerced by the police and the military into settling\r\nhis accounts with the incumbent was not likely to be any the more ready\r\nto pay up because the demand for payment was made by the\r\nLord-Lieutenant.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1834--Henry Ward and the Irish Church]\r\n\r\nIt was becoming more and more evident every day that the whole\r\nconditions of the State Church in Ireland were responsible for the\r\ntrouble of which the tithes difficulty was only an incident.  Already a\r\nparty was forming itself in the House of Commons composed of\r\nintellectual and far-seeing men who recognized the fact that the Irish\r\nState Church was in its very principles an anomaly and an anachronism.\r\nOn May 27, 1834, a debate on the whole question of the Irish State\r\nChurch and its revenues was raised in the House of Commons by Mr. Henry\r\nWard, one of the most advanced reformers and thoughtful politicians\r\nwhom the new conditions of the franchise had brought into Parliament.\r\nHenry Ward was a son of that Plumer Ward who was at one time famous as\r\nthe author of a novel {213} called \"Tremaine.\"  If any memory of\r\n\"Tremaine\" lingers in the minds of readers who belong to the present\r\ngeneration, the lingering recollection is probably only due to the fact\r\nthat in Disraeli's \"Vivian Grey\" there is an amusing scene in which the\r\nhero makes audacious use of an extemporized passage, which he professes\r\nto find in Plumer Ward's novel.  Henry Ward, the son, afterwards won\r\nsome distinction by his administration of the Ionian Islands while the\r\nislands were under the charge of Great Britain.  In our Parliamentary\r\nhistory, however, he will always be remembered as the author of the\r\nfirst serious attempt to obtain a national recognition of the principle\r\nwhich, within our own times, secured its final acknowledgment by the\r\ndisestablishment of the Irish Church.  The resolution which was\r\nproposed merely declared that the Protestant Episcopal Establishment in\r\nIreland exceeded the wants of the Protestant population, and that, it\r\nbeing the right of the State to regulate the distribution of Church\r\nproperty in such manner as Parliament might determine, it was the\r\nopinion of the House that the temporal possessions of the State Church\r\nin Ireland ought to be reduced.  This resolution went no further in\r\nwords, as it will be seen, than to ask for a reduction of the revenues\r\nof that Church on the ground that it had already more funds than were\r\nrequired for the full discharge of its duties among those who attended\r\nits ministrations.  But then the resolution also assumed the right of\r\nthe State to institute an inquiry into the application of the revenues\r\nand the needs of the surrounding population, and would necessarily\r\ncarry with it the assertion of the principle that the Irish State\r\nChurch existed only to minister to the wants of the Protestants of\r\nIreland.  It is clear that if once this principle were recognized by\r\nthe State the whole theory of the Established Church in Ireland could\r\nno longer be maintained.  That theory was that the State had a right to\r\nuphold and a duty to perform in the maintenance of a Protestant\r\nEstablishment in Ireland for the purpose of converting to its doctrines\r\nthat vast majority of the Irish population who could not be driven,\r\neven at the bayonet's point, to attend the {214} services conducted by\r\na Protestant pastor.  Only a few years after this time the great\r\nstatesman who was afterwards to obtain from Parliament the\r\ndisestablishment of the Irish Church was arguing, in his earliest\r\npublished work, that the fewer the Protestants in Ireland the greater\r\nwas the necessity for the State to be lavish of its money with the\r\nobject of converting the outer population of Ireland to the established\r\nreligion.  Mr. Ward, in his speech, set himself to make it clear to the\r\nHouse of Commons that the collection of tithes in Ireland was, at that\r\ntime, the principal cause of the disturbance and disaffection which\r\nbrought so much calamity on the unhappy island, and prevented any\r\npossibility of its becoming a loyal part of the British dominions.  He\r\nshowed by facts and figures that the opposition to the collection of\r\ntithes was not any longer confined to the Catholic population alone,\r\nbut had spread among the Protestants of dissenting denominations, and\r\nwas showing itself in the North of Ireland, as well as in the provinces\r\nof the South and the West and the Midlands.  He pointed to the fact\r\nthat it was found necessary to maintain in Ireland, for the purpose of\r\ncollecting the tithes, an army larger than that which England needed\r\nfor the maintenance of her Indian Empire, and that, nevertheless, it\r\nwas found impossible to collect the tithes in Ireland, and that the\r\nGovernment could suggest nothing better than a project for the payment\r\nof the tithes out of the pockets of the national taxpayer.  Mr. Ward\r\nmade it clear to the House of Commons that the revenues of the State\r\nChurch in Ireland were not distributed with anything like a view to the\r\nfair and equal remuneration of its clergy.  In numbers of cases the\r\nclergy of the higher ranks had enormous incomes, quite out of all\r\nproportion to any duties they were even supposed to perform, while the\r\nclergymen who actually did the work were, as a general rule, screwed\r\ndown to a pitiful rate of payment which hardly kept soul and body\r\ntogether.  Twenty pounds a year was not an uncommon stipend among the\r\ncurates who did the hard work, while an annual revenue of sixty pounds\r\nwas regarded as something like opulence.  Where the curate received his\r\nthirty {215} or forty pounds a year or less, the incumbent usually had\r\nhis two thousand a year, and in many instances much more.  As we said\r\nbefore, the incumbent deriving a rich revenue from his office was often\r\nhabitually an absentee, who left the whole of his work to be performed,\r\nas best it might be done, by the curate, half starving on a miserable\r\npittance.  Mr. Ward made out a case which must have produced some\r\nimpression on any Parliamentary assembly, and could hardly fail to find\r\nattentive listeners and ready sympathy among the members of the first\r\nreformed House of Commons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1834--George Grote]\r\n\r\nThe motion was seconded by a remarkable man in a remarkable speech.\r\nMr. George Grote, afterwards famous as the historian of Greece, was one\r\nof the new members of Parliament.  He was a man of a peculiar type, of\r\nan intellectual order which we do not usually associate with the\r\nmovement of the political world, but which is, nevertheless, seldom\r\nwithout its representative in the House of Commons.  Grote was one of\r\nthe small group of men who were, at that time, described as the\r\nphilosophical Radicals.  He acknowledged the influence of Bentham; he\r\nwas a friend and associate of the elder and the younger Mill; he was a\r\nbanker by occupation, a scholar and an author by vocation; a member of\r\nParliament from a sense of duty.  Grote, no doubt, was sometimes\r\nmistaken in the political conclusions at which he arrived, but he\r\ndeserved the praise which Macaulay has justly given to Burke, that he\r\nwas always right in his point of view.  With Grote a political measure\r\nwas right or wrong only as it helped or hindered the spread of\r\neducation, human happiness, and peace.  He was one of the earliest and\r\nmost persevering advocates of the ballot system at elections, and\r\nduring his short Parliamentary career he made the ballot the subject of\r\nan annual motion.  Some of us can still well remember George Grote in\r\nhis much later days, and can bear testimony to the fact that, to quote\r\nthe thrilling words of Schiller, he reverenced in his manhood the\r\ndreams of his youth.  We can remember how steady an opponent he was of\r\nslavery, and how his sympathies went with the cause of the North during\r\nthe {216} great American civil war.  One can hardly suppose that\r\nGrote's style as a speaker was well suited to the ways of the House of\r\nCommons, but it is certain that whenever he spoke he always made a\r\ndistinct impression on the House.  Some of us who can remember John\r\nStuart Mill addressing that same assembly at a later day, can probably\r\nform an idea of the influence exercised on the House by the man who\r\nseemed to be thinking his thoughts aloud rather than trying to win over\r\nvotes or to catch encouraging applause.  Grote's speech on Ward's\r\nmotion brought up one view of the Irish Church which especially\r\ndeserved consideration.  Grote dealt with the alarms and the\r\nconvictions of those who were insisting that to acknowledge any right\r\nof Parliament to interfere with the Irish State Church would be to\r\nsound in advance the doom of the English State Church as well.  He\r\npointed out that, whatever difference of opinion there might be as to\r\nthe general principle of a State Establishment, the case of the two\r\nChurches, the English and the Irish, must be argued upon grounds which\r\nhad nothing in common.  Every argument which could be used, and must be\r\nused, for the State Church of England was an argument against the State\r\nChurch in Ireland.  The State Church of England was the Church to which\r\nthe vast majority of the English people belonged.  It ministered to\r\ntheir spiritual needs, it was associated with their ways, their hopes,\r\ntheir past, and their future.  If an overwhelming majority in any\r\ncountry could claim the right, by virtue of their majority, to set up\r\nand maintain any institution, the Protestant population of England\r\ncould claim a right to set up a State Church.  But every word that\r\ncould be said in support of the English State Church was a word of\r\ncondemnation and of sentence on the State Church in Ireland.  The Irish\r\nState Church was the Church of so small a minority that, when allowance\r\nhad been made for the numbers of dissenting Protestants in Ireland, it\r\nwas doubtful whether one in every twelve of the whole population could\r\nbe claimed as a worshipper in the temples maintained and endowed by\r\nlaw.  Moreover, the Irish State Church was a badge of conquest, and was\r\n{217} regarded as such by the whole Celtic population of the island.\r\nThe tithe exacted from the Irish Catholic farmer was not merely a\r\ntribute exacted by the conqueror, but was also a brand of degradation\r\non the faith and on the nationality of the Irish Celt who was called\r\nupon to meet the demand.  The student of history will note with some\r\ninterest that, at a day much nearer to our own, the Lord Stanley whose\r\nname we shall presently have to bring up in connection with this debate\r\non Mr. Ward's motion made use, in the House of Lords, of an appeal\r\nwhich suggested the idea that he had not heard or had forgotten George\r\nGrote's speech on which we have just been making comment.  Not very\r\nlong before his death Lord Derby, as he had then become, was declaiming\r\nin the House of Lords against the proposal to disestablish the Irish\r\nState Church, and he warned the House that if the fabric of the Irish\r\nChurch were to be touched by a destroying hand it would be in vain to\r\nhope that the destruction of the English State Church could long be\r\naverted.  [Sidenote: 1834--Lord Derby]  Lord Derby had always a very\r\nhappy gift of quotation, and he made on this occasion a striking\r\nallusion.  He reminded the House of that thrilling scene in Scott's\r\n\"Guy Mannering\" where the gypsy woman suddenly presents herself on the\r\nroadside to the elder, the Laird of Ellangowan and some of his friends,\r\nand, complaining of the eviction of her own people from their\r\nhomesteads, bids the gentlefolk take care that their own roof-trees are\r\nnot put in danger by what they had done.  Lord Derby made use of this\r\npassage as a warning to the prelates and peers of England that, if they\r\nallowed the Irish State Church to be disestablished, the statelier\r\nfabric of their own Church in England might suffer by the example.  It\r\nwas pointed out at the time, by some of those who commented on Lord\r\nDerby's speech, that George Grote had answered this argument by\r\nunconscious anticipation, and had shown that the best security of the\r\nEnglish State Church was the fact that it rested on a foundation\r\ntotally different from that of the State Church in Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe Government were greatly embarrassed by all this {218} discussion as\r\nto the condition, the work, and the character of the Establishment in\r\nIreland.  Lord Grey, whose whole nature inclined him to move along the\r\npath of progress with slow, steady, and stately steps, began to chafe\r\nagainst the eagerness with which the more Radical reformers were\r\nendeavoring to hurry on the political movement.  It was necessary that\r\nthe Government should announce a purpose of one kind or another--should\r\neither give a general sanction to the inquiry into the claims and\r\nmerits of the Irish Church, or declare themselves against any movement\r\nof reform in that direction.  It was found hardly possible for the\r\nGovernment to ally themselves with the followers of old-fashioned\r\nToryism, and it soon began to be rumored that Lord Grey could only keep\r\non the reforming path at the cost of losing some of his most capable\r\ncolleagues.  Before long it was made publicly known that the rumors\r\nwere well founded.  Lord Stanley and Sir James Graham resigned their\r\nplaces in the Ministry.  Graham afterwards held office in more than one\r\nAdministration that might well be called Liberal, but Lord Stanley\r\npassed the greater part of his Parliamentary life in the ranks of\r\nuncompromising Toryism.  He had begun his public career as an\r\nenthusiastic champion of Parliamentary reform, and he was the\r\nfigure-head of reform again at a much later date, but on all other\r\nquestions he remained a steadfast and a most eloquent advocate of\r\ngenuine Tory principles.  It may fittingly be mentioned here that the\r\nexistence of the Radical party, recognized as such and regarded as\r\ndistinct from the ordinary Liberals, began with the debates on the\r\nState Church in Ireland.  The passing of the Reform Bill divided the\r\nWhigs and Tories into Liberals and Conservatives, and the discussions\r\non the Irish Church divided those who had once been Whigs into Liberals\r\nand Radicals.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1834--King William and the Irish State Church]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile poor old King William was greatly concerned by the attacks\r\nwhich were made upon the State Church in Ireland.  William the Fourth\r\nhad a simple sort of piety of his own, and was perhaps somewhat like\r\nthe man whom Doctor Johnson commended because, whatever {219} follies\r\nor offences he might have committed, he never passed a church without\r\ntaking off his hat.  The King knew little or nothing, we may well\r\nsuppose, about the Irish Church and the way in which it fulfilled, or\r\nhad any chance of fulfilling, its sacred office.  But he took off his\r\nhat to it as a Church, and, more than that, he shed tears and\r\npositively blubbered over its hard fate in having to stand so many\r\nattacks from its enemies.  The King received, on one of his birthdays,\r\na delegation from the prelates of the Irish Church, and to them he\r\npoured out his assurances that nothing should ever induce him to\r\nabandon that Church to its ungodly foes.  He reminded the prelates that\r\nhe was growing an old man, that his departure from this world must be\r\nnear at hand, that he had nothing left now to live for but the rightful\r\ndischarge of his duties as a Protestant sovereign, and he bade them to\r\nbelieve that the tears which were bedewing his countenance were the\r\ntears of heartfelt sympathy and sorrow.  The King nevertheless did not\r\nget into any quarrel with his ministers on the subject of the Irish\r\nChurch, and when any documents bearing on the question were presented\r\nto him for signature he ended by affixing his name and did not allow\r\nhis tears to fall upon it and blot it out.  The Duke of Cumberland,\r\ntoo, stood by the Irish Church to the best of his power.  A member of\r\nthe House of Lords has a privilege which is not accorded to a member of\r\nthe House of Commons--he can enter on the books of the House his\r\nwritten protest against the passing of any measure which he has not\r\nbeen able to keep out of legislation.  The Duke of Cumberland entered\r\nhis protest against some of the resolutions taken with regard to the\r\nIrish State Church, and he declared that the sovereign who affirmed\r\nsuch resolves must do so in defiance of the coronation oath.  That\r\ncoronation oath had not been brought into much prominence since the\r\ndays of George the Third, when it used to be relied upon as an\r\nimpassable barrier to many a great measure of political justice and\r\nmercy.  The Duke of Cumberland was not exactly the sort of man who\r\ncould quicken it anew into an animating influence, and King {220}\r\nWilliam did what his ministers advised him to do, and the world went on\r\nits way.  The King, however, liked his ministers none the more because\r\nhe did not see his way to quarrel with them when they advised him to\r\nmake some concessions to public feeling on the subject of the Irish\r\ntithes.  Thus far, indeed, the concessions were not very great, and the\r\nimportant fact for this part of our history is only that the tithe\r\nquestion brought up the far more momentous question which called into\r\ndoubt the right to existence of the Irish State Church itself.  The\r\nGovernment went no farther, for the time, than to offer the appointment\r\nof a commission to inquire into the incidence and the levying of the\r\ntithes, and endeavored to evade the question of appropriation, that is,\r\nthe question as to the right of Parliament to decide the manner in\r\nwhich the revenues of the Irish State Church ought to be employed.  The\r\ntithe question itself was finally settled for England before it came to\r\nbe finally settled for Ireland.  But its settlement involved no such\r\nconsequences to the English State Church as it did to the State Church\r\nin Ireland.  For our present purposes it is enough to record the fact\r\nthat the earliest clear indications of the national policy, which in a\r\nlater generation disestablished the Irish State Church, were given by\r\nthe first Reform Parliament.  Meanwhile the controversy raised as to\r\nthe position of the Irish Establishment had had the effect of\r\ndisturbing Lord Grey, who did not like to be driven too rapidly along\r\nthe path of reform; of greatly angering the sovereign, who grumbled all\r\nthe more because he could not openly resist; and of dissatisfying men\r\nlike Ward and Grote and Lord Durham, and even members of the Cabinet\r\nlike Lord John Russell, who could not regard mere slowness as a virtue\r\nwhen there was an obvious wrong to be redressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{221}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVI.\r\n\r\n\"ONLY A PAUPER.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1832--The poor-law system]\r\n\r\nThe spirit of reform was impelling Lord Grey's Government in other\r\ndirections as well as in those which led to the abolition of slavery in\r\nthe Colonies, the improved conditions of the factory works and the\r\nintroduction of some better method for the collecting of tithes.  The\r\nstate of the poor laws all over the country had long been attracting the\r\nattention of thoughtful, philanthropic, and at the same time practical\r\nmen.  The administration of relief to the poor was still conducted, up to\r\nLord Grey's reforming Administration, on the same general principle as\r\nthat which had been embodied in the famous statute of Queen Elizabeth.\r\nThe manner in which that principle had been working during the\r\nintervening centuries was only another illustration of Burke's maxim\r\nabout systems founded on the heroic virtues to which we have lately made\r\nreference in this volume.  The statute of Elizabeth was based on the\r\nprinciple that the State, or at least the local authorities, ought to\r\nfind relief for all the deserving poor.  The duty of making provision for\r\nthe deserving poor was left in the hands of those who managed the affairs\r\nof the parishes, of whom the local clergy and magistrates were the\r\nprincipal personages.  The means had to be furnished by the taxpayers,\r\nand the influential men of each parish were left to decide as to the\r\nclaims and the deserts of the applicants.  There was no regular body\r\nanswerable to public opinion, nor was there indeed any practical way in\r\nwhich the public of a district could very effectively express itself.\r\nNothing could be better arranged for the development of that benevolent\r\nspirit which Sydney Smith describes as common to all humanity, and {222}\r\nunder the influence of which no sooner does A hear that B is in distress\r\nthan he thinks C ought at once to relieve him.  Men and women had only to\r\ngo and say that they were in distress, and some influential persons in\r\nthe neighborhood were sure to find that the easiest way of doing a\r\nbenevolent act was to provide them with orders for parochial relief\r\ninside or outside the workhouse.  There seemed to be a sort of easy-going\r\nimpression prevailing everywhere that when a man or a woman or a family\r\nhad once been set down for relief from the rates the enrolment ought to\r\nendure as a kind of property for life, and even as an inheritance for\r\nfuture generations.  The grant of parish relief under the old ways has\r\nbeen humorously likened to a State pension, which, when it has once been\r\ngiven, is never supposed to be revoked during the lifetime of the\r\nprivileged pensioner.  But the presumption in the case of those relieved\r\nby the parish had a still more abiding efficacy, for it was assumed that\r\nif a man got parish relief for himself and his family the beneficent\r\nendowment was to pass onward from generation to generation.  It is quite\r\ncertain that whole races of paupers began to grow up in the country, one\r\nfamily depending on the rates engendering another family, who were\r\nlikewise to be dependent on the rates.  Thus the vice of lazy and\r\nshiftless poverty was bequeathed from pauper sire to son.  In the case of\r\nthe ordinary man or woman there was no incitement to industry and\r\nperseverance.  The idle pauper would be fed in any case, and no matter\r\nhow hard he worked at the ordinary labor within his reach he could only\r\nhope to be poorly fed.  Indeed, even the man who had an honest\r\ninclination for honest labor was very much in the condition of the Irish\r\ncottier tenant, described many years afterwards by John Stuart Mill as\r\none who could neither benefit by his industry nor suffer by his\r\nimprovidence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1832--Some defects in the poor-law system]\r\n\r\nThe system may be said without exaggeration to have put a positive\r\npremium on immorality among the poorer class of women in a district, for\r\nan unmarried girl who had pauper offspring to show was sure to receive\r\nthe liberal benefit of parochial relief.  Pity was easily aroused for\r\n{223} her youth, her fall, her deserted condition when her lover or\r\nbetrayer had taken himself off to some other district.  Any tale of\r\ndeceived innocence was readily believed, and so far as physical comforts\r\ngo the unmarried mother was generally better off than the poor toiling\r\nand virtuous wife of the hard-worked laborer who found her family growing\r\nand her husband's wages without any increase.  Then, of course, there was\r\nall manner of jobbery, and a certain kind of corruption among parish\r\nofficials and the local tradesmen and employers of labor generally, which\r\ngrew to be an almost recognized incident of the local institutions.\r\nLabor could be got on cheaper terms than the ordinary market rates if the\r\nemployers could have men or women at certain seasons of the year whom the\r\nparish was willing to maintain in idleness for the rest of the time.\r\nSmall contracts of all kinds were commonly made, in this sort of fashion,\r\nbetween parish officials and local employers, and the whole system of\r\nrelief seemed to become converted into a corrupting influence, pervading\r\nthe social life and showing its effects in idleness, immorality, and an\r\ninfectious disease of pauperism.  Owing to the many misinterpretations of\r\nthe laws of settlement it was often easy for a rich and populous district\r\nto fling much of its floating pauperism on some poorer region, and thus\r\nit frequently happened that the more poverty-stricken the parish the\r\ngreater was the proportion of unsettled pauperism for which it had to\r\nprovide.  In many districts the poorer classes of ratepayers were\r\nscarcely a degree better off than the actual paupers whom they were taxed\r\nto support.  Thus many a struggling family became pauperized in the end\r\nbecause of the increase in the rates which the head of the family could\r\nno longer pay, and the exhausted breadwinner, having done his best to\r\nkeep himself and his family independent, had at last to eat the bread of\r\nidleness from parish relief, or to starve with his family by the\r\nroad-side.\r\n\r\nThings had come to such a pass indeed that many earnest and capable\r\nobservers, like Lord Brougham, Mr. Nassau Senior, and Miss Martineau,\r\nwere beginning to advocate the doctrine that no remedy could be found for\r\n{224} the system of legalized poor relief short of its total abolition.\r\nIt was gravely contended by many reformers, whose guiding spirit was pure\r\nlove of humanity, that the best course for the Government to take would\r\nbe to abolish the poor-relief system altogether, and leave the really\r\ndeserving poor to the mercy of private benevolence.  By such a measure,\r\nit was contended, private charity would be left to find out its own, and\r\nwould, before long, find out its own, and the charity thus given would\r\ncarry with it no demoralizing effect, but would be bestowed, as all true\r\ncharity is bestowed, with the object of enabling those whom it helped to\r\nhelp themselves after a while.  The owner of an estate, it was argued,\r\ncan easily find out where there is genuine distress among those who\r\ndepend upon him, and can sustain them through their time of need, so that\r\nwhen their hour of sickness or enforced idleness is over they may be able\r\nto begin again with renewed energy, and work with the honest purpose of\r\nmaking themselves independent.  It was urged that the operation of the\r\nlegalized poor law relief could only create new pauperism wherever its\r\nunwholesome touch was felt.  It would impress on the well-inclined and\r\nthe industrious the futility of honest and persevering endeavor, inasmuch\r\nas idleness could get itself better cared for than laborious poverty.\r\nIdleness and immorality, it was argued, were well housed and fed, while\r\nhonest independence and virtue were left outside in cold and hunger.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1832-33--A commission on poor-law relief]\r\n\r\nThe study of political economy was even already beginning to be a part of\r\nthe education of most men who took any guiding place or even any\r\nobservant interest in the national life.  Writers who dealt with such\r\nsubjects were beginning to find readers among the general public.  Some\r\nof the members of Lord Grey's own Administration had taken a close\r\ninterest in such questions.  The whole subject of poor relief and its\r\ndistribution was one of the earliest which came under the consideration\r\nof the Liberal Government after the passing of the Reform Bill.  It was\r\nclear that something would soon have to be done, and, as the Whig\r\nministers had a good deal of other work on their {225} hands, the natural\r\ncourse, at such a time, was to appoint a commission which should inquire\r\ninto the whole system of poor-law relief, and report to the Government as\r\nto the best means for its reorganization.  Such a commission was\r\nappointed and set at once to its work.  Among the commissioners and the\r\nassistant-commissioners nominated for the purpose were some men whose\r\nnames are well remembered in our own days.  One of those was Mr. Nassau\r\nSenior, a man of great ability and wide practical information, who\r\ndistinguished himself in many other fields of literary work, as well as\r\nthat which belonged to what may be called the literature of pure\r\neconomics.  Another was Mr. Edwin (afterwards Sir Edwin) Chadwick, who\r\nwas a living and an active presence, until a very short time ago, among\r\nthose who devoted themselves to the study and the propagation of what are\r\ncalled social science principles, and whose work was highly valued by so\r\nwell qualified a critic as John Stuart Mill.  The commission made careful\r\ninquiry into the operation of the poor-law relief system, and presented a\r\nreport which marked an epoch in our social history, and might well have a\r\ndeep interest even for the casual student of to-day.  The result of the\r\ninquiries made was such as to satisfy the commissioners that the\r\nadministration of the poor law had increased the evils of pauperism,\r\nwherever it found them already in existence, and had created and fostered\r\nevils of the same kind, even in regions which had not known them before\r\nthey were touched by its contagion.  The report of the commissioners\r\npronounced that the existing system of poor law was \"destructive to the\r\nindustry and honesty and forethought of the laborers, to the wealth and\r\nmorality of the employers of labor and the owners of property, and to the\r\nmutual good-will and happiness of all.\"  This may be thought a very\r\nsweeping condemnation, but the more closely the evidence is studied the\r\nmore clearly it will be seen that where the poor-relief system had any\r\neffect worth taking into calculation this was the sort of effect it\r\nproduced.  The real objects of the legalized poor-law relief system were\r\nwell and even liberally described in the report of the {226}\r\ncommissioners.  The object of poor relief, as the commissioners defined\r\nit, should be to make provision for that proportion, to be found in\r\nalmost every community, which is plunged into such a condition of\r\ndistress that it never can hope to be self-supporting again, and for that\r\nmore fluctuating proportion made up of those who at the time are unable\r\nto support themselves, but whom some temporary relief may enable to\r\nreturn to their former condition of independence.  In each class of cases\r\nit ought to be made equally clear, before public relief were called in,\r\nthat those in distress, continuous or temporary, had no near relatives in\r\na condition to afford them reasonable assistance without undue sacrifice.\r\nOf course it was understood that these conditions included the men and\r\nwomen who, owing to some temporary lack of employment, were actually\r\nunable to find the means of living by their own honest labor.  The ideas\r\nof the commissioners were not pedantically economical in their range, nor\r\ndid they insist that public relief must be given only as the reward of\r\npersonal integrity when visited by undeserved misfortune.  It was freely\r\nadmitted that even where men and women had allowed themselves, by\r\nidleness or carelessness, to sink into actual poverty, it was better to\r\ngive them temporary relief at the public expense than allow them to take\r\nup with the ways of crime, or leave them to pay the penalty of their\r\nwrongdoings by death from starvation.  But it was strictly laid down that\r\na healthy system of public relief was to help men and women for a time,\r\nin order that they might be able to help themselves once again, as soon\r\nas possible, and to make provision for those who had done their work and\r\ncould do no more, and who had no near relatives in a condition to keep\r\nthem from starvation.  The report of the commissioners pointed out that\r\nthe existing system \"collects and chains down the laborers in masses,\r\nwithout any reference to the demand for their labor; that, while it\r\nincreases their numbers, it impairs the means by which the fund for their\r\nsubsistence is to be reproduced, and impairs the motives for using those\r\nmeans which it suffers to exist; and that every year and every day these\r\nevils are becoming {227} more overwhelming in magnitude and less\r\nsusceptible of cure.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1833--Plans to improve the relief system]\r\n\r\nThe passages which we have quoted are taken from the recommendations of\r\nMr. Chadwick.  He goes on to say that, \"of those evils, that which\r\nconsists merely in the amount of the rates--an evil great when considered\r\nby itself, but trifling when compared with the moral effects which I am\r\ndeploring--might be much diminished by the combination of workhouses, and\r\nby substituting a rigid administration and contract management for the\r\nexisting scenes of neglect, extravagance, jobbery, and fraud.\"  Mr.\r\nChadwick points out that \"if no relief were allowed to be given to the\r\nable-bodied or to their families, except in return for adequate labor or\r\nin a well-regulated workhouse, the worst of the existing sources of\r\nevil--the allowance system--would immediately disappear; a broad line\r\nwould be drawn between the independent laborers and the paupers; the\r\nnumbers of paupers would be immediately diminished, in consequence of the\r\nreluctance to accept relief on such terms, and would be still further\r\ndiminished in consequence of the increased fund for the payment of wages\r\noccasioned by the diminution of rates; and would ultimately, instead of\r\nforming a constantly increasing proportion of our whole population,\r\nbecome a small, well-defined part of it, capable of being provided for at\r\nan expense less than one-half of the present poor rates.\"  And finally it\r\nwas urged that \"it is essential to every one of these improvements that\r\nthe administration of the poor laws should be intrusted, as to their\r\ngeneral superintendence, to one central authority with extensive powers;\r\nand, as to their details, to paid officers, acting under the\r\nconsciousness of constant superintendence and strict responsibility.\"  On\r\nthese reports and recommendations the new measure for the reorganization\r\nof the poor-law system was founded.  The main objects of the measure were\r\nto divide these countries, for poor-relief purposes, into areas of\r\nregular and, in a certain sense, of equal proportions, so that the whole\r\nburden of poverty should not be cast for relief on one particular\r\ndistrict, while a neighboring and much richer {228} district was able to\r\nescape from its fair measure of liability; to have the relief\r\nadministered not by local justices, or parish clergymen, but by\r\nrepresentative bodies duly elected and responsible to public opinion; and\r\nby the creation of one great central board charged with the duty of\r\nseeing to the proper administration of the whole system.  Thus, it will\r\nbe observed that the main principle of the Reform Bill, the principle of\r\nrepresentation, had been already accepted by statesmanship as the central\r\nidea of a department of State which had nothing to do with the struggles\r\nof political parties.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1834--Passage of the Poor-law Bill]\r\n\r\nThe measure when it came before Parliament met, of course, with strong\r\nopposition, first in the House of Commons and then in the House of Lords.\r\nMuch of the opposition came, no doubt, from men of old-fashioned ways,\r\nwho dreaded and hated any changes in any institutions to which they had\r\nbeen accustomed, and who held that even pauperism itself acquired a\r\ncertain sanctity from the fact that it had been fostered and encouraged\r\nby the wisdom of so many succeeding generations.  Some of the opposition,\r\nhowever, was inspired by feelings of a more purely sentimental, and\r\ntherefore perhaps of a more respectable order.  It was urged that the new\r\nsystem, if carried into law, would bear hardly on the deserving as well\r\nas the undeserving people; that the workhouse test would separate the\r\nhusband from wife, and the father from the children; and, above all, that\r\ncertain clauses of the new measure would leave the once innocent girl who\r\nhad been led astray by some vile tempter to bear the whole legal\r\nresponsibility as well as the public shame of her sin.  It is not\r\nnecessary for us now to go over at any length the long arguments which\r\nwere brought up on both sides of the controversy.  Many capable and\r\nhigh-minded observers were carried away by what may be called the\r\nsentimental side of the question, and forgot the enormous extent of the\r\nalmost national corruption which the measure was striving to remove, in\r\ntheir repugnance to some of the evils which it did not indeed create, but\r\nwhich it failed to abolish.  One weakness common to nearly all the\r\narguments employed against the {229} measure came from the facility there\r\nwas for putting out of sight altogether, during such a process of\r\nreasoning, the fact that the daily and hourly effect of the existing\r\nsystem was to force the deserving and hard-working poor to sink into that\r\nvery pauperism which it was the object of all law-makers to diminish, or\r\nto abolish altogether.  The wit of man could not devise any system of\r\npoor relief which should never go wrong in its application, should never\r\nbear harshly on men and women who deserved, and were striving for, an\r\nhonest and independent subsistence.\r\n\r\nThe Bill, however, was passed in the House of Commons by a large\r\nmajority.  It was carried after a hard fight through the House of Lords,\r\nand received the royal assent in August, 1834.  It should be said that\r\nthe Duke of Wellington, although usually strong and resolute as a party\r\nman, had good sense and fair spirit enough to make him a warm supporter\r\nof the measure, despite the vehement protestations of many of his own\r\nhabitual supporters.  Since that time it seems to be admitted by common\r\nconsent that the measure has accomplished all the beneficial results\r\nwhich its promoters anticipated from it, and has, in many of its\r\nprovisions, worked even better than some of its supporters had expected.\r\nOf course, our poor-law system has since that time been always undergoing\r\nmodifications of one kind or another, and public criticism is continually\r\npointing to the necessity for further improvement.  We hear every now and\r\nthen of cases in which, owing to local maladministration, some deserving\r\nmen and women, honestly struggling to keep their heads above pauperism,\r\nare left to perish of hunger or cold.  We read well-authenticated, only\r\ntoo well-authenticated, instances of actual starvation taking place in\r\nsome wealthy district of a great city.  We hear of parochial funds\r\nsquandered and muddled away; of the ratepayers' money wasted in\r\nextravagance, and worse than extravagance; of miserable courts and alleys\r\nwhere the deserving and undeserving poor are alike neglected and uncared\r\nfor.  But it would be utterly impossible that some such defects as these\r\nshould not be found in the management of any system worked by {230} human\r\nmechanism for such a purpose as the relief of a great nation's poverty.\r\nThe predominant fact is that we have a system which is based on the\r\nrepresentative principle, which is open to the inspection and the\r\ncriticism of the whole country, and which frankly declares itself the\r\nenemy of professional beggary and the helper of the poverty which is\r\nhonestly striving to help itself.  Much remains yet to be done for the\r\nimprovement of our national system of poor relief, but it has, at least,\r\nto be said that the reformed Parliament did actually establish a system\r\nfounded on just principles and responsible to public judgment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1833--The East India Company's charter]\r\n\r\nAnother of the great reforms which was accomplished in this age of reform\r\nfound its occasion when the time came for the renewal of the East India\r\nCompany's charter.  The Government and the Houses of Parliament had to\r\ndeal with the future administration of one of the greatest empires the\r\nworld had ever seen, brought together by events and forces the like of\r\nwhich had not been at work in any previous chapter of the world's\r\nhistory.  We have already traced, in this book, the growth of the East\r\nIndia Company's possessions, a growth brought about by a combination of\r\nthe qualities which belonged to the Alexanders and the Caesars, and of\r\nthe qualities also which go to the expansion of peaceful commerce and the\r\nopening up of markets for purely industrial enterprise.  The charter of\r\nthe Company had been renewed by legislation at long intervals, and the\r\nfirst reformed Parliament now found itself compelled to settle the\r\nconditions under which the charter should be renewed for another period\r\nof twenty years.  Mr. Molesworth justly remarks that \"it was a fortunate\r\ncircumstance that the Reform Bill had passed, and a Reform Parliament\r\nbeen elected, before the question of the renewal of the Company's charter\r\nwas decided; for otherwise the directors of this great Company and other\r\npersons interested in the maintenance of the monopolies and abuses\r\nconnected with it would in all probability have returned to Parliament,\r\nby means of rotten boroughs, a party of adherents sufficiently large to\r\nhave effectually prevented the Government and the House of Commons from\r\ndealing with {231} this great question in the manner in which the\r\ninterests of England and India alike demanded that it should be dealt\r\nwith.\"\r\n\r\nUp to the time at which we have now arrived the East India Company had an\r\nalmost absolute monopoly of the whole Chinese trade, as well as the\r\nIndian trade, and a control over the administration of India such as\r\nmight well have gratified the ambition of a despotic monarch.  The last\r\nrenewal of the Company's charter had been in 1813, and it was to run for\r\ntwenty years, so that Lord Grey's Government found themselves charged\r\nwith the task of making arrangements for its continuance, or its\r\nmodifications, or its abolition.  Some distinction had already been\r\neffected between the powers of the Company as the ruler of a vast Empire\r\nunder the suzerainty of England, and its powers as a huge commercial\r\ncorporation, or what we should now call a syndicate, but the company\r\nstill retained its monopoly of the India and China trade.  In the mean\r\ntime, however, the principles of political economy had been asserting a\r\ngrowing influence over the public intelligence, and the question was\r\ncoming to be asked, more and more earnestly, why a private company should\r\nbe allowed the exclusive right of conducting the trade between England\r\nand India and China.  An agitation against the monopoly began, as was but\r\nnatural, among the great manufacturing and commercial towns in the North\r\nof England.  Miss Martineau, in her \"History of the Thirty Years' Peace,\"\r\nascribes the beginning of this movement to a once well-known merchant and\r\nphilanthropist of Liverpool, the late Mr. William Rathbone, whom some of\r\nus can still remember having known in our earlier years.  Miss Martineau\r\nhad probably good reasons for making such a statement, and, at all\r\nevents, nothing is more likely than that such a movement began in\r\nLiverpool, and began with such a man.  In London the directors and\r\nsupporters of the East India Company were too powerful to give much\r\nchance to a hostile movement begun in the metropolis, and it needed the\r\nenergy, the commercial independence, and the advanced opinions of the\r\nnorthern cities to give it an effective start.\r\n\r\n{232}\r\n\r\nWhen the time came for the renewal of the Company's charter, the\r\nGovernment had made up their mind that the renewal should be conditional\r\non the abolition of the commercial monopoly, and that the trade between\r\nthe dominions of King William and the Eastern populations should be\r\nthrown open to all the King's subjects.  The measure passed through both\r\nHouses of Parliament with but little opposition.  Mr. Molesworth is\r\nperfectly right in his remarks as to the different sort of reception\r\nwhich would have been given to such a measure if the charter had come up\r\nfor renewal before the Act of Reform had abolished the nomination\r\nboroughs and the various other sham constituencies.  But it is a striking\r\nproof of the hold which the representative principle and the doctrines of\r\nfree-trade were already beginning to have on public opinion that the\r\nmonopoly of the East India Company should not have been able to make a\r\nharder fight for its existence.  The wonder which a modern reader will be\r\nlikely to feel as he studies the subject now is, not that the monopoly\r\nshould have been abolished with so little trouble, but that rational men\r\nshould have admitted so long the possibility of any justification for its\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nThe renewal of the Charter of the Bank of England gave an opportunity,\r\nduring the same session, for an alteration in the conditions under which\r\nthe Bank maintains its legalized position and its relations with the\r\nState, and for a further reorganization of those conditions, which was in\r\nitself a distinct advance in the commercial arrangements of the Empire.\r\nOther modifications have taken place from time to time since those days,\r\nand it is enough to say here that the alterations made by the first\r\nreformed Parliament, at the impulse of Lord Grey and his colleagues, were\r\nin keeping with the movement of the commercial spirit and went along the\r\npath illumined by the growing light of a sound political economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{233}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVII.\r\n\r\nPEEL'S FORLORN HOPE.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1834--Retirement of Lord Grey]\r\n\r\nLord Grey was growing tired of the work of that Administration.  It had\r\nbeen incessant work, and its great successes of later years had been\r\ncheckered by some disappointments, which, although not deep-reaching,\r\nwere irritating and disturbing.  Some of his most capable colleagues\r\nhad broken away from him, and he probably began to feel that the\r\nreformers all over the country expected more of him than he saw his way\r\nto accomplish.  In 1834 he asked to be relieved from the duties of his\r\noffice, and the King consented, probably with greater good-will than he\r\nhad felt in acceding to some of Lord Grey's previous requests, and\r\naccordingly Lord Grey ceased to be Prime Minister.  With his\r\nresignation of office Lord Grey passes out of this history and takes an\r\nabiding place in the Parliamentary history of his country.  He can\r\nhardly be called a great statesman, for he had been mainly instrumental\r\nin bringing to success and putting into legislative form the ideas of\r\ngreater men, but his must be regarded as a distinguished and noble\r\nfigure among England's Parliamentary leaders.  He was especially suited\r\nfor the work which it was his proud fortune to accomplish at the zenith\r\nof his power, for no one could be better fitted than he for the task of\r\ndiscountenancing the wild alarms which were felt by so many belonging\r\nto what were called the privileged classes at the thought of any\r\nmeasures of reform which might disturb the existing order of things,\r\nand lead to red ruin and the breaking-up of laws.  On Lord Grey's\r\nretirement he was succeeded as Prime Minister by Lord Melbourne, who\r\nhad previously been Home Secretary.  Lord Melbourne might have been\r\nthought just the sort of {234} person with whom King William could\r\neasily get on, because such a Prime Minister was not likely to vex his\r\nsovereign's unwilling ear by too many demands for rapid and\r\nfar-reaching reform.  Melbourne was a thoroughly easy, not to say lazy,\r\nman.  He was certainly not wanting in intellect, he had some culture,\r\nhe was a great reader of books and a great lover of books, and he was\r\noften only too glad to escape into literary talk and literary gossip\r\nfrom discussions on political questions and measures to be introduced\r\ninto Parliament.  He was fond of society, made himself generally\r\nagreeable to women, and was usually well acquainted with the passing\r\nscandals of high social life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1834--Peel to be Premier]\r\n\r\nOne might, indeed, have thought that such a man was just the minister\r\nin whom King William would find a congenial companion and adviser.  But\r\nthe truth was that the King had grown tired of the Whig statesmen, and\r\nhad long been looking out for an opportunity to get rid of them on easy\r\nterms.  Perhaps he did not quite like the idea of telling a man of Lord\r\nGrey's stately demeanor that he wished to dispense with his services\r\nand saw in Lord Melbourne a minister who could be approached on any\r\nsubject without much sensation of awe.  However that may be, the King\r\nsoon found what seemed to him a satisfactory opportunity for ridding\r\nhimself of the presence of his Whig advisers.  Lord Althorp was\r\nsuddenly raised to the House of Lords by the death of his father.  Earl\r\nSpencer, and of course some rearrangement of the Ministry became\r\nnecessary, as it would not be possible that the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer should have a ministerial place anywhere but in the House\r\nwhich has the levying of the taxes and the spending of the money.  When\r\nLord Melbourne came to advise with his sovereign on the subject the\r\nKing informed him, in the most direct and off-hand manner, that he\r\ncontemplated a much more complete rearrangement than Lord Melbourne had\r\nsuggested, and, in fact, that he had made up his mind to get rid of the\r\npresent Government altogether.  Lord Melbourne, of course, bowed to the\r\nwill of his master, and, indeed, was not the sort of man to take a\r\n{235} dismissal from office greatly to heart, believing it, no doubt,\r\nquite likely that some restoration to office might await him, and\r\npossibly feeling that life had some enjoyments left for him even though\r\nhe were never again to be Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nThe King determined to send for Sir Robert Peel and intrust him with\r\nthe task of forming an Administration.  William had, as might naturally\r\nbe expected of him, consulted in the first instance with the Duke of\r\nWellington.  Wellington, with the practical good sense which was a part\r\nof his character, had told the sovereign that at such a time it was\r\nfutile to think of calling upon any one to become Prime Minister who\r\nhad not a seat in the House of Commons.  As the King was resolved to\r\nhave a new Administration, Peel was obviously the man to be intrusted\r\nwith the task of forming it, and therefore the King sent for him at\r\nonce.  But Peel was not in England; he had gone with his wife to Italy,\r\nand, as we know from his own published letters, he had not entered into\r\nany communication, even with the Duke of Wellington, as to the probable\r\nmovements of political affairs in his absence, not supposing for a\r\nmoment that any emergency could arise at home which might make it\r\nnecessary for him to cut short his holiday and return to the working\r\nground of Westminster.  A special messenger had to be sent off at once\r\nto convey to Peel the wishes of his sovereign, and one has to stop and\r\nthink over things a little before he can quite realize what it meant in\r\nthose days, which seem so near our own, to send a special message from\r\nLondon to the heart of Italy.  Peel was at Rome, and had just returned\r\nwith his wife one night from a great ball given by a celebrated Italian\r\nPrincess, when he received the letter which urged him to come back and\r\nbecome for the first time Prime Minister of England.  Peel's mind was\r\nat once made up.  That sense of duty which always guided his movements\r\ndictated his reply.  There was for him no question of personal pride or\r\nambition to be gratified, or of any graceful effort to affect the ways\r\nof one who modestly shrinks from a task beyond his power.  He saw that\r\nhis sovereign needed {236} his immediate services, and that was enough\r\nfor him.  He and his wife were just on the eve of what had promised to\r\nbe a delightful visit to Naples, but the visit to Naples was put off\r\nwithout a second thought to the indefinite future, and the statesman\r\nand his wife set out at once on their journey to London.  The\r\npreparations for such a journey at that time were such as might give\r\npause even to an experienced explorer in our own easy-going and\r\nluxurious age.  Sir Robert Peel, of course, had to travel by private\r\ncarriage.  He had to traverse more than one State in order to reach the\r\nsea at Calais.  The roads were dangerous in many places, and Peel had\r\nto take some well-armed servants with him.  He had to go well provided\r\nwith the most elaborate official passports.  He had even to obtain a\r\nspecial passport for himself, lest, in the event of his wife finding\r\nthe constant travel too much for her, she might have to take rest at\r\nsome town on the way, and Peel, if he attempted to continue his\r\njourney, might be stopped somewhere until he had satisfactorily\r\naccounted for the disappearance of the lady who was described in the\r\noriginal passports as his travelling companion and his wife.  The\r\njourney was interrupted by unforeseen obstacles in several places.  At\r\none spot the rising of a river relentlessly barricaded the progress of\r\nthe travellers for many hours.  At another point a bridge was broken\r\ndown.  In France, Peel and his wife were brought to a stand at the city\r\nof Lyons because that city happened just then to be in a state of\r\nsiege, and the travellers had to furnish satisfactory evidence that\r\nthey were not emissaries of some revolutionary propaganda.  It took\r\ntwelve days to cover the distance from Rome to Dover, and, except for\r\nsuch delays as have just been mentioned, our travellers had gone on\r\nnight and day without stopping.  Even when they arrived at Dover, Peel\r\ntook no thought about rest, but journeyed on all night until he reached\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1834--The difficulties that beset Peel]\r\n\r\nPeel himself tells us in his memoirs that the long travel had at least\r\nthe advantage of giving him time enough to think out his course of\r\naction and the best way of serving his sovereign and his country.  The\r\njourney, he says, {237} allowed him to do this coolly and without\r\ninterruption.  He certainly had time enough for the purpose, but it\r\nmust have needed all Peel's strength of character to enable him to give\r\nhis mind up to such considerations during a course so toilsome, so\r\nrugged, so dangerous, and often so rudely interrupted.  He arrived in\r\nLondon at an early hour on the morning of December 9, 1834, and he set\r\noff at once to present himself to the King, by whom, it need hardly be\r\nsaid, he was very cordially welcomed.  The welcome became all the more\r\nwarm because he was willing to accept the important task which the King\r\ndesired to intrust to him, and would enter without delay on the work of\r\nendeavoring to form a Ministry.  Now, in order to do justice to Peel's\r\npatriotic purpose in undertaking this difficult task, we have to bear\r\nin mind that he did not personally approve of the King's action in\r\nbreaking up the Melbourne Administration, or even of the manner in\r\nwhich it had been broken up.  He knew well enough that the King had\r\ngrown tired of the Whig Ministry, but he did not think the King's\r\npersonal feelings were a complete justification for William's dismissal\r\nof a set of men whom he had consented to place in power.  Peel did not\r\nregard the mere necessity for a rearrangement consequent on Lord\r\nAlthorp's removal to the House of Lords as anything like a fitting\r\nexcuse for the break-up of the whole Government.  More than that, Peel\r\nhad no confidence in the chances of a new Conservative Administration\r\njust then.  It was not encouraging to a statesman about to form his\r\nfirst Cabinet to have to believe, as Peel did, that such a Government\r\nwould be left very much at the mercy of the Opposition, and in more\r\nthan one important or even impending question might at any time be\r\noutvoted in the House of Commons.  None the less, however, was Peel\r\nresolved to stand by his sovereign, who appeared to be in a difficulty.\r\nThe same sense of public duty, according to his conception of public\r\nduty, which guided him at every great crisis of his political career\r\ndecided his action in this instance.  He set himself to the work of\r\nforming an Administration in which he proposed to take under his own\r\ncharge the functions of {238} Prime Minister and the office of\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer.  He knew that he could count on the\r\nsupport of the Duke of Wellington, and to Wellington he offered the\r\npost of Secretary for Foreign Affairs, which was at once accepted.\r\nThen he wrote to Sir James Graham and to Lord Stanley.  Both refused.\r\nSir James Graham, although he declined to accept office, promised Peel\r\nall the support he could give consistently with his own judgment and\r\nhis own political views.  Lord Stanley wrote a letter to Peel which has\r\neven still both historical and personal interest.  Its historical\r\ninterest consists in the clear exposition it contains of the various\r\nquestions which then divided the two great parties in the State.  Its\r\npersonal interest is found in the fact that it shows Lord Stanley as\r\nthe convinced reformer, who sees no possibility of his joining an\r\nAdministration about to be created by a statesman whose whole career\r\nhas been antagonistic to political reform.  Those of us who remember\r\nthe brilliant orator Lord Derby, by whom the office of Prime Minister\r\nwas three times held, find it hard to think of him as anything but a\r\nsteady-going Conservative at heart, and may be excused a shock of\r\nsurprise when they are bidden to remember that in 1834 the same man,\r\nthen Lord Stanley, declared that he could not serve under Peel because\r\nPeel was not reformer enough all round to secure his co-operation.\r\nLord Stanley pointed out, in his letter, that between Peel and himself\r\nthere had been a complete difference of opinion on almost every great\r\npublic question except that which concerned the State Church, and he\r\nreminded Peel that so lately as on the occasion of Lord Grey's\r\nretirement from office the Duke of Wellington had seized the\r\nopportunity of publicly condemning the whole policy of the Whig\r\nAdministration.  Under these circumstances Lord Stanley declared that,\r\nin his opinion, it would be injurious to his own character and\r\ninjurious to the new Government as well if he were to accept the offer\r\nof a place in such an Administration.  He had left Lord Grey's\r\nGovernment because he differed with Lord Grey on one question alone,\r\nwhich then had to be dealt with, and he could not join a Government of\r\nwhich {239} Peel and Wellington were to be the leaders, from whom he\r\nhad differed on almost every great political question that had engaged\r\nthe attention of the country during his time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1834--Peel forms his Ministry]\r\n\r\nPeel had nothing for it but to go on with his task and form the best\r\nAdministration he could.  Lord Lyndhurst was once again to be Lord\r\nChancellor, and in such a man Peel certainly found a colleague who had\r\nno superior either as a lawyer or a debater in the House of Lords.\r\nSome of us who can still remember having heard Lord Lyndhurst deliver\r\nlong and powerful speeches in the House of Lords, compelling the\r\nattention and the admiration of every listener when the orator himself\r\nhad long left his eightieth year behind him, will feel sure that Sir\r\nRobert Peel's first Administration was adequately represented in the\r\nhereditary chamber.  It is not necessary to introduce here a full list\r\nof the new Ministry, but there are three names which call for special\r\nmention.  These are the names of three young men who then entered\r\nministerial office for the first time, and with whom the world\r\nafterwards became well acquainted, each according to his different way.\r\nOne was William Ewart Gladstone, who became Junior Lord of the\r\nTreasury, and whom the world has long since recognized as the greatest\r\nstatesman and the greatest master of the House of Commons known to the\r\nreign of Queen Victoria.  The second was Sidney Herbert, who was for\r\nmany years one of the most ready, accomplished, and brilliant debaters\r\nin that House, and whose premature death cut short a career that had\r\nseemed to be steadily rising from day to day.  The third was a man\r\nwhose political life has long since been forgotten, but whose name is\r\nwell remembered because of his success in quite a different\r\nfield--Winthrop Mackworth Praed, the charming author of delightful\r\nverses, the founder of that English school of minstrelsy which sings\r\nfor the drawing-room and the club-room, the feasts and the fashions,\r\nthe joys and the well-ordered troubles of the West-End.  Sidney Herbert\r\nand Praed were made joint Secretaries to the Board of Control, the\r\ndepartment established by Pitt for directing the Government of India.\r\n\r\n{240}\r\n\r\nThe new Prime Minister believed that it would be in every way more\r\nsuitable to the convenience of the country that he and his colleagues\r\nshould submit their political claims and purposes to the judgment of\r\nthe constituencies by means of a general election.  A dissolution\r\naccordingly took place, and Peel issued an address to the electors of\r\nTamworth, which will always be regarded as an important political\r\ndocument.  Although Peel had been an opponent of the principles\r\nembodied in the Reform Bill, no reformer in the country understood\r\nbetter than he did the impossibility, at such a time, of carrying on\r\nthe work of the Government without a thorough understanding between the\r\nMinistry and the Parliament, between the Parliament and the public\r\nout-of-doors.  No one knew better than Peel that the time had gone by,\r\nnever to return, when an English minister could rule as an English\r\nminister even so lately as in the days of Pitt had done, merely by the\r\napproval and the support of a monarch without the approval and support\r\nof a majority of the electors.  When, therefore, Peel prepared his\r\naddress to his Tamworth constituents he knew perfectly well that his\r\nwords were meant, not merely for the friendly ears of the little\r\nconstituency, but for the consideration of the whole country.  The same\r\nfeeling actuated the great statesman during the entire course of his\r\nsubsequent career, and the constituency of Tamworth had therefore the\r\nadvantage of being favored from time to time with election addresses\r\nwhich form chapters of the highest interest and importance in the\r\nhistorical literature of the country.  The address which he issued to\r\nhis constituents before the general election in December, 1834,\r\nproclaimed, in fact, the opening of a new political era in England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1834-34--Peel's Tamworth address]\r\n\r\nPeel made frank announcement that, so far as he and his friends were\r\nconcerned, the controversy about Parliamentary reform had come to an\r\nend.  By him and by them the decision of Parliament, which sanctioned\r\nthe introduction of the Reform Bill of 1832, was accepted as a final\r\nsettlement of the question.  Peel declared that he regarded it as \"a\r\nsettlement which no friend to the peace {241} of the country would\r\nattempt to disturb, either by direct or by insidious means.\"  Of course\r\nit was not to be understood that Peel had any intention of describing\r\nthe Reform Act of 1832 as the last word of the Reformers' creed, and\r\nthe close of all possible controversy with regard to the construction\r\nof the whole Parliamentary system.  Peel no more meant to convey any\r\nidea of this kind than did Lord John Russell, when he used the word\r\nfinality in connection with the Reform Act, mean to convey the idea\r\nthat, according to his conviction, Parliament was never again to be\r\ninvited to extend the electoral franchise or to modify the conditions\r\nunder which the votes of the electors were to be given.  The\r\nannouncement which Peel made to the electors of Tamworth, and to the\r\nworld in general, was that he and his friends recognized the\r\nestablishment of the representative principle in English political\r\nlife, accepted the new order of things as a result of a lawful decree,\r\nand separated themselves altogether from the antiquated Toryism which\r\nenshrined the old ideas of government as a religious faith, and revered\r\nthe memory of the nomination boroughs, as the Jacobites revered the\r\nmemory of the Stuarts.  With the issue of Peel's Tamworth address in\r\nthe December of 1834, the antique Tory, the Tory who made Toryism of\r\nthe ante-reform days a creed and a cult, may be said to disappear\r\naltogether from the ranks of practical English politicians.  The Tory\r\nof the old school appears, no doubt, here and there through all\r\nParliamentary days down to our own time.  We saw him in both Houses of\r\nParliament as a heroic, unteachable opponent of Peel himself, of Bright\r\nand Cobden, of Gladstone, and sometimes even of Lord Derby and of Lord\r\nSalisbury, but he was merely a living protest against the succession of\r\nnew ideas, and was no longer to be counted as a practical politician.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel soon saw that he had not gained much by his appeal to\r\nthe constituencies.  The results of the general election showed that\r\nthe Conservatives had made a considerable addition to their numbers in\r\nthe House of Commons, but showed also that they were still in a\r\ndisheartening minority.  The return of the first Reform {242}\r\nParliament had, indeed, exhibited them for the time as completely down\r\nin the dust, for there was a majority of more than three hundred\r\nagainst them, and now the Liberal majority was hardly more than one\r\nhundred.  A very hopeful Conservative, or a Conservative who had a\r\nprofound faith in the principles of antique Toryism, might fill himself\r\nwith the fond belief that this increase in the Conservative vote\r\nforetold a gradual return to the good old days.  But Peel was too\r\npractical a statesman to be touched for a moment by any such illusion.\r\nHe had fully expected some increase in the Tory vote.  He knew, as well\r\nas anybody could know, that there had been some disappointment among\r\nthe more advanced and impatient reformers all over the country with the\r\nachievements of the first reformed Parliament, and, indeed, with the\r\nAct of Reform itself.  After victory in a long-contested political\r\nbattle there comes, almost as a matter of course, a season of relaxed\r\neffort among the ranks of the victors, for which allowance would have\r\nto be made in the mind of such a statesman as Peel, and, in this\r\ninstance, allowance also had to be made for a falling off in the\r\nenthusiasm of those who had helped to carry the Reform movement to\r\nsuccess, and found themselves in the end left out of all its direct\r\nadvantages.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1835--The Office of Speaker]\r\n\r\nPeel saw at once that his Government must be absolutely at the mercy of\r\nthe Opposition when any question arose on which it suited the purposes\r\nof the Opposition leaders to rally their whole forces around them and\r\ntake a party division.  So far as the ordinary business of the session\r\nwas concerned, the Ministry might get on well enough, for there must\r\nhave been a considerable amount of routine work which would not provoke\r\nthe Opposition to a trial of strength; but if chance or hostile\r\nstrategy should bring about at any moment a controversy which called\r\nfor a strictly party division, then the Government must go down.\r\nNothing can be more trying to a proud-spirited statesman in office than\r\nthe knowledge that he can only maintain his Government, from day to\r\nday, because, for one reason or another, it does not suit the\r\nconvenience of the Opposition to press some vote which must leave him\r\nand his colleagues {243} in a distinct minority.  Peel had not long to\r\nwait before he found substantial evidence to justify his most gloomy\r\nforebodings.\r\n\r\nThe new Parliament met on February 19, 1835.  The first trial of\r\nstrength was on the election of a new Speaker.  The former occupant of\r\nthe office having been put forward for re-election, the Government were\r\nbeaten by a majority of ten.  Now this was a very damaging event for\r\nthe ministers, and also an event somewhat unusual in the House of\r\nCommons.  There is generally a sort of understanding, more or less\r\ndistinctly expressed, that the candidate put forward by the Government\r\nfor the office of Speaker is to be a man on whom both sides of the\r\nHouse can agree.  It is obviously undesirable that there should be a\r\nparty struggle over the appointment of the official who is assumed to\r\nhold an absolutely impartial position and is not supposed to be the\r\nmere favorite of either side of the House.  In later years there has\r\noften been a distinct arrangement, or, at all events, a clear\r\nunderstanding, between the Government and the Opposition on this\r\nsubject, and a candidate is not put forward unless there is good reason\r\nto assume that he will be acceptable to the two great political\r\nparties.  In this instance no such understanding existed, or had been\r\nsought for.  The Opposition set up a candidate of their own, and the\r\nnominee of the Government was defeated.  There was, however, one\r\ncondition in this defeat which, although it did not take away from the\r\nominous character of the event, might, to a certain extent, have\r\nrelieved Peel from the necessity of regarding it as an absolute party\r\ndefeat.  The majority had been obtained for the Opposition by the\r\nsupport of the Irish members who followed the leadership of Daniel\r\nO'Connell, and thus Sir Robert Peel saw himself outvoted by a\r\ncombination of two parties, one of them regarded with peculiar disfavor\r\nby the majority of the English public on both sides of the political\r\nfield.  It was something for the followers of the Government to be able\r\nto say that their Liberal opponents had only been able to score a\r\nsuccess by the help of the unpopular Irish vote, and it became, in\r\nfact, a new accusation against the {244} Liberals that they had traded\r\non the favor of O'Connell and his Irish followers.  From about this\r\ntime the Irish vote has always played an important part in all the\r\nstruggles of parties in the House of Commons; and it will be observed\r\nthat the English Party, whether Liberal or Tory, against which that\r\nvote is directed is always ready with epithets of scorn and anger for\r\nthe English Party for whom that vote has been given.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1835--Peel and the Opposition]\r\n\r\nSeveral other humiliations awaited Peel as the session went on.\r\nSometimes he was saved from defeat on a question of finance by the help\r\nof the more advanced Liberals, who came to his assistance when certain\r\nof his own Tory followers were prepared to desert him because his views\r\non some question of taxation were much too new-fashioned for their own\r\nold-fashioned notions.  Every one who has paid any attention to\r\nParliamentary history can understand how distressing is the position of\r\na minister who has no absolute majority at his command, and how more\r\ndistressing still is the position of a minister who can only look to\r\nchance disruptions and combinations of parties for any possible\r\nmajority.  Peel bore himself throughout all the trials of that most\r\ntrying time with indomitable courage and with unfailing skill.  Never\r\nduring his whole career did he prove himself more brilliant and more\r\nfull of resource than as the leader of what might be called an utterly\r\nhopeless struggle.  The highest tribute has been paid to his\r\nnever-failing tact and temper during that trying ordeal by his\r\nprincipal opponent in the House of Commons, Lord John Russell.  Russell\r\nwas now the leader of the Liberal Opposition in the House of Commons,\r\nand the struggle of parties was once again illustrated by a sort of\r\ncontinuous Parliamentary duel between two rival leaders.  The same\r\nphenomenon had been seen, from time to time, in the days of Queen Anne\r\nand in the days of the Georges; and it was seen again, at intervals,\r\nduring some of the most vivid and fascinating passages of Parliamentary\r\nhistory in the reign of Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\nThe crisis, however, came soon to this first Ministry of Sir Robert\r\nPeel.  Peel had announced, in a reasonable and {245} manful spirit,\r\nconsidering how the task of holding together a Ministry had been\r\nimposed on him and the temptation which it afforded for the attacks of\r\nirresponsible enemies, that he would not resign office on any side\r\nissue or question of purely factitious importance, and that he would\r\nhold his place unless defeated by a vote of want of confidence or a\r\nvote of censure.  He challenged the leader of the Opposition to test\r\nthe feeling of the House by a division on a question of that nature.\r\nLord John Russell refused to take any such course, declaring that he\r\nbelieved it his duty to wait and see what might be the nature of the\r\nmeasures of reform which the Government had promised to introduce\r\nbefore inviting the House to say whether the Government deserved or did\r\nnot deserve its confidence.  Some of the measures announced by the\r\nGovernment had to do with the reform of the ecclesiastical courts and\r\nthe maintenance of Church discipline, and Sir Robert Peel had himself\r\ngiven notice of a measure to deal with the Irish tithe system, the\r\nprincipal object of which was understood to be the transfer of the\r\nliability of the payment of tithes from the shoulders of the tenant to\r\nthe shoulders of the landlord.  It was not unreasonable that the\r\nOpposition should proclaim it their policy to wait and see what the\r\nTory ministers really proposed to do before assailing them with a\r\ndirect and general vote of want of confidence.  Even, however, if the\r\nOpposition had been inclined to linger before inviting a real trial of\r\nstrength, there was a feeling growing up all over the country which\r\nseemed impatient of mere episodical encounters leading to nothing in\r\nparticular.  The leaders of the Opposition had a very distinct policy\r\nin their minds, and on March 30, 1835, it found its formal expression.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell moved a resolution which called upon the House to\r\nresolve itself into a committee \"in order to consider the present state\r\nof the Church established in Ireland, with the view of applying any\r\nsurplus of revenues not required for the spiritual care of its members\r\nto the general education of all classes of the people without\r\ndistinction of religious persuasion.\"  Now here, it will be seen, {246}\r\nwas the battle-ground distinctly marked out on which the two political\r\nparties must come, sooner or later, to a decisive struggle.  About the\r\ncollection of tithes, about the imposition of tithes, about the class\r\nof the community on whom the direct responsibility for the payment of\r\ntithes ought to fall, there might possibly be a basis of agreement\r\nfound between Tories and Whigs.  But when there arose a question as to\r\nthe appropriation of the Church revenues, there the old doctrines and\r\nthe new, the old Tories and the new Reformers, came into irreconcilable\r\nantagonism.  The creed of the Tories was that the revenues of the\r\nChurch belonged to the Church itself, and that if the Church had a\r\nsurplus of funds here or there for any one particular purpose that\r\nsurplus could be applied by it to some of its other purposes, but that\r\nno legislature had any right to say to the Church, \"You have more money\r\nhere than is needed for your own rights, and we have a right to take\r\npart of it away from you and apply it for the uses of the general\r\npublic.\"  The Government, therefore, accepted Lord John Russell's\r\nresolution as a distinct challenge to a trial of strength on an\r\nessential question of policy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1835--William Ewart Gladstone]\r\n\r\nThe debate which followed lasted through four days, and all the members\r\nof the House on both sides took part in it.  The reports of that\r\nmomentous debate may be read with the deepest interest even at this\r\nday, when some of the prophecies intended as terrible warnings by some\r\nof the Conservative orators have long since been verified as facts, and\r\nare calmly accepted by all parties as the inevitable results of\r\nrational legislation.  Sir Robert Peel, Lord Stanley, Sir James Graham,\r\nand most others who spoke on the Ministerial side spoke with one voice,\r\nin warning the House of Commons that if it claimed a right to touch any\r\nof the revenues of the Irish State Church in order to appropriate them\r\nfor the general education of the Irish people, the result must be that\r\nthe time would come when the Irish Church itself would no longer be\r\nheld sacred against the desecrating hand of the modern reformer, would\r\nbe treated as no longer necessary to the welfare of the Irish people,\r\nand would be severed from the State and left upon a level {247} with\r\nthe Roman Catholic Church and the various dissenting denominations.\r\n\r\nOne appeal which may be said to run through the whole of the speeches\r\non the side of the Government is familiar to the readers and the\r\naudiences of all political debates, whore any manner of Reform is under\r\ndiscussion.  \"You are asked\"--so runs the argument--\"to adopt this sort\r\nof policy in order to satisfy the demands of a certain class of the\r\npopulation; but how do you know, what guarantee can you give us, that\r\nwhen we have granted these demands they will be content and will not\r\nimmediately begin to ask for more?  We granted Catholic Emancipation in\r\norder to satisfy Ireland, and now is Ireland satisfied?  It was only\r\nthe other day we granted Catholic Emancipation, and now already Ireland\r\ndeclares, through her representatives, that she ought to have part of\r\nthe revenues of the Irish State Church taken away from that Church and\r\napplied to the common uses of the Irish people.  If she gets even that,\r\nwill Ireland be contented?  Will she not go on to demand repeal of the\r\nUnion?\"  We turn with peculiar interest to the speech of a young Tory\r\nmember which was listened to with great attention during the debate,\r\nand was believed to contain unmistakable promise of an important\r\npolitical career.  So indeed it did, although the promise that career\r\nactually realized was not altogether of the kind which most of its\r\naudience were led to anticipate.  It was the speech of Mr. William\r\nEwart Gladstone.  \"The present motion,\" said Mr. Gladstone, \"opens a\r\nboundless road--it will lead to measure after measure, to expedient\r\nafter expedient, till we come to the recognition of the Roman Catholic\r\nreligion as the national one.  In principle, we propose to give up the\r\nProtestant Establishment.  If so, why not abandon the political\r\ngovernment of Ireland and concede the repeal of the legislative union.\"\r\n\"There is no principle,\" he went on to say, \"on which the Protestant\r\nChurch can be permanently upheld, but that it is the Church which\r\nteaches the truth.\"  That, he insisted, was the position which the\r\nHouse ought to maintain without allowing its decision to be affected by\r\nthe mere {248} assertion, even if the assertion were capable of proof,\r\nthat the revenues of the State Church in Ireland were entirely out of\r\nproportion to the spiritual needs of the Protestant population.  Mr.\r\nGladstone, however, had the mind of the financier even in those early\r\ndays of his career, and he was at some pains to argue that the\r\ndisproportion between the numbers of the Protestant and the Catholic\r\npopulations in Ireland was not so great as Lord John Russell had\r\nasserted.  He made out this part of his case ingeniously enough by\r\nincluding in the Protestant population in Ireland all the various\r\nmembers of the dissenting denominations, many or most of whom were as\r\nlittle likely to attend the administrations of the Established Church\r\nas the Roman Catholics themselves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1835--Defeat of Peel's Ministry]\r\n\r\nGladstone's speech was thoroughly consistent in its opposition to Lord\r\nJohn Russell's resolution on the ground that that resolution, if\r\npressed to its legitimate conclusion, assailed the whole principle on\r\nwhich the State Church in Ireland was founded.  \"I hope,\" he said, \"I\r\nshall never live to see the day when such a system shall be adopted in\r\nthis country, for the consequences of it to public men will be\r\nlamentable beyond all description.  If those individuals who are called\r\non to fulfil the high function of administering public affairs should\r\nbe compelled to exclude from their consideration the elements of true\r\nreligion, and to view various strange and conflicting doctrines in the\r\nsame light, instead of administering those noble functions, they will\r\nbecome helots and slaves.\"  The weakness of Mr. Gladstone's case was\r\nfound in the fact that he insisted on regarding the State Church in\r\nIreland as resting on precisely the same foundations as those which\r\nupheld the State Church in England.  The truth was afterwards brought\r\nhome to him that every argument which could be fairly used to justify\r\nthe maintenance of the State Church in England was but another argument\r\nfor the abolition of the State Church in Ireland--a work which it\r\nbecame at last his duty to accomplish.  \"I shall content myself,\" said\r\nDaniel O'Connell in his speech in the debate, \"with laying down the\r\nbroad principle that the {249} emoluments of a Church ought not to be\r\nraised from a people who do not belong to it.  Ireland does not ask for\r\na Catholic Establishment.  The Irish desire political equality in every\r\nrespect, except that they would not accept a single shilling for their\r\nChurch.\"\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel made a speech which was at once very powerful and very\r\nplausible.  It was not, perhaps, pitched in a very exalted key, but it\r\nwas full of argument, at once subtle and telling.  He challenged the\r\naccuracy of Lord John Russell's figures, and declaimed against the\r\ninjustice of inviting the House to pass a resolution founded on\r\nstatistics which it had as yet no possible opportunity of verifying or\r\neven of examining.  He pointed out that the Government had already\r\ngiven notice of their intention to bring in measures to deal with the\r\nvery question concerned in Lord John Russell's resolution; and he asked\r\nwhat sincerity there could be in the purposes of men who professed a\r\ndesire to amend as quickly as possible the tithe system in Ireland, and\r\nwho yet were eager to deprive the Government of any chance of bringing\r\nforward the measures which they had prepared in order to accomplish\r\nthat very object.  The main argument of the speech was directed not so\r\nmuch against the policy embodied in the resolution of Lord John\r\nRussell, as against the manner in which it was proposed to carry out\r\nthat policy.  Sir Robert Peel declared that the object of the\r\nOpposition was not to effect any improvement in the relations of the\r\nState Church of Ireland and the people of Ireland, but simply and\r\nsolely to turn out the Government.  Why not, he asked, come to the\r\npoint boldly and at once?  Why not bring forward a vote of censure on\r\nthe Government, or a vote of want of confidence in the Government, and\r\nthus compel them, if defeated, to go out of office, instead of\r\nendeavoring to enforce on them the adoption of a resolution dealing\r\nwith questions which the Government had already promised to make the\r\nsubject of legislation, and without waiting to hear what manner of\r\nlegislation they were prepared to introduce?\r\n\r\nThere was an eloquent defiance in the closing words of Peel's speech.\r\nThe great minister knew that defeat was {250} awaiting him, and he\r\nshowed himself resolved to meet it half way.  At three o'clock on the\r\nmorning of April 3 the division on the resolution of Lord John Russell\r\ntook place.  There were 322 votes for the resolution and 289 against\r\nit.  The resolution was therefore carried by a majority of 33.  The\r\nstudent of history will observe with interest that the abolition of the\r\nIrish State Church was the result of a series of resolutions carried by\r\nMr. Gladstone in the House of Commons in 1868, and afterwards embodied\r\nin an act of legislation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1835--Melbourne and Brougham]\r\n\r\nThe debate on Lord John Russell's resolution was carried on for a few\r\ndays longer, but it was chiefly concerned with mere questions as to the\r\nform in which the Ministry were called upon to give effect to the wish\r\nof the majority, and submit the resolution to the King.  There was no\r\nheart or practical purpose in these debates, for everybody already knew\r\nwhat the end must be.  On April 8 Sir Robert Peel announced to the\r\nHouse that he could not take any part in giving effect to the\r\nresolution, and that, therefore, he and his colleagues had determined\r\non resigning their offices.  The course taken by Peel was thoroughly\r\nhonest, consistent, and upright, and Lord John Russell bore prompt and\r\nwilling testimony to the constitutional propriety of the retiring Prime\r\nMinister's resolve.  The Peel Ministry had come to its end.  The\r\ncountry had been put to the trouble and expense of a general election,\r\nvaluable time had been wasted, legislative preparations had been thrown\r\naway, and everything was now back again in just the same condition as\r\nwhen the King made up his mind to dismiss the Melbourne Administration.\r\nThe whole blame for the muddle rested on the King, who now found\r\nhimself compelled to take up again with Lord Melbourne just as if\r\nnothing had happened.  The King, indeed, made an attempt to induce Lord\r\nGrey to come out of his retirement and form another Ministry; but Lord\r\nGrey was not to be prevailed upon to accept such an invitation, and\r\nWilliam had to gulp down his personal objections and invite Lord\r\nMelbourne to come back once more and take charge of the Government of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n{251}\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne had no difficulty in forming an Administration, and it\r\nwas on the whole very much the same in its composition as that which\r\nKing William had so rudely dismissed only a few months before.  But\r\nthere were some new names in the list, and there was one very\r\nremarkable omission.  Lord Brougham was not one of the members of the\r\nnew Government.  Lord Melbourne had made up his mind that if, perhaps,\r\nthere could be no living without such a colleague, there certainly\r\ncould be no living with him, and he preferred the chance to the\r\ncertainty.  The greatest sensation was produced all over the country\r\nwhen it was found that Lord Brougham was to have nothing to do with the\r\nnew Administration.  In and out of Parliament the question became a\r\nsubject of keen and vehement discussion.  The energy and the eloquence\r\nof Brougham had held a commanding place among the forces by which\r\nParliamentary reform had been effected, and the wonder was how any\r\nReform Ministry could venture to carry on the work of government, not\r\nmerely without the co-operation of such a man, but with every\r\nlikelihood of his active and bitter hostility.  At one time the report\r\nwent abroad, and found many ready believers, that there were periods in\r\nBrougham's life when his great intellect became clouded, as Chatham's\r\nhad been at one time, and that the Liberal Ministry found it therefore\r\nimpossible to avail themselves of his fitful services.  Lord Melbourne\r\nhimself once made an emphatic appeal to his audience in the House of\r\nLords, after Lord Brougham had delivered a speech there of\r\ncharacteristic power and eloquence.  Melbourne invited the House to\r\nconsider calmly how overmastering must have been the reasons which\r\ncompelled any body of rational statesmen to deprive themselves of such\r\na man's co-operation.  It would appear, however, that the reasons which\r\ninfluenced Melbourne and his colleagues were given by Brougham's own\r\npassionate and ungovernable temper, his impatience of all discipline,\r\nhis sudden changes of mood and purpose, his overmastering egotism, and\r\nhis frequent impulse to strike out for himself and to disregard all\r\nconsiderations of convenience or compromise, all {252} calculations as\r\nto the effect of an individual movement on the policy of an\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1835--Melbourne and the Irish Members]\r\n\r\nFrom that time Brougham had nothing more to do with ministerial work.\r\nHe became merely an independent, a very independent, member of the\r\nHouse of Lords.  To the close of his long career he was a commanding\r\nfigure in the House and in the country, but it was an individual\r\nfigure, an eccentric figure, whose movements must always excite\r\ninterest, must often excite admiration, but from whom guidance and\r\ninspiration were never to be expected.  Even on some of the great\r\nquestions with which the brightest part of his career had been\r\nespecially associated he often failed to exercise the influence which\r\nmight have been expected from a man of such gifts and such\r\nachievements.  Through the remainder of his life he could always arouse\r\nthe attention of the country, and indeed of the civilized world, when\r\nhe so willed, but his work as a political leader was done.\r\n\r\nThe office of Lord Chancellor was left for a while vacant, or, to\r\ndescribe the fact in more technical language, was put into commission.\r\nThe commission was made up of the Master of the Rolls, the\r\nVice-Chancellor, and one of the Judges.  After a time Lord Cottenham\r\nwas made Lord Chancellor.  Lord John Russell became Home Secretary, and\r\nLord Palmerston was Foreign Secretary.  Among the new names on the list\r\nof the Administration was that of Sir Henry Parnell, who became\r\nPaymaster-General and Paymaster of the Navy, and that of Sir George\r\nGrey, who was Under-Secretary of the Colonies, and afterwards rose to\r\nhold high office in many a Government, and had at one time the somewhat\r\nundesirable reputation of being the rapidest speaker in the House of\r\nCommons.\r\n\r\nKing William must have put a strong constraint upon himself when he\r\nfound that he had to receive, on terms at least of civility, so many of\r\nthe men, as ministers, whom he had abruptly dismissed from his service\r\nnot long before.  For a considerable time he put up with them rather\r\nthan received them, and maintained a merely official relationship with\r\nthem so far even as not to invite them to dinner.  {253} After a time,\r\nhowever, his Majesty somewhat softened in temper; the relations between\r\nhim and his advisers became less strained; and he even went so far as\r\nto invite the members of the Cabinet to dinner, and expressed in his\r\ninvitation the characteristic wish that each guest would drink at least\r\ntwo bottles of wine.  When the construction of the new Ministry had\r\nbeen completed, Parliament reassembled on April 18; but that meeting\r\nwas little more than of formal character, as the Houses had again to\r\nadjourn in order to enable the new members who were members of the\r\nHouse of Commons to resign and seek, according to constitutional usage,\r\nfor re-election at the hands of their constituents.  The only public\r\ninterest attaching to the meeting of Parliament on April 18 was found\r\nin an attempt, made by two Tory peers, to extract from Lord Melbourne\r\nsome public explanation as to his dealings with O'Connell and the Irish\r\nparty.  Lord Melbourne was quite equal to the occasion, and nothing\r\ncould be drawn from him further than the declaration that he had\r\nentered into no arrangements whatever with O'Connell; that if the Irish\r\nmembers should, on any occasion, give him their support, he should be\r\nhappy to receive it, but that he had not taken and did not mean to take\r\nany steps to secure it.  The incident is worth noting because it serves\r\nto illustrate, once again, the effect of the new condition which had\r\nbeen introduced into the struggles of the two great political parties\r\nby the passing of the Catholic Emancipation Act, and the consequent\r\nadmission of Irish Catholic members into the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nSome of the members of the new Administration were not successful when\r\nthey made their appeal to their old constituencies.  Lord John Russell,\r\nfor instance, was beaten in South Devonshire by a Tory antagonist, and\r\na vacancy had to be made for him in the little borough of Stroud, the\r\nrepresentative of which withdrew in order to oblige the leaders of his\r\nparty, and obtained, in return for his act of self-sacrifice, an office\r\nunder Government.  Lord Palmerston was placed in a difficulty of the\r\nsame kind, and a vacancy was made for him in the borough of {254}\r\nTiverton by the good-nature and the public spirit of its sitting\r\nrepresentative, and from that time to the end of his long career Lord\r\nPalmerston continued to be the member for Tiverton, which indeed won,\r\nby that fact alone, a conspicuous place in Parliamentary history.\r\nThere were other disturbances of the same kind in the relations of the\r\nmembers of the new Government and their former constituents, and it was\r\nclear enough that a certain reaction was still working against the\r\npolitical impulse which had carried the Reform measures to success.\r\nStill, it was clear that the new Government had come into power as a\r\nGovernment of reformers, and Lord Melbourne found himself compelled to\r\ngo on with the work of reform.  Nothing could be less in keeping with\r\nhis habits and the inclinations of his easy-going nature.  It used to\r\nbe said of him that whenever he was urged to set about any work of the\r\nkind his instinctive impulse always was to meet the suggestion with the\r\nquestion: \"Why can't you let it alone?\"  Now, however, he had in his\r\nCabinet some men, like Lord John Russell, whose earnestness in the\r\ncause of Reform was genuine and unconquerable; and if Lord Melbourne\r\nwas too indolent to press forward reforms on his own account, he was\r\nalso too indolent to resist such a pressure when put on him by others.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1835--Foundation of municipal bodies]\r\n\r\nThere was one great pressing and obvious reform which remained to be\r\naccomplished and ought naturally to follow on the reorganization of the\r\nParliamentary system.  That was the reorganization of the municipal\r\nsystem.  The municipal work of the country, the management of all the\r\nvarious and complicated relations which concerned the local affairs of\r\nthe whole community, had become a mere chaos of anomalies,\r\nanachronisms, and, in too many instances, of reckless mismanagement and\r\ndownright corruption.  If the sort of so-called representation which\r\nprevailed in the Parliamentary constituencies was, up to 1832, an\r\nabsurdity and a fraud, it was not perhaps on the whole quite so absurd\r\nor altogether so fraudulent as that which set itself up for a\r\nrepresentative system in the arrangements of the municipal\r\ncorporations.  As in the case of the {255} Parliamentary system, so in\r\nthe case of the municipal system, the organization had begun with an\r\nintelligible principle to guide it; but, during the lapse of years and\r\neven of centuries, the original purpose had been swamped by the gradual\r\nand always increasing growth of confusion and corruption.  The\r\nmunicipal arrangements of England had begun as a practical protest\r\nagainst the feudal system.  While the feudal laws or customs still\r\nprevailed, the greater proportion of the working-classes were really\r\nlittle better than serfs at the absolute control of their feudal lords\r\nand masters.  The comparatively small proportion of men who formed the\r\ntrading class of the community found themselves compelled to devise\r\nsome kind of arrangement for the security of themselves, their traffic,\r\nand their property against the dominion of the ruling class.  It was\r\npractically impossible that a mere serf could devote his energies to a\r\ncraft or trade with any hope of independence for himself or any chance\r\nof contributing to the prosperity of his working and trading neighbors.\r\nThe trading, manufacturing, and commercial classes in each locality\r\nbegan to form themselves into groups, or what might be called guilds,\r\nof their own, with the object of common protection, in order to secure\r\nan opening for their traffic and their industry, and for the\r\npreservation of the earnings and the profits which came of their skill\r\nand energy.  These trading groups asserted for themselves their right\r\nto free action in all that regarded the regulation of their work and\r\nthe secure disposal of their profits, and thus they became what might\r\nbe called governing bodies in each separate locality.  One common\r\nprinciple of these governing bodies was that no one should be allowed\r\nto become a craftsman or trader in any district if he were a serf, and\r\nthey claimed, and gradually came to maintain, the right to invest\r\nothers with the title and privileges of freemen.  This right of\r\nfreemanship soon became hereditary, and the male children of a freeman\r\nwere to be freemen themselves.  In many communities the man who married\r\na freeman's daughter acquired, if he had not been free before, the\r\nright of freemanship.  No qualification of residence was necessary to\r\n{256} enable a man thus to become free.  The self-organized community,\r\nwhatever it might be, had the right of creating any stranger a freeman\r\naccording as it thought fit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1835--Reform of municipal corporations]\r\n\r\nWe find this ancient system still in harmless and graceful illustration\r\nwhen a public man who has distinguished himself in the service of the\r\ncountry is honored by admission to the freedom of some ancient city.\r\nBut in the far-off days, when the system was in practical operation,\r\nthe unlimited right of creating freemen came to mean that in many\r\ncities, towns, and localities of all descriptions a number of outsiders\r\nwho had no connection by residence, property, or local interest of any\r\nkind with the district, and who were wholly irresponsible to the public\r\nopinion of the local community, had the right to interfere in the\r\nmanagement of its affairs and to become members of its municipal body.\r\nFor the local traders soon began to form themselves into councils or\r\ncommittees for the management of the local affairs, and, in fact,\r\nbecame what might be described as self-elected municipal corporations;\r\ntrustees who had assumed the trust for themselves; local law-makers\r\nwhose term of office was lifelong, and against whose decision there was\r\nno available court of appeal.  In some cases these local bodies\r\nactually arrogated to themselves the right of passing penal laws, and\r\ntrying cases and awarding punishments.  The local municipalities\r\nsometimes exercised the power of appointing Recorders to preside over\r\ntheir courts of law, and it happened in many instances that the\r\nmunicipal body made no condition as to the Recorder being a member of\r\nany branch of the legal profession.  It is hardly necessary to point\r\nout some of the inevitable consequences of such a system.  The\r\nmunicipal bodies voted what salaries they pleased out of the local\r\nfunds, and named according to their pleasure the persons to receive the\r\nsalaries.  They disposed of the corporate revenues in any way they\r\nthought fit--and, indeed, in many cases they claimed and annexed as\r\ncorporate property possessions that had always, up to the time of the\r\nannexation, been supposed to belong to the public at large.  They\r\nusurped for themselves all manner of privileges and {257} so-called\r\nrights, and, if they thought fit, offered them for purchase to the\r\nhighest bidder.  The whole governing body often consisted of a very\r\nsmall number of residents who had elected themselves to office, and as\r\nthey had the power of making themselves very disagreeable to disputants\r\nthey did not often find individuals public spirited enough to challenge\r\ntheir right of local control.  It happened much more frequently that if\r\nany man were strong enough to make his opposition inconvenient or\r\nuncomfortable for the local rulers, they got over the trouble by\r\nprevailing on him to become one of themselves, to share their\r\nprivileges and profits, and to strengthen their authority.  A local\r\nmagnate, the head of some great family, a peer of old descent, was\r\noften thus \"nobbled\"--to use a modern colloquialism--and was allowed to\r\nmake as many freemen as he pleased and to take whatever part he would\r\nin the control of municipal affairs.\r\n\r\nIt would be superfluous to say that the municipalities became a\r\nconstantly working instrument in the hands of this or that political\r\nparty.  Wherever the Whigs or the Tories were strong, there the\r\nconstituencies, such as they were, could always be placed at the\r\nabsolute disposal of some local magnate.  Even in the districts where\r\nthere was but little actual corruption there was often the most\r\nextravagant waste of the public funds and public property, and the most\r\nutter neglect of all the ordinary ways of business and of economy.  For\r\na long time the increasing evils of the system had been attracting the\r\nattention and arousing the alarm of enlightened and public-spirited men\r\nall over the country, and of course when the great measure of reform\r\nhad dealt with the political system, it was obvious that the reforming\r\nhand must before long touch the municipal system as well.  Shortly\r\nafter the passing of the Reform Bill Lord Althorp had appointed a\r\ncommission to inquire into the whole history, growth, and working of\r\nthe municipal corporations, and the report had brought out an immense\r\namount of systematized information on which the Liberal statesmen, now\r\nonce again in office, were determined to act.  Lord Melbourne intrusted\r\nthe task of {258} preparing and conducting through the House of Commons\r\na measure for this purpose to the capable hands of Lord John Russell,\r\nwho was now the leader of the Government in that House.  Lord John\r\nRussell's measure was, in fact, the foundation of the whole municipal\r\nsystem which we see spread over the country in our times.  It proposed\r\nto begin by abolishing altogether the freeman system and placing the\r\nelection of local governing bodies in the hands of residents who paid a\r\ncertain amount of taxation.  In fact, it made the municipal bodies\r\nrepresentative in just the same sense as the Parliamentary\r\nconstituencies had been made representative by the Reform Act.  It\r\nremodelled altogether the local law courts and legal arrangements of\r\nthe municipalities, and ordered that the appointment of Recorders\r\nshould be in the hands of the Crown, that each Recorder was to be a\r\nbarrister of a certain standing, and that a Recorder should be\r\nnominated for every borough which undertook to provide a suitable\r\nsalary for the occupant of the office.  Provision was also made for the\r\nproper management of charitable trusts and funds.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1835--The Municipal Reform Bill]\r\n\r\nThe measure was to apply to 183 boroughs, not including the metropolis,\r\nwith an average of 11,000 persons to each borough.  Some of the larger\r\nboroughs were to be divided into wards, and in most cases the intention\r\nof the measure was that the boundaries of the Parliamentary borough\r\nshould be the boundaries of the municipal borough as well.  The\r\ngoverning body of each municipality was to consist of a Mayor and\r\nCouncillors, the Councillors to be elected by resident ratepayers.  It\r\nwas proposed that the rights of living freemen were to be maintained,\r\nbut as each life lapsed the right was to be extinguished, and thus the\r\nwhole freeman system was to die out and all exclusive trading\r\nprivileges were to be abolished.  The Bill, as introduced by Lord John\r\nRussell, only applied to England and Wales; but O'Connell demanded that\r\nIreland should also be included in the reform, and it was finally\r\nagreed that a Bill of the same nature should be brought in for Ireland,\r\nand that arrangements should be made with the Scottish representatives\r\nto have the provisions of the {259} measure applied also to Scotland so\r\nfar as might be consistent with the usages and the desire of the\r\nScottish people.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel did not offer any direct opposition to the measure,\r\nalthough he criticised it severely enough in some of its provisions.\r\nHis speech, however, was distinctly a declaration in favor of some\r\ncomprehensive scheme of municipal reform, and might fairly have been\r\nregarded rather as a help than as a hinderance to the purposes of the\r\nGovernment.  The example set by Sir Robert Peel had naturally much\r\ninfluence over the greater number of the Conservative party, and only\r\nsome very old-fashioned Conservatives seemed inclined to make a stand\r\nagainst the measure.  Mr. Grote seized the opportunity to introduce a\r\nmotion for the adoption of the ballot in municipal elections, but it is\r\nhardly necessary to say that he did not secure support enough on either\r\nside of the House to win success for his proposition.  The Bill passed\r\nthrough the House of Commons without any important change in its\r\ncharacter, but it met with very serious maltreatment in the House of\r\nLords.  The majority of the peers did not see their way to compass the\r\nactual rejection of the Bill, especially after the liberal and\r\nstatesmanlike spirit in which Sir Robert Peel had dealt with it; but\r\nthey set themselves to work with the object of rendering it as nearly\r\nuseless as they could for the purposes which its promoters had in view.\r\nLord Lyndhurst led the opposition to the Bill, and he could, when he so\r\npleased, become the very narrowest of Tories, while he had ability and\r\nplausibility not included in the intellectual stock of any other Tory\r\nthen in the House of Lords.  Under this leadership the Tory peers so\r\ndisfigured and mangled the Bill that before long its own authors could\r\nhardly have recognized it as the work of their hands.  The peers not\r\nonly restored all, or nearly all, the abuses and anomalies which the\r\nmeasure as it left the House of Commons had marked for utter abolition,\r\nbut they even went so far as to introduce into their version of the\r\nBill some entirely new and original suggestions for the creation of\r\nabuses up to that time unknown to the existing municipal system.\r\n\r\n{260}\r\n\r\nThe Bill thus diversified had, of course, to go back to the House of\r\nCommons, and it is hardly necessary to say that the House of Commons\r\ncould not, as the Parliamentary phrase goes, agree with the Lords'\r\namendments.  Peel once again took a statesmanlike course, and strongly\r\nadvised the House of Lords not to press their absurd and objectionable\r\nalterations.  In the House of Lords itself the Duke of Wellington,\r\nacting as he almost always did under the influence of Peel, recommended\r\nthe Tory peers not to carry their opposition too far, and before long\r\nLord Lyndhurst, who was by temperament and intellect a very shrewd and\r\npractical man, with little of the visionary or the fanatic about him,\r\nthought it well to accept Wellington's advice, and to urge its\r\nacceptance on his brother Conservatives.  Lord John Russell recommended\r\nthe House of Commons to accept a compromise on a few insignificant\r\ndetails in no wise affecting the general purposes of the measure, in\r\norder to soothe the wounded feelings of the peers and enable them to\r\nyield with the comforting belief that after all their resistance had\r\nnot been wholly in vain.  The struggle was over, and on September 7,\r\n1835, the measure became law in the same shape, to all practical\r\npurposes, as that which it wore when it left the House of Commons after\r\nits third reading there, and thus secured for Great Britain and Ireland\r\nthe system of municipal government which has been working to this day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{261}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVIII.\r\n\r\nSTILL THE REIGN OF REFORM.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1836--The Universities of London]\r\n\r\nThe movement for the diffusion of education among the people had been\r\nmaking steady progress during the reign of William the Fourth, and some\r\nof the most distinct and lasting memorials of that movement have come\r\nto be associated with the history of the reign.  One of these was the\r\ngranting of a charter for the establishment of a great university which\r\nwas to bear the name of the capital, and was to confer its degrees, its\r\nhonors, and its offices without any conditions as to the religious\r\nprofession of those whom it educated, and whom it taught and qualified\r\nby appointment to conduct the education of others.  The old\r\nUniversities of Oxford and Cambridge were then directly associated with\r\nthe State Church, and only gave the stamp of their approval and the\r\nright to teach to those who professed the religion established by law.\r\nThere had been growing up, for some time, a feeling in the community\r\nthat there was need for a system of university teaching which should be\r\nopen alike to the members of all creeds and denominations, and even to\r\nthose who did not profess to subscribe to the doctrines of any\r\nparticular creed, or to enroll themselves in the ranks of any\r\nparticular denomination.  The institutions which are now known as\r\nUniversity College, London, and the University of London are among the\r\nmost remarkable growths of this movement.  After years of effort the\r\ncharters for these institutions were granted by King William in 1836,\r\nand it is needless to say that University College has played a great\r\npart in the spreading of education among the middle and poorer classes\r\nthroughout the country.  Henry Brougham was one of the most active\r\npromoters of the effort to bring the higher education and {262} its\r\nhonors within the reach of all classes and creeds, and his name will\r\nalways be distinctly associated with the rapid progress made in the\r\nspread of knowledge during the earlier part of the nineteenth century.\r\nBrougham was one of the founders and promoters of the \"Penny\r\nCyclopaedia for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge,\" which delighted\r\nsome of our grandfathers, amazed and bewildered others, and filled yet\r\nothers with a holy horror at the daring effort to upset all the\r\nwholesome distinctions of ranks and classes by cramming the lower\r\norders with an amount of knowledge wholly unsuited to their subordinate\r\ncondition, and unfitting them for the proper discharge of the duties\r\nassociated with that station in life to which it had pleased Providence\r\nto call them.\r\n\r\nBrougham also took a leading part in the founding of the British\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science, which was established by\r\nSir David Brewster, Sir Roderick Murchison, and many other men famous\r\nin science and in letters in 1831.  It has been holding its annual\r\nmeetings in all the great cities and towns of these islands ever since,\r\nand is not likely to be interrupted in the continuance of its work.\r\nThe British Association was the subject of a good deal of cheap\r\nridicule in its early days, and caricaturists, most of them long since\r\nforgotten, delighted in humorous illustrations of the oddities by which\r\nsocial life was to be profusely diversified when science was taught at\r\npopular meetings, and not merely men, but even women and young women,\r\ncould sit in the public hall and listen to great professors discoursing\r\non the construction of the earth and the laws which regulate the\r\nmovements of the heavenly bodies.  The present generation has almost\r\ncompletely forgotten even the fact that the British Association was\r\nonce a familiar and favorite subject for the pen and pencil of\r\nsatirists.  \"The schoolmaster is abroad\" was an expression used by\r\nBrougham to illustrate the educational movement which was going on in\r\nhis time, and which he did as much as any man could have done to set\r\nand to keep in motion.  King William himself, we may be sure, took only\r\na very moderate interest in all these goings {263} on, but, at all\r\nevents, he did not stand in the way of the general educational\r\nmovement; and indeed he gave it a kindly word of patronage and\r\nencouragement whenever it seemed a part of his State functions to\r\nsanction the progress of science by his royal recognition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1831--The press-gang]\r\n\r\nAmong the many reforms accomplished in this reign of reform was that\r\nwhich effected the practical abolition of the system of impressment for\r\nthe Navy, that system which had so long worked its purposes through the\r\naction of what was familiarly known as the press-gang.  The press-gang\r\nsystem had been in force from very remote days indeed, for it is shown\r\nby statute and by record to have been in operation before 1378.  In\r\n1641 the practice was declared illegal by Parliament; but Parliament\r\nmight just as well not have troubled itself upon the subject, for the\r\nimpressment of seamen went on just as if nothing had happened.\r\nWhenever seamen were required to man the royal fleet in time of war,\r\nthe press-gang instantly came into operation.  Its mode of action was\r\nsimple and straight-forward, and consisted of the forcible arrest and\r\ncomplete capture of merchant seamen and fishermen, or stalwart young\r\nmen of any kind, in seaport towns, who looked as if they had seen\r\nservice on some kind of sailing craft.  The ordinary practice was that\r\nan officer and a party of seamen and marines landed from some ships of\r\nwar in the harbor, and seized and carried off any number of men who\r\nseemed to them suitable for their purpose, and dragged them as\r\nprisoners on board war vessels, where they were compelled to serve\r\nuntil such time as their help might be no longer needed.\r\n\r\nThe literature of England, almost down to our own times, is diversified\r\nhere and there by illustrations of the scenes which were created in our\r\nseaport towns by this practice.  Smollett has more than one animated\r\npicture of this kind.  The sea stories of Captain Marryat's days abound\r\nin such illustrations, and even romance of the higher order, and poetry\r\nitself, have found subjects for picturesque and pathetic narrative in\r\nthe stories of young men thus torn from their families without a\r\nmoment's {264} notice, and compelled to go on a ship of war and fight\r\nthe foreign enemy at sea.  The pay of an able seaman in a ship of war\r\nwas, in those times, very poor; the life was one of hardship, and there\r\nwas little to tempt a young man of ordinary ways and temperament to\r\nenter the naval service of his sovereign.  The seaport towns and the\r\ntowns on the great rivers were called upon by royal authority to supply\r\na certain proportionate number of men for service in the Navy, and the\r\nlocal governing bodies did their best, we may be sure, by the offer of\r\nbounties and other encouragements, to induce young men to volunteer for\r\nthe sea.  In times of war, however, when sudden demands were made on\r\nthe part of the Crown for the efficient manning of the Navy, these\r\nencouragements and temptations often failed to procure anything like\r\nthe required amount of voluntary service, and then it was that the\r\npress-gang came into work to meet the demand by force.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1835--Resisting the press-gang]\r\n\r\nDuring the long wars which followed the outbreak of the French\r\nRevolution the press-gang had a busy time of it.  Vessels of war were\r\nin the constant habit of summoning merchant vessels to hand over a\r\ncertain number of their seamen, and the merchant vessels were brought\r\nto just as if they had been the cruisers of the enemy, and were boarded\r\nby force, whenever force seemed necessary, and compelled to supply the\r\nrequisite number.  It sometimes happened that the captain of a vessel\r\nfailed to understand the meaning of the peremptory summons issued to\r\nhim, and he was then promptly brought to an understanding of the\r\nsituation by the shot of the war vessel and the appearance of an armed\r\nboarding party on his own decks.  Nor was it even a very unusual event\r\nfor the captain of the merchant vessel to offer a resistance, and then\r\nthere was a regular sea-fight between the British war ship and the\r\nBritish merchantman, in which, of course, the latter was very soon\r\ncompelled to acknowledge the validity of the royal warrant.\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary course of things, however, the captain of the war\r\nvessel sent an officer and a party of men on shore, and their business\r\nwas to make any captures they {265} pleased, in that part of the town\r\nwhere men fit for service at sea were most likely to be found.  There\r\nare stories told, and told on historic evidence as truth, about young\r\nhusbands thus captured and thrown into prison to await their removal to\r\nsome war vessel off the coast, and whose wives or mothers could devise\r\nno better means for their rescue than to obtain an interview with them\r\nin the prison, and there contrive so to mutilate the hands of the\r\ncaptives through the bars of the cell as to render them unfit for\r\nservice in the Royal Navy.  Sometimes, when it became known that the\r\npress-gang was about to visit that part of the town where seafaring men\r\nwere likely to be found, the population of the quarter rallied in\r\ndefence of their townsmen, and offered just such resistance to the\r\nemissaries of the naval authorities as they would have offered to an\r\ninvading enemy.  Streets were barricaded; from the high windows of\r\nhouses stones were hurled down and volleys of musketry were fired;\r\ncrowds of armed men, and even sometimes of armed women, met the\r\ninvaders in the street itself and disputed their progress inch by inch.\r\n\r\nIn the lower quarters of Portsmouth and other seaport towns such scenes\r\nwere of frequent occurrence.  The whole system had among its other\r\nharmful effects a very damaging influence on the Navy itself and on its\r\ndiscipline.  The press-gang was not very choice in making up its\r\ncontributions of recruits for the fleet.  No great pains were taken\r\nwith a view to obtain certificates as to character and conduct.  Those\r\nwho formed the recruiting expedition were only too ready to seize any\r\nstrapping young men whom they found loitering about the streets and\r\nlanes of the lower quarters in a seaport town.  These strapping young\r\nmen often turned out to be rising young men of the criminal classes,\r\nbut their limbs and muscles made them like some of Falstaff's recruits,\r\n\"good enough to toss--food for powder,\" and they were promptly swooped\r\nupon and carried off to serve in his Majesty's Navy.  Such captives as\r\nthese, when put on board a vessel of war and compelled to serve as\r\nseamen there, had the influence which might have been expected from\r\nthem over the habits of the whole crew.  {266} The severest and even\r\nthe most savage methods of discipline were often found necessary to\r\nforce such men into habits of obedience and into anything like decent\r\nconduct.  Flogging then, and for long after, prevailed in the Navy and\r\nin the Army, and one of the most familiar arguments in favor of keeping\r\nup that form of discipline was found in the fact that in many cases the\r\nnew recruits might have corrupted the habits of a whole ship's company\r\nif they had not been compelled by frequent floggings to obey orders,\r\nsubmit themselves to rules, and conduct themselves with decency.\r\n\r\nFor a long time a strong feeling had been growing up among\r\nphilanthropists and reformers of all kinds against the practice of\r\nimpressment and against the discipline of the \"cat,\" as the flogging\r\ninstrument was commonly termed.  The philanthropists and the reformers\r\ngenerally were met by the old sort of familiar argument.  They were\r\ntold that it would be utterly impossible to man a navy if the\r\npress-gang were to be abolished, and equally impossible to keep the\r\nNavy up to its work and in decent condition if seamen were no longer\r\nliable to the punishment of the lash.  The innovators were asked\r\nwhether they knew better how to raise and maintain an efficient Navy\r\nthan did the naval authorities, on whose shoulders rested the\r\nresponsibility of defending the shores of England from foreign\r\ninvasion.  Those who made themselves conspicuous by their advocacy of\r\nwhat were then beginning to be called humanitarian principles were\r\nroundly accused of want of patriotism, and it was often suggested that\r\nthey were anti-English in their sentiments and their instincts, and\r\nwere persons who would probably, on the whole, rather welcome the\r\nforeign invader than lend a hand to drive him back.  The spirit of\r\nhumanity and of reform was in the air, however, and in the reformed\r\nParliament there were many men who had as good a gift of eloquence as\r\nthe best of their opponents, and who could not be frightened out of any\r\npurpose on which they had set their minds and hearts.  In 1835 the\r\nGovernment of Lord Melbourne brought in a measure for the abolition of\r\nthe press-gang {267} system and for limitation of compulsory service in\r\nthe Navy to a period of five years.  This measure not only had its own\r\ndirect and immediate beneficial effects, but it also did much to\r\nprepare the way for the abolition of flogging.  Many years, indeed, had\r\nto pass before this latter reform could be accomplished, but it was\r\nclear that, when the manning of the Navy no longer brought with it its\r\ncaptures from the criminal classes, the time was coming for the gradual\r\nadoption of a system of discipline more in accordance with the\r\nprinciples of humanity and the character of a noble service.  As we\r\nhave seen in all previous experiences of reform, the forebodings of the\r\nanti-reformers proved to be utterly false alarms in regard to the\r\nmanning and the discipline of the Navy.  We have seen some foreign wars\r\nsince the days of William the Fourth, and we have heard alarms of\r\nforeign invasion again and again.  But the Navy, under its improved\r\nconditions, has never been in want of volunteers to man it, and the\r\ngreatest lovers of peace have always proclaimed it to be the surest and\r\nbest defence of the country.  There were many leading men in the House\r\nof Commons since those days who persistently demanded a reduction in\r\nthe Army on the very ground that England could safely defy any foreign\r\nfoe so long as she had the bulwark of such a Navy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1840--The new Houses of Parliament]\r\n\r\nOne great, solid, and picturesque memorial is destined to associate the\r\nreign of William the Fourth with the history of English architecture.\r\nWe speak of the Houses of Parliament which stand on the banks of the\r\nriver, and thus have the Thames on one side and Westminster Abbey on\r\nthe other.  The great range of halls, towers, and terraces, arches,\r\nsquares, and court-yards, which, until comparatively recent days, were\r\noften described in common phrase as the New Houses of Parliament, owe\r\ntheir origin and their plan, although not their complete construction,\r\nto the reign of William the Fourth.  On the evening of October 16,\r\n1834, the old buildings in which the Lords and the Commons used to\r\nassemble were completely destroyed by fire.  The fire broke out so\r\nsuddenly on that evening and spread with such extraordinary rapidity\r\nthat many of those {268} who were engaged in occupations of one kind or\r\nanother in various parts of the buildings had much difficulty in\r\nescaping with their lives.  The flames spread so fast that in an almost\r\nincredibly short space of time the two Houses of Parliament, and almost\r\nall the offices, residences, and other buildings attached to them, were\r\nseen to be devoted to hopeless ruin.  For a while it seemed almost\r\ncertain that Westminster Hall itself must be involved in the common\r\ndestruction, and even the noble Abbey, with its priceless memorial\r\ntreasures, appeared destined to become a mere ruin of shattered stones.\r\nThe arrangements for the extinguishing of fires were rude and poor and\r\ninefficient in those days when compared with the systematized service\r\nwhich is employed in our own, and for a considerable time those who\r\nhurried to the spot, charged with the duty of combating the\r\nconflagration, appeared to do little better than get in each other's\r\nway and only give new chances to each fresh eruption.  The tide in the\r\nriver was very low, too, when the destroying work began, and it was\r\nhard indeed to bring any great body of water to bear upon the flames.\r\nAs the tide rose, however, it became easy to make more effective\r\nefforts.  At last it was found that Westminster Abbey might be\r\nconsidered perfectly safe.  So was Westminster Hall, that noble\r\nhistorical enclosure, the Hall which saw the trial of William Wallace,\r\nof Charles the First, of Somers, and of Warren Hastings, the hall which\r\ncelebrated the coronation of so many kings, which boasts of being the\r\noldest chamber in Europe held in continuous occupation up to the\r\npresent day, the largest hall in Europe unsupported by pillars.  It was\r\npreserved, to be the grand entrance and vestibule to both the Houses of\r\nParliament.  But the chambers in which, up to that day, the Lords and\r\nCommons had conducted their legislative work were utterly destroyed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1834--Burning of the old Parliament Houses]\r\n\r\nAt first it was assumed, as is almost always the assumption in the case\r\nof any great conflagration, that the work of destruction had been the\r\noutcome of an incendiary plot, and for a while a wild idea spread\r\nabroad that some modern Guy Fawkes had succeeded where his predecessor\r\nhad {269} completely failed.  But it was soon made clear and certain\r\nthat the whole calamity, if indeed it can be called much of a calamity,\r\nhad been the result of a mere accident.  A careless workman, aspiring\r\nto nothing more than a quick release from his labor, and not destined\r\nto the fame of the aspiring youth who fired the Ephesian dome, had\r\nbrought about the ruin which bequeathed to England and to the world the\r\nvast and noble structure of Westminster Palace.  The workman was\r\nengaged in burning up a number of the old, disused wooden tallies which\r\nonce used to be employed in the Court of Exchequer, and he heaped too\r\nlarge a bundle of them on the fire.  At an unlucky moment a flame\r\nsuddenly blazed up which caught hold of the furniture in the room, and\r\nin another moment set the whole building on fire, and then created the\r\nvast conflagration which wrought so much destruction.\r\n\r\nWe have expressed a certain doubt as to whether the burning of the old\r\nHouses of Parliament is really to be regarded as a national calamity,\r\nand the doubt is founded partly on the admitted fact that the chambers\r\nwhich existed before the fire were quite unequal in size and in\r\naccommodation to the purposes for which they were designed, and partly\r\non the architectural magnificence of the buildings which succeeded\r\nthem.  The Lords and Commons found accommodation where they could while\r\npreparations were in progress for the building of new and better\r\nchambers, and a Parliamentary committee was soon appointed to consider\r\nand report upon the best means of providing the country with more\r\ncommodious and more stately Houses of Parliament.  The committee\r\nventured on a recommendation which was considered, at the time, a most\r\ndaring piece of advice.  The recommendation was that the contract for\r\nthe erection of the new Houses of Parliament should be thrown\r\nabsolutely open to public competition.  Nothing like that proposal had\r\never been heard of under similar conditions in English affairs up to\r\nthat time.  What seemed to most persons the most natural and proper\r\nplan--the seemly, becoming, and orderly plan--would have been to allow\r\nthe sovereign or some great State {270} personage to select the Court\r\narchitect who might be thought most fitting to be intrusted with so\r\ngreat a task, and let him work out, as best he could, the pleasure of\r\nhis illustrious patron.  The committee, however, were able to carry\r\ntheir point, and the contract for the great work was thrown open to\r\nunrestricted competition.  Out of a vast number of designs submitted\r\nfor approval, the committee selected the design sent in by Mr. Barry\r\n(afterwards Sir Charles Barry), the famous architect, who has left many\r\nother monuments of his genius to the nation, but whose most conspicuous\r\nmonument, assuredly, is found in the pile of buildings which ornament\r\nthe Thames at Westminster.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1840--The seating capacity of the Commons]\r\n\r\nOnly the mere fact that the selection of the design for the new\r\nbuilding was made during the lifetime of William the Fourth connects\r\nthe reign of that monarch with the history of Westminster Palace.  It\r\nwas not until the reign of Queen Victoria had made some way that the\r\ntowers of the palace began to show themselves above the river; but the\r\nnew principle which offered the design for the work to public\r\ncompetition, and the fact that Mr. Barry's design was chosen from all\r\nothers, oblige us to associate the building of the new chambers with\r\nthe reign of a sovereign whose name otherwise was not likely to be\r\nidentified with any triumph of artistic genius.  We must not set down\r\nto any defects in the architect's constructive skill the fact that the\r\nnew House of Commons was almost as inadequate to the proper\r\naccommodation of its members as the old House had been.  The present\r\nHouse of Commons does not provide sitting accommodation for anything\r\nlike the number of members who are entitled to have seats on its\r\nbenches.  Even if the galleries set apart for the use of members only,\r\ngalleries that are practically useless for the purposes of debate, were\r\nto be filled to their utmost, there still would not be room for nearly\r\nall the members of the House of Commons.  But at the time when the new\r\nHouse was built, the general impression of statesmen on both sides\r\nseemed to be that, if the chamber were made spacious enough to give a\r\nseat to every member, the result would be {271} that the room would be\r\ntoo large for anything like practical, easy, and satisfactory\r\ndiscussion, and that the chamber would become a mere hall of\r\ndeclamation.\r\n\r\nAt that time almost all the business of the House, even to its most\r\nminute details of legislation, was done in the debating-chamber itself.\r\nThe scheme which was adopted a great many years later, and by means of\r\nwhich the shaping of the details of legislative measures is commonly\r\nrelegated to Grand Committees, as the Parliamentary phrase goes, had\r\nnot then found any favor with statesmen.  The daily work of the House\r\nwas left, for the most part, in the hands of the members of the\r\nAdministration and the leading members of the Opposition, or, in cases\r\nwhere the interests of a particular class, or trade, or district were\r\nconcerned, to the men who had special knowledge of each subject of\r\nlegislation.  It was therefore argued, and with much plausibility, that\r\nto construct a chamber large enough to hold seats for all the members\r\nwould be to impose an insupportable, and at the same time a quite\r\nunnecessary, strain upon the energies and the lungs of the\r\ncomparatively small number of men by whom the actual business of the\r\nHouse had to be carried on.  This argument was used with much effect,\r\nnot many years before his death, by Mr. Gladstone himself, and there\r\ncan be no doubt that it maintained itself against the many successive\r\nproposals which have been made from time to time for the enlargement of\r\nthe representative chamber.  In most other legislative halls, on the\r\nContinent or in the United States or in Canada, each member has his own\r\nseat, and finds it ready for his occupation at any time; but in the\r\nHouse of Commons on great occasions the ordinary member has to come to\r\nthe House at the earliest moment when its doors are open, hours and\r\nhours before the business begins, in order to have even a chance of\r\nobtaining a seat during the debate, and a large number of members are\r\nfated, whatever their energy and their early rising, to sigh for a seat\r\nin vain.  The question has been raised again and again in the House of\r\nCommons, and all manner of propositions have been brought forward and\r\nplans suggested for the {272} enlargement of the debating-chamber, but\r\nup to the present the condition of things remains just as it was when\r\nthe new Houses of Parliament were opened in the reign of Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1840--Ladies in the House of Commons]\r\n\r\nSir Charles Barry's design has the great advantage that it renders an\r\nincrease in the size of the House of Commons possible and practicable\r\nwithout a complete reconstruction of all that part of the vast building\r\nwhich belongs to the representative chamber and its various offices.\r\nIn the opinion of many leading members of the House of Commons the\r\nnumber of representatives is needlessly large for the purposes demanded\r\nby an adequate and proportionate system of representation, and it is\r\nnot difficult to foresee changes which might lead, with universal\r\nsatisfaction, to a reduction in the number of members in the House of\r\nCommons.  It may also be anticipated that the system that relegates the\r\ndetails of legislative measures to the consideration of Grand\r\nCommittees may be gradually extended as time goes on, and that thus the\r\ncommittee work of the House of Commons itself may grow less and less by\r\ndegrees.  In either case, or in both cases together, it might easily\r\ncome to pass that the present debating-chamber would supply ample\r\nsitting room to all its members on every ordinary occasion, although it\r\nis hardly possible to understand how, on a night of great debate, with\r\na momentous division impending, the present chamber could be expected\r\nto accommodate the full number of members entitled to claim seats\r\nthere.  At all events, it is hardly possible to imagine any condition\r\nof things arising which could call for any alteration in the\r\nconstruction of the representative chamber which would be likely to\r\naffect, in the slightest degree, the general character of that palace\r\nof legislation which was planned and founded during the reign of\r\nWilliam the Fourth, was opened in the reign of Queen Victoria, and will\r\nbear down to posterity the name of its architect, Sir Charles Barry.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this subject it is of interest to note that the question\r\nof providing accommodation for ladies desiring to listen to the debates\r\nin the House of Commons {273} was brought up more than once during the\r\nreign of William the Fourth.  Miss Martineau, in her \"History of the\r\nThirty Years' Peace,\" makes grave complaint of the manner in which the\r\nproposal for the admission of ladies to hear the debates was treated\r\nalike by the legislators who favored and by those who resisted the\r\nproposition.  The whole subject, she appears to think, was treated as a\r\nhuge joke.  One set of members advocated the admission of ladies on the\r\nground, among other reasons, that their presence in the House of\r\nCommons would tend to keep the legislators sober, and prevent them from\r\ngarnishing their speeches with unseemly expressions.  Another set stood\r\nout against the proposal on the ground that if ladies were allowed to\r\nsit in a gallery in sight of the members, the result would be that the\r\nrepresentatives would cease to pay any real attention to the business\r\nof debate, and would occupy themselves chiefly in studying the faces\r\nand the dresses of the fair visitors, and trying to interchange glances\r\nwith the newly admitted spectators.\r\n\r\nThe conditions under which ladies may be permitted to listen to the\r\ndebates in the House of Commons form a subject of something like\r\nperiodical discussion up to the present day.  There is, as everybody\r\nknows, a certain number of seats set apart behind the Press gallery in\r\nthe House of Commons for the accommodation of women, who are admitted\r\nby orders which members can obtain who are successful in a balloting\r\nprocess which takes place a week in advance.  About twenty members only\r\nout of more than six hundred can win two seats each for any one sitting\r\nof the House, and no member can approach the ballot for at least a week\r\nafter he has accomplished a success.  The Ladies' Gallery holds only a\r\nvery small number of women, and it is jealously screened by a gilded\r\ngrating something like that through which the women of an Eastern\r\npotentate's household are permitted to gaze upon the stage from their\r\nbox in the theatre.\r\n\r\nIt will perhaps be news to some readers to hear that this ladies'\r\ngallery, such as it is, is technically not within the precincts of the\r\nHouse of Commons at all.  It is not an {274} institution of the House,\r\nnor does it come under the rules of the House, nor is it recognized by\r\nthe authorities of the House.  It is there, as a matter of fact, but it\r\nis not supposed to be there, and the Speaker of the House, who is\r\nomnipotent over all other parts of the chamber, has no control over the\r\noccupants of that gilded cage, and is technically assumed to be\r\nignorant of their presence.  The Speaker can, on proper occasions,\r\norder strangers \"to withdraw\" from all the other galleries set apart\r\nfor the use of outsiders, but he has no power over the ladies who sit\r\nin the gallery high above his chair.  It has even happened that when\r\nsubjects had, as a matter of necessity, to be discussed in the House of\r\nCommons which the Speaker did not consider quite suitable for an\r\naudience of both sexes, he has sent a private and unofficial intimation\r\nto the Ladies' Gallery that it would, in his opinion, be more seemly if\r\nits occupants were to withdraw.  But on some occasions a few of the\r\nladies declined to withdraw, and the Speaker had no power to enforce\r\nhis advice, seeing that, technically, there was no Ladies' Gallery\r\nwithin his jurisdiction.  Some time, no doubt, the House of Commons\r\nwill adopt more reasonable regulations, and will recognize the right of\r\nwomen to be treated as rational creatures, as members of the community,\r\nas citizens, and allowed to sit, as men do, in an open gallery, and\r\nlisten to the debates which must always more or less concern their own\r\ninterests.  It is a curious fact that the galleries and other parts of\r\nthe House of Lords to which women have admission are open to the public\r\ngaze just as are those parts of the House in which male strangers are\r\npermitted to listen to the debates of the peers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1835--The Orange Associations]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1835 the public mind of these countries was much surprised,\r\nand even startled, by the discovery, or what at least seemed to be the\r\ndiscovery, of a great and portentous plot against the established order\r\nof succession to the throne.  This plot was declared to be carried on\r\nby the Orange societies which had for many years been growing up in\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland, and throughout many of the colonies and\r\ndependencies.  This Orange {275} organization began in the North of\r\nIreland, and was originally intended to crush out the Catholic\r\nassociations which were then coming into existence all over Ireland for\r\nthe political and religious emancipation of the Roman Catholics, and\r\nfor strengthening the national cause in the Irish Parliament.  There is\r\nso little to be said in defence, or even in excuse, of the Orange\r\norganization in its earlier years that it seems only fair to admit the\r\npossibility of its having been seriously intended, in the beginning,\r\nfor the defence of Great Britain against an Irish rebellion fomented\r\nand supported by France.\r\n\r\nThe Orange associations took their title from the name of the royal\r\nhouse which had given William the Third as a sovereign to England, and\r\nthe name of Orange was understood to illustrate its hostility to all\r\nJacobite plots and schemes, which were naturally assumed to have the\r\ncountenance and the favor of England's foreign enemies.  We have seen\r\nalready, in the course of this history, how the Orange societies acted\r\nbefore the rebellion of '98 in Ireland, and how orange and green became\r\nthe rival colors of those who denounced and those who supported every\r\nIrish national movement.  When the rebellion was suppressed, and\r\nGrattan's Parliament was extinguished, the Orange associations were not\r\nin the least disposed to admit that their work had been accomplished\r\nand that there was no further need for their active existence.  On the\r\ncontrary, they increased their efforts to spread their power all over\r\nthe country, and, claiming for themselves the credit of having been a\r\nmain influence in the suppression of the Irish rebellion, they appealed\r\nfor the support of all loyal Englishmen to increase their numbers and\r\nstrengthen their hands.  Orangeism, which had at first only been known\r\nin Ireland, began to spread widely throughout Great Britain.  Orange\r\nLodges were everywhere formed; Orange Grand Masters were appointed; a\r\nwhole vocabulary of Orange titles, passwords, and phrases was invented;\r\na complete hierarchy of Orange officialism was created, and an\r\ninvisible network of Orangeism held the members of the organization\r\ntogether.  The Orange conspiracy, if {276} we may call it so, had been\r\nspreading its ramifications energetically during the later years of\r\nGeorge the Fourth's reign, and had succeeded in obtaining the\r\ncountenance, and indeed the active support, of many peers, of at least\r\nsome bishops, and even of certain members of the royal family.  The\r\nDuke of York, who at that time stood nearest in the succession to the\r\nthrone, was a patron of the societies, and was invited to become Grand\r\nMaster of the whole organization.  The invitation would in all\r\nprobability have been accepted if the Duke had not been assured, on the\r\nmost authoritative advice, that a secret organization of such a nature\r\nwas distinctly an illegal body.  When the Duke died, and it seemed all\r\nbut certain that the next King of England must be his brother William,\r\nDuke of Clarence, the Orange lodges transferred their allegiance to the\r\nDuke of Cumberland, who consented to become their Grand Master.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1835--Wellington and the British Crown]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cumberland, as we have already seen, was a Tory of the most\r\nextreme order; an inveterate enemy to every kind of reform and every\r\nprogressive movement, a man who was not merely unpopular but thoroughly\r\ndetested among all classes who valued political freedom, religious\r\nliberty, and the spread of education.  Soon after William the Fourth's\r\naccession to the throne a new impulse was given to Orangeism by the\r\nKing's yielding to the demand for popular reform, and by the measures\r\nand the movements which began to follow the passing of Lord Grey's\r\nReform Bill.  The Orangemen all over these countries then began to look\r\nupon the Duke of Cumberland as their natural leader, and there can be\r\nlittle doubt that in the minds of many of them, in the minds of some of\r\nthe most influential among them, there was growing up the wild hope\r\nthat the Duke of Cumberland might become King of England.  The Orange\r\nlodges became a vast secret organization with signs and passwords, a\r\nmysterious political confraternity, the Grand Master of which was a\r\nsort of head centre, to adopt a phrase belonging to a more modern\r\nconspiracy, and performing, indeed, something like the part which\r\nContinental Freemasonry at one time {277} aspired to play.  The Orange\r\nlodges in Great Britain and Ireland swelled in numbers until they had\r\nmore than three hundred thousand members solemnly and secretly sworn to\r\nobey all the orders of the leaders.  More than that, the emissaries of\r\nthe Orange lodges contrived to make their influence widely felt in the\r\nArmy, and it became clear afterwards that a large number of soldiers\r\nwere sworn confederates of the association.\r\n\r\nSome of the explanations which were afterwards given to account for the\r\nsudden spread of Orangeism might well appear incredible at first to an\r\nintelligent reader of our day not acquainted with this singular chapter\r\nof history.  But it was afterwards made perfectly certain that a large\r\nnumber of credulous persons were prevailed upon to join the Orange\r\nranks by the positive assurance that the Duke of Wellington had formed\r\nthe determination to seize the crown of England and to put it on his\r\nown head, and that the Duke of Cumberland was the only man who could\r\nsave the realm from this treasonable enterprise.  It seems hardly\r\npossible now to understand that there could have been one human\r\ncreature in England silly and ignorant enough to believe the Duke of\r\nWellington capable of so preposterous and so wicked a scheme.  Lord\r\nJohn Russell has left it on record that when he visited Napoleon in his\r\nexile at Elba, the fallen Emperor, during the course of a long\r\nconversation, expressed his strong belief that Wellington would seize\r\nthe crown of England.  Lord John endeavored to convince him that such\r\nan idea went entirely outside the limits of sober reality; but Napoleon\r\nrefused to be convinced, and blandly put the question aside with the\r\nmanner of one who knows better but does not particularly care to\r\nimpress his opinion on unwilling ears.  One can easily understand how\r\nsuch an idea might come into the mind of Napoleon, who knew little or\r\nnothing about the actual conditions of English political and social\r\nlife, and who had experience of his own to demonstrate the possibility\r\nof a great military conqueror becoming at once the ruler of a State.\r\nBut it seems hard indeed to understand how any sane Englishman could\r\nhave believed that {278} the simple, loyal, unselfish Duke of\r\nWellington could allow such an idea to enter his mind for a moment, or\r\ncould see his way to make it a reality even if he did entertain it.\r\nYet it cannot be doubted that numbers of Englishmen were induced to\r\njoin Orange lodges by the positive assurance that thus only could they\r\nsave the State from Wellington's daring ambition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1836--Dissolution of the Orange lodges]\r\n\r\nOne of the principal instruments of the Orange organization was a\r\ncertain Colonel Fairman, who held an important position in what may be\r\ncalled its military hierarchy, and was undoubtedly at one time\r\nintrusted by the Duke of Cumberland with the fullest authority to act\r\nas the emissary of the Grand Master to make known his will and convey\r\nhis orders.  Whether the Duke of Cumberland ever really entertained the\r\nproject ascribed to him of seizing the crown for himself and shutting\r\nout the Princess Victoria can, in all probability, never be known as a\r\ncertainty; but there can be no question that his actions often\r\njustified such a belief, and that many of his most devoted Orange\r\nfollowers looked up to him as the resolute hero of such a project to\r\nsave England from Whigs and Liberals, and Roman Catholics, and mob\r\norators, and petticoat government, and all other such enemies to the\r\ngood old state of things as established by the wisdom of our ancestors\r\nand the Act of Settlement.  The whole question was raised in the House\r\nof Commons during the session of 1835 by Joseph Hume, the consistent\r\nand persevering advocate of sound economic doctrine, of political\r\nfreedom, of peace, retrenchment, and reform.  Hume obtained the\r\nappointment of a committee to inquire into the whole subject, and the\r\ncommittee had no great difficulty in finding out that Colonel Fairman\r\nhad been carrying on, with or without the consent or authority of his\r\nGrand Master the Duke of Cumberland, what must be called a treasonable\r\nconspiracy through the Orange lodges and even through Orangemen who\r\nwere actually serving in the King's Army.  In 1836 Hume brought up the\r\nquestion once again and obtained so much support from Lord John\r\nRussell, then acting as Leader of the Government in the House of\r\nCommons, that {279} an address was unanimously voted to the King\r\ncalling on him to proclaim the condemnation of the Orange conspiracy.\r\nThe Duke of Cumberland disclaimed all treasonable purposes, and\r\ndeclared that many of the steps taken by Fairman and other Orange\r\nemissaries had been taken without his orders and even without his\r\nknowledge.  Fairman disappeared from the scene when the crisis seemed\r\nto become too serious for his personal convenience, and one of the\r\nOrange emissaries, against whom a prosecution was to be instituted, was\r\nremoved by a sudden death from the reach of the criminal law.  The Duke\r\nof Cumberland announced that he had already, of his own inspiration,\r\nordered the dissolution of the Orange lodges.  The King, in his reply\r\nto the address in the House of Commons, declared himself entirely in\r\naccordance with the resolutions of the House, and thus the whole\r\nconspiracy came to an end, and the Government thought it well to allow\r\nthe subject to pass into obscurity without further action.\r\n\r\nThis was the end of the Orange organization, as it was known in the\r\ndays of William the Fourth.  At a later date Orangeism was again\r\nrevived, but only in the form which it still maintains, by which it is\r\nnow known to us all as a political association, openly avowing\r\nlegitimate opinions and purposes, and as fairly entitled to existence\r\nas any political club or other such organization recognized in the\r\nmovements of modern life.  The treasonable conspiracy, like many\r\nanother evil, died when it was compelled to endure the light of day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{280}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE CLOSE OF A REIGN AND THE OPENING OF AN ERA.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1748-1832--Mackintosh, Malthus, and Mill]\r\n\r\nMany lives that now belong to history had faded into history during the\r\nreign of William the Fourth.  William Wilberforce, the great champion of\r\nevery noble and philanthropic movement known to his times, had passed\r\nfrom the living world which he had done so much to improve.  Wilberforce\r\nlived to see the triumph of that movement against slavery and the\r\nslave-trade which he, more than any other of his time, had inspired and\r\npromoted.  He had been compelled by ill-health to give up his position in\r\nParliament for several years before his death, but he had never withdrawn\r\nhis watchful sympathy and such co-operation as it was in his power to\r\ngive from any cause to which he had consecrated his life.  His name will\r\nalways be illustrious in English history as that of one who loved his\r\nfellow-men and who gave expression to that love in every act and effort\r\nof his public and private career.  Jeremy Bentham, one of the greatest of\r\nmodern thinkers, the founder of more than one school of political and\r\neconomic doctrine, a man whose influence on human thought is never likely\r\nto pass altogether away, died in June, 1832.  Bentham's principle, the\r\ngreatest happiness of the greatest number, has often been narrowly and\r\nunfairly judged, but it may be doubted whether a sounder theory of\r\npolitical and social government has ever come out of the mere wisdom of\r\nman.  The phrase utilitarianism, which came into use as the summary of\r\nhis teaching, has often been misunderstood and misapplied, and perhaps\r\nsome excuse was found for the misinterpretation of his meaning in his\r\ndecision that his dead body should be given up for the purpose of anatomy\r\nand not buried in earth to be of service {281} only to the worms.  Many\r\nof us have seen the skeleton of Jeremy Bentham clothed in his habit as he\r\nlived in a room of that University College which he helped to make a\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nSir James Mackintosh brought his noble career to a close during this\r\nreign.  Mackintosh had been historian, philosopher, and politician, and,\r\nlike Macaulay, he had rendered great services in India as well as in\r\nEngland.  Like Macaulay also, he had been listened to with the deepest\r\ninterest whenever he addressed the House of Commons, although his gifts\r\nand his temperament seemed suited rather for the study than for\r\nParliamentary life.  Another man whose death belongs to the reign of\r\nWilliam the Fourth, whose teachings were at one time the occasion for\r\nincessant controversy--and indeed caused most controversy where they were\r\nleast understood--was Thomas Robert Malthus.  In many classes of readers\r\nthe name of Malthus came to be associated for a while with the idea of\r\nsome strange and cruel doctrine which taught that wars and pestilences\r\nand other calamities that have the effect of sweeping redundant\r\npopulations off the world are really good things in themselves, to be\r\nencouraged by beneficent legislation.  It is hardly necessary to say now\r\nthat nothing could be more narrow and even more perverse than this\r\ninterpretation of Malthus's philosophy.  Another of the teaching minds\r\nwhich passed from the contemplation of earthly subjects during the reign\r\nwas that of James Mill, the historian of British India and the\r\npromulgator of great doctrines in political economy.  James Mill, like\r\nEdmund Burke, had studied India thoroughly, and come to understand it as\r\nfew men had done who had lived there for years and years, although, like\r\nBurke, he had never been within sight of the shores of Hindustan.  Mill\r\ndivined India as Talleyrand said that Alexander Hamilton, the American\r\nstatesman and companion of George Washington, had divined Europe.\r\nCharles Greville, writing in November, 1830, speaks of meeting at\r\nbreakfast \"young Mill, a political economist,\" and adds that \"young Mill\r\nis the son of Mill who wrote the 'History of British India,' {282} and\r\nsaid to be cleverer than his father.\"  The elder Mill would no doubt have\r\ngladly endorsed the saying, and it may be assumed that history has given\r\nits judgment in the same way, but history will certainly maintain the\r\nfame of the father as well as the fame of the son.  A man of a very\r\ndifferent order from any of these we have just mentioned, but who has\r\nmade a reputation of his own in literature as well as in politics, closed\r\nhis career within the same reign.  We have already spoken in this volume\r\nof William Cobbett's command of simple, strong English, which made his\r\nprose style hardly inferior to that of Swift himself.  Indeed, one of the\r\nmost distinguished authors of the present day, a man who has made a name\r\nin political life as well as in literature, has been heard to contend\r\nwith earnestness that, as a writer of pure, strong, idiomatic English,\r\nCobbett might be accounted the rival of Swift.  The great engineer,\r\nTelford, and the really gifted and genuine, although eccentric and\r\nopinionated, physician, Dr. Abernethy, were among the celebrities whose\r\ndeaths rather than their works belong to the time when William the Fourth\r\nwas King.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1754-1834--Coleridge and Hannah More]\r\n\r\nPoetry, romance, and art suffered many heavy losses during the same time.\r\nWe have already chronicled the death of Walter Scott.  One who had known\r\nhim and had been kindly welcomed by him, James Hogg, the Ettrick\r\nShepherd, died three years after Scott in 1835.  The death of George\r\nCrabbe was one of the memorable events of the reign.  Crabbe might well\r\nbe described in the words which a later singer set out for his own\r\nepitaph, as \"the poet of the poor.\"  Crabbe pictured the struggles, the\r\nsufferings, the occasional gleams of happiness which are common to the\r\nlives of the poor with a realism as vigorous and as vivid as the prose of\r\nCharles Dickens himself could show, and he had touches here and there of\r\nexquisitely tender poetic feeling which were not unworthy of Keats or\r\nWordsworth.  Nothing was nobler in the life of Burke than his early\r\nappreciation and generous support of Crabbe.  Hannah More died in 1833.\r\nThe fame of this remarkable woman has somewhat faded of late years, and\r\neven the {283} most successful of her writings find probably but few\r\nreaders among the general public.  She has, however, won for herself a\r\ndistinct place in history, not less by her life itself than by her work\r\nin various fields of literature.  In her early days she had been an\r\nassociate of Samuel Johnson, Burke, and Goldsmith, and Reynolds, and she\r\nhad known Macaulay from his childhood.  She was always a writer with a\r\npurpose, whether she wrote a religious tract or an ethical essay, a\r\ntragedy or a novel.  She always strove to be a teacher, and the\r\nintellectual gifts with which she had been endowed were only valued by\r\nher in so far as they enabled her to serve the education and the moral\r\nprogress of humanity.  \"The rapt One of the godlike forehead, the\r\nheaven-eyed creature,\" as Wordsworth described Samuel Taylor Coleridge,\r\ndied in 1834.  Coleridge belonged to an order of intellect far higher\r\nthan that to which Crabbe or Hannah More had any claim.  He was indeed a\r\nman of genius in all but the very highest meaning of the word.  He was\r\npoet, philosopher, teacher, and critic, and in each department, had he\r\nworked in that alone, he must have won renown.  Perhaps if he had not\r\nworked in so many fields he might have obtained even a more exalted\r\nposition than that which history must assuredly assign to him.  His\r\ninfluence as a philosopher is probably fading now, although he\r\nunquestionably inspired whole schools of philosophic thought, and the\r\nworld remembers him rather as the author of \"The Ancient Mariner\" than as\r\nthe metaphysical student and teacher.  As a critic, in the highest sense\r\nof the word, he will always have the praise that should belong to the\r\nfirst who aroused the attention of Englishmen to the great new school of\r\nthoughtful criticism which was growing up in Germany under the influence\r\nof Lessing and of Goethe.  He would have deserved fame if only for his\r\ntranslations of some of Schiller's noblest dramas.  It has been justly\r\nsaid that Coleridge by his successful efforts to spread over England the\r\ninfluence of the higher German criticism did much to restore Shakespeare\r\nto that position as head of the world's modern literature from which\r\nEnglish {284} criticism and English tastes had done so much to displace\r\nhim since the days of Dryden.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1775-1836--Mrs. Siddons and Edmund Kean]\r\n\r\nThe death of Coleridge was soon followed by that of Charles Lamb, and,\r\nindeed, Coleridge's death may have had some effect in hastening that of\r\nhis dear and devoted friend.  In the same poem from which we have just\r\nquoted the lines that picture Coleridge, Wordsworth tells how \"Lamb, the\r\nfrolic and the gentle, has vanished from his lonely hearth.\"  Lamb was\r\nthe most exquisite of essayists and letter-writers, a man whose delicate\r\nhumor, playful irony, and happy gift of picturesque phrase claim for him\r\ntrue poetic genius.  The present generation has probably but a faint\r\nmemory of Felicia Hemans, whose verse had at one time an immense\r\npopularity among all readers with whom sweetness of sentiment, musical\r\nease, fluency of verse, and simple tenderness of feeling were enough to\r\nconstitute poetic art.  She, too, died not long before the close of the\r\nreign.  Many men who had won wide fame as pulpit orators and as religious\r\nteachers of various orders marked by their deaths as well as by their\r\nlives this chapter of history.  Rowland Hill was one of these, the great\r\npopular preacher, who flung aside conventionalities, and was ready to\r\npreach anywhere if he had hope of gathering an audience around him whom\r\nhe could move and teach, whether he spoke from the pulpit of a church or\r\na chapel, or from a platform in the open air, or in the midst of a crowd\r\nwith no platform at all.  Another was Robert Hall, admittedly one of the\r\nmost eloquent preachers of modern times.  Yet another was Adam Clarke,\r\nthe author of the celebrated \"Commentary on the Holy Scriptures.\"  Of\r\ncourse the fame of these men and women does not belong in the fuller\r\nsense to the reign of William the Fourth.  Some of them had wellnigh done\r\ntheir work before the reign began, none of them can be said to have won\r\nany new celebrity during the reign.  Their names are introduced here\r\nbecause their deaths were events of the moment and lend, in that way,\r\nadditional importance to the reign's history.\r\n\r\nThe fame of Mrs. Siddons can hardly be said to belong in any sense to the\r\ndays when William the Fourth sat on {285} the English throne, for she had\r\nretired from the stage many years before his accession, and only appeared\r\nin public on rare occasions and for some charitable object; but she died\r\nwithin the reign, and it must therefore find another distinction by its\r\nassociation with her name.  Two years later died Edmund Kean, who also\r\nmay be said to have closed his career as an actor before the reign had\r\nbegun.  Of the fame that is won on the boards of a theatre posterity can\r\nonly judge by hearsay.  The poet, the novelist, the historian, the\r\nphilosopher, the painter, the sculptor, leave their works always living\r\nbehind them, and the later generation has the same materials on which to\r\nform its judgment as were open to the world when the author or artist had\r\njust completed his work.  Even the orator can bequeath to all ages the\r\nwords he has spoken, although they are no longer to be accompanied by the\r\nemphasis of his gesture and accentuated by the music of his voice.  Of\r\nthe actor and the actress who have long passed away we can know nothing\r\nbut what their contemporaries have told us, and can form no judgment of\r\nour own.  We can hardly be wrong, however, in regarding Mrs. Siddons as\r\nby far the greatest tragic actress who has ever appeared on the English\r\nstage, and Edmund Kean as the greatest actor of Shakespearian tragedy\r\nwhom England has seen since the days of Garrick.  In mentioning these two\r\nnames, we must also be reminded of the name of Charles Mathews the elder,\r\nan actor of extraordinary versatility and genuine dramatic power, who is,\r\nhowever, best remembered as the originator of the style of theatrical\r\nentertainment which may be described as the \"At Home\" performance, in\r\nwhich he probably never had a rival.  Many of us can still remember his\r\nyet more gifted son, the younger Charles Mathews, the incomparable light\r\ncomedian of a later day.\r\n\r\nWe have told thus far, in this chapter, only of lights going out in\r\nliterature, art, philosophy, theology, and science.  Let us relieve the\r\npicture by recording that one rising star of the first magnitude in\r\nliterature cast its earliest rays over these latest years of William the\r\nFourth.  Early in 1836 the \"Sketches by Boz\" were published in a {286}\r\ncollected form, and a little later in the same year appeared the first\r\nnumber of \"The Pickwick Papers.\"  Then the world began to know that a man\r\nof thoroughly original genius had arisen, and before the reign was out\r\nthe young author, Charles Dickens, was accorded by all those whose\r\njudgment was worth having that place among the foremost English novelists\r\nwhich he has ever since retained and is ever likely to retain.  \"The\r\nPickwick Papers\" opened a new era in the history of English\r\nnovel-writing.  By a curious coincidence, the proposal of a young art\r\nstudent to furnish illustrations for Dickens's books being declined by\r\nthe author, led the young art student to believe that he had mistaken his\r\nvocation in trying to illustrate the works of other men, and he turned\r\nhis attention to literature, and afterwards became the one great rival of\r\nDickens, and will be known to all time as the author of \"Vanity Fair\" and\r\n\"The Newcomes.\"  None of the writings which made Thackeray's fame\r\nappeared during the time of William the Fourth, but his name may be\r\nassociated with the close of the reign by the incident which brought him\r\ninto an acquaintanceship with Dickens, and which led to his abandoning\r\nthe pencil for the pen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1772-1834--The impositions of Princess Olivia]\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the reign died one of the most audacious and\r\nastonishing impostors known to modern times.  Even the Tichborne claimant\r\nof the reign that followed makes but a poor show for inventiveness and\r\nenterprise when compared with the woman who described herself as the\r\nPrincess Olivia of Cumberland, and who claimed to be the daughter of King\r\nWilliam's brother.  This woman was the daughter of a house painter named\r\nWilmot, and was educated under the care of her uncle, the Rector of a\r\nparish in Warwickshire.  She received a good education, and even in her\r\nyoung days seemed to have a desire to exhibit herself as the heroine of\r\nstrange adventures.  At an early age she was married to John Serres, a\r\nman distinguished in his art, who obtained the position of painter to the\r\nKing and the Duke of Clarence, afterwards William the Fourth, and it was\r\nprobably this association with the surroundings of greater personages\r\nthat inspired {287} her with some of her bold conceptions.  Her husband\r\nand she did not get on very well together, and a separation took place;\r\nafter which for a while Mrs. Serres appeared on the stage, and then took\r\nto the art of painting on her own account, and actually succeeded in\r\ngetting herself appointed landscape painter to the Prince of Wales.  Her\r\nnext attempt was at novel-writing, and she also published a volume of\r\npoems and even ventured on the composition of an opera.  Later still she\r\nmade herself conspicuous by writing a volume to prove that her uncle, the\r\nRev. James Wilmot, was the actual author of the letters of Junius.  That\r\nwas only a beginning, for she soon after proclaimed herself the\r\nlegitimate daughter, by a secret marriage, of the Duke of Cumberland.\r\nShe made her claims known to the Prince Regent and all the other members\r\nof the royal family, and demanded a formal hearing in order that she\r\nmight prove her right to rank as one of them.  She was so far successful\r\nthat her claim was actually taken up by a member of the House of Commons,\r\nwho moved for the appointment of a Committee of the House to give it a\r\nfull investigation.  Sir Robert Peel promptly settled the question, so\r\nfar as regarded the appointment of a committee, by announcing that he\r\nheld in his hand a manifesto of the Princess Olivia, addressed to the\r\nhigh powers of the kingdom of Poland, in which she claimed to be the\r\ndescendant of Stanislaus Augustus.  Sir Robert Peel urged that as the two\r\nclaims were practically irreconcilable and were both made by the same\r\nclaimant, the House of Commons might consider itself relieved from the\r\nnecessity of appointing a Committee of Inquiry, and the House accepted\r\nhis advice.  Still, it is almost needless to say that many persons were\r\nfound quite willing to believe in the genuineness of the Princess\r\nOlivia's claim, and even in the genuineness of both her claims, and she\r\nhad indeed, for a time, a party of faithful and credulous followers as\r\nstrong as that which backed up the pretensions of the adventurer from\r\nWapping who proclaimed himself to be Sir Roger Tichborne.  The later\r\nyears of the self-created Princess Olivia were spent in poverty, and she\r\ndied within the rules of the {288} King's Bench.  Even in much later\r\ndays, however, her name was not wholly forgotten.\r\n\r\nA few lines may be spared to describe the career of a man who died not\r\nlong after the death of the Princess Olivia, and who belonged to that\r\nclass which used to be described as wonderful characters.  This was a man\r\nnamed James Norris, who came of a family of good position having property\r\nnear Devizes.  Norris received a good education, and at one time promised\r\nto make a name for himself as a student of natural history.  He is\r\ndescribed as \"handsome in person and elegant in manners,\" and we are told\r\nthat \"he possessed a highly cultivated mind which seemed to promise in\r\nearly life eminence in society, and that he would rise to be an ornament\r\nto the age in which he lived.\"  At a comparatively early age he had\r\noutlived all his family, and thus became the owner of large landed\r\nproperty.  He suddenly became a prey to strange, overmastering habits of\r\nindolence, apathy, and shyness, which gradually estranged him from all\r\nsociety.  He neglected his property, allowed his rents to remain for\r\nyears and years in the hands of his steward, without troubling himself\r\nabout them, and allowed his dividends to grow up in the hands of his\r\nbankers without concerning himself as to their amount, or even opening\r\nany letters which might be addressed to him on the subject.  He gave up\r\nshaving and allowed his hair and board to grow as they would; he never\r\nchanged his clothing or his linen until they became worn to rags; he lay\r\nin bed for the greater part of the day, took his principal meal about\r\nmidnight, then had a lonely ramble, and returned to bed as the morning\r\ndrew near.  He was hardly ever seen by anybody but his servants, and\r\ndeclined any communication even with his nearest neighbors.  When an\r\noccasion arose which actually compelled him to communicate with any one\r\nfrom the outer world, he would only consent to speak with a door, or at\r\nleast a screen, between him and the other party to the conversation.  All\r\nthe time he does not seem to have been engaged in any manner of study or\r\nwork, and he appears to have simply devoted himself to the full\r\nindulgence of his {289} passion for solitude.  His figure, or some sketch\r\nsuggested by it, has been made use of more than once by writers of\r\nfiction, but the man himself was a living figure in the reign of William\r\nthe Fourth, and died not long before its close.\r\n\r\nUnder the date of March 31, 1837, Charles Greville writes: \"Among the\r\nmany old people who have been cut off by this severe weather, one of the\r\nmost remarkable is Mrs. Fitzherbert, who died at Brighton at above eighty\r\nyears of age.  She was not a clever woman, but of a very noble spirit,\r\ndisinterested, generous, honest, and affectionate, greatly beloved by her\r\nfriends and relations, popular in the world, and treated with uniform\r\ndistinction and respect by the Royal Family.\"  The death of this\r\ncelebrated woman recalls to memory one of the saddest and most shameful\r\nchapters in the whole sad and shameful story of the utterly worthless\r\nPrince who became George the Fourth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1756-1837--Illness of William the Fourth]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the reign of William the Fourth was hastening to its close.\r\nThe King had had several attacks of illness, and more than once, before\r\nthe end was yet quite near, his physical condition went down so low that\r\nthose around him believed it impossible for him to rise again.  He\r\nrallied, however, more than once, and regained his good spirits and gave\r\nhope to those who had any real wish for his recovery that the reign had\r\nnot yet quite come to an end.  In some of his better moods he showed\r\nglimpses of that higher nature which was wont to assert itself fitfully\r\nnow and then at many periods of his career.  More than once he prayed\r\nfervently in these later days that his life might be spared until the\r\nPrincess Victoria should come of age.  Almost to the end the usual\r\nfestivities were kept up at Windsor Castle, and the Queen, by his wish,\r\nvisited the race-course at Ascot a few days before the end came; but it\r\nis recorded that she only remained an hour on the ground.  The formal\r\nannouncement that the King was seriously ill was not made until within a\r\nfew days of the sovereign's death.  Even when regular bulletins began to\r\nbe issued, they were so sparing of their information, and {290} so\r\ncarefully guarded against any suggestion of alarm, that the outer public\r\nhad really very little to go upon, except the bare fact that the King was\r\ngrowing to be an old man, and that he was liable to fits of illness just\r\nas he had been for years before.  It would appear that it was William's\r\nwhim to dictate the bulletins himself, and that he was very anxious not\r\nto allow a word to go forth which might convey a knowledge of his actual\r\ncondition.  The poor old sovereign was apparently inspired by the full\r\nconviction that the prolongation of his life was of the utmost importance\r\nto the welfare of his people, and it may be fully believed that his\r\nunwillingness to admit the imminence of danger to his life came from an\r\nhonest sort of public purpose.  He gave his attention to the business of\r\nthe State almost to the very last.  All the time those who were\r\nimmediately around the sinking sovereign knew quite well that the end was\r\nclose at hand, and were already consulting earnestly and constantly as to\r\nthe steps which ought to be taken to prepare for the new reign, even as\r\nto the matter of mere ceremonials which were to accompany the accession\r\nof a woman as sovereign.  On June 16 Greville says: \"Met Sir Robert Peel\r\nin the Park, and talked with him about the beginning of the new reign.\r\nHe said that it was very desirable that the young Queen should appear as\r\nmuch as possible emancipated from all restraint, and exhibit a capacity\r\nfor the discharge of her high functions.  That the most probable as well\r\nas the most expedient course she could adopt would be to rely entirely on\r\nthe advice of Melbourne, and she might with great propriety say that she\r\nthought it incumbent on her to follow the example which had been set by\r\nher two uncles, her predecessors, George the Fourth and William the\r\nFourth.\"  Each of these had retained the ministers whom he found in\r\noffice, although not quite of his own pattern.  There were some fears, at\r\nthe time, that Leopold, King of the Belgians, might hasten over to\r\nEngland, and might exercise, or at least be suspected of exercising, an\r\nundue influence over the young Princess Victoria.  Headers at the present\r\nday will notice, perhaps with peculiar interest, the observation made by\r\n{291} Greville that \"Lord Durham is on his way home, and his return is\r\nregarded with no little curiosity, because he may endeavor to play a\r\ngreat political part, and materially to influence the opinions, or at\r\nleast the councils, of the Queen.\"  Lord Durham, up to this time, was\r\nregarded by most people merely as a Radical of a very advanced order,\r\nburning with strong political ambitions, fitfully impelled with\r\npassionate likings and dislikings, and capable of proving a serious\r\ntrouble to the quiet of the new reign.  We know now that Durham was soon\r\ndrawn away almost altogether from home politics, disappointing thereby\r\nmany of his Radical admirers, and that he found a new field of success,\r\nand established for himself an abiding-place in history as the statesman\r\nto whose courage, energy, and genius is owing the foundation of the\r\nself-governing, prosperous, peaceful, and loyal Dominion of Canada, which\r\nhas again and again proved itself in recent times an important part of\r\nthe empire's strength.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1837--The Princess Victoria]\r\n\r\nWriting of the Princess Victoria, Greville goes on to say: \"What renders\r\nspeculation so easy, and events uncertain, is the absolute ignorance of\r\neverybody, without exception, of the character, disposition, and capacity\r\nof the Princess.  She has been kept in such jealous seclusion by her\r\nmother (never having slept out of her bedroom, nor been alone with\r\nanybody but herself and the Baroness Lehzen), that not one of her\r\nacquaintance, none of the attendants at Kensington, not even the Duchess\r\nof Northumberland, her governess, have any idea what she is or what she\r\npromises to be.\"  Greville tells us that \"the Tories are in great\r\nconsternation at the King's approaching death,\" because they fear that\r\nthe new sovereign is not likely to make any advances to them, while \"the\r\nWhigs, to do them justice, behave with great decency; whatever they may\r\nreally feel, they express a very proper concern, and I have no doubt\r\nMelbourne really feels the concern he expresses.\"  Then Greville\r\ndismisses, for the moment, the whole subject with the words: \"The public\r\nin general don't seem to care much, and only wonder what will happen.\"\r\nThe chronicler no doubt expressed very correctly the {292} public\r\nfeeling.  Of course, there is nothing surprising in the fact that while\r\nthe poor King lay dying those who had any official relations with the\r\nCourt or with Parliament were occupying themselves, during the greater\r\npart of the time, with speculations as to the immediate changes which his\r\ndeath would bring about, and with discussions and disputations as to the\r\nproper arrangements and ceremonials to accompany and to follow his\r\npassing away from this world.  Something of the same kind must have\r\nhappened in the case of any Windsor shopkeeper whose family and friends\r\nwere in hourly expectation of his death, and it is only when such\r\ndiscussions and arrangements come to be recorded as a part of the history\r\nof a reign that we are likely to feel impressed by the difference between\r\nthe prosaic, practical details of the business of this world and the\r\nsacred solemnity of the event that is supposed already to cast its shadow\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1837--Death of William the Fourth]\r\n\r\nThere appears to have been some dispute between the authorities of Church\r\nand State as to the offering up of prayers in the churches for the\r\nrecovery of the King.  William was anxious that the prayers should be\r\noffered at once, and the Privy Council assembled to make the order; but\r\nthe Bishop of London raised an objection, not to the offering of the\r\nprayers, but to the suggestion that the prayers were to be offered in\r\nobedience to an order coming from the Lords in Council.  The Bishop\r\nmaintained that the Lords had no power to make any such order.  In the\r\ndiscussion which took place it appears that some eminent lawyers were of\r\nopinion that even the King himself had no power to order the use of any\r\nparticular prayers, or, at all events, that even if he had any such power\r\nit was in virtue of his position as head of the Church and not as head of\r\nthe State.  This was indeed to raise what the late Baron Bramwell once\r\nhumorously described as \"a most delightful point of law.\"  The difficulty\r\nappears to have been got over by a sort of compromise, the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury undertaking to order, on his own authority, that prayers\r\nshould be offered up in all churches for the King's recovery, and the\r\norder was no {293} doubt dutifully obeyed.  To complete the satirical\r\nhumor of the situation King William ought actually to have died while the\r\ndispute was still going on as to the precise authority by which prayers\r\nwere to be offered up for his recovery, but some sort of effective\r\narrangement was made during the monarch's few remaining hours of life,\r\nand the appeal on his behalf was duly made.\r\n\r\nOn June 19 the King was found to be falling deeper and deeper into\r\nweakness, which seemed to put all chance of his recovery out of\r\nreasonable consideration, and the Sacrament was administered to him by\r\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury.  One of the King's last utterances may be\r\nset down as in the best sense characteristic--it illustrated, that is to\r\nsay, the best side of his character.  \"Believe me,\" were the words of the\r\ndying King, \"that I have always been a religious man.\"  It may be\r\nadmitted, in justice to William, that according to his generally dull and\r\noften confused and hazy lights he did always recognize the standard,\r\nhigher than that of mere expediency, or political compromise, or personal\r\nconvenience, set up to regulate the conduct even of princes.\r\n\r\nThe reign came to an end on June 30, 1837.  Shortly after two o'clock\r\nthat morning King William passed away.  He died calmly and without a\r\nstruggle.  The closing hours of his life had a resignation and a dignity\r\nabout them which might well have fitted the end of one whose whole\r\ncareer, public and private, had been more dignified and more noble than\r\nthat of the poor, eccentric, restless, illiterate personage who succeeded\r\nthe last of the Georges on the throne of England.  It must be owned that,\r\nwhatever the personal defects and disadvantages of the sovereign, the\r\nreign of King William the Fourth had been more beneficent in politics\r\nthan that of any of his predecessors since the days of Queen Anne.  For\r\nthe first time in the modern history of England the voice of the people\r\nhad been authorized by legislation to have some influence over the\r\ndirection of national affairs.  The passing of the great Reform measure,\r\nand the rush of other reforms which followed it, opened the way for a new\r\nsystem of {294} administration, the beneficial effects of which in the\r\npolitical and social life of the empire have been expanding ever since.\r\nWith the reign of William the Fourth the principle of personal rule, or\r\nrule by the mere decree and will of the sovereign, came to an end.  If\r\nthe reign is to be judged by the work it accomplished, it cannot but be\r\nset down in history as a great reign.  Perhaps there were few men in\r\nEngland of whatever class, high or low, who had less of the quality of\r\npersonal greatness than William the Fourth.  He had greatness thrust upon\r\nhim by the mere fact that fate would have him King.  He contributed\r\nnothing towards the accomplishment of the many important works which are\r\nthe best monuments of his reign, except by the negative merit of having\r\nat least not done anything to prevent their being accomplished.  Even\r\nthis, however, is a claim to the respect of posterity which must be\r\ndenied to some of his nearest predecessors.  He ruled over a great\r\ncountry without acquiring during his course any quality of greatness for\r\nhimself.  He was like the glass of the window, which admits the light of\r\nthe sun without any light-creating power of its own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{295}\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abernethy, Dr., death, iv. 282.\r\n  Act for better securing the Dependency of Ireland, i. 177.\r\n  Act of Settlement, i. 4.\r\n  Act of Union passed, iii. 327, 330.\r\n  Acts of Trade, iii. 82, 84, 86, 105.\r\n  Adams, John:\r\n    Conduct towards Colonel Preston, iii. 152.\r\n    Opposes dominion of England, iii. 85.\r\n  Adams, Samuel, protests against Stamp Act, iii. 90.\r\n  Addington, Henry, Viscount Sidmouth, Prime Minister, iii. 337.\r\n  Addison, Joseph:\r\n    M.
