Hamilton's work was of that\r\nconstructive sort which is vital for laying the foundations of new\r\nstates. Whether the Union would have been formed under the\r\nConstitution and would have been consolidated into a powerful nation,\r\ninstead of a loose confederation of sovereign states, without the\r\ngreat services of Hamilton, is one of those problems about which\r\nspeculation is futile. It is certain that the conditions of the time\r\npresented a rare opportunity for such a man as Hamilton, and that\r\nwithout some directing and organizing genius like his, the\r\nconsolidation of the Union must have been delayed, and have been\r\naccomplished with much travail.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the career of Hamilton in America and that of\r\nthe two greatest organizing minds of other countries--Cæsar and\r\nNapoleon--marks the difference between Anglo-Saxon political ideals\r\nand capacity for self-government and those of other races. Where the\r\norganization of a strong government degenerated in Rome and France\r\ninto absolutism, it tended in America, under the directing genius of\r\nHamilton, to place in the hands of the people a more powerful\r\ninstrument for executing their own will. So powerful a weapon was thus\r\ncreated that Hamilton himself became alarmed when it was seized by the\r\nhands of Jefferson, Madison, and other democratic leaders as the\r\ninstrument of democratic ideas, and those long strides were taken in\r\nthe states and under the federal government which wiped out the\r\ndistinctions between classes, abolished the relations of church and\r\nstate, extended the suffrage, and made the government only the servant\r\nof the popular will.\r\n\r\nThe development of two principles marked the early history of the\r\nRepublic,--one, the growth of sentiment for the Union under the\r\ninspiration of Hamilton and the Federalist party; the other, the\r\ngrowth of the power of the masses, typified by the leadership of\r\nJefferson and the Democratic party. These two tendencies, seemingly\r\nhostile in many of their aspects, waxed in strength together until\r\nthey became the united and guiding principles of a new political\r\norder,--a nation of giant strength whose power rests upon the will of\r\nall the people. It was the steady progress of these two principles in\r\nthe heart of the American people which in \"the fullness of time\" made\r\nit possible for the Union to be preserved as a union of free men under\r\na free constitution. To Hamilton, the creator of the machinery of the\r\nUnion, and to John Marshall, the great Chief Justice, who interpreted\r\nthe Constitution as Hamilton would have had him do, in favor of the\r\npowers of the Union, this result was largely due.\r\n\r\nIf Cæsar, fighting the battles of Rome on the frontier of Germany,\r\nand kept from party quarrels at home, and Napoleon, born outside of\r\nFrance and free by his campaign in Egypt from the compromising\r\nintrigues of Parisian politics, were preëminently fitted by these\r\naccidents to transmute the spirit of revolution from chaos into order,\r\nHamilton stood in somewhat the same position in America. Born in the\r\nlittle island of Nevis in the West Indies (January 11, 1757), he came\r\nto the United States when his mind was already mature, in spite of his\r\nfifteen years. He came without the local prejudices or state pride\r\nwhich influenced so many of the Revolutionary leaders, and was\r\ntherefore peculiarly qualified to fasten his eyes steadfastly upon the\r\nsingle end of the creation of a nation rather than the ascendency of\r\nany single state. He was so free from local attachments that he even\r\nhesitated at first on which side he should cast his lot,--whether with\r\nthe imperial government of Great Britain, which appealed strongly to\r\nhis love of system and organized power, or with the struggling\r\nrevolutionists, with their poor and undisciplined army and uncertain\r\nfuture. The possibility of winning distinction in the service of Great\r\nBritain must have attracted him, but the justice of the colonial cause\r\nspoke more strongly to his sense of right and his well-ordered mind.\r\n\r\nThe great services of Hamilton were nearly all performed before he was\r\nforty years of age. His precocity was partly derived from his birth in\r\nthe tropics and partly, perhaps, from the unfortunate conditions of\r\nhis early life. A mystery hangs over his birth and parentage, which\r\nrepeated inquiries have failed to clear away. He is believed to have\r\nbeen the son of James Hamilton, a Scottish merchant of Nevis, and a\r\nlady of French Hugenot descent, the divorced wife of a Dane named\r\nLavine. But the history of his parents and their marriage is shrouded\r\nin much obscurity. The father, although reduced to poverty, lived\r\nnearly if not quite as long as his illustrious son, but the mother was\r\nreported to have died while Hamilton was only a child, leaving the\r\nmemory of her beauty and charm in one of the chambers of his infant\r\nmind. Hamilton sought in his later years to establish regular\r\ncommunication with his father, and he had a brother in the West Indies\r\nwith whom he corresponded; but the fact that all these relatives\r\nremained so much in the background gave some color to the slanders of\r\nhis enemies concerning his birth.\r\n\r\nTo offset the disadvantages of birth, Hamilton had neither the\r\nfascinating manners which go straight to the hearts of men, nor the\r\nimposing personal presence which in the orator often invests trifling\r\nplatitudes with sonorous dignity. He was possessed of a light and\r\nwell-made frame, and was erect and dignified in bearing, but was much\r\nbelow the average height. His friends were wont to call him \"the\r\nlittle lion,\" because of the vigor and dignity of his speech. He had\r\nthe advantage of a head finely shaped, large and symmetrical. His\r\ncomplexion was fair, his cheeks were rosy, and in spite of a rather\r\nlarge nose his face was considered handsome. His dark, deep-set eyes\r\nwere lighted in debate with a fire which controlled great audiences\r\nand cowed his enemies. But it was chiefly the power of pure intellect\r\nwhich gave him control over the minds of other men. There was nothing\r\nmean or low in his character, but he had not a high opinion of the\r\naverage of humanity, and therefore lacked somewhat in that ready\r\nsympathy with the minds of others which is so useful to politicians\r\nand party leaders.\r\n\r\nHamilton was early thrown upon his own resources. His father became a\r\nbankrupt, and he was cared for by his mother's relatives. His\r\neducation was aided by the Rev. Hugh Knox, a Presbyterian clergyman,\r\nwith whom Hamilton kept up an affectionate correspondence in later\r\nyears. The boy was only thirteen years of age when he was placed in\r\nthe office of Nicholas Cruger, a West Indian merchant. Here his\r\nself-reliance and methodical habits made him master of the business\r\nand head of the establishment when his employer had occasion to be\r\naway. His remarkable capacity, and his occasional writings for the\r\ndaily press, led to a determination by his relatives and friends to\r\nsend him to a wider field. He was accordingly supplied with funds and\r\nsent to Boston, where he arrived in October, 1772, still less than\r\nsixteen years of age. He was fortunately provided with some strong\r\nletters of recommendation from Dr. Knox, and was soon at a grammar\r\nschool at Elizabethtown, N.J., where he made rapid progress. He\r\ndesired to enter Princeton, but his project of going through the\r\ncourses as rapidly as he could, without regard to the regular classes,\r\nwas in conflict with the rules. He therefore turned to King's College,\r\nNew York, now Columbia University, where he was able, with the aid of\r\na private tutor, to pursue his studies in the manner which he wished.\r\n\r\nThe decision of Hamilton to take the side of the colonies in the\r\nconflict with England was made early in 1774, partly as the result of\r\na visit to Boston. Among the well-to-do classes of New York, the\r\ndominant feeling was in favor of Great Britain, and the control of the\r\nAssembly was in the hands of the friends of the Crown. Hamilton found\r\nBoston the hotbed of resistance to England, and listened attentively\r\nto the reasoning by which the \"strong prejudices on the ministerial\r\nside,\" which he himself declares he had formed, gave way to \"the\r\nsuperior force of the arguments in favor of the colonial claims.\" The\r\nopportunity soon came for him to make public proclamation of his\r\nposition. A great meeting was held in the \"Fields\"[1] (July 6, 1774),\r\nto force the hand of the Tory Assembly in the matter of joining the\r\nother colonies in calling a Congress. Hamilton attended, and after\r\nlistening to the speeches was so strongly impressed with what was left\r\nunsaid that he worked his way to the platform and began an impassioned\r\nargument for the colonial side. Below the normal stature and of\r\nslender form, he looked even younger than his seventeen years, but was\r\nrecognized by the crowd as a collegian and received with great\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The \"Fields\" of that day occupied what is now City Hall\r\nPark, then the upper limit of New York. King's College was in the\r\nimmediate neighborhood, the name still lingering in College Place.]\r\n\r\nHamilton was soon at the forefront of the fight for civil liberty,\r\nwhich was carried on by means of pamphlets and newspaper addresses.\r\nHis papers, which appeared without signature, showed so much ability\r\nthat they were attributed to the most eminent of the patriot leaders.\r\nAfter the die was cast at Lexington for armed conflict, Hamilton early\r\nin 1776 received the command of a company of artillery. Its thorough\r\ndiscipline attracted the favorable notice of Greene and other leaders.\r\nGreene introduced Hamilton to Washington, who had early occasion, in\r\nthe disastrous battle of Long Island, when Hamilton protected the rear\r\nwith great coolness and courage, to measure the mettle of his young\r\nartillery officer.\r\n\r\nWashington on March 1, 1777, offered Hamilton the rank of\r\nLieutenant-Colonel on his staff. In this position Hamilton found\r\ncongenial occupation for his pen in the great mass of letters,\r\nreports, and proclamations which issued from headquarters. These\r\ncommunications, many of which still survive, while bearing the impress\r\nof Washington's clear, directing mind, bear also the mark of the\r\nskill and logic of the younger man. Hamilton rendered valuable service\r\nafter the surrender of Burgoyne, in persuading Gates to detach a part\r\nof his forces to aid Washington. On this occasion, although he had in\r\nhis pocket a positive order from Washington, he displayed a tact and\r\ndiplomatic skill which were unusual in his dealings with men. It fell\r\nto the lot of Hamilton to meet André while a prisoner in the hands of\r\nthe Americans, and his letters regarding the affair to Miss Schuyler,\r\nwho afterwards became his wife, are among the most interesting\r\ncontributions to this pathetic episode of Revolutionary history.\r\n\r\nHamilton's quarrel with Washington, about which much has been written,\r\ncame after nearly four years' service over a trivial delay in obeying\r\na call from the General. Washington rebuked his aide for disrespect,\r\nto which Hamilton hotly retorted, \"I am not conscious of it, sir; but\r\nsince you have thought it, we part.\" Washington endeavored to prevent\r\nthe execution of his project, but Hamilton would not be reconciled\r\nand returned to service in the line. He led his men with great\r\nimpetuosity upon one of the British redoubts at Yorktown, and carried\r\nthe position in ten minutes, with much more promptness than the\r\nFrench, to whom the other redoubt had been assigned.\r\n\r\nWhile the war was still in progress Hamilton was looking ahead with\r\nthe constructive genius which afterwards found such wide opportunities\r\nin the cabinet of Washington. He addressed a letter in 1780 to Duane,\r\na member of Congress, in which he made a remarkable analysis of the\r\ndefects of the Articles of Confederation, urged that Congress should\r\nbe clothed with complete sovereignty, and made suggestions regarding\r\nits powers which were afterwards embodied to a large extent in the\r\nConstitution. He addressed an anonymous letter to Robert Morris early\r\nin the same year, treating of the financial affairs of the\r\nconfederacy. He discussed carefully the paper currency and the causes\r\nof its depreciation, and proposed to restore soundness to the finances\r\nby gradual contraction of the volume of paper, a tax in kind, and a\r\nforeign loan, which was to form the basis of a national bank. When the\r\nclumsiness and helplessness of the system of government by committees\r\nwas finally appreciated by the Continental Congress in 1781, and\r\nseveral executive departments were established, Hamilton was suggested\r\nby John Sullivan to Washington for head of the Treasury Department.\r\nWashington replied that \"few of his age have a more general knowledge,\r\nand no one is more firmly engaged in the cause, or exceeds him in\r\nprobity and sterling virtue.\" Robert Morris was chosen for the\r\nTreasury, but Hamilton opened a correspondence with him regarding the\r\nwork of the department, which established a firm friendship between\r\nthe older and younger man.\r\n\r\nHamilton desired the unification of the debt and the creation of a\r\nnational bank, for the combined objects of cementing the Union and\r\nputting the finances of the country upon a stable basis. \"A national\r\ndebt,\" he wrote, \"if it is not excessive, will be a national\r\nblessing, a powerful cement of union, a necessity for keeping up\r\ntaxation, and a spur to industry.\" Whether all these benefits fall\r\nwithin the economic effects of a debt may well be doubted, but the\r\nsecond advantage assigned was undoubtedly one of the chief motives of\r\nHamilton in recommending its creation. The Bank of North America was\r\nestablished by Morris upon a much more modest scale than was proposed\r\nby Hamilton. The younger man, looking to the future needs of the\r\ncountry and to the example of European banks, recommended an\r\ninstitution with a capital of ten or fifteen millions, with authority\r\nto establish branches, and with the sole right to issue paper currency\r\nequal to the amount of its capital. He contemplated a close relation\r\nbetween the bank and the government, and the taking up, under contract\r\nwith the United States, of all the paper issues of the Continental\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nHamilton made a connection while still under twenty-four which fixed\r\nhis status as a citizen of New York, and proved of value to him in\r\nmany ways. While on his mission to Gates at Albany, he met Miss\r\nElizabeth Schuyler, daughter of General Philip Schuyler, one of the\r\nsocial as well as political leaders of the best element in New York.\r\nThe acquaintance with Miss Schuyler was renewed in the spring of 1780\r\nand ripened into an engagement, followed by their marriage on December\r\n14 of that year. With the conclusion of the war, Hamilton was left\r\nwith nothing but his title to arrears of pay in the army, and with a\r\nwife and child to support. He refused generous offers of assistance\r\nfrom his father-in-law, applied himself for four months to the study\r\nof the law, and in the summer of 1782 was admitted to the bar at\r\nAlbany. While waiting for clients he continued his studies on\r\nfinancial and political questions and his vigorous arguments through\r\nthe public prints for a strong federal union. He declined several\r\noffers of public place, but finally accepted an appointment from\r\nRobert Morris (June, 1782) as continental receiver of taxes for New\r\nYork. This afforded him an opportunity of meeting the New York\r\nlegislature, which had been summoned in extra session at Poughkeepsie,\r\nin July, to receive a report from a committee of Congress.\r\n\r\nCongress in May, 1782, had taken into consideration the desperate\r\ncondition of the finances of the country, and divided among four of\r\nits members the duty of explaining the common danger of the states. It\r\nwas at the request of the delegation which went north that Governor\r\nClinton called an extra session, and a communication was submitted on\r\nthe necessity of providing for a vigorous prosecution of the war.\r\nHamilton went to Poughkeepsie to aid his father-in-law, General\r\nSchuyler, and it was upon the motion of the latter that the Senate\r\nresolved itself into a committee of the whole on the state of the\r\nnation. Two days of deliberation were sufficient to produce a series\r\nof resolutions, probably drafted by Hamilton, which were unanimously\r\nadopted by the Senate and concurred in by the House.\r\n\r\nThese resolutions set forth that recent experience afforded \"the\r\nstrongest reason to apprehend from a continuance of the present\r\nconstitution of the continental government a subversion of public\r\ncredit\" and danger to the safety and independence of the states.\r\nTurning to practical remedies, it was pointed out that the source of\r\nthe public embarrassments was the want of sufficient power in\r\nCongress, particularly the power of providing a revenue. The\r\nlegislature of New York, therefore, invited Congress \"to recommend and\r\neach state to adopt the measure of assembling a general convention of\r\nthe states especially authorized to revise and amend the\r\nconfederation, reserving a right to the respective legislatures to\r\nratify their determinations.\" These resolutions the government was\r\nrequested to transmit to Congress and to the executives of the other\r\nstates. Hamilton appeared before the legislature and discussed the\r\nsubject of revenue, and one of the results of his manifest interest in\r\nthe subject and his knowledge of finance was his selection by the\r\nlegislature as one of the members of Congress from New York.\r\n\r\nThe impress of the organizing mind and far-sighted purposes of\r\nHamilton was felt during his brief service in Congress. He took his\r\nseat from New York in November, 1782, and resigned in August, 1783. He\r\ncast his influence from the beginning in favor of a strong executive\r\norganization, and did his best to strengthen the heads of the recently\r\ncreated departments of finance and foreign affairs. He was of great\r\nservice to Robert Morris, and almost carried the project of a general\r\nduty on importations, which was finally defeated by the obstinacy of\r\nRhode Island. Such a measure, if carried out, would have afforded the\r\ncentral government a permanent revenue. It would have greatly\r\nmitigated the evils of the time, but would perhaps by that very fact\r\nhave postponed the more complete union of the states which was to come\r\nunder the Constitution of 1789. This was only one of the many projects\r\ngerminating in the fertile mind of Hamilton. In a letter to Washington\r\n(March 17, 1783) he wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"We have made considerable progress in a plan to be recommended to\r\nthe several states for funding all the public debts, including those\r\nof the army, which is certainly the only way to restore public credit\r\nand enable us to continue the war by borrowing abroad, if it should be\r\nnecessary to continue it.\"\r\n\r\nThat it might be necessary to continue the war Hamilton seriously\r\nfeared, in spite of the fact that the provisional treaty of peace with\r\nGreat Britain was then before Congress. A grave question had arisen\r\nwhether faith had been kept with France in the negotiation of this\r\ntreaty. Congress had resolved unanimously (October 4, 1782) that \"they\r\nwill not enter into any discussion of overtures of pacification but in\r\n_confidence_ and in _concert_ with His Most Christian Majesty,\" the\r\nKing of France. Adams and Jay, against the advice of Franklin,\r\nnegotiated secretly with Great Britain, and only the moderation of\r\nVergennes, French Minister of Foreign Affairs, prevented serious\r\nfriction between the allies.\r\n\r\nHamilton, though far from being a partisan of France, believed in\r\nacting towards her with the most scrupulous good faith. He advocated a\r\nmiddle course between subserviency to Great Britain and implicit\r\nconfidence in the disinterestedness of France. He declared (March 18,\r\n1783), when the peace preliminaries were considered, that it was \"not\r\nimprobable that it had been the policy of France to procrastinate the\r\ndefinite acknowledgment of our independence on the part of Great\r\nBritain, in order to keep us more knit to herself, and until her own\r\ninterests could be negotiated.\" Notwithstanding this caution regarding\r\nFrench purposes, he \"disapproved highly of the conduct of our\r\nministers in not showing the preliminary articles to our ally before\r\nthey signed them, and still more so of their agreeing to the separate\r\narticle.\" His own view was expressed in some resolutions which he\r\noffered, and which Congress adopted (May 2, 1783), asking a further\r\nloan from the French King, \"and that His Majesty might be informed\r\nthat Congress will consider his compliance in this instance as a new\r\nand valuable proof of his friendship, peculiarly interesting in the\r\npresent conjuncture of the affairs of the United States.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE FIGHT FOR THE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nHamilton was not a conspicuous national figure during the four years\r\nwhich elapsed between the termination of his term in Congress and his\r\nappearance in the Federal Convention of 1787. He was working none the\r\nless earnestly and persistently, however, in favor of a stronger\r\nunion. Movements towards this union took form almost simultaneously in\r\ndifferent parts of the country under the impulse of a common need. The\r\nwise and thoughtful words of Washington, in his circular letter to the\r\ngovernor of each state on surrendering the command of the army (June\r\n8, 1783), sank into many hearts, and did much to soften local\r\nprejudices against giving more power to the central government. The\r\nState of Virginia in December, 1783, ceded her northwestern territory\r\nto Congress, and granted a general impost. Significance was given to\r\nthe act by the policy of the governor in communicating it to the\r\nexecutive authority of the other states, with the suggestion that they\r\ndo likewise.\r\n\r\nJefferson was as cordial a supporter as Madison at that time of the\r\nproject of a federal union. As a member of Congress, he prepared a\r\nplan for intercourse with the powers of Europe and the Barbary States,\r\nin which he described \"the United States as one nation upon the\r\nprinciples of the federal constitution.\" Only two states--Rhode Island\r\nand Connecticut--voted to substitute weaker words in describing the\r\nunion. It was voted by eight states to two (March 26, 1784) that in\r\ntreaties and in all cases arising under them, the United States formed\r\n\"one nation.\" The need for uniform rules for the regulation of\r\ncommerce on the Potomac and the creation of roads and canals led to a\r\nnumber of conferences during the next two years between Virginia and\r\nMaryland, in one of which Washington played the part of referee. The\r\nlegislature of Maryland finally took a step which shot a bright ray\r\nof light through the darkness surrounding the prospects of a permanent\r\nunion. In a letter to the legislature of Virginia (December, 1785), it\r\nproposed that commissioners from all the states should be invited to\r\nmeet and regulate the restrictions on commerce for the whole. Madison\r\nin Virginia gave cordial welcome to the invitation. He had already\r\ngone beyond the sentiment of his state in his zeal for union, but at\r\nhis instigation a meeting of delegates from the states was called by\r\nVirginia at Annapolis, Md., for September, 1786.\r\n\r\nHamilton snatched at the opportunity which this invitation presented.\r\nSeveral of his friends were elected to the legislature of New York,\r\nand made the appointment of delegates to Annapolis their paramount\r\nobject. In spite of much hostility, they succeeded in wresting\r\nauthority from the legislature for a commission of five. Hamilton and\r\nBenson were the only two of these delegates who appeared at Annapolis.\r\nThey found only four other states represented there. It was\r\ndetermined that the best that could be done by the little gathering\r\nwas to urge upon the states a general convention, to meet at\r\nPhiladelphia on the second Monday of the next May, \"to consider the\r\nsituation of the United States, and devise such further provisions as\r\nshould appear necessary to render the constitution of the federal\r\ngovernment adequate to the exigencies of the Union.\" Hamilton was not\r\na member of the committee appointed to prepare the report, but it was\r\nhis draft which, with some modifications to meet the sensibilities of\r\nthe Virginians, was accepted and adopted.\r\n\r\nA path was now blazed in which those who favored a stronger union\r\ncould walk in harmony. Hamilton returned to New York with the\r\nintention of exerting his whole strength in behalf of the convention.\r\nHe secured an election to the legislature, and at once took the lead\r\nof the members opposed to the separatist policy of Governor Clinton.\r\nHe assailed the governor on the question of granting an impost to\r\nCongress in a practicable form, but was beaten by the solid vote of\r\nthe party in power. He succeeded better with his resolution for the\r\nappointment of five delegates to the convention at Philadelphia. The\r\nSenate cut down the number to three, and two of them--Chief Justice\r\nRobert Yates and John Lansing, Jr.--were resolute supporters of the\r\ngovernor; but Hamilton carried the vital point that New York should be\r\nrepresented in the Federal Convention, and he was himself one of the\r\ndelegates. It was not until late in February, 1787, that this action\r\nwas taken,--little more than three months before the meeting of the\r\nconvention,--and it was a few days later when formal approval was\r\ngiven to the project by the Federal Congress.\r\n\r\nHamilton, although one of the three delegates from New York to the\r\nconvention, was embarrassed throughout the proceedings by the open\r\nhostility of his associates to any vigorous steps towards a strong\r\nunion. He had definite ideas and strong feelings, however, and could\r\nnot restrain himself from setting forth his views of what the new\r\ngovernment should be. When Dickinson proposed that the convention\r\nshould seek union through a revision of the old Articles of\r\nConfederation, Hamilton took the floor (June 18, 1787) to show how\r\ninadequate such a measure would be, and to set forth his own long\r\nmatured views. He spoke for six hours, reviewing the history of the\r\ncolonies before the Revolution, during its progress, and afterwards,\r\nthe steps which had been taken towards union, and the imperative\r\nnecessity which had been disclosed for a government possessing\r\ncomplete powers within its fields of action. He urged that the\r\nconvention \"adopt a solid plan without regard to temporary opinions.\"\r\nHe laid bare unsparingly the defects of the confederacy, and insisted\r\nthat the Articles of Confederation could not be amended with benefit\r\nexcept in the most radical manner. He opposed strongly the creation of\r\na general government through a single body like Congress, because it\r\nwould be without checks. He continued:--\r\n\r\n\"The general government must not only have a strong soul, but strong\r\norgans by which that soul is to operate. I despair that a republican\r\nform of government can remove the difficulties; I would hold it,\r\nhowever, unwise to change it. The best form of government, not\r\nattainable by us, but the model to which we should approach as near as\r\npossible, is the British constitution, praised by Necker as 'the only\r\ngovernment which unites public strength with individual security.' Its\r\nhouse of lords is a most noble institution. It forms a permanent\r\nbarrier against every pernicious innovation, whether attempted on the\r\npart of the crown or of the commons.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton made little concealment of his belief that the new government\r\nshould not be exclusively republican. He said on June 26, 1787:--\r\n\r\n\"I acknowledge I do not think favorably of republican government; but\r\nI address my remarks to those who do, in order to prevail on them to\r\ntone their government as high as possible. I profess myself as zealous\r\nan advocate for liberty as any man whatever; and trust I shall be as\r\nwilling a martyr to it, though I differ as to the form in which it is\r\nmost eligible. Real liberty is neither found in despotism nor in the\r\nextremes of democracy, but in moderate governments. Those who mean to\r\nform a solid republic ought to proceed to the confines of another\r\ngovernment. If we incline too much to democracy, we shall soon shoot\r\ninto a monarchy.\"\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of these views, Hamilton urged that all branches of the\r\nnew government should originate in the action of the people rather\r\nthan of the states. In this respect he came closer to democracy than\r\nsome of his opponents, but he proposed to give strength and permanence\r\nto the government by providing that the Senators and the executive\r\nshould hold office during good behavior. He contended that by making\r\nthe chief executive subject to impeachment, the term monarchy would\r\nnot be applicable to his office. Another step differing radically from\r\nthe Constitution as adopted, and showing the unswerving purpose of\r\nHamilton to give supremacy to the central government, was the proposal\r\nthat the executive of each state should be appointed by the general\r\ngovernment and have a negative on all state legislation.\r\n\r\nHamilton had no expectation that his plan would be adopted. What he\r\nsought was to key the temper of the delegates up to a pitch which\r\nwould bring them as nearly to his ideal of what the new government\r\nshould be as was possible under the circumstances of the times. His\r\nlong speech was attentively listened to, and even Yates reported that\r\nit \"was praised by everybody, but supported by none.\" Notwithstanding\r\nthese criticisms, the Constitution, as it was finally adopted,\r\nembodied many of the features of the project which was outlined by\r\nHamilton. A legislative body of two houses, the choice of the\r\nexecutive by electors, a veto for the executive over legislative acts,\r\nthe grant of the treaty-making power to the executive and the Senate,\r\nthe confirmation of appointments by the Senate, the creation of a\r\nfederal judiciary, and the provision that state laws in conflict with\r\nthe Constitution should be void; these and many other features of the\r\nexisting Constitution were parts of the plan of Hamilton.\r\n\r\nIt was not the open preference which Hamilton expressed for the\r\nBritish form of government which caused distrust of his plan. This was\r\nneither startling nor offensive to the great majority of those who\r\nheard him. Representative government under a republican head had not\r\nthen been tried upon a large scale in any part of the world. Such\r\nsmall republics as existed in ancient times and in Italy had been\r\nconfined within narrow areas, and had in many cases presented examples\r\nof factional strife which were far from encouraging to the friends of\r\nliberty. The Americans, in revolting against Great Britain, revolted\r\nonly against what they considered the false interpretation given by\r\nKing George to the guarantees of the English constitution, wrested by\r\ntheir ancestors from King John and his successors and consecrated by\r\nthe Revolution of 1688. It was far from the thoughts of the most\r\nextreme, with perhaps an occasional personal exception, to cut loose\r\nfrom the traditions of English liberty, tear down the ancient\r\nstructure, and build from the ground up, as was done a few years\r\nlater in France by the maddened victims of the oppression of the\r\nnobles.\r\n\r\nThe sentiment most strongly opposed to the views of Hamilton was not\r\ndemocratic sentiment, in the strictest sense of the word, but devotion\r\nto local self-government. Hamilton was democratic enough to insist, in\r\nthe discussion of the manner of choosing members of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, \"It is essential to the democratic rights of the\r\ncommunity that the first branch be directly elected by the people.\"\r\nWhat he desired was strength at the centre of authority, from whatever\r\nsource that authority was derived. Coming from a little West Indian\r\nisland where the traditions of parliamentary government had little\r\nfooting, he attached no such importance as most of his associates to\r\nthe reserved rights of the states. He was the man for the hour as the\r\nchampion of a strong government, but it would not have been fortunate\r\nin some respects if his views had been adopted in their extreme form.\r\nThere never was the slightest chance, as he doubtless knew, that they\r\nwould be adopted by the descendants of English freemen who had founded\r\nself-governing states in accord with their own principles on the\r\nwestern shores of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nHaving delivered a single strong speech, which pointed the way towards\r\na strong union, Hamilton remained comparatively in the background\r\nduring the remainder of the convention. It was inevitable, however,\r\nthat he should make himself heard upon the proposal that the new\r\ngovernment should have power \"to emit bills on the credit of the\r\nUnited States.\" The power to issue unfunded paper had received his\r\ncensure four years before, as one of the defects of the existing\r\nArticles of Confederation. He now opposed in the most emphatic manner\r\nthe grant of authority to the new government to issue paper money in\r\nthe form of its own notes, and to force them into circulation as a\r\nsubstitute for gold and silver coin. When Gouverneur Morris moved to\r\nstrike out the power to issue bills on the credit of the United States\r\nand was supported by Madison, it was supposed that, if the motion\r\nprevailed, the power to issue government paper money and make it a\r\nlegal tender for debts was guarded against for all time. The power was\r\nstricken out of the Constitution by a vote of nine states against two.\r\nMadison decided the vote of Virginia, and declared that \"the pretext\r\nfor a paper currency, and particularly for making the bills a tender,\r\neither for public or private debts, was cut off.\" It is not surprising\r\nthat Mr. Bancroft, the jealous friend of the Constitution, in spite of\r\nthe opening of the door at a later period by the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States, declared:\r\n\r\n\"This is the interpretation of the clause, made at the time of its\r\nadoption alike by its authors and by its opponents, accepted by all\r\nthe statesmen of that age, not open to dispute because too clear for\r\nargument, and never disputed so long as any one man who took part in\r\nframing the Constitution remained alive.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton spoke on a few other occasions on subsidiary points connected\r\nwith the draft of the Constitution, but it was only at the close of\r\nthe convention that he again came resolutely to the front to exert a\r\nstrong influence over his associates. When the final draft of the new\r\nframe of government had been completed, several delegates showed\r\nsymptoms of refusing to affix their signatures. The great weight of\r\nFranklin was thrown into the scale to urge that the delegates go back\r\nto the people presenting the semblance of harmony instead of\r\ndivisions. \"I consent to this Constitution,\" he declared, \"because I\r\nexpect no better, and because I am not sure that it is not the best.\"\r\nWashington sought also to secure unanimity, and Hamilton declared:--\r\n\r\n\"I am anxious that every member should sign. A few by refusing may do\r\ninfinite mischief. No man's ideas are more remote from the plan than\r\nmy own are known to be; but is it possible to deliberate between\r\nanarchy and convulsion on the one side, and the chance of good to be\r\nexpected from the plan on the other?\"\r\n\r\nSuch words had some weight, but not enough to secure unanimity. All\r\nthe states voted for the Constitution, but several delegates went on\r\nrecord against it, and Hamilton's two associates from New York were\r\nabsent. It was this alone which saved New York from being recorded\r\nagainst the Constitution. Hamilton did not shrink from putting down\r\nhis signature as the representative of his state. It was he who, in a\r\nbold, plain hand, inscribed on the great sheet of parchment the name\r\nof each state, as the delegations came forward, one after another, in\r\ngeographical order and affixed their signatures to the precious\r\ndocument which was to found the government of the United States.\r\n\r\nHamilton returned to New York determined to use his utmost powers to\r\nsecure the ratification of the Constitution as the best attainable\r\nmeans of averting the dangers of disunion. Although cordially\r\nsupported by John Jay and Edward Livingston, Hamilton, in the fight\r\nfor ratification in New York, was the natural leader. He found arrayed\r\nagainst him the whole influence of Governor Clinton and the dominant\r\nparty in New York politics. Clinton was not absolutely opposed to\r\nunion, but he attached to it so many reservations that for practical\r\npurposes he was an opponent of the new Constitution. The battle over\r\nratification began on the question of the choice of delegates to the\r\nstate convention. It was in this field that Hamilton fought the great\r\nfight with his pen which has left to posterity the fine exposition of\r\nthe Constitution known as \"The Federalist.\" A society was formed in\r\nthe city of New York to resist the adoption of the Constitution, and\r\narticles soon began to appear in the local press criticising and\r\nopposing it.\r\n\r\nPreparing a vigorous letter, while gliding down the Hudson, in reply\r\nto some of the first points of the opposition, Hamilton soon extended\r\nthe project into a series of strong papers, which appeared twice a\r\nweek for twenty weeks over the signature of \"Publius.\" He secured the\r\naid of Madison and Jay, who wrote some of the papers, but the project\r\nwas Hamilton's, the majority of the papers were written by him, and\r\nto him has been justly given the credit of the well-knit and powerful\r\narguments afterwards printed under the title of \"The Federalist.\"\r\n\r\nTaking up point by point the provisions of the new Constitution,\r\nHamilton, by skillful argument, drawn from the closest abstract\r\nreasoning, the recent experience of the states, and the history of\r\nforeign countries, sought to show that the new Constitution was based\r\nupon sound principles of government, that it was well calculated to\r\ncarry out these principles, and that its acceptance was practically\r\nthe only course open to the American people to insure for themselves\r\nthe benefits of liberty, prosperity, and peace. \"The Federalist,\"\r\nalthough a purely political argument, has survived the occasion which\r\ncalled it forth, as one of the master documents of political writing.\r\nThat it has a distinct place in literature is admitted by so severe a\r\ncritic as Professor Barrett Wendell in his recent \"Literary History of\r\nAmerica.\" It is worth while quoting his acute literary judgment of its\r\nmerits:--\r\n\r\n\"As a series of formal essays, the 'Federalist' groups itself roughly\r\nwith the 'Tatler,' the 'Spectator,' and those numerous descendants of\r\ntheirs which fill the literary records of eighteenth century England.\r\nIt differs, however, from all these, in both substance and purpose.\r\nThe 'Tatler,' the 'Spectator,' and their successors dealt with\r\nsuperficial matters in a spirit of literary amenity: the 'Federalist'\r\ndeals in an argumentative spirit as earnest as that of any Puritan\r\ndivine with political principles paramount in our history; and it is\r\nso wisely thoughtful that one may almost declare it the permanent\r\nbasis of sound thinking concerning American constitutional law. Like\r\nall the educated writing of the eighteenth century, too, it is phrased\r\nwith a rhythmical balance and urbane polish which give it claim to\r\nliterary distinction.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the written arguments of Hamilton in \"The Federalist\" have\r\nsurvived for a hundred years and been consulted by foreign students in\r\nthe formation of new constitutions, a more severe task was imposed\r\nupon him at the meeting of the state convention called to consider the\r\nreport of the convention at Philadelphia. It was in some respects the\r\nhardest task ever set with any hope of success before a parliamentary\r\nleader. Indeed, to the superficial observer there would have seemed to\r\nbe no hope of success, when in the elections to the state convention\r\nthe supporters of Governor Clinton chose forty-six delegates and left\r\non the side of Hamilton only nineteen of the sixty-five members. But\r\nthis statement of the case gives a somewhat darker color to the\r\nsituation than the real facts. There was a strong and growing body of\r\npublic sentiment for the Constitution in New York city and the\r\ncounties along the Hudson, which even led to the suggestion that they\r\nshould join the Union in any event and leave the northern counties to\r\nshift for themselves. It was generally recognized, moreover, that\r\nhowever strong the objections were to the Constitution, the choice lay\r\npractically between this Constitution and none,--between the proposed\r\ngovernment and anarchy.\r\n\r\nSo strong was the sentiment that the Constitution must be accepted in\r\nsome form, that its opponents in the state convention did not venture\r\nupon immediate rejection. Fortunately, their course in fighting for\r\ndelay only tended to make it clearer that New York would stand alone\r\nif she failed to ratify. While the dream of independent sovereignty,\r\nor the leadership in a federation which should dictate terms to the\r\nsurrounding states, was not without its attractions to the more\r\nambitious of the opposition leaders, there was a darker side to the\r\nproposition which was much less attractive. Independence for New York\r\nmeant a heavy burden of taxation for a separate army and navy, for\r\nguarding long frontiers on the east, north, and south, for supporting\r\nan extensive customs service along the same frontiers, for maintaining\r\nministers at foreign courts and consuls in the leading cities of the\r\nworld, and for meeting all the other expenses of a sovereign nation.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for the state and the country that the leader of the\r\nopposition to the Constitution in the New York convention was a man of\r\na high order of ability, whose mind was open in an unusual degree to\r\nthe influence of logical reasoning. This man was Melancthon Smith, who\r\nis accorded by Chancellor Kent, the great authority on American law,\r\nthe credit of being noted \"for his love of reading, tenacious memory,\r\npowerful intellect, and for the metaphysical and logical discussions\r\nof which he was a master.\" It is as much to his credit as that of\r\nHamilton that he finally admitted that he had been convinced by\r\nHamilton, and that he should vote for the Constitution. This result\r\nwas only reached, however, after a long and sometimes acrimonious\r\nstruggle, in which Hamilton was on his feet day after day explaining\r\nand defending each separate clause of the Constitution,--not only in\r\nits real meaning, but against all the distorted constructions put upon\r\nit by the most acute and jealous of critics.\r\n\r\nBut events had been fighting with Hamilton. State after state had\r\nratified the new document, and news of their action had reached New\r\nYork. Nine states, the number necessary to put the Constitution in\r\nforce, were made up by the ratification of New Hampshire (June 21,\r\n1788). Still New York hesitated, and Hamilton wrote to Madison: \"Our\r\nchance of success depends upon you. Symptoms of relaxation in some of\r\nthe leaders authorize a gleam of hope if you do well, but certainly I\r\nthink not otherwise.\" Virginia justified his hopes by a majority of 89\r\nagainst 79 for ratification (June 25, 1788). The news reached New York\r\non July 3. The opposition there, though showing signs of relenting,\r\nwas still stubborn. Conditional ratification, with a long string of\r\namendments, was first proposed. Jay firmly insisted that the word\r\n\"conditional\" must be erased. Finally, on July 11, he proposed\r\nunconditional ratification. Melancthon Smith then proposed\r\nratification with the right to withdraw if the amendments should not\r\nbe accepted. Hamilton exposed the folly of such a project in a\r\nbrilliant speech, which led Smith to admit that conditional\r\nratification was an absurdity. Other similar proposals were brought\r\nforward, but they were evidently equivalent to rejection by\r\nindirection, which would have left New York out of the new Union.\r\n\r\nFinally, Samuel Jones, another broad-minded member of the opposition,\r\nproposed ratification without conditions, but \"in full confidence\"\r\nthat Congress would adopt all needed amendments. With the support of\r\nSmith, this form of ratification was carried by the slender majority\r\nof three votes (July 26, 1788). By this narrow margin it was decided\r\nthat New York should form a part of the Union, and that the great\r\nexperiment in representative government should not begin with the two\r\nhalves of the country separated by a hostile power, commanding the\r\ngreatest seaport of the colonies.\r\n\r\nHamilton thus played an important part in winning the first great\r\nbattle for the Constitution. Ratification was only one of many steps\r\nwhich remained to be taken before the new government was in working\r\norder. Hamilton hurried back to the Federal Congress, and carried an\r\nordinance fixing the dates and the place for putting the new\r\ngovernment in operation. When he returned to New York, he was beaten\r\nfor reëlection to Congress, and Governor Clinton and his party\r\nretained such a firm grip upon the legislature that a deadlock\r\noccurred between the Federalist House and the opposition Senate. New\r\nYork was unrepresented in the first electoral college, and had no\r\nsenators at the meeting of the First Congress. The state elections\r\nwhich followed resulted in defeat for the Federalists in the election\r\nof the governor, but they carried the legislature and elected two\r\nsenators,--General Schuyler and Rufus King. King had recently come\r\nfrom Massachusetts, and Hamilton's insistence that he should be chosen\r\ncaused a breach with the Livingstons, which contributed to the defeat\r\nof Schuyler two years later and the election of Aaron Burr. Hamilton's\r\ncourse in this matter was one of many cases in which he showed that\r\nhe was not an astute politician, nor an adept at dealing with men. His\r\nhighest qualities were those more distinctly intellectual, which led\r\nhim to drive straight towards a desired object, with little patience\r\nfor smaller men or the obstacles which stood in his way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nESTABLISHING THE PUBLIC CREDIT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great work of Hamilton, which was to stamp his name forever upon\r\nAmerican history and our frame of government, was yet before him.\r\nWashington was inaugurated in April, 1789, but it was not until\r\nSeptember 2 that an act passed Congress establishing the Treasury\r\nDepartment. Hamilton was the selection of Washington for the new post.\r\nIt was a selection so well approved by all who were familiar with\r\nHamilton's great abilities as an organizer and financier that the\r\nnomination was confirmed on the day that it reached the Senate. The\r\nstudies of many years, the programme which had been outlined in\r\nletters to Morris and in the newspapers, were now to bear fruit under\r\nthe directing genius of Hamilton. Only ten days passed after his\r\nappointment before Congress requested him to prepare a report upon\r\nthe public credit. Then came calls for reports on the collection and\r\nmanagement of the revenue; estimates of receipts and expenditures; the\r\nregulation of the currency; the navigation laws; the post-office, and\r\nthe public lands. Money had to be found at once for the pressing needs\r\nof the new government before the more elaborate projects of the young\r\nminister of finance could be put in operation. But Hamilton did not\r\ndelay long even for the more important and permanent work. When\r\nCongress met in January, he submitted his celebrated report \"On Public\r\nCredit,\" which laid the corner-stone of American finance under the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nThis report of Hamilton's on the public credit has long stood out as\r\none of the master state papers of American history. Read to-day in the\r\nlight of the economic progress of more than a century, its conclusions\r\nare not entirely novel, but are in the main clear and sound. To obtain\r\na proper perspective regarding their value, the mind should be\r\nprojected back to the beginning of 1790, when political economy as a\r\nscience had barely been born, and the work of Adam Smith, although\r\nabout fourteen years old, was probably known to but few in America.\r\nMany public men of to-day with the proper preliminary training might\r\nevolve as sound a report as that of Hamilton, but no ordinary man\r\ncould have done it a hundred and ten years ago, and few men could do\r\nit to-day with the force of diction, precision and directness of\r\nstatement, the grasp of principles, and the mastery of detail which\r\nmarked the work of Hamilton.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to gather in his hands all the tangled threads of the\r\ndisordered finances of the Continental Congress and of the states and\r\nshow how they could be woven into a band of strength and symmetry,\r\nholding together by the motive of enlightened self-interest all the\r\nparts of the new Union. He proposed to plant the public credit upon a\r\nfirm foundation, satisfy the public creditors, and put the nation on\r\nthe high road to industrial and financial progress. The difficulties\r\nwhich Hamilton confronted were not merely a bankrupt Treasury and a\r\nloose system of finance under the federal government, but large\r\nexpenditures by the states for carrying on the Revolutionary War, for\r\nwhich reimbursement was demanded by the states which had spent the\r\nmost and was opposed by those which had spent the least. Hamilton\r\nendeavored to show that all would gain by the assumption of these\r\ndebts by the federal government. Although a thinker rather than a\r\ntactician, he was shrewd enough to make an appeal early in his report\r\nto all men engaged in industry by pointing out the importance of\r\npublic credit upon the volume and profits of private business. He\r\nendeavored first to make clear the benefit to any government of a\r\nsound fiscal system. He said upon this point:--\r\n\r\n\"As, on the one hand, the necessity for borrowing in particular\r\nemergencies cannot be doubted, so, on the other, it is equally evident\r\nthat to be able to borrow upon good terms, it is essential that the\r\ncredit of a nation should be well established. For, when the credit of\r\na country is in any degree questionable, it never fails to give an\r\nextravagant premium, in one shape or another, upon all the loans it\r\nhas occasion to make. Nor does the evil end here; the same\r\ndisadvantage must be sustained upon whatever is to be bought on terms\r\nof future payment. From this constant necessity of borrowing and\r\nbuying dear, it is easy to conceive how immensely the expenses of a\r\nnation, in the course of time, will be augmented by an unsound state\r\nof the public credit.\"\r\n\r\nTaking up the demonstration how closely the public credit is linked\r\nwith the fortune of the individual, Hamilton points out that public\r\nsecurities are a part of the medium of exchange, that sound credit\r\nwill extend trade by preventing the export of money, and that\r\nagriculture and manufactures will be promoted because \"more capital\r\ncan be commanded to be employed in both,\" and that the interest of\r\nmoney will be lowered.\r\n\r\nHamilton took up and punctured in his report several fallacies\r\nregarding the treatment of the debt which had obtained lodgment in the\r\npublic mind and threatened to influence the action of Congress. One\r\nof these was that a distinction should be made between those holders\r\nof the debt to whom it was originally issued and those who had\r\nacquired it by purchase. As the latter holders had bought the debt in\r\nsome cases at a mere fraction of its face value and for speculative\r\npurposes, the specious argument was made that they were entitled in\r\nthe settlement with the government only to what they had paid the\r\noriginal holders. Hamilton set himself to dissipate this prejudice by\r\nshowing that the man who had been willing to purchase the public debt\r\nmight be quite as patriotic as the man who had parted with it for a\r\nprice. He suggested that if the debt was thus purchased in the\r\nconfidence that it would rise to par, the act was a proof of the\r\npatriotism of the purchaser, and it would be a sorry return for this\r\nconfidence to make it a reason for discrimination against him.\r\n\r\nBut much more important from the public point of view, he pointed out,\r\nwas the sanctity of contracts guaranteed by the new Constitution, and\r\nabsolutely required to give a stable character to the securities of\r\nthe government. If the government were to discriminate between the\r\noriginal holders of the debt and other holders, he made it clear that\r\na degree of discredit would be cast on all the obligations of the\r\nUnited States, no matter in whose hands they were found, which would\r\ntend to defeat the end and aim of all his measures,--the restoration\r\nof public credit. Upon this point he said:--\r\n\r\n\"The nature of the contract, in its origin, is, that the public will\r\npay the sum expressed in the security, to the first holder or his\r\nassignee. The intent in making the security assignable is, that the\r\nproprietor may be able to make use of his property, by selling it for\r\nas much as it may be worth in the market, and that the buyer may be\r\nsafe in the purchase.\r\n\r\n\"Every buyer, therefore, stands exactly in the place of the seller,\r\nhas the same right with him to the identical sum expressed in the\r\nsecurity, and having acquired that right, by fair purchase, and in\r\nconformity to the original agreement and intention of the government,\r\nhis claim cannot be disputed without manifest injustice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"The impolicy of a discrimination results from two considerations:\r\none, that it proceeds upon a principle destructive of that quality of\r\nthe public debt, or the stock of the nation, which is essential to its\r\ncapacity for answering the purposes of money, that is, the security of\r\ntransfer; the other, that, as well on this account as because it\r\nincludes a breach of faith, it renders property in the funds less\r\nvaluable, consequently induces lenders to demand a higher premium for\r\nwhat they lend, and produces every other inconvenience of a bad state\r\nof public credit.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most serious obstacles which confronted Hamilton in\r\ncarrying out his financial policy was the opposition to the assumption\r\nby the new federal government of the debts of the several states\r\nincurred in the prosecution of the war. The states which had been\r\nremiss in paying their quota for the general expenses and those which\r\nhad not been called upon to pay much for local defense did not see\r\nwhy a burden should be imposed upon them, even in equitable proportion\r\nwith the other states, for the purpose of relieving those states which\r\nhad been prompt with their payments or had been compelled to spend\r\nfreely for the protection of their own boundaries and people. This\r\nprejudice Hamilton faced with the same clear vision and resolute\r\npurpose as that against providing for the debt of the Union. He set\r\nforth at the outset that if these debts were to be paid at all,\r\nwhether by the states or by the Union, \"it will follow that no greater\r\nrevenues will be required, whether that provision be made wholly by\r\nthe United States, or partly by the states separately.\" He pointed out\r\nthat the control of the entire matter by the federal government would\r\nsecure uniformity of treatment for the public creditors, would prevent\r\ncompetition between the Union and the states for the sources of the\r\nrevenue, which otherwise might cause collision and confusion, and\r\nwould secure a distribution of taxation more just to industry in all\r\nthe states. The assumption of the state debts, moreover, he insisted\r\nwas vital to the credit of the Union. Upon this head, and upon the\r\nequity of charging to the Union of the states the debts which had been\r\nincurred for the benefit of all, Hamilton observed:--\r\n\r\n\"Should the state creditors stand upon a less eligible footing than\r\nthe others, it is unnatural to expect they would see with pleasure a\r\nprovision for them. The influence which their dissatisfaction might\r\nhave could not but operate injuriously, both for the creditors and the\r\ncredit of the United States. Hence it is even the interest of the\r\ncreditors of the Union, that those of the individual states should be\r\ncomprehended in a general provision. Any attempt to secure to the\r\nformer either exclusive or peculiar advantages would materially hazard\r\ntheir interests. Neither would it be just that one class of the public\r\ncreditors should be more favored than the other. The objects for which\r\nboth descriptions of the debt were contracted are in the main the\r\nsame. Indeed, a great part of the particular debts of the states has\r\narisen from assumptions by them on account of the Union. And it is\r\nmost equitable, that there should be the same measure of retribution\r\nfor all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"The general principle of it seems to be equitable, for it appears\r\ndifficult to conceive a good reason why the expenses for the\r\nparticular defense of a part, in a common war, should not be a common\r\ncharge, as well as those incurred professedly for the general defense.\r\nThe defense of each part is that of the whole, and unless all the\r\nexpenditures are brought into a common mass, the tendency must be to\r\nadd to the calamities suffered by being the most exposed to the\r\nravages of war, an increase of burthens.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton found the public debt of the Union to be $54,124,464.56. This\r\nwould not be a formidable debt to-day, even with full allowance for\r\nthe difference in population, but it was formidable for that time\r\nbecause of the comparative poverty of the country, and the scanty\r\nresources for paying it. The great increase in the productive power\r\nof man in our time, by means of machinery, improved means of\r\ncommunication, and other devices for saving labor and increasing its\r\nefficiency, makes it easy for prosperous nations to bear taxation\r\nwithout feeling the burden which would have paralyzed industry and\r\narrested national progress a century ago. The United States in 1790\r\nwere not far beyond the primitive condition in which the entire sum of\r\nproduction is required for the necessaries of existence, and little is\r\nleft for the luxuries of life and of state enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe total of the debt, as computed by Hamilton, was made up by adding\r\nthe foreign debt, $10,070,307, with arrears of interest amounting to\r\n$1,640,071.62, to the principal of the domestic debt, $27,383,917.74,\r\nwith arrears of interest amounting to $13,030,168.20, and estimating\r\nthe unliquidated debt at $2,000,000. The amount of the state debts he\r\nwas not able to ascertain with precision, but estimated at about\r\n$25,000,000. This made the total debt to be dealt with something more\r\nthan $75,000,000. The annual interest required at the rates provided\r\nin the contract would amount to $542,599.66 on the foreign debt, and\r\n$4,044,845.15 on the domestic debt, including that of the states,\r\nmaking a total of $4,587,444.81. While urging the most conscientious\r\nfulfillment of obligations, Hamilton admitted that this demand would\r\nrequire the extension of taxation to a degree and to objects which the\r\ntrue interests of the public creditors themselves forbade. \"It is\r\ntherefore to be hoped,\" he said, \"and even to be expected, that they\r\nwill cheerfully concur in such modifications of their claims, on fair\r\nand equitable principles, as will facilitate to the government an\r\narrangement substantial, durable, and satisfactory to the community.\"\r\n\r\nThis arrangement he did not propose to reach by repudiating any\r\nportion of the debt. He proposed to reduce the rate of interest, in\r\ncourse of time, in accordance with the decline in the rate for the\r\nrental of capital abroad, but to those holders of the debt who\r\ndesired settlement in full at the old rates of interest, he made\r\nliberal offers. A number of optional plans for accepting funds at\r\ndifferent rates of interest for different terms were presented, which\r\nit is not necessary to set forth in detail. The statement of the first\r\ntwo will give an idea of their general character:--\r\n\r\n\"First, That, for every hundred dollars subscribed, payable in the\r\ndebt, (as well interest as principal,) the subscriber be entitled, at\r\nhis option, either to have two-thirds funded at an annuity or yearly\r\ninterest of six per cent., redeemable at the pleasure of the\r\ngovernment, by payment of the principal, and to receive the other\r\nthird in lands in the western territory, at the rate of twenty cents\r\nper acre. Or, to have the whole sum funded at an annuity or yearly\r\ninterest of four per cent, irredeemable by any payment exceeding five\r\ndollars per annum, on account both of principal and interest, and to\r\nreceive, as a compensation for the reduction of interest, fifteen\r\ndollars and eighty cents, payable in lands, as in the preceding\r\ncase.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton thus reserved the right to redeem the debt at the pleasure of\r\nthe government, when new securities could be floated at reduced rates.\r\nThis was in accordance with the enlightened policy of governments\r\nbefore and since in availing themselves of the increase of capital and\r\nthe improved condition of the public credit. The holder of the public\r\nfunds could find no fault if he received back his principal, while an\r\nattractive investment at current rates of return upon capital would be\r\noffered to new investors in the form of funds at a reduced rate of\r\ninterest, if such new funds were not acceptable to the old holders of\r\nthe debt.\r\n\r\nThe proposal for using the public lands in part settlement of the debt\r\nwas a happy device for employing a resource of immense value to the\r\ncountry, and promoting early settlement of the great areas of\r\nuncultivated land which became the property of the Union. It was in\r\npursuance of this comprehensive policy that Connecticut, Virginia,\r\nand other states had ceded to Congress, even before the adoption of\r\nthe Constitution, their indefinite claims to the great stretches of\r\ncountry between the Allegheny Mountains and the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nCONGRESS SUSTAINS HAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plans of Hamilton having been formulated, it remained to be\r\ndetermined whether they should be adopted by the lawmaking power or\r\nshould remain a splendid but abortive monument to the constructive\r\nskill of their author. Vigorous opposition was expected by Hamilton to\r\nthe measures which he proposed. He had endeavored to meet and disarm\r\nsuch opposition as far as possible in the careful and illuminating\r\nlanguage of his report, but it soon became evident that against nearly\r\nall parts of it a bitter and persistent battle would be waged. The\r\nowners of capital and the commercial element were represented in the\r\nNorthern and Eastern States rather than in the South, and the\r\nrepresentatives of the former states strongly supported from the first\r\nthe entire policy of the Secretary of the Treasury. Rumors were\r\nalready abroad that something was to be done to restore the national\r\ncredit, but it was not until the reading of Hamilton's report in the\r\nHouse (January 14, 1790) that the full scope of his plans was made\r\nmanifest.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the report was so favorable upon the public credit as to\r\nforge weapons for its enemies. This came about through the sudden rise\r\nin the public funds, and the promptness with which speculators bought\r\nthem up from holders who were ignorant of their value. Funds which\r\nwould have been gladly disposed of at three shillings to the pound, or\r\nfifteen per cent. of their face value, at any time within the previous\r\nthree years, rose before noon the next day fifty per cent. of their\r\nquoted price. It was not yet certain that the project would be adopted\r\nby Congress, but shrewd men were willing to discount the future in\r\nmuch the same manner that brokers in Wall Street do at the present\r\ntime. The absence of a well-organized stock market, with the\r\nramifications of telegraphic quotations throughout the Union, put in\r\nthe hands of the more daring of these speculators an opportunity to\r\navail themselves of the ignorance of others to an extent which would\r\nnot be possible to-day. Agents were soon scouring the country, buying\r\nup the certificates of the debt in all its varied forms, before the\r\nnews of Hamilton's great report had reached the humble holders, some\r\nof whom were old soldiers or quiet farmers who had been compelled to\r\nfurnish supplies for the army. Jefferson says in his Anas:--\r\n\r\n\"Couriers and relay horses by land, and swift-sailing pilot-boats by\r\nsea, were flying in all directions. Active partners and agents were\r\nassociated and employed in every state, town, and county, and the\r\npaper bought up at five shillings, and even as low as two shillings in\r\nthe pound, before the holder knew that Congress had already provided\r\nfor its redemption at par.\"\r\n\r\nThis sudden and remarkable effect of Hamilton's recommendations put\r\nweapons in the hands of the enemies of the project, because it seemed\r\nto give force to their argument that a distinction should be made\r\nbetween those to whom the debt was originally issued at par and the\r\nnew holders who had obtained it at a discount. Long and bitter were\r\nthe debates in the House over this and other branches of Hamilton's\r\nproject. But it was so obvious that a distinction between the holders\r\nof the debt would run directly counter to its character as negotiable\r\npaper, and would be almost impossible of just execution, that the\r\nfriends of the funding project easily had the best of the argument.\r\nMadison, although inclined to oppose Hamilton, was forced to admit\r\nthat the debt must be funded at par without discrimination. He brought\r\nforward a project to pay the original holders the difference between\r\npar and the price at which they had sold, and to pay to the present\r\nholders only what they had paid for the securities. This was shown to\r\nbe so impracticable that only thirteen votes were given for it in a\r\nHouse of forty-nine members voting. The advocates of the entire\r\nfunding project carried it in committee of the whole (March 9, 1790)\r\nby a vote of 31 to 26.\r\n\r\nThe debates had so strengthened the position of Hamilton that the\r\nwisdom of funding the debt of the Union at par was now generally\r\nadmitted. His opponents and those who feared too great a concentration\r\nof power in the capitalist class and the central government made their\r\nstand on the proposal to assume the state debts. When the resolution\r\nreported by the committee of the whole was taken up in the House on\r\nMarch 29, several representatives from North Carolina appeared in the\r\nHouse and swelled the ranks of the opposition. North Carolina had been\r\nlate in accepting the Constitution, and her members had not been\r\npresent on previous votes. When, therefore, a motion to recommit the\r\nfinancial projects was made, it was carried by a vote of 29 to 27. The\r\nadvocates of assumption were so indignant, and so convinced that one\r\npart of the project was as vital as the other, that they voted to\r\nrecommit the original funding resolution. Further debate took place,\r\nbut without shaking the firmness of the opposition to the assumption\r\nof the state debts. The project was rejected in committee (April 12)\r\nby a vote of 31 to 29.\r\n\r\nThe situation was a grave one. Hamilton felt that the future of the\r\nUnion was at stake. If his projects were not adopted substantially as\r\na whole, the new government would be without credit and the work of\r\nthe Convention of 1789 would be in vain. The government at Washington\r\nwould be as helpless as the Continental Congress and its committees\r\nhad been. This opinion was shared by all those who favored a vigorous\r\ncentral government, and practically by all the members of the party in\r\nCongress which was forming in support of the measures of Hamilton and\r\nlooking to him as their leader. While casting about for some means for\r\nmeeting the emergency, Hamilton fell upon a plan which represents one\r\nof the few cases in which he had recourse to diplomacy in his public\r\ncareer. The question of the location of the national capital had been\r\nfor some time pending in Congress. It had already become involved with\r\nthe assumption of the state debts. A strong bid had been made by the\r\nopponents of assumption for the five votes of Pennsylvania by the\r\noffer to locate the capital for fifteen years at Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe importance of having Congress and its officials in a given city\r\nrepresented more at that time, in spite of the small size of the body\r\nand the relative insignificance of the interests before it, than would\r\nbe the case to-day with either of the great commercial cities of New\r\nYork, Boston, or Philadelphia. Local interests played the same part\r\nthen as now in political man[oe]uvring, and possession of the capital\r\nlooked larger in the eyes of some members than the financial policy of\r\nthe Union. In the sarcastic language of Professor McMaster, \"The state\r\ndebts might remain unpaid, the credit of the nation might fall, but\r\ncome what might, the patronage of Congress must be drawn from New York\r\nand distributed among the grog-shops and taverns of Philadelphia.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton took advantage of this situation to save assumption and to\r\nfix the financial policy of the United States. The Senate had\r\nrejected the proposal to establish the capital at Philadelphia, and\r\nwhen the project came back to the House, Baltimore was substituted by\r\na majority of two. The Pennsylvanians and their friends in the Senate\r\nretaliated by mutilating the funding bill and daring the\r\nassumptionists to reject it. The latter held to their position and\r\nrejected the bill, 35 to 23. It was while matters were in this acute\r\nstage, while threats were made on behalf of the North that the Union\r\nwould be broken up if assumption were not carried, that Hamilton one\r\nday in front of the President's house met Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson\r\nhad recently returned from France to assume the position of Secretary\r\nof State. What followed is best told in Jefferson's own words, because\r\nhe afterwards claimed that he had been \"duped\" by Hamilton and acted\r\nwithout knowledge of the effect of what he was doing. Jefferson's\r\naccount of the matter is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"As I was going to the President's one day, I met him (Hamilton) in\r\nthe street. He walked me backwards and forwards before the\r\nPresident's door for half an hour. He painted pathetically the temper\r\ninto which the legislature had been wrought; the disgust of those who\r\nwere called the creditor states: the danger of the _secession_ of\r\ntheir members, and the separation of the states. He observed that the\r\nmembers of the administration ought to act in concert; that though\r\nthis question was not of my department, yet a common duty should make\r\nit a common concern; that the President was the centre on which all\r\nadministrative questions ultimately rested, and that all of us should\r\nrally around him, and support, with joint efforts, measures approved\r\nby him; and that the question having been lost by a small majority\r\nonly, it was probable that an appeal from me to the judgment and\r\ndiscretion of some of my friends might effect a change in the vote,\r\nand the machine of government, now suspended, might be again set into\r\nmotion. I told him that I was really a stranger to the whole subject;\r\nthat not having yet informed myself of the system of finance adopted,\r\nI knew not how far this was a necessary sequence; that undoubtedly, if\r\nits rejection endangered a dissolution of our Union at this incipient\r\nstage, I should deem that the most unfortunate of all consequences, to\r\navert which all partial and temporary evils should be yielded. I\r\nproposed to him, however, to dine with me the next day, and I would\r\ninvite another friend or two, bring them into conference together, and\r\nI thought it impossible that reasonable men, consulting together\r\ncoolly, could fail, by some mutual sacrifices of opinion, to form a\r\ncompromise which was to save the Union. The discussion took place. I\r\ncould take no part in it but an exhortatory one, because I was a\r\nstranger to the circumstances which should govern it. But it was\r\nfinally agreed, that whatever importance had been attached to the\r\nrejection of this proposition, the preservation of the Union and of\r\nconcord among the states was more important, and that, therefore, it\r\nwould be better that the vote of rejection should be rescinded, to\r\neffect which some members should change their votes. But it was\r\nobserved that this pill would be peculiarly bitter to the Southern\r\nStates, and that some concomitant measure should be adopted to sweeten\r\nit a little to them. There had been projects to fix the seat of\r\ngovernment either at Philadelphia or at Georgetown on the Potomac; and\r\nit was thought that by giving it to Philadelphia for ten years, and to\r\nGeorgetown permanently afterwards, this might, as an anodyne, calm in\r\nsome degree the ferment which might be excited by the other measure\r\nalone. Some two of the Potomac members (White and Lee, but White with\r\na revulsion of stomach almost convulsive) agreed to change their\r\nvotes, and Hamilton undertook to carry the other point. In doing this,\r\nthe influence he had established over the eastern members, with the\r\nagency of Robert Morris with those of the Middle States, effected his\r\nside of the engagement.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton had little of the state pride which influenced the men of\r\nMassachusetts, New York, Virginia, or of any other state who had\r\ngrown up on the soil won by their English ancestors by their blood or\r\nthe sweat of their brows. To him the question of the location of the\r\ncapital seemed insignificant in comparison with the foundation of the\r\nUnion upon the rock of a comprehensive financial policy. It is\r\nsignificant of the commanding influence which the young secretary had\r\nacquired, and the well-knit party which was gathering around him, that\r\nhe had no difficulty in carrying his part of the programme for seating\r\nthe capital eventually on the banks of the Potomac. The bill to remove\r\nthe capital was passed on July 9, 1790, by a majority of three, and\r\nthe assumption of the state debts was carried soon after. The form of\r\nthe assumption differed somewhat from the proposal of Hamilton, but it\r\naccomplished the result at which he aimed. A specific sum,\r\n$21,500,000, was assumed by the government and distributed among the\r\nstates in set proportions. The project passed the Senate July 22, by a\r\nvote of 14 to 12, and the House on July 24, by a vote of 34 to 28. A\r\ngreat step was thus taken in the consolidation of the Union, and\r\nnotice was given to the world that the United States proposed to pay\r\ntheir debts and fulfill with scrupulous honor their financial\r\nobligations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nSTRENGTHENING THE BONDS OF UNION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe funding of the debt was only one of several parts of the policy of\r\nHamilton for putting the new government upon a solvent and firm basis.\r\nThe session of Congress which began in December, 1790, witnessed the\r\npresentation of his report in favor of a national bank. This report,\r\nlike that on the debt, showed careful study of the subject in its\r\ntheoretical as well as practical aspects. Hamilton referred in opening\r\nto the successful operation of public banks in Italy, Germany,\r\nHolland, England, and France. He then went on to point out some of\r\ntheir specific advantages in concentrating capital and permitting the\r\neasy transfer of credit. He declared that such a bank would afford\r\n\"greater facility to the government, in obtaining pecuniary aid,\r\nespecially in sudden emergencies.\" It would also facilitate the\r\npayment of taxes, by enabling tax-payers to borrow from the bank and\r\nby the aid which it would give in the transfer of funds. He did not\r\nshrink from declaring that the country would benefit if foreigners\r\ninvested in the bank shares, since this would bring so much additional\r\ncapital into the United States. Hamilton then pointed out the vital\r\ndistinction between government paper issues and bank paper. He laid\r\ndown thus the fundamental principle of a well-regulated bank-note\r\ncurrency:--\r\n\r\n\"Among other material differences between a paper currency, issued by\r\nthe mere authority of government, and one issued by a bank, payable in\r\ncoin, is this: That, in the first case, there is no standard to which\r\nan appeal can be made, as to the quantity which will only satisfy, or\r\nwhich will surcharge the circulation: in the last, that standard\r\nresults from the demand. If more should be issued than is necessary,\r\nit will return upon the bank. Its emissions, as elsewhere intimated,\r\nmust always be in a compound ratio to the fund and the demand: whence\r\nit is evident, that there is a limitation in the nature of the thing;\r\nwhile the discretion of the government is the only measure of the\r\nextent of the emissions, by its own authority.\"\r\n\r\nThe bank which Hamilton proposed was private in its ownership, but the\r\nUnited States were to pledge themselves not to authorize any similar\r\ninstitution during its continuance. The capital of the bank was not to\r\nexceed $10,000,000, for which the President of the United States might\r\nsubscribe $2,000,000 on behalf of the government. It was further\r\nprovided that three fourths of the amount of each share might be paid\r\nin the public debt instead of gold and silver.\r\n\r\nIt was the purpose of Hamilton not merely to create a useful financial\r\ninstitution, in which the government would be able to keep its\r\ndeposits, but to weld the monetary system of the country into an\r\nharmonious whole. The result of this, which he foresaw and intended,\r\nwas to bind the property-owning classes to the interests of the new\r\ngovernment. The effect was much the same as the creation of the Bank\r\nof England by the loan of its capital to the government, which bound\r\nthe moneyed classes firmly to King William, through the knowledge that\r\nthe debt and the solvency of the bank depended on the perpetuation of\r\nhis government and the exclusion of the Stuart Pretender. The tendency\r\nof Hamilton's project was clearly seen by Jefferson and other\r\ndemocratic leaders, and did not fail to arouse their hostility. It was\r\nnot long before they promptly took sides against the national bank.\r\nJefferson wrote regarding the meetings of the cabinet at this time\r\nthat \"Hamilton and myself were daily pitted in the cabinet like two\r\ncocks.\"\r\n\r\nThere was something deeper involved, from the standpoint of Jefferson,\r\nthan the mere question of bringing the moneyed class to the side of\r\nthe government. The latter object was sufficiently distasteful to him,\r\nbut the extension of the powers granted by the Constitution beyond\r\nthose which were directly enumerated in the document involved a\r\nquestion of public policy and constitutional law which afforded the\r\nbasis for the creation of two great national parties. The Constitution\r\ndid not anywhere grant in terms to the government the power to\r\nestablish a national bank. Even Hamilton did not pretend to put his\r\nfinger on the specific authority for his new project. He advanced a\r\ndoctrine which was eagerly embraced by the party which was growing up\r\naround him, but which was as resolutely opposed by the other party.\r\nThis was the doctrine of the implied powers granted to the new\r\ngovernment by the Constitution. It is doubtful whether the\r\nConstitution would have been ratified by Virginia and other states if\r\nthis doctrine had been set forth and defended in the state conventions\r\nby the friends of the Constitution. This by no means implies that the\r\npolicy and doctrine of Hamilton were not wise and far-sighted.\r\nHamilton had definite aims before him, and it was his legitimate\r\nmission to educate public sentiment up to the point of accepting those\r\naims and of granting him the means for carrying them out.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of the \"implied powers\" rested upon the theory that\r\nunless they were directly prohibited by the Constitution, all powers\r\nwere granted to the government by implication which were found\r\nnecessary and proper for carrying out the powers specifically granted.\r\nJefferson came to believe, if he did not believe at the outset, that\r\nthe government was one of delegated powers which were strictly limited\r\nto those enumerated in the Constitution. The doctrine of Hamilton,\r\nfrom this point of view, was revolutionary. It meant the conversion of\r\na government holding limited delegations of power from the people and\r\nthe states into a government having supreme power, capable of taking\r\nan infinite variety of measures whenever Congress, in the exercise of\r\nits discretion, believed that such measures would contribute to the\r\nwell-being of the Union. The state governments, coming closer to the\r\npeople than the federal government, were most directly threatened by\r\nthis assumption of power, and it was as the champions of state rights\r\nas well as democratic ideas that Jefferson and his friends took their\r\nground as the advocates of the strict construction of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that the proposal to create the Bank\r\nof the United States called forth in Congress prolonged and heated\r\ndebates. But the policy of Hamilton had been so far successful in\r\nrestoring the public credit that he carried the project for the\r\nnational bank through both houses, and it was laid before the\r\nPresident for his approval. Washington had watched with interest the\r\nstruggle in the two houses, and was somewhat impressed by the weight\r\nof the argument against the constitutional power of Congress to\r\nestablish the bank. The cabinet was divided. Jefferson and Randolph\r\nwere against the constitutionality of the bill. Hamilton and Knox were\r\nin favor of it. Washington asked each of them to give him in writing\r\nthe reasons for his opinion. He weighed them carefully and then\r\naffixed his signature to the bill (February 25, 1791). The new project\r\nrealized all the benefits which Hamilton expected. Washington, in his\r\ntour of the Southern States in the spring of 1791, found the sentiment\r\nfor union strengthening and the country recovering from the\r\nprostration of the era of bad money and political uncertainty which\r\nhad followed the Revolution. He declared in a letter written after his\r\nreturn:\r\n\r\n\"Our public credit stands on that ground, which, three years ago, it\r\nwould have been madness to have foretold. The astonishing rapidity\r\nwith which the newly instituted bank was filled, gives an unexampled\r\nproof of the resources of our countrymen and their confidence in\r\npublic measures. On the first day of opening the subscription, the\r\nwhole number of shares (twenty thousand) were taken up in one hour,\r\nand application made for upwards of four thousand shares more than\r\nwere granted by the institution, besides many others that were coming\r\nin from various quarters.\"\r\n\r\nHow much was likely to be done by a national bank to bind together the\r\ncommercial interests of different sections of the country can hardly\r\nbe appreciated to-day. At that time there were only four banks in the\r\ncountry; none of these was ten years old, and their combined capital\r\nwas only $1,950,000. The Bank of the United States was authorized to\r\nestablish offices of discount and deposit in all the states and to\r\ndistribute parts of its capital among eight branches in the chief\r\ncities of the country. It was the drafts of these branches upon each\r\nother, and their means for reducing to a uniform and reasonable rate\r\nthe cost of transferring funds, which contributed to knit all parts of\r\nthe country together in commercial matters and so strengthened the\r\nbond of political union. The bank did not make regular reports to the\r\nTreasury Department, but its success is indicated by a special report\r\ncommunicated to Congress by Secretary Gallatin (January 24, 1811),\r\nwhich showed resources of $24,183,046. The average annual dividends\r\npaid upon the stock up to March, 1809, were over eight per cent.\r\n\r\nSo invaluable were the operations of the Bank of the United States to\r\nthe public treasury that Jefferson himself when President came to its\r\nsupport. His support was perhaps never very hearty, and was due to\r\nAlbert Gallatin, his Secretary of the Treasury, whose foresight and\r\nability give him a rank next to Hamilton among the able men who have\r\npresided over the national finances. Gallatin made a strong report in\r\n1809, recommending that the charter of the bank be renewed upon its\r\nexpiration in 1811, with an increase of capital and wider powers. A\r\nnew charter was voted in the House, but the bill was not acted on in\r\nthe Senate, and before the next session the opposition of the state\r\nbankers had rallied sufficient strength to defeat the recharter. The\r\nsecond United States Bank was authorized in 1816, under the\r\nadministration of Madison and with his approval, but its career was\r\nterminated in 1836, as the result of the political hostility of\r\nPresident Jackson.\r\n\r\nIt was not until after the grant of this second charter that the\r\nquestion of the power of Congress to establish a bank came directly\r\nbefore the Supreme Court in 1819. At the head of this court sat John\r\nMarshall, who next to Hamilton, perhaps, did more than any other man\r\nto strengthen and extend the powers of the general government. The\r\njealousy of the state banks had led the State of Maryland to impose a\r\ndiscriminating tax on the Bank of the United States. If the right to\r\nlevy such a tax had been admitted, the Bank would have been completely\r\nat the mercy of the states, and one of the chief purposes of its\r\ncreation would have been defeated. In order to sustain the right of\r\nthe bank to exemption from taxation, it was necessary to prove that it\r\nwas a constitutional instrument of federal power. Hence the question\r\nof the power of Congress to create such a corporation came directly\r\nbefore the court.\r\n\r\nHamilton found the power to create a bank partly in the preamble to\r\nthe Constitution, which declares that the people of the United States\r\nhave adopted it in order to \"promote the general welfare,\" but more\r\nparticularly in that concluding phrase of the clause defining the\r\npowers of Congress, which declares that that body shall have\r\nauthority \"to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for\r\ncarrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers\r\nvested by this Constitution in the government of the United States or\r\nin any department or officer thereof.\" Marshall, in the series of\r\ngreat decisions by which he strengthened the power of the Union, often\r\nmade use of these provisions to justify his reasoning. In one of the\r\nmost famous of these decisions (McCulloch _vs._ Maryland), he\r\nsustained the constitutionality of the bank as an instrument of\r\nfederal power and denied the right of the states to levy upon its\r\nproperty. He declared that the power to tax involved the power to\r\ndestroy, and that if the federal government had not the power to\r\nwithdraw its creations from discriminating legislation by the states,\r\nthe latter might tax the mail or the mints, the papers of the\r\ncustom-houses, or the forms of judicial process.\r\n\r\nThe view of Hamilton regarding the power of the federal government to\r\ncreate a bank was thus sustained in emphatic terms by the highest\r\ncourt in the land. It was partly his policy in providing for the bank\r\nand demonstrating its usefulness, with his other measures to develop\r\nthe powers of the central government, which made possible the\r\ndecisions of Marshall. If the question of the right to incorporate a\r\nbank could have been brought before the court at the beginning, before\r\nthe institution had proved its value, and if men like Jefferson and\r\nMadison had been upon the bench, there is at least room for doubt\r\nwhether a decision would have been rendered in favor of a power which\r\nis not granted directly to the government by the Constitution. But by\r\nthe resolute executive policy of Hamilton and the broad judicial\r\nconstructions of Marshall, the functions of the new government were\r\nextended to all those great objects necessary to create a vigorous and\r\nunited nation.\r\n\r\nThe many other measures of Hamilton were directed by the same\r\nsingleness of purpose to strengthen the hands of the government and\r\nconsolidate the Union. The report on the mint followed the previous\r\nreports of Jefferson in recommending the adoption of the dollar as the\r\nunit of value. Hamilton observed that \"upon the whole, it seems to be\r\nmost advisable, as has been observed, not to attach the unit\r\nexclusively to either of the metals; because this cannot be done\r\neffectually, without destroying the office and character of one of\r\nthem as money, and reducing it to the situation of a mere\r\nmerchandise.\" He believed, however, that care should be taken to\r\nregulate the proportion between the metals with an eye to their\r\naverage commercial value. He pointed out the danger of undervaluing\r\neither metal, and the inevitable result, in case of a difference of\r\nratio in two countries, \"if other things were equal, that the greatest\r\npart of the gold would be collected in one, and the greatest part of\r\nthe silver in the other.\"\r\n\r\nThis discussion of the subject took place at a time when monetary\r\nprinciples were not very well fixed, when the standard and the state\r\nof the currency had hardly been settled on an orderly basis in any\r\ncountry, and when the means of transportation for the precious metals\r\nwere much slower and less efficient than under modern conditions, and\r\nthe cost was much greater. Hamilton endeavored to find the true\r\ncommercial relation between gold and silver as a basis for the coinage\r\nvalues, in the hope that this would not change sufficiently to upset a\r\nbimetallic system founded upon such a basis. He was not a victim of\r\nthe delusion that government can arbitrarily give value by law to\r\nmoney, but declared, \"There can hardly be a better rule in any country\r\nfor the legal, than the market proportion; if this can be supposed to\r\nhave been produced by the free and steady course of commercial\r\nprinciples.\"\r\n\r\nThe report on manufactures and the bill providing for an excise were\r\nparts of the project of Hamilton for building up a vigorous and\r\nself-supporting nation. The report on manufactures was not presented\r\nto Congress until the beginning of the long session at the close of\r\n1791, and was not carried out in legislation. It consisted chiefly of\r\nan argument for the encouragement of young industries in an\r\nundeveloped country. Hamilton strongly favored the diversification of\r\nthe industries of the country between agriculture and various forms of\r\nmanufacture, because he believed it would contribute to the solidity\r\nof the industrial system and to the financial independence of the\r\nUnited States. His conception of the best method for promoting\r\nAmerican industries differed materially, however, from more recent\r\ndevelopments of the protective system. He recommended bounties and\r\npremiums in many cases in preference to protectionist customs duties,\r\nin order to avoid the rise in the price of articles to the consumer\r\nwhich often results from such duties. The customs duties which he\r\nproposed, moreover, ranged only from seven and a half to fifteen per\r\ncent., and the latter rate was to be levied on only a few articles.\r\n\r\nThe country was not yet ripe for extensive industrial enterprises. The\r\nmanufactures then existing were chiefly for supplying local needs,\r\nthe factory system had not been introduced, and the capital had not\r\nbeen accumulated for the creation of large establishments. The country\r\nneeded many foreign manufactured articles to put it upon the highroad\r\nto industrial development, and it was at a much later period that the\r\nmanufacturing interests acquired the power which enabled them to\r\nincrease the scale of duties. When this time came, they turned to the\r\narsenal of Hamilton's report for weapons in support of the policy of\r\ndiversifying industries; but they used these weapons in behalf of a\r\nscale of duties which was not recommended by him and they ignored his\r\narguments for premiums and bounties for the protection of the consumer\r\nagainst excessive prices.\r\n\r\nWhether Hamilton would have favored the policy of protection in its\r\nlater developments, it is useless to inquire. It is idle to claim for\r\nany thinker of the past that he anticipated all future discoveries and\r\nreasoning in the fields of politics or economics. It is not\r\nnecessary, in order to give a statesman a high place in history, to\r\nworship blindly all that he did or said or to make such deeds and\r\nwords an authority for later generations. What can be said of Hamilton\r\nwithout reasonable ground of denial is that he did not recommend in\r\nany of his writings the high scale of duties advocated by some\r\nprotectionists in recent years. On the contrary, he urged a scale of\r\nduties which would be treated by the protectionist of to-day as below\r\neven the level of a \"tariff for revenue only.\" That his ideas were far\r\nfrom extreme is indicated by the project which he drew up in 1794 for\r\na reciprocity treaty with Great Britain, which proposed to limit\r\nAmerican import duties on the leading textiles and manufactured\r\narticles of metal to ten per cent. of their value. He even criticised\r\nJefferson's message of 1801 for recommending the repeal of the\r\ninternal revenue taxes, upon the ground that the duties on imports\r\nwere high and that if any taxes were to be repealed, they should be\r\nthose which weighed on commerce and navigation.\r\n\r\nA measure which led to more immediate results than the report on\r\nmanufactures was the report on the excise. Hamilton found it\r\nnecessary, in order to obtain sufficient funds to meet the interest on\r\nthe debt and other charges, to recommend an excise tax upon distilled\r\nliquors produced in the United States. The bill passed Congress in\r\nJanuary, 1791, and was soon put in force. Violent resistance was made\r\nin western Pennsylvania, where the manufacture of whiskey was more\r\nextensively carried on than in any other part of the Union. The\r\nfederal collector for Washington and Allegheny was tarred and\r\nfeathered, and deputy marshals did not dare serve writs against those\r\nguilty of the outrage. Washington's journey through the South had a\r\ngood effect in softening the opposition to the law, which first showed\r\nitself in Virginia and North Carolina; but in Pennsylvania conditions\r\nwent from bad to worse, until it became necessary to give the federal\r\ngovernment additional powers for collecting the tax and putting down\r\ninsurrection. Masked mobs terrorized those who were inclined to obey\r\nthe law, and forced them to publish the injury done to their stills.\r\nIn order to protect themselves by embroiling the whole community, some\r\nof the insurgent leaders had the mail stopped, the militia called out\r\non their side, and threatened to lay Pittsburg in ashes (July, 1794).\r\n\r\nThe opportunity had come for testing the question whether the Union\r\nwas strong enough to put down rebellion by force. It was an\r\nopportunity which Hamilton did not shirk. At his earnest solicitation,\r\nan army was dispatched to the disturbed districts. Washington showed\r\nno hesitation in supporting the authority of the federal government.\r\nHe obtained a certificate from a judge of the Supreme Court, setting\r\nforth that the laws of the United States were set at naught and that\r\nthe courts were unable to enforce them. He then issued a proclamation\r\ncommanding the insurgents to submit to the laws, and made a\r\nrequisition for 12,950 militia from Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia,\r\nand New Jersey, to move on September 1, 1794, towards the disaffected\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\nThe firmness of Washington put an end to the insurrection. Governor\r\nMifflin of Pennsylvania, who had hesitated to put down the\r\ndisturbances by the strong hand of the state, recovered his courage,\r\nand aided the federal government by proclamations and by his full\r\nquota of troops. Hamilton accompanied the army as it moved towards the\r\nWest, and remained with it after Washington turned back to attend the\r\nopening of Congress. The strong display of force made by the\r\ngovernment overawed the insurgents and finally compelled their\r\nsubmission. Albert Gallatin, although a citizen of the disaffected\r\nsection and an opponent of the party in power, exerted his influence\r\non behalf of order. Negotiations were set on foot between\r\ncommissioners of the President, and a committee of citizens, of which\r\nGallatin was a member. When this committee met to decide whether they\r\nwould recommend compliance with the law, they were surrounded by\r\nriflemen who were ready to shoot if their leaders showed signs of\r\nyielding. But they adopted the clever device of a ballot upon which\r\nboth yea and nay were written, with the option of destroying either\r\nword. A small majority voted to submit. Some of the obstinate spirits\r\nheld out, but as the people fell away from them, they were arrested\r\nand put on trial, and the authority of the federal government was no\r\nlonger disputed.\r\n\r\nThis suppression of the \"Whiskey Rebellion,\" as it was called, was one\r\nof the most important steps in the consolidation of the Union. Many\r\nwho had observed the aggressive and comprehensive projects of\r\nHamilton, and seen them daily binding closer the bonds of union, did\r\nnot believe that they would stand the test of armed conflict. They\r\nfeared that the power of the government would wither and the people\r\nsplit into warring factions when men were called upon to march in arms\r\nagainst their fellow-citizens. The event proved that the new\r\ngovernment had vindicated its right to exist, and that the sentiment\r\nof union was daily gaining a stronger hold upon the hearts of the\r\npeople. That this new power had not only built up a cohesive financial\r\nsystem, but had shown its capacity to put down resistance to its\r\nlawful authority with a strong hand, was largely the work of Hamilton.\r\nIt may be said that it was wholly his work, so far as any great\r\nnational policy can be projected and carried out by a single man,\r\nindependently of the support of his associates in the government and\r\nof the body of public opinion which make possible the execution of his\r\nplans.\r\n\r\nThe time had come when Hamilton felt that his constructive work was\r\ndone. He withdrew from the cabinet (January 31, 1795), and Oliver\r\nWolcott of Connecticut was appointed his successor. Hamilton chose the\r\nmoment for retiring from office with a tact and judgment unusual with\r\npublic men. He was moved partly by the desire to provide for his\r\nfamily upon a more liberal scale than his modest salary under the\r\ngovernment permitted. He was too patriotic, however, to have\r\nabandoned his post until he felt that his constructive work was\r\ncomplete. It was with conscious satisfaction that in his report on the\r\npublic credit at the beginning of 1795 he was able to marshal the\r\nmeasures already taken towards restoring order to the national\r\nfinances and point out their results. The credit of the country had\r\nbeen raised from the lowest abyss of dishonor to that of the most\r\nenlightened nations of the old world; an adequate system of taxation\r\nhad been provided for meeting the public obligations; the business\r\ninterests had been knit together in support of the government by a\r\nnational bank; a monetary system had been established; the Treasury\r\nhad been organized in its various branches upon a basis which has\r\nsurvived to our day; and finally the strength of the fabric of the\r\nUnion and of the financial system had been subjected to the test of a\r\nrebellion which, without serious bloodshed, but with a strong display\r\nof force, had been fully and firmly subdued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nFOREIGN AFFAIRS AND NEUTRALITY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe comprehensive measures of Hamilton for strengthening the Union\r\ngave a definite character and policy to the Federalist party. The\r\nfoundations of this party had been laid by the struggle over the\r\nquestion whether the Constitution should be accepted by the states;\r\nbut the measures of Hamilton were too strong for some of the friends\r\nof the Constitution, and many changes occurred in the temporary\r\ngroupings of political leaders before a definite dividing line was\r\nestablished between the Federalism of Hamilton on the one side and the\r\nDemocracy of Jefferson and Madison on the other. These two eminent\r\nDemocratic leaders had, indeed, been among the most earnest supporters\r\nof the Constitution. Madison went farther than Jefferson in the\r\ndirection of Federalism, and encountered the distrust of the\r\nstates-rights element at home; but Jefferson, as has been already\r\nseen, made several reports in the Continental Congress in favor of\r\ndeclaring the United States a nation, and was the cordial promoter of\r\nthose important steps towards union,--the transfer of the Western\r\nterritory to Congress and the adoption of a common monetary system.\r\n\r\nThe plans of Hamilton in regard to the finances, however, and his\r\nresolute policy of neutrality between France and Great Britain, ran\r\ncounter to the views of Jefferson. It is not surprising, therefore,\r\nthat the latter found himself pitted against the great Federalist\r\nleader upon nearly every question of importance which came before the\r\ncabinet. The feeling that he had been duped in regard to the\r\nassumption of the state debts found vent in many complaints, which\r\nfinally bore fruit in open attacks upon Hamilton, at first made\r\nindirectly through a clerk in the government service, and then\r\ndirectly in a long letter to Washington. Jefferson gave the post of\r\ntranslating clerk in the State Department to a Frenchman, Philip\r\nFreneau, who published a journal known as the \"National Gazette.\" In\r\nthis journal Freneau began a series of bitter and sometimes\r\nwell-directed attacks upon the measures of the administration, and\r\nparticularly those of Hamilton. A friend of Jefferson in Virginia,\r\nColonel Mason, approached Washington in the summer of 1791, and made a\r\nlong and severe criticism upon the Treasury measures and their effect\r\nupon the people.\r\n\r\nWashington continued to stand above party, and sought to mitigate the\r\nfriction between his cabinet officers. Where the judgments of Hamilton\r\nand Jefferson differed on constructive measures, however, Washington\r\nin nearly every case became convinced of the wisdom of the\r\nrecommendations of Hamilton. He therefore had the appearance of\r\nleaning to his side, although he often mitigated the sharpness of the\r\narguments of his vigorous young minister of finance and endeavored to\r\ntemper his excess of zeal. After listening to Mason, Washington felt\r\nthat the time had come to interpose in the growing hostility between\r\nhis cabinet ministers. He submitted a brief summary to Hamilton of\r\nthe criticisms which had been made upon his projects and asked him to\r\nsubmit a statement in reply. The charges were directed not only\r\nagainst the substance of the financial measures, but declared that\r\nthey fostered speculation, corrupted Congress through the ownership of\r\nthe public debt by members of that body, and that Hamilton was\r\nlaboring secretly to introduce aristocracy and monarchy.\r\n\r\nIt was not difficult for Hamilton to brush away most of these\r\ncriticisms. This he did in the cool, logical manner of which he was a\r\nmaster by numbering each objection to his policy and measures and\r\nshowing that it was not founded upon solid reasoning or fact. Hamilton\r\nwould have done well to have rested his case upon his letter to\r\nWashington, but he was now convinced that Jefferson was behind the\r\nattacks upon him, and he determined to strike back. He began a series\r\nof anonymous communications through the Federalist organ, \"Fenno's\r\nGazette,\" which showed all his usual vigor and force of reasoning, but\r\nwhich only intensified the bitterness in the cabinet. President\r\nWashington was deeply disturbed by this open outbreak of hostilities,\r\nand remonstrated by letter with both Hamilton and Jefferson. Hamilton\r\nsuspended his attacks, while Jefferson confined his hostility to less\r\nopen methods.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress met at the close of 1791, Giles of Virginia, a\r\nloud-spoken, hot-headed member of the House, called for accounts of\r\nthe various foreign loans made by the government. An attempt was made\r\nto prove corruption in the management of the Treasury. Hamilton could\r\nnot have found a better opportunity for defending himself, if he had\r\nsought it. He was no longer shut up to the unsatisfactory methods of\r\nunsigned communications through newspapers, but was in a position to\r\nspeak openly and boldly in exposition and defense of his measures.\r\nReport after report was sent to Congress, setting forth the operations\r\nof the Treasury with a lucidity and power which silenced the\r\nopposition and almost overwhelmed Madison, who had been forced as a\r\nparty leader to accept the responsibility for the attacks. The\r\nreports, to any one who understood the subject, were absolutely\r\nconvincing of the soundness and wisdom of Hamilton's measures.\r\n\r\nJefferson, perhaps, had some right to complain of the influence which\r\nHamilton exerted over that department of the government which properly\r\nbelonged under his exclusive jurisdiction. This was the management of\r\nforeign relations. Hamilton had such definite and well-considered\r\nviews on foreign policy as well as finance that he could not forbear\r\npresenting them in the cabinet. His superiority in definiteness of aim\r\nand energy no doubt led him to believe that he was fitted for the\r\nfunctions of prime minister and that he was justified in exercising\r\nthem as far as he could. The course of Washington encouraged him to\r\nthe extent that the President often gave the preference to his views\r\nover those of Jefferson, but it was far from the purpose of the\r\nPresident to make any distinction in rank or in his confidence between\r\nhis ministers. Hamilton, although an admirer of the British political\r\nsystem, permitted himself few prejudices in his theory of the foreign\r\npolicy of the United States. Though often charged with British\r\nsympathies, he leaned much less towards Great Britain than Jefferson,\r\nthrough his admiration of the spirit of the French Revolution, leaned\r\ntowards France.\r\n\r\nThe foreign relations of the country began to become acute with the\r\noutbreak of war between England and France in 1793. France had already\r\nabolished royalty, expelled the nobles, sent Louis XVI. to the\r\nscaffold, and was on the eve of the terrible massacres which did so\r\nmuch to revolt even her best friends outside the country. The news of\r\nwar reached the United States early in April, 1793. News came also\r\nthat a minister from the French Republic had landed at Charleston and\r\nwould soon present his credentials at Philadelphia. Hamilton sent post\r\nhaste for Washington, who was at Mount Vernon. The outbreak of war\r\nmeant danger to American commerce on the ocean and the risk of trouble\r\nwith both powers over the neutrality laws. The serious question\r\nconfronting the American government was whether they should maintain\r\nstrict neutrality between the belligerents or should side with France,\r\nto whom they were bound by the treaties made with her when she came to\r\nthe rescue of the colonies. When Washington reached Philadelphia, he\r\nfound both Jefferson and Hamilton ready with suggestions for meeting\r\nthe crisis, but these suggestions differed widely. Jefferson, although\r\nnot an advocate of war against England, believed that Congress should\r\nbe called together in extra session to deal with the emergency.\r\n\r\nA stronger programme was urged upon the President by Hamilton. He\r\nregarded the question of neutrality and the reception of the French\r\nenvoy as one for the executive rather than for Congress. He believed\r\nalso that these subjects would be safer in the hands of Washington\r\nthan midst the passions of a legislative body. He drew up a statement,\r\nembodying a series of questions regarding the policy of the United\r\nStates, which was laid by Washington before the cabinet. The first\r\nquestion was whether a declaration of neutrality should be issued.\r\nThis was decided in the affirmative, and the proclamation was soon\r\nissued by Washington. It was decided that the French minister, Genet,\r\nshould be received, but that early occasion should be taken to explain\r\nto him that the United States did not consider themselves bound by the\r\ntreaties to plunge into war in behalf of France. While it was admitted\r\nby Hamilton that it would not be the province of the United States\r\nunder ordinary circumstances to cavil over the character of the\r\ngovernment in France, but would be their duty to accept the government\r\nwhich existed, nevertheless, the extraordinary events which had taken\r\nplace at Paris justified a certain reserve towards the revolutionary\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nEntirely apart from the changes in the character of the French\r\ngovernment, it was felt by Hamilton that the time had come to give an\r\ninterpretation to the early treaties in harmony with a more\r\nunchallenged independence for the United States, and a more\r\ncomplete separation from the intrigues of European politics. The\r\nradical character of the Revolution in France, and the action of the\r\nFrench government itself, gave an excuse for an interpretation of the\r\ntreaties which otherwise might not have been found without blushing.\r\nThe treaties provided for a defensive alliance with France, and it was\r\npromptly decided by the cabinet that the war of France against Great\r\nBritain was not defensive. Hamilton proposed not only to revise the\r\ntreaties, but to resist by the utmost efforts of the federal\r\ngovernment the enlistment of men and the fitting out of privateers in\r\nAmerica in aid of the French. He did not propose, as some of the\r\nfriends of France would have desired, that the proclamation of\r\nneutrality should be only a mask for underhanded aid to that country.\r\n\r\nThe situation was made as difficult as possible for the government by\r\nthe hot temper and indiscretions of the new French minister. These\r\nqualities in him were encouraged by the reception which he received\r\non the way from Charleston to Philadelphia. He was everywhere welcomed\r\nwith such enthusiastic demonstrations of sympathy for France as tended\r\nto make him believe that he was something more than the diplomatic\r\nrepresentative of a foreign country, and could safely interfere in the\r\npolitics of the United States. As he approached Philadelphia (May 16,\r\n1793) he found Captain Bompard of the French frigate L'Ambuscade ready\r\nto fire a salute of three guns, and men on swift horses posted along\r\nthe road to give notice to the citizens of his coming.\r\n\r\nGenet had no sooner landed at Charleston than he began to fit out\r\nprivateers to prey upon British commerce. The Ambuscade herself, which\r\nbrought Genet to Charleston, seized several English merchant vessels\r\non her way to Philadelphia, and crowned her insolence to the United\r\nStates by seizing an English vessel, the Grange, within the Delaware\r\ncapes, in the jurisdiction of the United States. The Grange was\r\nrestored to her owners, but her seizure was only one of many flagrant\r\nviolations of international law which were systematically carried out\r\nby the French, and which were defended and often planned by Genet.\r\nWhen the Polly was stopped from leaving New York fitted out for a\r\nFrench privateer, Hauterive, the French consul, addressed a note to\r\nGovernor Clinton, telling him it was not in a land where Frenchmen had\r\nspilled their blood that they were to be thus harassed. When the\r\nLittle Sarah was fitted out as a privateer in Philadelphia, Hamilton\r\nand Knox urged that a battery be placed on one of the islands and that\r\nthe vessel be fired upon if she attempted to leave the harbor.\r\nJefferson was hoodwinked by assurances from Genet that the vessel\r\nwould not sail, and himself indulged in some glittering talk against\r\nthe United States joining in \"the combination of kings against\r\nFrance.\" The vessel at once put to sea, and Washington was so\r\nindignant that Jefferson was almost driven to resignation.\r\n\r\nHamilton had a more direct interest officially in the demands of Genet\r\nfor money which was owed to France. Genet not only asked for the\r\nanticipation of payments soon to mature, but insisted that he should\r\nreceive the whole amount of the debt. He threw a bait to American\r\nsentiment by the suggestion that the money would be spent in the\r\nUnited States for provisions and supplies. Hamilton treated his rude\r\ndemands just as he would those of any other creditor. He was willing\r\nto anticipate certain payments when the Treasury resources justified\r\nit, but absolutely refused to do more. Genet then threatened to pay\r\nfor what he bought with drafts upon the Treasury. Hamilton coolly\r\nretorted that the drafts would not be honored. The Frenchman was\r\ncompelled to consume his wrath, not exactly in silence, but without\r\nresult upon the government.\r\n\r\nGenet, encouraged by some of the enemies of the administration,\r\nsucceeded in working up a strong pro-French sentiment in various parts\r\nof the country. At a dinner in Philadelphia, following his arrival,\r\nsongs were sung to France and America, and the red cap of liberty,\r\nwhich had been forced upon the reluctant head of Louis XVI. in the\r\ngreat demonstration of the preceding August at the Tuileries, was\r\npassed around the table and successively worn by each of the American\r\nguests. Hamilton, who never had much confidence in pure democracy,\r\nwent close to the other extreme in his alarm over these signs of\r\npublic opinion. He felt compelled in the summer of 1793 to publish a\r\nseries of essays signed \"Pacificus,\" defending the policy of the\r\nadministration. These papers, in the language of Mr, Lodge, \"served\r\ntheir purpose of awakening the better part of the community to the\r\ngravity of the situation, and began the work of rallying the friends\r\nof the government to its active support.\" Genet addressed such\r\noffensive letters to the Department of State, and his conduct became\r\nso intolerable, that the cabinet agreed to send the correspondence to\r\nParis and ask for his recall. Genet himself published a letter which\r\nrevealed his insolence to the public, and caused a revulsion of\r\nsentiment which brought the more sober men of all parties to the side\r\nof Washington. Genet's course was run, and in February, 1794, his\r\nsuccessor came out from France.\r\n\r\nHamilton soon had opportunities for proving that his policy of\r\nneutrality was directed as much against English as against French\r\naggression. When Great Britain issued the first Orders in Council,\r\ndirecting the seizure of all vessels loaded with French produce,\r\nHamilton declared the British order an outrage, and urged the\r\nfortification of the seaports and the raising of troops. He exerted\r\nhimself, however, to restrain popular passion and preserve peace. He\r\nsuggested to Washington that a special mission be sent to London to\r\ntreat with the British government. The idea was cordially accepted by\r\nWashington. He desired to send Hamilton, but the Virginia party,\r\nheaded by Madison and Monroe, strongly opposed the appointment. They\r\nwere embittered by recent party conflicts, and regarded Hamilton as\r\ntoo friendly to British interests. Chief Justice John Jay of New York\r\nwas then recommended by Hamilton for the mission. Opposition was made\r\neven to Jay, but the nomination was confirmed (April 19, 1794), and\r\nHamilton himself drew the outline of the instructions with which Jay\r\nsailed from New York.\r\n\r\nThe conflict over the treaty which Jay brought back in the following\r\nwinter was one of the most bitter ever waged in American politics. The\r\ncontracting parties to the treaty--the United States and Great\r\nBritain--looked at the situation from widely different points of view.\r\nJay secured the promise of the withdrawal of the British troops from\r\nthe frontier posts and an agreement to compensate Americans for losses\r\nthrough British privateering. The last was an important concession,\r\nbecause it covertly admitted the British position in regard to\r\nprivateering to be in conflict with international law. Some important\r\ncommercial concessions were also made by Great Britain, which were\r\nregarded at London as purely gratuitous. But the treaty failed to\r\nsecure any compensation for the claims of American citizens for\r\nnegroes and other property carried away by the British troops, and\r\nAmerican vessels were forbidden carrying to Europe from English ports\r\nor even from the United States coffee and the other chief colonial\r\nproducts. Among the latter was named cotton, which was then just\r\nbecoming a large element in the production of the South.\r\n\r\nHamilton himself is said to have characterized the treaty as \"an old\r\nwoman's treaty,\" when he first read it, but it soon became evident\r\nthat it must be accepted substantially as presented, if war was to be\r\navoided. Washington called the Senate in extra session in June, 1795,\r\nand after two weeks' debate in secret session the treaty was ratified\r\nby exactly the necessary two thirds vote,--twenty to ten. It was not\r\nuntil the adjournment of the Senate that the contents of the document\r\nreached the public through Senator Mason of Virginia. The news was\r\nfollowed by town meetings all over the country demanding that\r\nPresident Washington refuse to exchange ratifications. So intense was\r\nthe feeling that a vessel suspected of being a British privateer was\r\nseized and burned at Boston, a great meeting in Faneuil Hall ordered\r\na committee to take a protest to Philadelphia, and Hamilton himself\r\nwas stoned and refused a hearing at a meeting in New York. But\r\nWashington remained calm. Hamilton, as the responsible leader of the\r\nparty, took up the cudgels for ratification. He submitted an elaborate\r\nargument to the cabinet (July 9, 1795), and with an amendment which\r\nthe Senate recommended and Great Britain accepted, the treaty went\r\ninto operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nHAMILTON AS A PARTY LEADER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ratification of the Jay treaty did much to shake the power of the\r\nFederalists, and for a moment seemed to threaten their ruin. It was\r\ndivisions in their own ranks, however, which contributed as much to\r\nthis event as any real blunders in public policy. Hamilton was not at\r\nhis best in conciliating those who differed from him, and he did not\r\nencounter a more yielding or tactful associate in John Adams. Hamilton\r\nhad gone out of his way with little reason at the first presidential\r\nelection, in 1788, to secure votes against Adams. His avowed object\r\nwas to insure the election of Washington by preventing a tie vote\r\nbetween Washington and Adams. The original Constitution authorized\r\neach elector to vote for two persons for President and Vice-President,\r\nwithout designating the office for which either was voted for. This\r\nled to complications which were corrected by an amendment after the\r\nelection of 1800. In the case of the first election, however, few sane\r\nmen doubted that Washington would have the majority of the votes, and\r\nthe only effect of the intrigue of Hamilton was to reduce the vote for\r\nAdams to a point which almost caused his defeat. Hamilton supported\r\nAdams in the second election, in 1792, and the relations between the\r\ntwo men were reasonably cordial.\r\n\r\nWhen Washington retired from the presidency, in 1797, the commanding\r\nmen in the Federalist party were Hamilton, John Jay, Thomas Pinckney,\r\nand John Adams. Hamilton was the controlling mind in the consultations\r\nof the leaders rather than the sort of man who appealed to the people.\r\nHe was not seriously thought of by himself or others as a candidate\r\nfor President. Jay was barred by the odium attaching to the treaty\r\nwith Great Britain. The choice was therefore reduced to Pinckney and\r\nAdams. Most of the leaders were for Adams, who was superior to\r\nPinckney in Revolutionary services and ability. It was determined\r\nthat the Federalist electors should vote for both Adams and Pinckney,\r\nwith the purpose of choosing the former for President and the latter\r\nfor Vice-President. Hamilton on this occasion urged that all the\r\nFederalist electors should vote for both Adams and Pinckney. If each\r\nhad received an equal number of votes, the choice would have been\r\nthrown into the House and Adams would probably have been elected.\r\nHamilton erred in letting it be known that he was indifferent whether\r\nthe outcome was favorable to Adams or Pinckney, especially when there\r\nwas a strong suspicion that he was really for Pinckney. Party\r\ndiscipline had not then reached its modern development, and votes were\r\nthrown away by Federalist electors,--in the North to prevent a\r\nmajority for Pinckney over Adams and in the South to prevent the same\r\nchance in favor of Adams.\r\n\r\nThe result of these jealousies was that Adams barely escaped defeat.\r\nHe was chosen by a plurality of three, but Pinckney was beaten, and\r\nJefferson, having the next highest vote, was elected Vice-President.\r\nAdams became firmly convinced that Hamilton was his personal enemy and\r\nwould stop at nothing to injure him. That Hamilton was recognized by\r\nall the party leaders as the master mind and the guiding spirit of the\r\nparty made no difference to a man of the hot temper and resolute\r\nspirit of John Adams. Tact and conciliation were as far removed from\r\nhis nature as from that of any American public man. The indifference\r\nof Hamilton whether he was beaten by Pinckney, in connection with\r\nHamilton's intrigue in 1788, had convinced Adams that Hamilton did not\r\nfeel proper respect for him, and that he was seeking to dictate the\r\npolicy of the administration and to thwart and degrade him. Adams\r\nresented any sort of suggestion or consultation, and took delight in\r\ndisregarding the suggestions of Hamilton, while the latter struck back\r\nthrough several members of the cabinet, who were more in sympathy with\r\nhim than with the President.\r\n\r\nThe country having escaped the danger of immediate war with England by\r\nthe Jay treaty, was soon threatened with war with France. Monroe had\r\nbeen recalled as American Minister at Paris and Charles Pinckney, who\r\nwas sent in his place, had been refused a reception. Some of the\r\nFederalists were so incensed against France that they were eager for\r\nwar. Hamilton was opposed to war if it could be avoided, but was in\r\nfavor of a resolute policy. Adams, although as far as possible from\r\nsympathy with France, believed every reasonable effort should be made\r\nto preserve peace. It was decided, with the approval of both Adams and\r\nHamilton, to send a commission of three to Paris, to negotiate. Over\r\nthe appointment of this commission new differences broke out between\r\nHamilton and the President. Hamilton favored the appointment of a\r\nNorthern and a Southern Federalist and of a Democrat of the highest\r\nstanding, like Madison or even Jefferson. Adams was at first disposed\r\nto make these appointments, but finally took both the Federalists from\r\nthe South,--Pinckney of South Carolina and John Marshall of\r\nVirginia,--and selected as the third member a Democrat of\r\ncomparatively minor standing, Gerry of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners accomplished little good at Paris. They were\r\ninsulted and browbeaten and told that only bribery would secure what\r\nthey desired. When their treatment became known in the United States,\r\nin the spring of 1798, there was a popular outburst which restored the\r\nFederalists to power in Congress in the following autumn, with a\r\nlarger majority than ever before since party divisions became fixed.\r\nEnthusiastic addresses poured in upon President Adams, war vessels\r\nwere fitted out by private subscription, and bills were carried at\r\nonce for a provisional army, for fortifications, and for the increase\r\nof the navy. Even under this stress of excitement, however, Hamilton\r\nopposed alliance with Great Britain, and persuaded Pickering, the\r\nSecretary of State, to abandon the advocacy of it.\r\n\r\nIt was over the organization of the new army that the hostility of\r\nAdams to Hamilton became open and bitter. Washington was selected as\r\ncommander-in-chief, but only consented to serve upon the condition\r\nthat he should have the choice of the officers who were to rank next\r\nhim, and should not be called upon to take an active part until the\r\narmy took the field. He recommended to the President that rank in the\r\nRevolutionary army be disregarded and that the three major-generals to\r\nbe appointed should be Hamilton, Charles Pinckney, and Knox. This gave\r\nthe practical command and the work of the organization to Hamilton.\r\nAdams sent the names to the Senate, in the order suggested by\r\nWashington, and they were promptly confirmed. When he came to signing\r\nthe commissions, however, he took the ground that Knox was the senior\r\nofficer on account of his rank during the Revolution. Hamilton would\r\nnot consent to this arrangement, and all the Federalist leaders,\r\nincluding members of the cabinet, remonstrated with the President\r\nagainst it. One of the saddest results of the quarrel was the\r\nalienation from Hamilton of Knox, who had been a friend of many years\r\nand when Secretary of War in Washington's first cabinet had stood\r\nloyally by Hamilton against Jefferson in the controversy over the\r\nfinancial projects.\r\n\r\nAdams at first seemed to grow more stubborn with the protests which\r\nwere made against his action. The leaders finally turned to\r\nWashington. The latter informed the President that if the original\r\nagreement as to the rank of the officers was not kept, he should\r\nresign. Adams, with all his stubbornness and bravery, did not dare\r\ndefy the country by forcing Washington from the service. He gave way,\r\nand appointed Hamilton to the first place, but the good feeling which\r\nmight have been promoted if he had done so at first was replaced on\r\nboth sides by bitterness which was never softened.\r\n\r\nHamilton, as the practical head of the army, showed the same abounding\r\nenergy and capacity for organization which he had shown at the head of\r\nthe Treasury. He drafted a plan for the fortification of New York\r\nharbor, made an apportionment of officers and men among the states,\r\nand drew up projects for the organization of the new army, dealing\r\nwith the questions of pay, uniforms, rations, promotions, police in\r\ngarrisons and camps, and the many other branches of the service. All\r\nthese projects received the cordial approval of Washington. When\r\nCongress met, Hamilton was ready with a bill putting the army upon a\r\nbasis which would permit its increase or diminution in future without\r\nchanging the form of the organization. In the spring of 1799 he was\r\nproviding for the defense of the frontiers and planning the invasion\r\nof Louisiana and the Floridas.\r\n\r\nThe projects of these invasions of Spanish territory justify a\r\nreference to the continental policy of Hamilton. He was among the\r\nfirst to maintain that the United States should have complete control\r\nof the valley of the Mississippi, and even during his short term in\r\nthe Congress of the Confederation the last resolution which he\r\npresented declared the \"navigation of the Mississippi to be a clear\r\nand essential right and to be supported as such.\" It was left for\r\nJefferson, Hamilton's great opponent, to carry out his conception of\r\nthe acquisition of the Mississippi valley by the purchase of\r\nLouisiana. The admirers of Hamilton credit him with a still wider\r\nvision of the future power of the United States, which was eventually\r\nto bear fruit in the Monroe doctrine and in the celebrated declaration\r\nof Secretary Olney in 1895, that \"to-day the United States is\r\npractically sovereign on this continent, and its fiat is law upon the\r\nsubjects to which it confines its interposition.\" Hamilton wrote in\r\n\"The Federalist,\" before the adoption of the Constitution, that \"our\r\nsituation invites and our situation prompts us to aim at an ascendant\r\nin American affairs.\"\r\n\r\nThe firm attitude of the United States towards France had its effect\r\nat Paris. Talleyrand sent an intimation indirectly to President Adams\r\nthat the French government would be glad to receive an American envoy.\r\nAgain the impetuosity of Adams divided his party and intensified his\r\nquarrel with the leaders who stood around Hamilton. The name of Vans\r\nMurray was sent to the Senate by the President for Minister to\r\nFrance, without even consulting the cabinet. Many doubted the wisdom\r\nof snapping up so promptly the offer made by Talleyrand, and more were\r\nincensed at the President's method of doing it. There was at first a\r\nstrong disposition among the Federalist leaders to defeat the\r\nnomination in the Senate. Hamilton, however, checked the indignation\r\nof his friends and suggested a way out of the difficulty by appointing\r\na strong commission.\r\n\r\nThe downfall of the Federal party and the retirement of Hamilton from\r\nthe active control of national policy were at hand. The passage of the\r\nalien and sedition laws, arrogating to the federal government\r\nintolerable powers of interference with the rights of the press and of\r\nfree speech, was one of the causes contributing to the revulsion of\r\nfeeling in favor of the party of Jefferson. Hamilton opposed the first\r\ndrafts of these laws as cruel, violent, and tyrannical, but he did not\r\ndisapprove their final form. The Federalists carried the congressional\r\nelections of 1798, under the impulse of the feeling against France,\r\nbut began to lose ground soon after. As the presidential election of\r\n1800 approached, a desperate struggle was made to hold New York for\r\nFederalism as the only hope of defeating Jefferson and reëlecting\r\nAdams. The New York election went against the administration, and\r\nHamilton pleaded in vain with Governor Jay to defeat the will of the\r\npeople by calling the old legislature together and giving the choice\r\nof presidential electors to the congressional districts. It was\r\nperhaps the most discreditable proposal which ever came from Hamilton,\r\nand was promptly rejected by Jay.\r\n\r\nHamilton's motive was a sincere fear that the country would go to ruin\r\nand the Constitution be endangered by the triumph of the political\r\nschool of Jefferson. This might have been the case if it had been the\r\nfirst election under the Constitution, but Hamilton himself had\r\nbuilded better than he knew. The financial projects, the national\r\nbank, the suppression of the \"Whiskey Insurrection,\" and the other\r\nmeasures taken under Washington and Adams had built up a Federal\r\nUnion, whose strength could not be seriously shaken by the transfer of\r\npower from one party to another.\r\n\r\nWith the shadow of defeat hanging over them, the course of the\r\nFederalist leaders seemed to justify the maxim, \"Whom the gods destroy\r\nthey first make mad.\" With the utmost need for harmony and unity,\r\nquarrels broke out which would have wrecked the party even if there\r\nhad been otherwise some prospect of its success. Adams drove McHenry\r\nand Pickering from his cabinet because they had betrayed his secrets\r\nto Hamilton, and denounced Hamilton and his friends as a British\r\nfaction. Hamilton asked in writing for a denial or explanation of the\r\ncharge, but was treated with contemptuous silence. As the presidential\r\nelection approached, Hamilton scarcely concealed his preference for\r\nPinckney, who was again to be voted for by the electors along with\r\nAdams. Hamilton had been so badly treated by the President that he\r\nannounced his purpose to prepare a pamphlet, exposing the failings of\r\nAdams and vindicating his own position.\r\n\r\nHis best friends stood aghast at the project and labored with him to\r\nabandon it. Hamilton persevered, however, in the preparation of the\r\npamphlet. He denounced Adams as a man of disgusting egotism, intense\r\njealousy, and ungovernable temper, and reviewed in a scathing manner\r\nhis entire public career, and especially the recent dismissal of the\r\nsecretaries who were friendly to Hamilton. After all this criticism,\r\nHamilton wound up with the lame conclusion that the electors should\r\nvote equally for Adams and Pinckney, in order to preserve Federal\r\nascendency. He yielded to the protests of his friends so far as to\r\nkeep the circulation of the pamphlet within a small circle, but it was\r\nhardly off the press before a copy was in the hands of Aaron Burr, the\r\nDemocratic leader in New York, and was used with effect against the\r\nFederalist President.\r\n\r\nThe downfall of Federalism came with the presidential election of\r\n1800. Jefferson and Burr were the Democratic candidates for President\r\nand Vice-President. Each was voted for by all the Democratic\r\nelectors, giving them an equal number of votes and a majority of the\r\nelectoral college. This threw the election into the House of\r\nRepresentatives, which was Federalist but was compelled by the\r\nprovisions of the Constitution to decide between the two leading\r\ncandidates, Jefferson and Burr. Some of the Federalists were ready to\r\nstoop to any means for striking at Jefferson, the great representative\r\nof Democratic ideals. If the Federalists in Congress could have\r\neffected a combination with the Democrats from states where Burr was\r\ninfluential, they might have been able to elect Burr President instead\r\nof Jefferson. But the Democrats, even from New York, voted for\r\nJefferson, and it was evident that he must be chosen or there would be\r\nno election. Feeling in the country ran high, and there were threats\r\nof violence if the election of Jefferson should be defeated by\r\nintrigue.\r\n\r\nHamilton behaved on this occasion with the high sense of public duty\r\nwhich marked most of his acts. Familiar as he was with the\r\nunscrupulous methods and doubtful character of Burr in New York\r\npolitics, he felt that it would be criminal to put him in office. He\r\nhad little reason to love Jefferson, who had filled the ears of\r\nWashington with slurs against himself, but he felt that the election\r\nbelonged to Jefferson and that his defeat by a political intrigue\r\nwould be a greater menace than his election to the system established\r\nby the Constitution. With Bayard of Delaware, the Federalist leader in\r\nthe House, Hamilton threw himself strongly into the contest against\r\nBurr. His advice was not at first followed. The House ballotted from\r\nthe eleventh to the sixteenth of February without reaching a choice. A\r\ncaucus of the Federalists was then held; it appeared that Jefferson\r\nhad given some assurances of a conservative policy in office, the\r\nviews of Hamilton and Bayard prevailed, and on February 17, 1801, the\r\nFederalist members from several states withheld their votes, and\r\nJefferson was elected.\r\n\r\nThe retirement of the Federalists from power substantially ended the\r\npublic services of Hamilton. He continued to watch public events with\r\ninterest during the remaining five years of his life, and to be\r\nregarded as the leader of the Federalist party, but the party had\r\nshrunk to a corporal's guard in Congress and the long reign of the\r\nDemocratic party had begun, which was to be interrupted during only\r\ntwo presidential terms until the election of Lincoln in 1860.\r\nHamilton, therefore, at the age of forty-three, had completed his\r\nconstructive work and ceased to influence public affairs except by his\r\nwritings and speeches. It might almost be said that this work was done\r\nwith the close of the administration of Washington in 1797, and that\r\nhis great fame would have shone with brighter lustre if he had not\r\nlived to take part in the later differences and quarrels of the Adams\r\nadministration. His life was not without service, however, under\r\nAdams, since his influence over members of the cabinet several times\r\nrestrained rash policies, and between the conflicting passions of the\r\nchampions of France and of the friends of Great Britain, kept the ship\r\nof state steady upon a safe course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nHAMILTON'S DEATH AND CHARACTER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe death of Hamilton was in a peculiar sense a part of his public\r\ncareer. He had never hesitated to denounce in strong terms the public\r\ncareer and some of the private acts of Aaron Burr. The latter, after\r\nlosing the presidency, sought the governorship of New York, and\r\nentered into correspondence with the Federalist leaders in New England\r\nwith a view to the formation of a Northern confederacy. Hamilton\r\nsucceeded in dividing the Federalist vote in New York so as to give\r\nthe election to Lewis, Burr's democratic rival. Burr then determined\r\nto force a personal quarrel upon Hamilton in order to obtain revenge\r\nupon the man who had so often thwarted him. Hamilton had no desire to\r\nfight, but he did not feel able to repudiate the code of the duelist\r\nas it was then accepted among gentlemen.\r\n\r\nIt was on June 17, 1804, that Colonel Burr, through his intimate\r\nfriend Judge Van Ness, demanded an apology for a criticism by Hamilton\r\nwhich had reached Burr's ears. Several letters were exchanged before\r\nit became plain that Burr was bound to force a quarrel or to humiliate\r\nHamilton to a point which he knew would not be endured. When Burr's\r\ntrue purpose became plain to Hamilton, he requested a short time to\r\nclose up several important cases for his clients, which were then\r\npending in the circuit court. The circuit having terminated, Colonel\r\nBurr was informed (Friday, July 6, 1804) that Hamilton would be ready\r\nto meet him at any time after the following Sunday. Both men realized\r\nthat the meeting might be fatal, and prepared for it in a\r\ncharacteristic way. Burr, who because of his fascinating manners was a\r\ngreat favorite with women, destroyed the compromising letters which he\r\nhad received and devoted his spare hours to pistol practice. Hamilton\r\nhad fewer such letters to destroy, and was determined not to kill Burr\r\nif it could be avoided. He drew up his will, and prepared a statement\r\nof his reasons for fighting. This statement set forth that he was\r\nopposed to the practice of dueling and had done all that was\r\npracticable, even beyond the demands of a punctilious delicacy, to\r\nsecure an accommodation. He then said:--\r\n\r\n\"I have resolved, if our interview is conducted in the usual manner,\r\nand it pleases God to give me the opportunity, to reserve and throw\r\naway my first fire; and I have thought even of reserving my second,\r\nand thus giving a double opportunity to Colonel Burr to pause and\r\nrepent.\"\r\n\r\nThe arrangements for the duel were made on Monday, and on the\r\nfollowing Wednesday (July 11) the meeting took place at seven o'clock\r\nin the morning at Weehawken, three miles above Hoboken, on the west\r\nshore of the Hudson. Burr and Hamilton exchanged salutations, the\r\nseconds measured the distance, which was ten paces, and the parties\r\ntook their respective stations. At the first word, Burr fired.\r\nHamilton's weapon was discharged in the air, and he almost instantly\r\nfell, mortally wounded. The ball struck the second or third false rib,\r\nfractured it about the middle, passed through the liver and diaphragm,\r\nand lodged in the first or second lumbar vertebra. Hamilton was at\r\nfirst thought to be dead, but he revived when put on board the boat\r\nwhich was in waiting, and was able to utter a few words as he was\r\nborne towards his home. He died on the day after the meeting at two\r\no'clock in the afternoon. Even in his death he rendered a parting\r\nservice to his countrymen, by the revulsion of feeling which was\r\neverywhere aroused against the practice of dueling. The news of his\r\npremature taking off caused a wave of grief and indignation to spread\r\nover the country, differing from the chastened sorrow felt over the\r\ndeath of Washington, because Washington had met his end full of years\r\nand honors, and in the natural order of nature.\r\n\r\nThe concluding statement made by Hamilton in the paper which he left\r\nregarding his meeting with Burr gives some clue to his reasons for\r\nfighting. This paragraph ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"To those who, with me, abhorring the practice of dueling, may think\r\nthat I ought on no account to have added to the number of bad\r\nexamples, I answer that my relative situation, as well in public as\r\nprivate, enforcing all the considerations which constitute what men of\r\nthe world denominate honor, imposed on me (as I thought) a peculiar\r\nnecessity not to decline the call. The ability to be in future useful,\r\nwhether in resisting mischief or effecting good, in those crises of\r\nour public affairs which seem likely to happen would probably be\r\ninseparable from a conformity with public prejudice in this\r\nparticular.\"\r\n\r\nThis statement has been construed to mean that Hamilton looked forward\r\nto the time when the Constitution would be assailed by extremists and\r\nhe would be called by events to put himself at the head of a movement\r\nfor a stronger government, and perhaps even to lead an army. Several\r\npassages in his writings, especially after the downfall of the\r\nFederalists, gave color to the view that he feared an outbreak of\r\nJacobin violence in America, and the failure of the Constitution in\r\nsuch an event to resist the strain which would be put upon it. In a\r\nletter to Gouverneur Morris (February 27, 1802), he drops into the\r\nfollowing gloomy forebodings:--\r\n\r\n\"Mine is an odd destiny. Perhaps no man in the United States has\r\nsacrificed or done more for the present Constitution than myself; and,\r\ncontrary to all my anticipations of its fate, as you know, from the\r\nvery beginning, I am still laboring to prop the frail and worthless\r\nfabric. Yet I have the murmurs of its friends no less than the curses\r\nof its foes for my reward. What can I do better than withdraw from the\r\nscene? Every day proves to me more and more that this American world\r\nwas not made for me.\"\r\n\r\nThis mood of despondency was not the usual mood of Hamilton. Much as\r\nhe abhorred the sympathy with France shown by the Democrats and the\r\ntendency towards French ideas, his habitual temper was for combination\r\nand action rather than surrender. During the three years which\r\nfollowed the inauguration of Jefferson, he continued, though busy with\r\nhis law practice, to keep up in private life an active correspondence\r\nwith Federalist leaders throughout the country, and to advise earnest\r\nefforts to defeat Democratic policies. Only the day before the duel,\r\nin a letter to Sedgwick of Massachusetts, he indirectly condemned a\r\nproject which was on foot for a combination of the Northern States\r\ninto a separate confederacy. He said that \"dismemberment of our empire\r\nwill be a clear sacrifice of great positive advantages without any\r\ncounterbalancing good, administering no relief to our real disease,\r\nwhich is Democracy.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton had fears for the future of the Union under the Constitution\r\nwhich were much exaggerated by his leanings towards a strong,\r\nself-centred government like that of Great Britain. It is not\r\nunreasonable to believe that he felt that he might again be called\r\nupon to play a great part in politics as the leader of his party, and\r\nthat under the prejudices then prevailing he would weaken his\r\npersonal influence if he refused a challenge. The public man of that\r\nday who could be charged with cowardice or lack of regard for his\r\npersonal honor would suffer much with the masses, if not with the\r\nparty leaders, who understood his character and abilities. Hamilton\r\nhardly needed to prove his personal courage to any reasonable man\r\nafter his services in the Revolution, including his reckless charge\r\nupon the redoubt at Yorktown, but political foes might forget these\r\nevidences of his character if he should tamely submit to insult from a\r\npolitical opponent. It is doubtful whether his purpose in meeting Burr\r\nwent beyond this submission to the general prejudice in favor of\r\ndueling and the belief on his part that his position as a gentleman\r\nand a political leader required him to accept the challenge.\r\n\r\nThe high abilities and great services of Hamilton to the new Union\r\nhave been sufficiently set forth in these pages to make unnecessary\r\nany elaborate estimate of his character and attainments. His essential\r\nmerit was that of a constructive and organizing mind, which saw the\r\nopportunity for action and was equal to the opportunity. Hamilton was\r\ngoverned to a large extent by his intellect, but having reasoned out a\r\nproposition to be sound and wise, he rode resolutely to its\r\naccomplishment, taking little account of the obstacles in the way. He\r\nwas not a closet philosopher, pursuing abstract propositions to their\r\nsources, and searching, through the discordant threads of human\r\ndestiny, the ultimate principles of all things; but his mind was keen\r\nand alert in seizing upon reasoning which seemed obviously sound,\r\nlaboring in behalf of his convictions, and presenting them with force\r\nand simplicity to others. He found the career for which he was\r\npreëminently fitted in the organization of the financial system and\r\nthe consolidation of the Union, under the first administration of\r\nWashington. He was less fitted for the career of a politician in times\r\nless strenuous, or when tact and finesse were more useful in securing\r\nresults than clear reasoning and strong argument.\r\n\r\nHamilton was cut off when he had only recently resumed his\r\nprofessional career, but was making a distinguished record at the bar.\r\nAlways a great lawyer, he would soon have accumulated a fortune if he\r\nhad lived amid the tempting opportunities of to-day. As it was, his\r\nlegal fees were modest and his sudden death left large debts. He\r\nbequeathed the request to his sons that they should assume these debts\r\nif his estate was insufficient, but the gratitude of some of the\r\nwealthy Federalists relieved them of this filial obligation. Hamilton\r\nhad six sons, but most of them were already approaching a\r\nself-supporting age when he died. His oldest son had fallen a victim\r\nto the barbarous practice of dueling in a petty quarrel at a theatre\r\nthree years before the father's death. The fourth son, Mr. John C.\r\nHamilton, gave much time to the study of his father's career, and\r\nprepared the Life of Hamilton which has been the source of the later\r\nwork of historians. Hamilton's widow, the daughter of General\r\nSchuyler, survived until 1854, when she died at the age of\r\nninety-seven years and three months.\r\n\r\nAs a man in private life, Hamilton was loved and respected by those\r\nwho came closest to him, but it was as much by the qualities of his\r\nmind as by the special fascinations of his manner. He commanded the\r\nrespect and support of most of the leaders of his party, because they\r\nwere great enough to grasp and appreciate his reasoning, but he was\r\nnever the idol of the people to the same extent as many other leaders.\r\nHe would probably have made a great career in whatever direction he\r\nmight have turned his high abilities, but he was fortunate in finding\r\nan opportunity for their exercise in a crisis which enabled him to\r\nrender greater services to the country than have been rendered by\r\nalmost any man in her history, with the exception of Washington and\r\nLincoln.\r\n\r\n    The Riverside Press\r\n\r\n    _Electrotyped and printed by H.
