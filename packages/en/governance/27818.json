AUGUST, 1845. VOL. LVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON PUNISHMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to punish crime, and in so doing reform the criminal; how to uphold\r\nthe man as a terror to evil-doers, and yet at the same time be\r\nimplanting in him the seeds of a future more happy and prosperous\r\nlife--this is perhaps the most difficult problem of legislation. We are\r\nfar from despairing of some approximation to a solution, which is the\r\nutmost that can be looked for; but we are also convinced that even this\r\napproximation will not be presented to us by those who seem willing to\r\nblind themselves to the difficulties they have to contend with. Without,\r\ntherefore, assuming the air of opposition to the schemes of\r\nphilanthropic legislators, we would correct, so far as lies in our\r\npower, some of those misconceptions and oversights which energetic\r\nreformers are liable to fall into, whilst zealously bent on viewing\r\npunishment in its reformatory aspect.\r\n\r\nWe have selected for our comments the pamphlets of Captain Maconochie,\r\nnot only because they illustrate the hasty and illogical reasonings, the\r\nutter forgetfulness of elementary principles, into which such reformers\r\nare apt to lapse; but also for the still better reason, that they\r\ncontain a suggestion of real value; a contribution towards an efficient\r\nprison-discipline, which merits examination and an extensive trial. We\r\nhave added to these pamphlets a brief work of Zschokke's, the venerable\r\nhistorian of Switzerland, on death-punishment, in order that we might\r\nextend our observations over this topic also. It is evident that the\r\nquestion of capital punishment, and the various questions relating to\r\nprison discipline, embrace all that is either very interesting or very\r\nimportant in the prevailing discussions on penal legislation.\r\nTransportation forms no essentially distinct class of punishment, as the\r\ntransported convict differs from others in this only, that he has to\r\nendure his sentence of personal restraint and compulsory labour in a\r\nforeign climate.\r\n\r\nReformatory punishment! Alas, there is an incurable contradiction in the\r\nvery terms! Punishment is pain, is deprivation, despondency, affliction.\r\nBut, would you reform, you must apply kindness, and a measure of\r\nprosperity, and a greater measure still of hope. There is no genial\r\ninfluence in castigation. It may deter from the recommission of the\r\nidentical offence it visits, but no conversion, no renewal of the heart,\r\nwaits on its hostile presence; the disposition will remain the same,\r\nwith the addition of those angry sentiments which pain endured is sure\r\nto generate. No philosopher or divine of these days would invent a\r\npurgatory for the purifying of corrupted souls. No--he would say--your\r\npurgatory may be a place of preparation if you will, but _not_ for\r\nheaven. You may make devils there--nothing better; he must be already\r\ntwice a saint whom the smoke of your torments would not blacken to a\r\ndemon.\r\n\r\nWe may rest assured of this, that the actual infliction of the\r\npunishment must always be an evil, as well to mind as body--as well to\r\nsociety at large as to the culprit. If the threat alone could be\r\nconstantly efficacious--if the headlong obstinacy, the passion, and the\r\nobtuseness of men would not oblige, from time to time, the execution of\r\nthe penalty, for the very purpose of sustaining the efficacy of the\r\nthreat--all would be well, and penal laws might be in full harmony with\r\nthe best educational institutions, and the highest interests of\r\nhumanity. But the moment the law from a threat becomes an act, and the\r\nsentence goes forth, and the torture begins, a new but unavoidable train\r\nof evils encounters us. There is war implanted in the very bosom of\r\nsociety--hatred, and the giving and the sufferance of pain. And here, we\r\npresume, is to be found the reason of the proverbially severe laws of\r\nDraco, which, being instituted by a man of virtue and humanity, were yet\r\nsaid to have been written in blood: he desired that the threat should be\r\neffective, and that thus the evils of punishment, as well as of crime,\r\nshould be avoided.\r\n\r\nWhatever is to be effected towards the genuine reformation of the\r\nculprit, must be the result, not of the punishment itself, but of some\r\nadded ingredient, not of the essence of the punishment; as when hopes\r\nare held out of reward, or part remission of the penalty, on the\r\npractice of industry and a continuance of good behaviour.\r\n\r\nAnd yet--some one may here object--we correct a child, we punish it, and\r\nwe reform. The very word correction has the double meaning of penalty\r\nand amendment. If the plan succeeds so well with the infant, that he who\r\nspares the rod is supposed to spoil the child, why should it utterly\r\nfail with the adult? But mark the difference. You punish a child, and a\r\nshort while after you receive the little penitent back into your love;\r\nnay, you caress it into penitence; and the reconcilement is so sweet,\r\nthat the infant culprit never, perhaps, has his affections so keenly\r\nawakened as in these tearful moments of sorrow and forgiveness. The\r\nheart is softer than ever, and the sense of shame at having offended is\r\nkept sensitively alive. But if you withdrew your love--if, after\r\npunishment inflicted, you still kept an averted countenance--if no\r\nreconcilement were sought and fostered, there would be no reformation in\r\nyour chastisement. Between society and the adult culprit, this is\r\nexactly the case. Here the hostile parent strikes, but makes no after\r\noverture of kindness. The blow, and the bitterness of the blow, are left\r\nunhealed. Nothing is done to take away the sting of anger, to keep the\r\nheart tender to reproof, to prevent the growing callousness to shame,\r\nand the rising rebellion of the spirit. And here reveals itself, in all\r\nits force, another notorious difficulty with which the reformer of penal\r\ncodes has to contend.\r\n\r\nIn drawing the picture of the helpless condition of the convicted and\r\npunished criminal, how often and how justly does he allude to the\r\ncircumstance, that the reputation of the man is so damaged that honest\r\npeople are loath to employ him--that his return to an untainted life is\r\nalmost impossible--and that out of self-defence he is compelled to\r\nresort again to the same criminal enterprises for which he has already\r\nsuffered. Struck with this view, the reformer would institute a\r\npenitentiary of so effective a description, that the having passed\r\nthrough it would be even a testimonial of good character. But who sees\r\nnot that the infamy is of the very essence of the punishment? A good\r\ncharacter is the appropriate reward of the good citizen; if the criminal\r\ndoes not pay the forfeit of his character--if only a certain amount of\r\ntemporary inconvenience is to be sustained, the terror of punishment is\r\nat an end. Here, on the arena of public life, between society and the\r\nculprit, are they not manifestly incompatible--the tenderness that would\r\nreclaim, and the vigour that must chastise?\r\n\r\nThere is no question here, we must observe, of that delicate sense of\r\nshame which is the best preservative against every departure from\r\nrectitude. This has been worn out, and almost ceased to operate on the\r\nmajority of persons who expose themselves to the penal laws of their\r\ncountry. It is the value of character as a commercial commodity, as a\r\nrequisite for well-being, that alone has weight with them. Benevolent\r\nprojectors of reform, more benevolent than logical, are fond of\r\ncomparing a prison to an hospital; they contend that the inmates of\r\neither place are sent there to be cured, and that they should not be\r\nrestored to society until they are restored, the one to health of body,\r\nthe other to health of mind. Would they carry out the analogy to its\r\nfair completeness, and maintain that the patient from either hospital\r\nshould be remitted to society with a character equally free from stain?\r\nIs the man to be received by the community with the same compassionate\r\nwelcome who has gone into prison to be cured of a propensity to theft,\r\nas one who has entered an hospital to be relieved of a disease?\r\n\r\nAn hospital is a word of no inviting sound--and physic, no doubt, is\r\nsufficiently nauseous to be not inaptly compared to flogging, or any\r\nother punitive discipline: but nauseous drugs are not the only means of\r\ncure; good nursing, vigilant attendance, sometimes generous diet, have a\r\nlarge share in the curative process. And in the hospital of the mind,\r\nthe lenitive and fostering measures have a still larger share in the\r\nwork of a moral restoration. Were this principle of cure, of perfect\r\nrestoration, to be adopted as the first principle of penal legislation,\r\nit would come to this, that a poor man would have no better way of\r\nrecommending himself to the fatherly care of the state than by the\r\ncommission of a crime, and that none, in the lower classes of society,\r\nwould be so well trained and disciplined for advancing their fortunes in\r\nthe world, as those who commenced their career by violating the laws of\r\ntheir country.\r\n\r\nImprisonment, with its various accompaniments and modifications, is the\r\ngreat reformatory punishment. Indeed, with the exception of\r\ndeath--confined almost entirely to the case of murder--it is the only\r\npunishment bestowed on serious offences. Imprisonment of some kind,\r\neither at home or in the colonies, is the penal safeguard of society;\r\nand we must be cautious that we do not so far diminish its terrors, that\r\nit should cease to hold out any threat to a needy malefactor. But before\r\nwe allude to the discipline of the prison, we must take a glance at this\r\ngreat exception of death, which it is the object of many of our zealous\r\nreformers entirely to erase from the penal code.\r\n\r\nThat this extreme punishment should be reserved for the extreme crime of\r\nmurder, seems generally admitted; and the practice, if not the letter,\r\nof our law has conformed to this opinion. It would be useless,\r\ntherefore, to argue on the propriety of inflicting this penalty on other\r\nand less enormous offences. The question is narrowed to this--shall\r\ndeath continue to be the punishment of the murderer?\r\n\r\nThose who contend for the entire abolition of this punishment, are in\r\nthe habit of enlarging much on the inadequate effect produced upon the\r\nmultitude who witness the spectacle of an execution. This is their\r\nfavourite and most frequent theme. They seem to overlook the much more\r\npowerful effect produced on the imagination of that far greater\r\nmultitude who never behold, or are likely to behold, an execution. It is\r\ncurious to observe how pertinaciously a certain class of reasoners will\r\ndwell on the picture which a crowd presents at a public execution;--much\r\nlike a crowd, we may be sure, at any other public spectacle. Whatever\r\nthe object which gathers together a mob of the lowest class, they will\r\nsoon begin to relieve the tedium of expectation by coarse jests,\r\ndrunkenness, and brawling. Yet these descriptive logicians are never\r\nweary of painting to us the grotesque and disgusting scenes which the\r\nmass of spectators exhibit on these occasions, as if this were quite\r\ndecisive of the question. That ragged children, who have never thought\r\nof death at all, play their usual pranks at the foot of the\r\ngallows--that pickpockets ply their trade in this as in every other\r\ngaping crowd--what has all this to do with the impression produced on\r\nthe mind of every man and woman throughout the kingdom, by the knowledge\r\nthat if he, through sudden passion, or the instigations of cupidity,\r\ntake the life of a fellow-creature, he shall be--not a spectator at such\r\nan exhibition--but that solitary crawling wretch who, after having spent\r\nhis days and nights in agony and fear, is thrust forward, bound and\r\npinioned, to be hanged up there like a dog before the scoffing or\r\nyelling multitude?\r\n\r\nWe willingly concede that a public execution is not an edifying\r\nspectacle. The coarse minds who can endure, and who court it, are the\r\nlast to whom such a spectacle should be presented. And, although the\r\npunishment might lose some portion of its terrors, we should prefer that\r\nthe execution should take place in a more private manner; in the\r\ncourt-yard, for instance, of the prison, and before a selected number of\r\nwitnesses, partly consisting of official persons, as the sheriffs and\r\nmagistrates, and partly of a certain number of persons who might be\r\ntaken from the several jury lists--the option being given to them either\r\nto accept or decline this melancholy office. This would be a sufficient\r\npublicity to ensure an impartial administration of the laws. The only\r\ndoubt that remains is, whether it would be sufficient to prevent the\r\nspread of false rumours, and absurd suspicions, amongst the people. It\r\nis a prevailing tendency with the mob, whenever any one at all above\r\ntheir own condition is executed, to believe that he has been favoured\r\nand allowed to escape. Even in the face of the most public execution,\r\nsuch rumours are circulated. We understand that Mr Tawell is confidently\r\nreported to be living at this moment in America. Such suspicions,\r\nhowever ridiculous and absurd, must be cautiously guarded against.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the mode of execution is but of secondary importance; arrange\r\nit how you will, it is a lamentable business. Like all other\r\npunishments, and still more than all other punishments, the actual\r\ninfliction of it is an evil to society. When the law passes from the\r\nthreat to the execution, it is a social disaster. The main point is,\r\nthat we present to the imagination of every man a great threat--that of\r\nalmost immediate extermination--if he lift his hand against his\r\nneighbour's life.\r\n\r\nThat which renders the punishment of death peculiarly appropriate, in\r\nour estimation, in the crime of murder, is not by any means its\r\nretaliative character; the sentiment, that \"blood must have blood,\" is\r\none which we have no desire to foster; and if some less grievous penalty\r\nwould have the same effect in deterring from the crime, we should, of\r\ncourse, willingly adopt it. Our ground of approval is this, that it\r\npresents to the mind an antagonist idea most fit to encounter the\r\ntemptation to the crime. As this temptation must generally be great, and\r\noften sudden, that antagonist idea should be something capable of\r\nseizing upon the apprehension at once--of exercising at once all its\r\nrestraining efficacy. Imprisonment for length of years--the mind must\r\ncalculate and sum up the long list of pains and penalties included in\r\nthis threat, before its full import is perceived. But death! And then\r\nthe after-death! For what makes the punishment of death so singularly\r\napplicable to the case of murder is this, that it awakens whatever may\r\nexist of religious terror in the mind of him who contemplates the crime.\r\nOn the one hand, he is about to commit a deed on which there are not two\r\nopinions; it is not a crime made such by the laws; it is not even a\r\nrobbery, for which he may frame excuses out of his destitution, and the\r\nharsh distinctions of society; it is murder, which heaven and earth,\r\nrich and poor, equally denounce. On the other hand, his guilt will bring\r\nhim almost immediately before the tribunal of God, as well as the\r\njudgment-seat of man. No long interval weakens the impression, no long\r\nspace holds out the vague prospect of repentance and amendment, and\r\ncompensatory acts of goodness; but if he will lift the knife, if he\r\nwill mingle the poison, there is the earthly executioner at hand to\r\ntransfer him to the still more dreadful sentence of the after-world! The\r\nsame opinion which condemns the crime of murder here on earth, as the\r\nmost atrocious that can be committed, follows him to that other\r\ntribunal; and all that his imagination has been accustomed to depict of\r\nthe horrors of internal and eternal punishment, rushes at once upon him.\r\n\r\nWhen the temptation comes in the shape of sudden anger and impetuous\r\npassion, there is a threat as sudden to encounter it. When the crime is\r\nrevolved in the secret and guilty recesses of the mind--as when some\r\nindividual stands between the tempted man and the possession of a\r\nfortune, or some other great object of desire--there is religious terror\r\nas stealthy, as secret, as unconquerable, as the strongest desire that\r\ntakes possession of the human heart, to assist always at his\r\ndeliberations.\r\n\r\nM. Zschokke's little treatise, to which we have alluded, contains the\r\nusual, together with some unusual, arguments against the punishment of\r\ndeath, and contributes also a novel substitute for it. He begins, in\r\ntrue German manner, by explaining (_inter alia_) the difference between\r\nreason and understanding; the exact distinction between man and the rest\r\nof the animal creation; and some other metaphysical generalities, which,\r\nfortunately, are not concerned with the business in hand. For, as no two\r\nwriters agree in their explanations, and as none succeeds in perfectly\r\nsatisfying either his reader or himself, it would be impossible, if such\r\npreliminaries were first to be adjusted, ever to arrive at the\r\ndiscussion itself. The work is written in letters, addressed to a young\r\nprince; and, at the thirteenth letter--there are but sixteen in the\r\nwhole--he approaches his main question--\"Nun denn es sei zur sache!\"\r\n\"Now then to the matter.\" And first he protests that death is no\r\npunishment at all. The venerable historian absolutely flies to such\r\naphorisms as were the delight of Seneca, to prove that death is no evil,\r\nand can consequently be no punishment; although there are some who,\r\nunder the dominion of mere instinct, may deem it such. \"The death,\" he\r\nwrites, \"of the criminal is no punishment; but for him, as for every\r\nother mortal, only the end of earthly troubles, cares, and sufferings.\r\nIn vain,\" he continues, \"does the multitude of suicides show us daily\r\nthat death is no evil, and therefore no punishment; for the men who thus\r\nabridge their days manifestly prefer death to the endurance of the evils\r\nof life.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been said, that \"he who can look at death starts at no shadows.\"\r\nAnd certainly, reason on the matter how you will, and prove life to be\r\nas worthless as you please, if a man can defy death, and solicit it,\r\nthere is no other punishment that can be effective. It would be all but\r\nimpossible to prevent a criminal, if so resolved, from laying violent\r\nhands upon himself; and altogether impossible to prevent him from\r\ncontemplating suicide as his last resort in case of detection, and so\r\nnullifying the threat of any other punishment. There is no hold whatever\r\non the man in whom the love of life, or the fear of death, is really\r\nextinct. But we are far from thinking that Seneca and the Stoics have\r\nyet made so deep an impression on mankind that there is a very general\r\nindifference to death, especially to a death inflicted by others--the\r\nignominious sentence of the law.\r\n\r\nAgain, this author objects, as some others have done, to the punishment\r\nof death, because it is incapable of an adjustment to the degrees of\r\nguilt. What punishment is? Or how can any tribunal determine on degrees\r\nof moral guilt? It is not a criminal, it is a crime, that the law\r\npunishes. To determine between two thieves, which had the better motive,\r\nwhich had the least _of thief in him_, is not the function of a judge,\r\nnor could he perform it, if imposed upon him. It has been remarked by\r\nthose who have had wide opportunities of judging--and the annals of\r\ncriminal jurisprudence support the observation--that murderers, taken as\r\na class, are not, as men, the worst order of criminals. Some sudden\r\nimpulse, or some one obstinate desire, got the better of their reason;\r\nor it might happen, that the motive for committing a great crime was\r\nnot of so dark a dye as that which often induces to one of less\r\nturpitude. And yet neither our author, nor any one else, would hesitate\r\nto accord to the crime of murder the very severest penalty that stands\r\nupon the code.\r\n\r\nBut M. Zschokke's main argument against the reasonableness and justice\r\nof death-punishment is this, that every man has an original\r\nimprescriptible right, prior to, and in the face of all society--_to be\r\na man_--\"mensch zu sein\"--\"to develope himself as man.\" Society may\r\nlimit the exercise of this right, but not annul it; may mutilate the man\r\nas it thinks fit, but must leave so much of him behind as may bear the\r\nname of man. What is to be said of such metaphysical vagaries as these?\r\nIf this pass for reasoning, the unlawfulness of imprisonment may be\r\nproved in the same manner; one has but to assert that man has an _a\r\npriori_ indefeasible right to the use of the limbs which nature has\r\ngiven to him. But no man has any _right_ whatever, but under the implied\r\ncondition of performing corresponding _duties_. This individual, whom\r\nthe law will not any longer allow to develope his humanity, should, if\r\nhe had wished to develope himself further, have allowed the like liberty\r\nto others.\r\n\r\nBut that which most remarkably distinguishes M. Zschokke's little\r\nperformance is the substitute for the punishment of death which it\r\nsuggests. We believe it was here that M. Sue derived an idea which\r\noccupies so conspicuous a place in his _Mysteries of Paris_. That\r\nsubstitute is _blindness_. \"The blinded man,\" writes our author, \"is an\r\neternal prisoner, without need of prison walls. He must envy other\r\nculprits their chains--their darkest dungeons; for in the darkest\r\ndungeons hope may penetrate, and _they_ may one day see the light again.\r\nHe must envy the dead, on whom the executioner has done his utmost; for\r\nto him life itself has become one endless punishment. He is bound\r\nwithout fetters--bound more securely than if he were locked to the oar\r\nor welded to the rock. Every step, every movement, tells him of his\r\nweakness and of his guilt. The living world around him--he has lost it\r\nall; he retains only its sources of pain, and the unfading memory of his\r\nown crime. Scoffed at by the unfeeling, pitied by some, by all\r\nshunned--contempt and commiseration and scorn are the smarting scourges\r\nto which he stands defenceless for the residue of his days.\"\r\n\r\nA frightful punishment truly! But we are far from approving of it as a\r\nsubstitute for death. In the first place, it is equally irrevocable; and\r\nit is one, and perhaps the most cogent argument against\r\ndeath-punishment, that it admits of no recall in case of error, no\r\nremission or compensation in the event of sentence having been passed\r\nupon an innocent man. Our author, indeed, seems to think otherwise; for\r\nhe reckons it amongst the advantages of this mode of punishment, that it\r\ndoes admit of compensation if it has been unjustly inflicted. To us it\r\nseems very doubtful whether any pleasures addressed to the remaining\r\nsenses of hearing, of touch, or of taste, can be said to compensate for\r\nthe loss of sight. Neither does blindness, any more than death, admit of\r\ndegree or apportionment. In this respect, _burning_ or the use of fire\r\nas a punishment, which has been suggested, though not absolutely\r\nadvised, by Bentham, would have a decisive preference. \"Fire,\" writes\r\nthat voluminous jurist and legislator, \"may be employed as an instrument\r\nof punishment without occasioning death. This punishment is variable in\r\nits nature, through all the degrees of severity of which there can be\r\nany need. It would be necessary carefully to determine, on the test of\r\nthe law, the part of the body which ought to be exposed to the action of\r\nfire; the intensity of the fire; the time during which it ought to be\r\napplied; and the paraphernalia to be employed to increase the terror of\r\nthe punishment. In order to render the description more striking, a\r\nprint might be annexed, in which the operation should be\r\nrepresented.\"--(_Works_, vol. i. p. 407.)\r\n\r\nWhat is still more to the point, the punishment of blinding is quite as\r\nrepugnant to those sentiments of humanity which are said to be outraged\r\nby the depriving a fellow creature of his life. As we have before\r\nintimated, the spectacle of pain inflicted is at all times an evil in\r\nitself. Even the presence of those gloomy buildings, devoted to all the\r\nwretched purposes of incarceration, is, we should say, a public\r\ncalamity. The more men see of misery, the more callous do they become to\r\nit; the less effort do they make to relieve; the more ready are they to\r\ninflict it. Punishments should be multiplied as little as possible. Very\r\nslight offences had better be left to the correction of public opinion,\r\nand very grave offences should be severely visited, as well to spare\r\npunishment as to prevent crime. We at once admit that it is an evil--the\r\nspectacle of putting a man to death. But this of putting out his eyes\r\nis, in act, scarce less revolting, and the spectacle is perpetuated. The\r\npublic execution lasts his lifetime. There is something, too, from which\r\nwe recoil in associating what has hitherto been the most pitiful\r\naffliction of humanity with the idea of punishment of crime. A blind man\r\nwalks amongst us the universally commiserated--and good need he has of\r\nour commiseration; it would be a sore addition to his calamity to make\r\nhis condition one of suspected turpitude, and expose him to the hazard\r\nof being classed with murderers.\r\n\r\nWith respect to that greater _severity_ of the punishment, on which our\r\nauthor eloquently enlarges, the only severity which a legislature ought\r\nto seek is that which is available in the shape of _threat_; and no\r\nthreat can be more effective than that of taking from a man his life,\r\nsince he can always, in his own imagination, commute any other\r\npunishment into that. If it be true, on the one hand, that death is a\r\nmere privation, and not to be compared, in real severity, to very many\r\nof the positive afflictions of life; and if, on the other, it is still\r\nthe greatest threat which society can hold out--these two facts together\r\nwould go far to prove that it is the very best punishment which could be\r\ndevised.\r\n\r\nDismissing this exception of the punishment of death for the crime of\r\nmurder, _imprisonment_ at home or abroad, accompanied with hard labour,\r\nor periods of solitary confinement, is the sole threat of any moment\r\nwhich the law holds out against offenders; and it becomes, therefore, of\r\ninfinite importance to establish an effective prison discipline. We look\r\nupon this simplification of our penal operations as an advantage; and we\r\nare by no means disposed to favour those inventive gentlemen who would\r\ndevise new punishments, or revive old ones, for the purpose, it would\r\nseem, of having a variety of inflictions corresponding to the variety of\r\noffences. A well-regulated prison, where the severity of the taskwork,\r\nthe nature of the diet, the duration and the strictness of the\r\nconfinement, all admit of apportionment to the offence, seems to include\r\nall that is desirable in this matter of punishment. Here, if any where,\r\ncan plans of reformation be combined with penal inflictions. Such plans\r\nought, by all means, to be encouraged; but they are not--whatever\r\nCaptain Maconochie, and other zealous reformers, say to the\r\ncontrary--the first and peculiar object for which a prison is designed.\r\n\r\nCaptain Maconochie was for some time superintendent of Norfolk Island. A\r\nrough experience. But prison discipline must be much the same in its\r\nelements, in whatever part of the world it is carried on. We are not\r\nabout to enter into the variety of questions connected with\r\ntransportation, or the management of penal colonies. Wherever\r\nimprisonment or compulsory labour are to be undergone, the same class of\r\ndifficulties and dilemmas must arise; and we shall deal only with\r\nCaptain Maconochie's remarks, as they apply generally to all convicts,\r\nwhether transported or not.\r\n\r\nIt is quite curious to observe the unconscious pranks that men of sound\r\nunderstandings, but not philosophically disciplined, may be led into,\r\nwhen, from some favourite point of view, they suddenly rush into\r\ngeneralities, and proclaim as reasoning what is the dictate of a\r\nmomentary sentiment. Captain Maconochie, desirous of enlisting our\r\nsympathies in favour of his convicts, assimilates their condition to\r\nthat of the black slaves, whom the philanthropic efforts of Wilberforce,\r\nand others, succeeded in emancipating. The parallel is--to say the\r\nbest--very surprising and unexpected. Convicts in the colonies stand in\r\nthe same predicament, with regard to society, as their fellow-culprits\r\nat home; and the gallant Captain would hardly preach a crusade for the\r\nliberation of all the prisoners in England--for all who are undergoing\r\nthe discipline of our houses of correction. To be compelled to labour\r\nfor another man's advantage, and at another man's will, because one is\r\n\"guilty of a darker skin,\" and to be compelled to the like taskwork\r\nbecause one has committed burglary, are two very different things. Full\r\nof this happy comparison, however, Captain Maconochie proceeds--\"They\r\n(the blacks) were thus, in the main, merry, virtuous, and contented\r\nbeings; they did not advance--this their condition as slaves\r\nforbade--but neither did they recede; and whatever the influence of\r\ntheir condition on their own character, it ended nearly with themselves;\r\nthey were subjects, not agents, and no one was made materially worse\r\nthrough their means. In every one of these respects, convicts are\r\ndifferently, and far more unfavourably, circumstanced. True, they have\r\nsinned, which is often alleged as a reason for dealing with them more\r\nharshly; _but who has not sinned? Who will venture to say, or would be\r\nright if he did say, that, similarly born, educated, and tempted_, as\r\nmost of them have been, he would have stood where they have fallen? They\r\nare our brothers in a much nearer sense than were the negroes.\" Now, if\r\nlanguage such as this means any thing, the convict is a most maltreated\r\nperson, and should not have been punished at all. It is really the duty\r\nof sober sensible men to put their veto on such oratory as this; there\r\nis too much of the same kind abroad. We must all of us be ready to\r\nacknowledge, that if we had been \"born, educated, and tempted,\" as many\r\nof these felons, we too might have been felons. Does it follow that we\r\nought not to have received the punishment of felons? Is this sort of\r\n_argumentum ad hominem_, which makes the crime in imagination our own,\r\nto bribe us into an utterly ruinous indulgence towards it? Crime is not\r\npunished on earth--as divines teach us it will be punished in heaven--on\r\na principle of retributive justice, and according to our moral deserts.\r\nTo prove that this is not the principle of judicial punishment, we have\r\nonly to call to mind that, whereas, in a moral point of view, the force\r\nof temptation diminishes the guilt, men, in framing their laws,\r\ninvariably increase the punishment in proportion to the temptation. The\r\nfacility to commit a crime, is one great element in the temptation to\r\ncommit it; and this facility has been always considered (as in the case\r\nof forgery) to call for a counterbalance in the severity of the penalty.\r\n\r\nIn matters of penal legislation, there are two currents of thought,\r\nwhich must be always kept distinct. The one relates to the natural and\r\nlittle cultivated feelings of mankind, which demand retaliation for\r\ninjuries committed--a vindictive or retributive justice. Here is found\r\nthe rude motive power by and on which legislation has to work; sometimes\r\nshaping these feelings to its purposes, sometimes shaping its purposes\r\nto them. The other current of ideas is purely legislative, purely\r\nprospective, having for its sole end the well-being of society, and\r\nlooking on punishment; not as retributive, or vindictive, or as morally\r\ndue, but as a sad necessity for the preservation of order.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the latter and only legislative mode of thinking, how\r\nextremely illogical does it appear this attempt to ward off the penal\r\nblow from a guilty party, or to excite our commiseration for him on the\r\nground that we all share the same passions and frailties of that guilty\r\nparty! Why, if such passions and frailties were not general, there would\r\nbe little need of punishment. It is because they are general, that the\r\nlegislature is compelled to be so watchful and energetic. If to take the\r\nobject of desire from our neighbour were a rare propensity, an\r\nextraordinary phenomenon, we might let the prison sink into happy ruin,\r\nand a most cheerful desolation.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the German, in his metaphysical manner, disposed of the\r\nright of society to put one of its members to death; the Captain, though\r\nno metaphysician, proves, in a manner quite as bold and singular, that\r\nthe state has really no right to inflict any punishment that is not of a\r\nreformatory character. It is true he admits of punishment--could a man\r\nof his experience do otherwise? But he admits it only as a part of his\r\n_curative process_. It is to induce \"submission and penitence.\" He can\r\nso far blind himself by his love of theory, or rather his tenacity to\r\none point of view, that he seems to suppose, that _reform of the\r\ncriminal being the direct object_, he would commence his treatment by\r\npenal inflictions. \"As already observed, a fever must be reduced before\r\nits ravages are sought to be repaired; a wound must be probed and\r\ncleansed before it can be healed up.\" And this surgical instance seems\r\nto have satisfied his mind, that the exacerbations consequent on\r\npunishment are an indispensable preparation for a moral restoration. As\r\nto the old-fashioned notion that punishment has for its legitimate and\r\nprimary object to deter others from offending, he denounces this, if\r\npursued as an independent aim, as a flagrant injustice; he regards such\r\ncriminals who are punished for this end only, as sacrifices cruelly\r\noffered up for the benefit of the public.\r\n\r\n    \"In the infancy of society,\" reasons Captain Maconochie, \"and under\r\n    every form of pure despotism, the individual is nothing, and the\r\n    commonwealth, or its chief, every thing. But just as intelligence\r\n    and true knowledge of state policy extend, does this state of\r\n    things become reversed; and in England already, the maxim is become\r\n    almost universal, that private rights are never to be invaded\r\n    without compensation. In two departments only is there still a\r\n    systematic deviation from this rule in practice. Impressment, in\r\n    which the compensation made, though it has increased much of late\r\n    years, must still be considered inadequate--for otherwise the act\r\n    itself would be unnecessary; and the punishment of offenders with a\r\n    view to _example_ only, in which they have no concern, and to which\r\n    their individual interests are yet unhesitatingly sacrificed. In\r\n    both cases the same plea of state necessity is offered in\r\n    justification; but it will not do. As society advances, and\r\n    individuals become more sensible of their own worth, their claims\r\n    to regard above such abstractions become more and more\r\n    evident.\"--(_General Views_, &c., p. 11.)\r\n\r\nWe would modestly suggest that before this curious analogy can be made\r\ncomplete, government ought to press for hanging as well as the sea\r\nservice. If the sheriff and his bailiffs sallied forth, and seized upon\r\nsome hapless wight, thrust the king's money into his hand, and thus\r\nenlisted him into the hanging corps for the benefit of the community,\r\nthe resemblance would be perfect. But no one, not even the high-sheriff\r\nhimself, has the least desire to obtain a single recruit for this\r\nforlorn service; the members of which force themselves in a most\r\nunwelcome manner upon the state. Still less, if possible, does the\r\ngovernment desire to be at the expense of erecting large buildings, and\r\nmaintaining numerous garrisons of all species of felons. \"Banishment of\r\noffenders, with a view to example only, _in which they have no concern_,\r\nand to which their individual interests are yet unhesitatingly\r\nsacrificed!\" Indeed, but they have! He who is punished for theft has\r\nstill his life to be preserved, and may one day have his property also\r\nto be protected by the same law under which he is suffering. One can\r\nimagine the strange effect it would produce upon the ignoble army of\r\nmartyrs which throng our jails, to be told that they were sacrifices to\r\nsociety--victims whom the community was offering up, most unjustifiably,\r\non the altar of its own interests! At first, the idea would be a little\r\ndim and mysterious; but, after a short time, the flattering nature of\r\nthe doctrine would doubtless be sufficient to insure its reception. They\r\nwould, thereupon, call in the jailer, and the chief spokesman of the\r\nparty would thus address him:--\"We perceive, O jailer! that society is\r\nconsulting its own interests in our punishment, and not, as it is bound\r\nto do, our especial benefit and advantage. As we have learned that\r\nstripes and bondage are to be inflicted on no man but for his own good,\r\nand as we are all agreed, after considerable experience, that we derive\r\nno benefit whatever from them, and you, O jailer! must be satisfied\r\nthat, as medical treatment, they are worse than inefficacious, we\r\ndemand, in the name of justice and human reason, our immediate\r\ndismissal.\"\r\n\r\nTo those who value no information but such as assumes the shape of\r\ndetail of facts, or can be reduced to figures, and exhibited in the\r\nshape of statistical tables, we shall perhaps appear to be wasting time\r\nin examining the mere errors of _reasoning_ on this important subject of\r\npenal discipline. We think otherwise. We apprehend there is nothing more\r\nnecessary than to keep active and zealous men steady to first principles\r\nin subjects of great general interest. We are not guilty of underrating\r\nthe value of statistical tables; albeit we have seen figures arrayed\r\nagainst figures, as if there were two arithmetics, as if there were two\r\nchurches in the doctrines of addition and multiplication; but the truth\r\nmust be kept in view, that to read statistical tables aright, something\r\nmore is required than a knowledge of the rules of arithmetic. A few\r\nsound principles, based on a knowledge of human nature, and the\r\nelementary bonds of human society, may often preserve us from false\r\ndeductions, which seem to be the sure product of the array of figures\r\nthat are presented to us.\r\n\r\nWe intimated that Captain Maconochie's pamphlet contained what appeared\r\nto us a valuable contribution towards a good prison discipline. That\r\ncontribution is simply--the commutation of _time_ of imprisonment for\r\nquantity of _labour_ to be performed. The amount of work done by the\r\nprisoner could be estimated by certain _marks_ awarded or reckoned to\r\nhim, and the duration of imprisonment measured by the number of those\r\nmarks to be earned, instead of a certain fixed number of months or\r\nyears. This is a very simple idea, and is all the better for its\r\nsimplicity. The punishment would be probably rendered more effective as\r\na threat, and the moral effect of the punishment, when inflicted, would\r\nbe much improved. A compulsion to labour (which becomes, in fact, a\r\ncompulsion of moral motive, as well as of sheer external control) may\r\nlead to a permanent habit of industry. There would be all the difference\r\nbetween the listless and disgustful labour of enforced time-work, and a\r\nlabour in part prompted by the hope of expediting the term of release.\r\nAn idle vagabond might thus be disciplined and trained into an\r\nindustrious workman.\r\n\r\nWe have no doubt that this principle has already been partially applied\r\nin the management of our prisons, and perhaps in more instances than we\r\nat all suspect; but that it has not yet been extensively applied, or\r\nreceived the trial which it appears to merit, is certain--because such\r\nan experiment must have been preceded by a very notorious and signal\r\nalteration in our laws.\r\n\r\nWe should be doing an egregious injustice to Captain Maconochie if we\r\nwere to judge of him only by the instances we have given of his powers\r\nof general reasoning. The perusal of his pamphlets has left in our mind\r\na strong impression of the manly character and practical ability of\r\ntheir writer. If his abstract reasonings are sometimes perverse, we are\r\nconvinced that his practical good sense is such, that in the management\r\nof any enterprise, he would in reality so order his proceedings, that,\r\nwhatever his pen might do, his conduct would contradict no sound\r\nprinciple of expediency. If it were the object to reclaim a set of\r\nfelons or vagabonds, and fit them--say for the naval and military\r\nservice--we are persuaded that the task could not be confided to better\r\nhands than those of the gallant Captain. During his residence at Norfolk\r\nisland, he seems to have obtained the esteem of even the worst of the\r\nsad crew he had to discipline; and this, it is evident, without\r\nsacrificing a jot of the duties of his station. He is plainly not the\r\nman to make any boast of such a matter, or to feel too highly flattered\r\nby it. \"Instances of individual attachment to myself,\" he says, at the\r\nconclusion of his pamphlet _On the Management of Transported Convicts_,\r\n\"I could multiply without number; but these, for obvious reasons, I\r\nforbear to quote; and in truth they as often pained me as pleased me, by\r\nbeing too deferential. It is a great and very common mistake, in\r\nmanaging prisoners, to be too much gratified by mere obedience and\r\nservility: duplicity is much encouraged by this; and, of two opposite\r\nerrors, it is better rather to overlook a little occasional\r\ninsubordination. I cannot refuse, however, to cite two traits, whose\r\ncharacter cannot be mistaken. I had a large garden within a few hundred\r\nyards of the ticket-of-leave village at Cascade, where from 300 to 400\r\nmen lived, four to six in a hut, never locked up, nor under other guard\r\nthrough the night than that of a police sentry, one of their own number.\r\nThe garden was by the road-side, very imperfectly fenced with open\r\npaling, and fully stocked with choice fruit and vegetables, bananas,\r\npine-apples, grapes, melons, and others, which _to men on a salt ration_\r\nmust have offered a great temptation; these were constantly under view,\r\nyet I scarcely ever lost any. And by a letter, received a few weeks ago,\r\nI learn that five men, having picked up an old black silk handkerchief\r\nthat had belonged to me, have had their prayer books bound with it.\" [1]\r\n\r\nThe Captain's theoretical error is, that he too much confounds the\r\nnecessity of penal laws with the duty of public education. The duty of\r\nthe state to educate its subjects is undeniable; but, when criminals are\r\nbrought before it, this is not the duty which is then most prominent.\r\nThis is a duty which ought to have been performed before--it is a duty\r\nwhich ought not to be forgotten then; but there is another function\r\nwhich comes into operation, which is typified by the judge, not by the\r\nschoolmaster.\r\n\r\nWe observe that Captain Maconochie confirms, from his own experience,\r\nthe opinion already expressed by many others upon the policy of solitary\r\nconfinement. For a short period the effect is good; but, if prolonged,\r\nit leads either to stupid indifference or moroseness of temper, if it\r\ndoes not conduct even to insanity. It is, manifestly, an expedient to be\r\ncautiously used. We should, before any appeal to experience, and judging\r\nonly from the nature of the human mind, have confidently predicted this\r\nresult. And, indeed, has not the effect of solitary confinement been\r\nlong ago understood and powerfully described? In that delightful tale of\r\nthe Arabian Nights, where the poor fisherman draws up a jar from the\r\nbottom of the sea, and, on opening it, gives escape to a confined spirit\r\nor genie, this monster of ingratitude immediately draws a huge sabre,\r\nwith the intention of decapitating his deliverer. Some parley ensues;\r\nand the genie explains that he is only about to fulfil a vow that he had\r\nmade while incarcerated in the jar--that, during the first thousand\r\nyears of his imprisonment--and, to an immortal genie, a thousand years\r\nmay reckon as about two calendar months with us--he promised to his\r\ndeliverer all imaginable blessings; but, during the second thousand\r\nyears, he vowed that he would _kill_ the man who should release him!\r\nCould there possibly be a better illustration of the effect of solitary\r\nconfinement?\r\n\r\nBut on the peculiar modifications of prison discipline, it is not our\r\npurpose here to enlarge. This must be reserved to some future occasion.\r\nWe must content ourselves with observing, that we have little confidence\r\nin novelties, and little wish to prompt the invention of our legislators\r\nin this direction. We are as little disposed to advocate the silent as\r\nthe solitary system. Such a demeanour as any reflective man would\r\nnaturally expect to find in a place of public correction, is all that we\r\nshould require to be preserved. All boisterous mirth, all obstreperous\r\nlaughter, all loud talking, would, by every efficient governor of such\r\nan institution, be systematically repressed. The labours of such an\r\nestablishment should be conducted with stern military order. Every\r\ninmate should feel himself under an irresistible domination, and that\r\nobedience and submission are the only parts he has to enact. How easily\r\nthe strongest minds may be led astray when scope is given to invention\r\nin this matter of penal discipline, may be seen in the example of Jeremy\r\nBentham himself. This celebrated man, whose cogitative faculty was\r\nassuredly of the most vigorous description, but who had a mode of\r\ndeveloping it the most insufferably and needlessly prolix, would have\r\nfilled our prisons with inextinguishable laughter by the introduction of\r\ncertain \"tragic masks,\" indicative of various crimes or passions, in\r\nwhich the several offenders were to be occasionally paraded--a quaint\r\ndevice, which would have given a carnival to our jails.\r\n\r\nOur main purpose, in these somewhat fragmentary observations, was to\r\nprotest against the reasoning which would divest punishment of its\r\nproper and distinctive character, which, spreading about weak and\r\neffeminate scruples, would paralyse the arm which bears the sword of\r\njustice. One writer would impugn the right of society to put its\r\narch-criminals to death; another controverts its right to inflict any\r\npenalty whatever, which has not for its direct object the reformation of\r\nthe criminal. So, then, the offender who will not live with his\r\nfellow-men on the only terms on which human fellowship can be\r\nmaintained, is to stand out and bandy logic with the community--with\r\nmankind--and insist upon his individual imprescriptible rights. These _a\r\npriori_ gentry would find it very difficult to draw any advantage from\r\ntheir imprescriptible rights, except in a state of tolerable civil\r\ngovernment. Civil government is, at all events, the condition on which\r\ndepends the enjoyment of all individual rights; without which they are\r\nbut shadows and abstractions, if even intelligible abstractions. Let us\r\nhave no more, therefore, of an opposition between the rights of\r\nindividuals and the stern, imperative, expediencies of society. There\r\ncan be no such opposition. Is it not as if some particular wave of the\r\nsea should assert a law of motion of its own, and think it injustice to\r\nsubmit to the great tidal movements of the ocean?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nZSCHOKKE'S _Aehrenlese.--Part I.

SHAW, B.A. OF\r\nCAMBRIDGE, ADJUNCT PROFESSOR OF ENGLISH LITERATURE IN THE IMPERIAL\r\nALEXANDER LYCEUM, TRANSLATOR OF \"THE HERETIC,\" &C. &C.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe trust our readers will not blame us for the slightness of\r\nconstruction and unimportant subjects of many of the minor pieces which\r\nwe have admitted into our present selection from Pushkin's lyrical\r\nproductions. It was our object to give the English reader, as far as\r\npossible, a fair and just notion of the poet's peculiar turn of thought\r\nand style of expression; and to do this completely, it appeared to us\r\nindispensable to avoid confining our choice--however natural it might\r\nhave seemed, and however great the temptation to do so--to the more\r\nambitious and elaborate efforts of his genius. The true principles of\r\ncriticism have long ago established the doctrine, that the composition\r\nof a beautiful song, or even of a perfect epigram, deserves to be\r\nconsidered as difficult a task, and as rare an achievement, as the\r\nproduction of an ode or of an elegy; and though it may be objected that,\r\nfor the purposes of _translation_, the song is generally much more\r\nungrateful than the more imposing production, yet we could not consider\r\nourselves as fulfilling our promise, (of holding up to our countrymen a\r\nfaithful mirror of Pushkin's poetry,) had we omitted to attempt versions\r\nof the slighter and more delicate products of his poesy. It is true\r\nthat, in passing through the deteriorating process of translation into\r\nanother language, the lighter works suffer most, and are more likely to\r\nlose that exquisite delicacy of expression, and that transparent\r\ncolouring of thought, which is the more peculiar merit of the song or\r\nthe fugitive poem--these tender blossoms run much more risk of losing,\r\nin short, their finer and more evanescent aroma, than the more gorgeous\r\nflowers of the tropical regions of poetical imagining; but at the same\r\ntime it must be remarked, that the danger in such experiments is not on\r\nthe side of the _author_, but wholly on that of the _translator_. That\r\nwe have determined--rashly, perhaps--to encounter this danger, must be\r\nour apology for having introduced into our collection many of the\r\nshorter and slighter pieces which will be found in these pages, and,\r\namong them, the specimen which we are now about to present.\r\n\r\n  \"ALAS FOR HER! WHY IS SHE SHINING?\"\r\n\r\n  Alas for her! why is she shining\r\n  In soft and momentary bloom?\r\n  Yet all the while in secret pining\r\n  'Mid youth's gay pride and first perfume ...\r\n  She fades! To her it is not given\r\n  Long o'er life's paths in joy to roam,\r\n  Or long to make an earthly heaven\r\n  In the calm precincts of her home;\r\n  Our daily converse to enlighten\r\n  With playful sense, with charming wile,\r\n  The sufferer's woe-worn brow to brighten\r\n  With the reflection of her smile.\r\n  Now that black thoughts around me darken,\r\n  I veil my grief with steady will,\r\n  To her sweet voice I haste to hearken,--\r\n  To hearken: and to gaze my fill.\r\n  I gaze, I hearken yet, and never\r\n  Shall voice or form from me depart;\r\n  Nought but our parting hour can ever\r\n  Wake fear or anguish in my heart.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the following spirited little piece Pushkin has commemorated an\r\nincident which occurred in the reign of Peter the Great, and which is\r\nprobably sufficiently familiar to the readers of Russian history, to\r\nrender unnecessary a more than passing allusion to the circumstance.\r\nAmong the thousand traits of grandeur recorded of the Hero-Tsar, there\r\nare few more affecting and sublime than that commemorated in the\r\nanecdote of his indulgence to Menstchikoff, who had betrayed his\r\nmaster's confidence, and committed various acts of peculation and\r\noppression. Peter pardoned his unfaithful but repentant minister, and\r\ncelebrated this act of generous clemency by a magnificent banquet, at\r\nwhich he exhibited to his admiral every testimony of renewed confidence\r\nand affection. This banquet is the subject of the following lines, in\r\nwhich all the allusions are probably familiar to our readers, not\r\nexcepting the mention made of the imposing ceremony spoken of in the\r\nthird stanza; that is to say, the grand review of the infant Russian\r\nfleet, at which the Emperor assisted in person, and in the rank of\r\nVice-Admiral. The whole squadron--recently created by the genius and\r\nwisdom of the Prince, and freshly covered with naval glory, till then\r\nunknown in Russia--was anchored in the Neva, and along its line slowly\r\npassed, under a general salute of cannon, and accompanied by the\r\nacclamations of the crews of the men-of-war, the old pleasure-boat, the\r\n\"baubling shallop,\" which had first suggested to Peter's mind the idea\r\nand the possibility of giving Russia a navy. This small vessel, still\r\nmost religiously preserved in the fortress, and affectionately called by\r\nthe Russians the \"Grandfather\" of their navy, had been constructed for\r\nthe amusement of the Tsar Alexei, by Brandt, a Dutch shipbuilder, who\r\nhad visited Moscow during the reign of that prince--the father of the\r\ngreat regenerator of Russia. The vessel, a small sloop rigged in the\r\nDutch manner, had remained neglected on the lake of Pereslav-Zalevskii\r\n(in the province of Vladimir) till it was remarked by Peter, who, from\r\nseeing it, not only conceived the idea of creating a navy, but made it\r\nthe means of acquiring for himself the first rudiments of practical\r\nseamanship. As _a ship_ in the Russian language is a _masculine_\r\nsubstantive, the familiar title given to this immortal little vessel is\r\n\"grandfather,\" or \"grandsire,\" a word of which we have thought it\r\nnecessary to transpose the gender, in obedience to that poetical and\r\nstriking idiom in our tongue, by which a ship always rigorously\r\nappertains to the gentler and lovelier sex. In our version, therefore,\r\nthe \"grandsire\" becomes--we trust without any loss of dignity or\r\ninterest--the \"grandame\" of the Russian navy:--\r\n\r\n  THE FEAST OF PETER THE FIRST.\r\n\r\n  O'er the Neva gaily dancing,\r\n  Flag and pennant flutter fair;\r\n  From the boats, in line advancing,\r\n  Oars-men's chorus fills the air.\r\n  Loud and joyous guests assembling,\r\n  Throng the palace of the Tsar;\r\n  And to cannon-crash is trembling\r\n  All the Neva from afar.\r\n\r\n  Wherefore feasts our Tsar of Wonders?\r\n  Why is Petersburg so gay?\r\n  Why those shouts and cannon-thunders,\r\n  And the fleet in war array?\r\n  Is new glory dawning o'er ye,\r\n  Russia's Eagle, Russia's Sword?\r\n  Has the stern Swede fled before ye?\r\n  Has the foe for peace implored?\r\n\r\n  Is it Brandt's slight boat, appearing\r\n  On the shore that _was_ the Swede's?\r\n  Through our young fleet proudly steering\r\n  Like a _grandame_ she proceeds.\r\n  They, her giant-brood, seem kneeling\r\n  'Fore their grandame--black and grim;\r\n  And to Science' name are pealing\r\n  Cannon-crash and choral hymn.\r\n\r\n  Is't Poltava, red and glorious,\r\n  That he feasts--the Lord of War?\r\n  When his Empire's life, victorious,\r\n  Saved from Charles the Russian Tsar?\r\n  Greet they Catharine's saint, those thunders?\r\n  Hath she given a Prince to life?\r\n  Of our Giant-Tsar of Wonders,\r\n  She, the raven-tressed wife?\r\n\r\n  No! a Subject's crime remitting,\r\n  To the guilty, guilt he sinks;\r\n  By a Subject's side he's sitting,\r\n  From a Subject's cup he drinks:\r\n  And his brow he kisses, smiling,\r\n  Gay of heart, and bright of eye;\r\n  And he feasts a Reconciling\r\n  Like some mighty Victory.\r\n\r\n  Hence those shouts of joy and wonder;\r\n  Hence is Petersburg so gay;\r\n  Hence the songs and cannon-thunder,\r\n  And the fleet in war array;\r\n  Hence the guests in joy assembling;\r\n  Hence the full cup of the Tsar;\r\n  Hence, with cannon-crash, is trembling\r\n  All the Neva from afar.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following lines (which are not without a kind of fantastic\r\nprettiness of their own) do not seen to need any remark or explanation,\r\nunless it be the circumstance of the poet's qualifying the sky of St\r\nPetersburg with the epithet of _pale-green_. It may be observed that\r\nthis peculiar tint (exactly enough expressed by the adjective) has\r\nstruck almost all the strangers who have visited the northern capital,\r\nand has been repeatedly noticed by travellers; as, for instance, Kohl,\r\nCustine, &c. &c. Our readers will find the singular colour of the St\r\nPetersburg atmosphere (particularly observable in the winter, or at\r\nnight) very well described in Sir George Lefevre's amusing \"Notes of a\r\nTravelling Physician.\" This greenish tint is as peculiar to the banks of\r\nthe Neva, as is the reddish-black to the neighbourhood of Birmingham or\r\nthe Potteries; or the yellowish-brown (in November--\"let rude ears be\r\nabsent!\") to the environs of the Thames:--\r\n\r\n  \"TOWN OF STARVING, TOWN OF SPLENDOUR!\"\r\n\r\n  Town of starving, town of splendour,\r\n  Dulness, pride, and slavery;\r\n  Skyey vault of pale-green tender,\r\n  Cold, and granite, and _ennui_!\r\n  With a pang, I say adieu t'ye\r\n  With a pang, though slight--for there\r\n  Trips the foot of _one_ young beauty,\r\n  Waves _one_ tress of golden hair.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the short and rapid sketch of Pushkin's life and writings which will\r\nbe found prefixed to this selection, we made particular mention of the\r\nstrong impression produced upon the Russian public by the appearance of\r\nthe noble lines addressed to the _Sea_. We beg to subjoin a translation\r\nof this short but vigorous poem, which has become classical in the\r\nauthor's country; an honour it certainly deserves, not only from the\r\nsimple grace and energy of the language, but from the weight, dignity,\r\nand verity of the thoughts. The lines were written by the poet on his\r\nquitting the shores of the Caspian, where he had so long dwelt in\r\nsolitude, gathering inspiration from the sublime Nature by which he was\r\nsurrounded; and the poem cannot but be considered as a worthy outpouring\r\nof the feelings which a long communion with that Nature was so capable\r\nof communicating to a mind like that of Pushkin. Of the two great men\r\nwhose recent death was naturally recalled to the poet's recollection by\r\nthe view of the ocean, the name of one--Napoleon--is specifically\r\nmentioned; that of the other is--Byron. Seldom, in the prosecution of\r\nhis difficult but not ungrateful task, has the translator felt the\r\nimperfection of his art, or the arduous nature of its object, more\r\nkeenly than when attempting to give something like an adequate version\r\nof the eleventh and twelfth stanzas of this majestic composition. In\r\norder to give some idea of the fidelity of his imitation, we will\r\nsubjoin the literal English of these eight lines:--\r\n\r\n  He vanish'd, wept by liberty,\r\n  Leaving to the world his crown.\r\n  Roar, swell with storm-weather;\r\n  He was, O sea, thy bard!\r\n  Thine image was stamp'd upon him,\r\n  He was created in thy spirit;\r\n  Like thee, mighty, deep, and gloomy,\r\n  Like thee, untameable!\r\n\r\n  TO THE SEA.\r\n\r\n  Farewell, free sky, and thou, O Ocean!\r\n  For the last time, before my sight\r\n  Roll thy blue waves in ceaseless motion,\r\n  And shine with a triumphant light!\r\n\r\n  Like friend's farewell in parting hour,\r\n  And mournful as his whisper'd word,\r\n  Thy solemn roar--that voice of power--\r\n  Now for the last time I have heard.\r\n\r\n  Bound of my spirit's aspiration!\r\n  How often on thy shore, O Sea!\r\n  I've roved in gloomy meditation,\r\n  Tired with my mighty ministry!\r\n\r\n  Thine echoes--oh, how I have loved them!\r\n  Dread sounds--the voices of the Deep!\r\n  Thy waves--or rock'd in sunset sleep,\r\n  Or when the tempest-blast had moved them!\r\n\r\n  The fisher's peaceful sail may glide--\r\n  If such thy will--in safety gleaming,\r\n  Mid thy dark surges rolling wide;\r\n  But thou awak'st in sportful seeming--\r\n  And navies perish in thy tide!\r\n\r\n  How oft was mock'd my wild endeavour\r\n  To leave the dull unmoving strand,\r\n  To hail thee, Sea; to leave thee never,\r\n  And o'er thy foam to guide for ever\r\n  My course, with free poetic hand.\r\n\r\n  Thou calledst ... but a chain was round me;\r\n  In vain my soul its fetters tore;\r\n  A mighty passion-spell had bound me,\r\n  And I remain'd upon thy shore.\r\n\r\n  Wherever o'er thy billows lonely\r\n  I might direct my careless prow,\r\n  Amid thy waste _one_ object only\r\n  Would strike with awe my spirit now;\r\n\r\n  One rock ... the sepulchre of glory ...\r\n  There sleep the echoes that are gone,\r\n  The echoes of a mighty story;\r\n  There pined and died Napoleon.\r\n\r\n  There pined he, lone and broken-hearted.\r\n  And after, like a storm-blast, then\r\n  _Another_ Mighty One departed,\r\n  Another Ruler among Men.\r\n\r\n  He vanish'd from among us--leaving\r\n  His laurels, Freedom, unto thee!\r\n  Roar, Ocean; swell-with tempest-grieving;\r\n  He was thy chosen bard, O sea!\r\n\r\n  Thine echoes in his voice resounded\r\n  Thy gloom upon his brow was shed,\r\n  Like thee, his soul was deep, unbounded,\r\n  Like thee 'twas mighty, dark, and dread.\r\n\r\n  The earth is empty now,   *       *\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Farewell, then, Sea! Before me gleaming\r\n  Oft wilt thou float in sunny pride,\r\n  And often shall I hear in dreaming\r\n  Thy resonance, at evening-tide.\r\n\r\n  And I shall bear, to inland meadows\r\n  To the still woods, and silent caves,\r\n  Thy rocks, thy cliffs, thy lights, thy shadows,\r\n  And all the language of the waves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following lines we think elegantly and prettily expressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ECHO.\r\n\r\n  To roar of beast in wild-wood still,\r\n  To thunder-roll, to bugle-trill,\r\n  To maiden singing on the hill,\r\n    To every sound\r\n  Thy voice, responsive, straight doth fill\r\n    The air around.\r\n\r\n  Thou hearkenest when the storm-blasts blow,\r\n  To thunder peal, to billow's flow,\r\n  And shepherd's call from hamlet low,\r\n    Replying straight;\r\n  But _thee_ nought answers ... Even so,\r\n    Poet, thy fate!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are few things more curious than to observe how universally the\r\nsame legends are to be found in the popular traditions of very distant\r\nages and nations, under circumstances which render it extremely\r\ndifficult for the most acute investigator to trace how, when, and where\r\nthey were communicated, or even to give any plausible account of the\r\norigin of the legend itself. So difficult indeed is this task, that we\r\nare almost driven to account for so singular a phenomenon, by\r\nattributing to the human mind an exceedingly small endowment of\r\noriginality; and by supposing that, however the details of these ancient\r\ntraditions may have been modified and adapted to suit the peculiar\r\nnature, the scenery of each particular country, or the manners, customs,\r\nand character of its inhabitants--the fundamental idea, and the leading\r\nincident, remaining the same under the most dissimilar conditions of\r\ntime and place, must have a common and a single origin. This doctrine,\r\nif carried to its legitimate consequences, would lead us to consider the\r\nnumber of the original legends common to all times and many races, as\r\nsingularly limited; and that a very short list indeed might be made to\r\nembrace the _root-stories_--the _uhrsagen_, as a German might call them.\r\nAnd really when we reflect that many of the most threadbare jests which\r\nfigure in the recondite tomes of Mr Joseph Miller are to be found,\r\ncrystallized in attic salt, in the pages of Hierocles, and represented\r\nas forming part of the \"Hundred merye Talis and Jeastis\" which\r\ndelectated the citizens of ancient Greece; when we reflect, we repeat,\r\nthat the same buffooneries, still retailed by after-dinner cits in the\r\nSunday shades of Clapham or Camden-Town, may have raised the easy laugh\r\nof the merry Greek beneath the portico and in the Agora; it makes us\r\nentertain a very humble idea respecting the amount of creative power\r\ngiven to man, even for the production of so small a matter as a\r\npleasantry, not to speak of pleasantries so very small as some of these\r\nmysterious and time-honoured jokes. If we remember, still further, that\r\nthe pedigree of these trifling insects of the brain, these children of\r\nthe quip, does not stop even in the venerable pages of Hierocles--that\r\nGreek \"Joe\"--but loses itself, like a Welsh genealogy in the darkest\r\ngloom of antiquity, we ought not to be surprised that ancient legends,\r\nbeing often shattered fragments and dim shadowings-forth of mystic and\r\nhierophantic philosophy, should be found, with many of their principal\r\nfeatures unaltered, in the popular traditions of different ages and\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe tale embodied in the \"Lay of Oleg the Wise,\" is identical in all its\r\nessentials with the legend still extant upon the tomb of an ancient\r\nKentish family, in the church of (we believe) Minster, in the Isle of\r\nSheppey. The inimitable Ingoldsby has made the adventure the subject of\r\none of his charming \"Legends,\" and has shown how the Knight came by his\r\ndeath in consequence of wounding his foot in the act of contemptuously\r\nkicking the fatal horse's skull, thus accomplishing the prophecy many\r\nyears after the death of the faithful steed. The reader will perceive,\r\nthat in the Russian form of the legend the hero dies by the bite of a\r\nserpent, and not by the less imposing consequences of mortification in\r\nthe toe; but the identity of the leading idea in the two versions of the\r\nold tale, is too striking not to be remarked. It is only necessary to\r\nobserve that Oleg is still one of the popular heroes of Russian\r\nlegendary lore, and that the feast, to which allusion is made at the end\r\nof the poem, is the funeral banquet customary among the ancient Slavons\r\nat the burial of their heroes; and resembling the funeral games of the\r\nheroic age in Greece. The Slavonians, however, had the habit, on such\r\noccasions, of sacrificing a horse over the tumulus or barrow of the\r\ndeparted brave. The _Perun_ mentioned in the stanzas was the War-God of\r\nthis ancient people.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE LAY OF THE WISE OLEG.\r\n\r\n  Wise Oleg to the war he hath bouned him again,\r\n        The Khozars have awaken'd his ire;\r\n  For rapine and raid, hamlet, city, and plain\r\n        Are devoted to falchion and fire.\r\n  In mail of Byzance, girt with many a good spear,\r\n  The Prince pricks along on his faithful destrere.\r\n\r\n  From the darksome fir-forest, to meet that array,\r\n        Forth paces a gray-haired magician:\r\n  To none but Perun did that sorcerer pray,\r\n        Fulfilling the prophet's dread mission:\r\n  His life he had wasted in penance and pain:--\r\n  And beside that enchanter Oleg drew his rein.\r\n\r\n  \"Now rede me, enchanter, beloved of Perun,\r\n        The good and the ill that's before me;\r\n  Shall I soon give my neighbour-foes triumph, and soon\r\n        Shall the earth of the grave be piled o'er me?\r\n  Unfold all the truth; fear me not; and for meed,\r\n  Choose among them--I give thee my best battle-steed.\"\r\n\r\n  \"O, enchanters they care not for prince or for peer,\r\n        And gifts are but needlessly given;\r\n  The wise tongue ne'er stumbleth for falsehood or fear,\r\n        'Tis the friend of the councils of Heaven!\r\n  The years of the future are clouded and dark,\r\n  Yet on thy fair forehead thy fate I can mark:\r\n\r\n  \"Remember now firmly the words of my tongue;\r\n        For the chief finds a rapture in glory:\r\n  On the gate of Byzantium thy buckler is hung,\r\n        Thy name shall be deathless in story;\r\n  Wild waves and broad kingdoms thy sceptre obey,\r\n  And the foe sees with envy so boundless a sway:\r\n\r\n  \"And the blue sea, uplifting its treacherous wave,\r\n        In its wrath--in the hurricane-hour--\r\n  And the knife of the coward, the sword of the brave,\r\n        To slay thee shall never have power:\r\n  Within thy strong harness no wound shalt thou know,\r\n  For a guardian unseen shall defend thee below.\r\n\r\n  \"Thy steed fears not labour, nor danger, nor pain,\r\n        His lord's lightest accent he heareth,\r\n  Now still, though the arrows fall round him like rain,\r\n        Now o'er the red field he careereth;\r\n  He fears not the winter, he fears not to bleed--\r\n  Yet thy death-wound shall come from thy good battle-steed!\"\r\n\r\n  Oleg smiled a moment, but yet on his brow,\r\n        And lip, thought and sorrow were blended:\r\n  In silence he bent on his saddle, and slow\r\n        The Prince from his courser descended;\r\n  And as though from a friend he were parting with pain,\r\n  He strokes his broad neck and his dark flowing mane.\r\n\r\n  \"Farewell then, my comrade, fleet, faithful, and bold!\r\n        We must part--such is Destiny's power:\r\n  Now rest thee--I swear, in thy stirrup of gold\r\n        No foot shall e'er rest, from this hour.\r\n  Farewell!

The gloom of the despondency\r\nexpressed in the lines is certainly Byronian--and haply \"something\r\nmore.\" It is to be hoped, however, that they may find favour in the eyes\r\nof the English reader--always so \"novitatis avidus,\"--if only on the\r\nscore of the singularity of the versification:--\r\n\r\n  REMEMBRANCE.\r\n\r\n  When for the sons of men is stilled the day's turmoil,\r\n      And on the dumb streets of the city\r\n  With half-transparent shade sinks Night, the friend of Toil--\r\n      And Sleep--calm as the tear of Pity;\r\n  Oh, then, how drag they on, how silent, and how slow,\r\n      The lonely vigil-hours tormenting;\r\n  How sear they then my soul, those serpent fangs of woe,\r\n      Fangs of heart-serpents unrelenting!\r\n  Then burn my dreams: in care my soul is drown'd and dead,\r\n      Black, heavy thoughts come thronging o'er me;\r\n  Remembrance then unfolds, with finger slow and dread,\r\n      Her long and doomful scroll before me.\r\n  Then reading those dark lines, with shame, remorse, and fear,\r\n      I curse and tremble as I trace them,\r\n  Though bitter be my cry, though bitter be my tear,\r\n      Those lines--I never shall efface them:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is another little composition in the same key.\r\n\r\n  \"I HAVE OUTLIVED THE HOPES THAT CHARM'D ME.\"\r\n\r\n  I have outlived the hopes that charm'd me,\r\n  The dreams that once my heart could bless!\r\n  'Gainst coming agonies I've arm'd me,\r\n  Fruits of the spirit's loneliness.\r\n\r\n  My rosy wreath is rent and faded\r\n  By cruel Fate's sirocco-breath!\r\n  Lonely I live, and sad, and jaded,\r\n  And wait, and wait--to welcome death!\r\n\r\n  Thus, in the chilly tempest shivering,\r\n  When Winter sings his song of grief,\r\n  Lone on the bough, and feebly quivering,\r\n  Trembles the last belated leaf.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following is a somewhat new version of the famous \"E pur si muove\"\r\nof Galileo.\r\n\r\n  MOTION.\r\n\r\n  \"There is,\" once said the bearded sage, \"no motion!\"\r\n  The other straight 'gan move before his eyes:\r\n  The contrary no stronglier could he prove.\r\n  All praised the answerer's ingenious notion.\r\n  Now, Sirs; this story doth to me recall\r\n  A new example of the fact surprising:\r\n  We see each day the sun before us rising,\r\n  Yet right _was_ Galileo, after all!\r\n\r\nIn the spirited lines addressed to \"The Slanderers of Russia,\" Pushkin\r\nhas recorded a sufficiently conclusive reply to the hackneyed calumnies\r\nagainst his country, repeated with such a nauseating uniformity, and\r\nthrough so long a period of time, in wretched verse, or more wretched\r\nprose, in the leading articles of obscure provincial newspapers, and on\r\nthe scaffolding of obscure provincial hustings. Whatever may be the\r\nmerits or demerits, in a moral point of view, of the part played by\r\nRussia in the events alluded to by the poet, events which form the stock\r\nsubject of the scribblings and spoutings we speak of, these tiresome\r\ntirades do not come with a very good grace from either England or\r\nFrance. There is a very excellent and venerable proverb which expresses\r\nthe imprudence of the practice of throwing stones, when indulged in by\r\nthe inhabitant of an abode composed of a vitreous substance, not to\r\nmention a still more greybearded and not less wise saw, specifying, in\r\nterms rather forcible than dignified, the impolicy of the pot alluding\r\nin an opprobrious manner to the blackness which characterizes the\r\nsitting part of its fellow-utensil, the kettle; and the \"wisdom of ages\"\r\nmight, in the present instance, be very reasonably adduced to moderate\r\nthe excessive moral susceptibilities of the aforesaid writers and\r\ndeclaimers, and to restrain the feeble flood of words--the dirty torrent\r\nof shallow declamation, so incessantly poured forth against Russia on\r\nthe subject of Poland. \"Judge not, that ye be not judged!\" is an\r\nexcellent precept for the guidance of nations as well as of individuals;\r\nand, we think, a Russian, wearied by the tiresome repetition of the same\r\naccusations against his native country, can hardly be blamed for asking,\r\nin language even more energetic than that here employed by Pushkin,\r\nwhether England or France have hands so clean, or a conscience so clear,\r\nas to justify them in their incessant and insolent attempt to sit in\r\njudgment upon their European sister. We certainly think that the\r\nrecollection of the Affghan war, the bombardment of Copenhagen, of the\r\nsplendid exploits of Whig policy and Whig non-intervention in Spain,\r\nmight make England a little more modest, and a little less inclined to\r\ndeclaim against the wickedness of other nations--and as to France, her\r\nwhole history, from the Republic to the present day, is nothing but a\r\nsuccession of lessons which might teach _la grande nation_ to abstain\r\nfrom exhibiting herself in the character of a moral instructress to the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n  TO THE SLANDERERS OF RUSSIA.\r\n\r\n  Why rave ye, babblers, so--ye lords of popular wonder?\r\n  Why such anathemas 'gainst Russia do ye thunder?\r\n  What moves your idle rage?

The chief grace and\r\nvalue of such productions certainly consists less in the quantity or\r\nweight of the gold employed in their composition, than in the beauty and\r\ndelicacy of the image stamped or graven upon the metal; and the critic\r\nmay object against us, if our critic be in a severe mood (quod Dii\r\navertant boni!) the rashness of the numismatist, who should hope, in\r\nrecasting the exquisite medals of antique art, to retain--or even\r\nimperfectly imitate--the touches of the Ionic or the Corinthian chisel.\r\n\r\nTrue as is the above reasoning with respect to the slighter productions\r\nof poetry in all languages, it is peculiarly true when applied to the\r\nsmaller offspring of Pushkin's muse; and were we not sufficiently\r\nconvinced of the danger and the arduousness of our attempt, by our own\r\nexperience and by analogy, we should have found abundant reason for\r\ndiffidence in the often repeated counsels of Russians, who all unite in\r\nasserting that there is something so peculiarly delicate and inimitable\r\nin the diction and versification of these little pieces, as to be almost\r\nbeyond the reach of a foreigner's _appreciation_, and, consequently,\r\nthat any attempt at _imitation_ must, _a fortiori_, of necessity be a\r\nfailure. Notwithstanding all this, and despite many sinister presages,\r\nwe have obstinately persevered in our determination to clothe in an\r\nEnglish dress those pieces, great and small--gems or flowers,\r\nproductions perfumed by grace of diction, or heavy with weight of\r\nthought--which struck us most forcibly among the poems of our author;\r\nand we hope that our boldness, if not our success, may be rewarded with\r\nthe approbation of such of our countrymen as may be curious to know\r\nsomething of the tone and physiognomy of the Russian literature.\r\n\r\n  PRESENTIMENT.\r\n\r\n  Clouds anew have gather'd o'er me,\r\n  Sad and grim, and dark and still;\r\n  Black and menacing before me\r\n  Glooms the Destiny of Ill ...\r\n\r\n  In contempt with fate contending,\r\n  Shall I bring, to meet her flood,\r\n  The enduring and unbending\r\n  Spirit of my youthful blood?\r\n\r\n  Worn with life-storm, cold and dreary,\r\n  Calmly I await the blast,\r\n  Saved from wreck, yet wet and weary,\r\n  I may find a port at last.\r\n\r\n  See, it comes--the hour thou fearest!\r\n  Hour escapeless!

This composition is founded upon one of the most\r\nwell-known and tragic episodes of the first French Revolution: the\r\nexecution of the young and gifted poet whose name forms the title of the\r\nlines. The story of Chenier's imprisonment and untimely death, as well\r\nas the various allusions to the beautiful verses addressed by him to his\r\nfellow-prisoner, La Jeune Captive, to his calm bearing on the scaffold,\r\nand to the memorable exclamation which was made in the last accents ever\r\nuttered by his lips; all these things are, doubtless, sufficiently\r\nfamiliar to our readers; or, if not, a single reference, either to any\r\nof the thousand books describing that most bloody and yet powerfully\r\nattractive period of French history--nay, the simple turning to the\r\narticle _Chenier_, in any biographical dictionary, will be amply\r\nsufficient to recall to the memory the principal facts of the sad story\r\nwhich Pushkin has made the subject of his noble elegy. It will be\r\ntherefore unnecessary for us to detail the life and death of the hero of\r\nthe poem, and we shall only throw together, in these short preliminary\r\nremarks, the few quotations and notes appended by the Russian poet to\r\nhis work. These will not be found of any very formidable extent; and as\r\nthe poem itself is not of a considerable length, we trust that the\r\nvarious passages, which these quotations are adduced to illustrate, will\r\nbe sufficiently perceptible, without our submitting to the necessity of\r\nappending them in the form of marginal annotations or foot-notes, a\r\nnecessity which would force us to load the text with those unsightly\r\nappendages to books in general, and to poetry in particular--the\r\nasterisks and daggers of marginal reference.\r\n\r\nThe supposed soliloquy of the martyred poet, which forms the principal\r\nportion of Pushkin's elegiac ode, is little else than an amplification,\r\nor pathetic and dignified paraphrase, of the exquisite composition\r\nactually written by Chenier on the eve of his execution; a composition\r\nbecome classical in the French literature:--\r\n\r\n  \"Comme un dernier rayon, comme un dernier zephyr\r\n  Anime le soir d'un beau jour,\r\n  Au pied de l'echafaud j'essaie encore ma lyre.\"\r\n\r\nOf the few persons to whom allusion is made in the verses, _Abel_,\r\n_Fanny_, and the _Captive Maid_, all that it is necessary to know is,\r\nthat the first was one of his friends, the companion of his early\r\nhappiness, and the fellow-labourer of his early studies--\"Abel, doux\r\nconfidant de mes jeunes mysteres;\" the second, one of his mistresses;\r\nand the third, a young lady, Mlle. de Coigny, who was for some time his\r\nfellow-prisoner, and the person to whom the poet addressed the touching\r\nverses which we have mentioned above. Mlle. de Coigny was the \"Jeune\r\nCaptive.\"\r\n\r\nIn justification of the very emphatic tone in which Pushkin has recorded\r\nthe noble generosity and self-sacrifice which conducted Chenier to the\r\nrevolutionary scaffold, it will be sufficient to quote the words of De\r\nla Touche, and to refer the reader to Chenier's Iambics, which drew down\r\nupon his head, and with good cause, the hatred and suspicion of\r\nRobespierre and his subordinate demons:--\"Chenier avait merite la haine\r\ndes factieux. Il avait celebre Charlotte Corday, fletri Collot\r\nd'Herbois, attaque Robespierre. On sait que le Roi avait demande a\r\nl'Assemblee par une lettre pleine de calme et de dignite, le droit\r\nd'appeler au peuple du jugement qui le condamnait. Cette lettre, signee\r\ndans la nuit du 17 au 18 Janvier, est d'Andre Chenier.\"--H. DE LA\r\nTOUCHE.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate poet was executed on the 8th of Thermidor; _i.e._ the\r\nday before the fall of Robespierre. The fatal tumbril which bore Chenier\r\nto the guillotine, conveyed also to the same scaffold the poet Roucher,\r\nhis friend:--\"Ils parlerent de la poesie a leurs derniers moments; pour\r\neux, apres l'amitie, c'etait la plus belle chose de la terre. Racine fut\r\nl'objet de leur entretien et de leur derriere admiration. Ils voulurent\r\nreciter ses vers; ils choisirent la premiere scene d'Andromaque.\"--H. DE\r\nLA TOUCHE.\r\n\r\nAt the place of execution, Chenier struck his forehead with his hand,\r\nand exclaimed--\"Pourtant j'avais quelque chose la!\"\r\n\r\n  ANDRE CHENIER.\r\n\r\n  \"Ainsi, triste et captif, ma lyre toutefois S'eveillait.\"\r\n\r\n        While earth, with wonderment and fear,\r\n        O'er Byron's urn is sadly bending,\r\n        And unto Europe's dirge its ear\r\n        By Dante's side his shade is lending,\r\n\r\n        Another shade my voice doth crave,\r\n        Who erst, unsung, unwept, unfriended,\r\n        In the grim Terror-days descended\r\n        From the red scaffold, to the grave.\r\n\r\n        Love, Peace, the Woodlands, did inspire\r\n        That Poet's dreams, sublime and free;\r\n        And to that Bard a stranger's lyre\r\n        Shall ring--shall ring to him and thee.\r\n\r\n    The lifted axe--what! cannot slaughter tire?--\r\n        For a new victim calls again.\r\n    The bard is ready; hark, his pensive lyre\r\n        Awakes its last, its parting strain.\r\n\r\n    At dawn he dies--a mob-feast hot and gory;\r\n        But that young Poet's latest breath\r\n    What doth it sing? Freedom it sings and glory,\r\n        'Twas faithful even unto death.\r\n\r\n        \"    *    *    *    *    *\r\n        *    *    *    *    *    *\r\n        *    *    *    *    *    *\r\n        *    *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\n  *     * \"I shall not see ye, days of bliss and freedom:\r\n  The scaffold calls. My last hours wearily\r\n  Drag on. At dawn I die. The headsman's hand defiling,\r\n  By the long hair will lift my head on high\r\n        Above the crowd unmoved and smiling.\r\n  Farewell! My homeless dust, O friends! shall ne'er repose\r\n  In that dear spot where erst we pass'd 'neath sunny bowers\r\n  In science and in feasts our careless days, and chose\r\n  Beforehand for our urns a place among the flowers.\r\n        And if, my friends, in after years\r\n        With sadness my remembrance moves ye,\r\n  O, grant my dying prayer!--the prayer of one who loves ye:\r\n  Weep, loved ones, weep my lot, with still and silent tears;\r\n  Beware, or by those drops suspicion ye may waken;\r\n  In this bad age, ye know, e'en tears for crimes are taken:\r\n  Brother for brother now, alas! must weep no more.\r\n\r\n  And yet another prayer: you've listen'd o'er and o'er\r\n  Unto my idle rhymes, my spirit's careless breathings,\r\n  Mournful and gay by turns, traditions and bequeathings\r\n  Of all my vanish'd youth. And hopes, and joy, and pain,\r\n  And tears, and love, my friends, those burning leaves contain,\r\n  Yea, they contain my life. From Abel and from Fanny\r\n  Gather them all; for they are gifts of Muses many.\r\n  Keep them. The stern cold world, and fashion's gilded hall,\r\n  Shall never hear of them. Alas! my head must fall\r\n  Untimely: my unripe and crude imagination\r\n  To glory hath bequeath'd no grand and high creation;\r\n  I shall die _all_. But ye, who love my parting soul,\r\n  Keep for yourselves, O friends! my true though simple scroll;\r\n  And when the storm is past, in a fond crowd assemble\r\n  Sometimes to read my lines--to read, to weep, and tremble,\r\n  And weep, and read again, and say--Yes, this is he;\r\n  These are his words. And I, from death's cold fetter free,\r\n  Will rise unseen and sit among ye in the bower;\r\n  And drink your tears, as drinks the desert-sand the shower--\r\n  In sweet oblivion.... Then shall, haply, be repaid\r\n  All my love-woes, and thou, haply, my _Captive Maid_,\r\n  Will list my love-song then, pale, mournful, but relenting....\"\r\n  But for a while the Bard ceased here his sad lamenting,\r\n  Ceased for a moment's space, and his pale head he bow'd.\r\n  The spring-days of his youth, loves, woes, a busy crowd,\r\n  Flitted before him. Girls with languid eyes and tender,\r\n  And feasts, and songs, and eyes of dark and burning splendour,\r\n  All, all revived; and far to the dim past he flew,\r\n  Dream-wing'd. But soon stream'd forth his murmur-song anew:--\r\n\r\n  \"Why luredst thou me astray, thou Genius evil-fated?\r\n  For love, for quiet arts, and peace, I was created;\r\n  Why did I leave the shade, and life's untroubled way,\r\n  And liberty, and friends, and peace, more dear than they!\r\n  Fate lull'd my golden youth, and cast a glamour round me,\r\n  And joy, with careless hand, and happiness, had crown'd me,\r\n  And the Muse shared my hours of leisure, pure and free.\r\n  In those so joyous nights, lighted with friendly glee,\r\n  How rang that dear abode with rhyme and merry laughter--\r\n  Waking the household gods--how rang each shouting rafter!\r\n  Then, weary of the feast, I from the wine-cup turn'd,\r\n  For a new sudden fire within my bosom burn'd,\r\n  And to my lady's bower I flew upon the morrow,\r\n  And found her half in wrath and half in girlish sorrow,\r\n  And with fond threats, and tears bedimming her soft eyes,\r\n  She cursed my age, still drown'd in ceaseless revelries,\r\n  She drove me from her, wept, forgave, and pouting chided:\r\n  How sweetly then my time like some bright river glided!\r\n  Ah, why from this calm life, in youth's most golden prime,\r\n  Plunged I in this abyss, this seething hell of crime,\r\n  Of passions fierce and fell, black ignorance, and madness,\r\n  Malice, and lust of gold! O visionary Gladness!\r\n  Where hast thou lured me, where? And was it then for me,\r\n  A worshipper of love, of peace, and poesy,\r\n  To brawl with sworders vile, wretches who stab for hire!\r\n  Was it for me to tame the restive courser's fire\r\n  To shake the rein, or wield the mercenary blade!\r\n  And yet, what shall I leave?--A trace that soon shall fade,\r\n  Of blind and senseless zeal; of courage--idle merit!--\r\n  Be dumb, my voice, be dumb! And thou, thou lying spirit,\r\n\r\n        Thou word, thou empty sound....Oh no!\r\n        Be still, ye murmurings of weakness!\r\n        And thou, O Bard! with rapture glow:\r\n        Thou hast not bent, with slavish meekness,\r\n        Before our age's shame thy brow;\r\n        The splendours of the wicked spurning,\r\n        Thou wav'dst a torch, terrific burning,\r\n        Whose lurid lustre fiercely fell\r\n        On that foul nest of vulture-rulers;\r\n        Loud rang thy lash and reach'd them well.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n        Around them hiss'd thy winged verse;\r\n  Thou did'st invoke upon them the avenger;\r\n        Thou sang'st to Marat's worshippers\r\n        The dagger and the Virgin-Nemesis!\r\n  When that old holy man strove from the axe to tear\r\n  With a chain-laden hand his master's crowned head,\r\n      Thou gav'st thy hand unto the noble pair;\r\n        Before ye, struck with horror, fell\r\n        That Areopagus of hell.\r\n  Be proud, O Bard! and thou, fiend-wolf of blood and guile,\r\n        Sport with my head awhile;\r\n  'Tis in thy clutch. But hark! and know, thou Godless one,\r\n  My shout shall follow thee, my triumph-laugh of joy!\r\n        Aye, drink our blood, live to destroy:\r\n        Thou'rt but a pigmy still; thy race shall soon be run.\r\n      An hour will come, an hour thou can'st not flee--\r\n        Thou shalt fall, Tyrant! Indignation\r\n  Will Wake at last. The sobs and mournings of a nation\r\n        Will waken weary destiny.\r\n  But now I go.... 'Tis time.... But thou shalt follow me!\r\n  I wait thy coming.\"\r\n\r\n        Thus rang the Bard's dying lay,\r\n  And all was still around. The dim lamp's quiet ray\r\n        'Gan pale before the gleam of morning,\r\n  Into that dungeon stream'd the dawn-light of the day,\r\n        Upon the grate he bends a glance unshrinking....\r\n  A noise. They come, they call. There is no hope! 'Tis they!\r\n        Locks, bolts, and bars, and chains, are clinking.\r\n  They call.... Stay, stay; one day, but one day more,\r\n        And he shall live in liberty\r\n        A mighty citizen, when all is o'er,\r\n        Amid a nation great and free.\r\n  The silent train moves on. There stands the headsman grim;\r\n  But the Bard's path of death, the ray of friendship lighteth,\r\n  Murmuring Glory's name, he mounts--His brow he smiteth--\r\n        Weep, Muse, for him!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARSTON; OR, THE MEMOIRS OF A STATESMAN.\r\n\r\nPART XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Have I not in my time heard lions roar?\r\n  Have I not heard the sea, puft up with wind\r\n  Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?\r\n  Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,\r\n  And Heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?\r\n  Have I not in the pitched battle heard\r\n  Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets clang?\"\r\n\r\n  SHAKSPEARE.\r\n\r\nOn returning to London I found the world in the \"transition state.\" The\r\nspirit of the people was changed; the nature of the war was changed; the\r\nprinciple of the great parties in the legislature was changed. A new era\r\nof the contest had arrived; and, in the midst of the general perplexity\r\nas to the nature of the approaching events, every one exhibited a\r\nconviction, that when they came their magnitude would turn all the\r\nstruggles of the past into child's play.\r\n\r\nI, too, had my share in the change. I had now passed my public\r\nnovitiate, and had obtained my experience of statesmanship on a scale,\r\nif too small for history, yet sufficiently large to teach me the working\r\nof the machinery. National conspiracy, the council-chamber, popular\r\nebullition, and the tardy but powerful action of public justice, had\r\nbeen my tutors; and I was now felt, by the higher powers, to be not\r\nunfit for trust in a larger field. A seat in the English House of\r\nCommons soon enabled me to give satisfactory evidence that I had not\r\naltogether overlooked the character of the crisis; and, after some\r\ninterviews with the premier, his approval of my conduct in Ireland was\r\nfollowed by the proposal of office, with a seat in the cabinet.\r\n\r\nI had thus attained, in the vigour of life, a distinction for which\r\nhundreds, perhaps thousands, had laboured through life in vain. But mine\r\nwas no couch of rosy prosperity. The period was threatening. The old\r\ndays of official repose were past, never to return. The state of Europe\r\nwas hourly assuming an aspect of the deepest peril. The war had hitherto\r\nbeen but the struggle of armies; it now threatened to be the struggle of\r\nnations. It had hitherto lived on the natural resources of public\r\nexpenditure; it now began to prey upon the vitals of the kingdom. The\r\nordinary finance of England was to be succeeded by demands pressing\r\nheavily on the existing generation, and laying a hereditary burden on\r\nall that were to follow. The nature of our antagonist deepened the\r\ndifficulty. All the common casualties of nations were so far from\r\nbreaking the enemy down, that they only gave him renewed power. Poverty\r\nswelled his ranks; confiscation swelled his coffers; bankruptcy gave him\r\nstrength; faction invigorated his government; and insubordination made\r\nhim invincible. In the midst of this confusion, even a new terror arose.\r\nThe democracy of France, after startling Europe, had seemed to be\r\nsinking into feebleness and apathy, when a new wonder appeared in the\r\npolitical hemisphere, too glaring and too ominous to suffer our eyes to\r\nturn from it for a moment. The Consulate assumed the rule of France.\r\nCombining the fiery vigour of republicanism with the perseverance of\r\nmonarchy, it now carried the whole force of the country into foreign\r\nfields. Every foreign capital began to tremble. The whole European\r\nsystem shook before a power which smote it with the force of a\r\ncannon-ball against a crumbling bastion. The extraordinary man who now\r\ntook the lead in France, had touched the string which vibrated in the\r\nheart of every native of the soil. He had found them weary of the crimes\r\nof the democracy; he told them that a career of universal supremacy was\r\nopen before them. He had found them degraded by the consciousness of\r\nriot and regicide; he told them that they were the chevaliers of the new\r\nage, and destined to eclipse the chevaliers of all the ages past. His\r\nItalian campaigns, by their rapidity, their fine combinations, and their\r\nastonishing success, had created a new art of war. He had brought them\r\nromantic triumphs from the land of romance. Day by day the populace of\r\nthe capital were summoned to see pageants of Italian standards, cannon,\r\nand prisoners. Every courier that galloped through the streets brought\r\ntidings of some new conquest; and every meeting of the Councils was\r\nemployed in announcing the addition of some classic province, the\r\noverthrow of some hostile diadem, or the arrival of some convoy of those\r\nmost magnificent of all the spoils of war, the treasures of the Italian\r\narts. France began to dream of the conquest of the world.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between her past calamities and her present splendour,\r\npowerfully heightened the illusion. France loves illusion; she has\r\nalways rejoiced in glittering deceptions, even with the perfect\r\nknowledge that they were deceptions; and here stood the most dazzling of\r\npolitical charlatans, the great wonder-worker, raising phantoms of\r\nnational glory even out of the charnel. The wrecks of faction, the\r\nremnants of the monarchy, and the corpses lying headless in the shadow\r\nof the guillotine, gave all semblance to the conception--France _was_ a\r\ncharnel. Her people, by nature rushing into extremes, wild and fierce,\r\nyet gallant and generous, had become at length conscious of the national\r\nfall in the eyes of Europe. They had been scandalized by the rudeness,\r\nthe baseness, and the brutishness, of rabble supremacy. They gazed upon\r\ntheir own crimsoned hands and tarnished weapons with intolerable\r\ndisgust; and it was in this moment of depression that they saw a sudden\r\nbeam of military renown shot across the national darkness. After so long\r\ndefeat that it had extinguished all but the memory of her old triumphs,\r\nFrance was a conqueror; after a century of helpless exhaustion, she had\r\nrisen into almost supernatural vigour; after a hundred years, scarcely\r\nmarked by a single victory, her capital rang with the daily sound of\r\nsuccessful battles against the veterans of Frederick and Maria Theresa;\r\nafter lingering for generations in the obscurity so bitter to the\r\npopular heart, France had been suddenly thrown into the broadest lustre\r\nof European sovereignty. The world _was_ changed; and the limits of that\r\nchange offered only a more resistless lure to the popular passion, for\r\ntheir being still indistinct to the keenest eye of man.\r\n\r\nBut our chief struggle was at home, and the reaction of our foreign\r\ndisasters came with terrible weight upon a cabinet already tottering. We\r\nsaw its fate. Days and nights of the most anxious consultation, could\r\nnot relieve us from the hourly increasing evidence, that the Continent\r\nwas on the verge of ruin. The voice of Opposition, reinforced by the\r\nroar of the multitude, could no longer be shut out by the curtains of\r\nthe council-chamber. Fox, always formidable, was never more confident\r\nand more popular, than when he made the House ring with prophecies of\r\nnational downfall. His attacks were now incessant. He flung his\r\nhand-grenades night after night into our camp, and constantly with still\r\ngreater damage. We still fought, but it was the fight of despair. Pitt\r\nwas imperturbable; but there was not one among his colleagues who did\r\nnot feel the hopelessness of calling for public reliance, when, in every\r\nsuccessive debate, we heard the leader of Opposition contemptuously\r\nasking, what answer we had to the Gazette crowded with bankruptcy? to\r\nthe resolutions of great bodies of the people denouncing the war? or to\r\nthe deadly evidence of its effects in the bulletin which he held in his\r\nhand, announcing some new defeat of our allies; some new treaty of\r\nsubmission; some new barter of provinces for the precarious existence of\r\nforeign thrones?\r\n\r\nIn all my recollections of public life, this was the period of the\r\ndeepest perplexity. The name of the great minister has been humiliated\r\nby those who judge of the past only by the present. But then all was\r\nnew. The general eye of statesmanship had been deceived by the formal\r\ngrandeur of the continential sovereignties. They had lain untouched,\r\nlike the bodies of their kings, with all their armour on, and with every\r\nfeature unchanged; and such they might have remained for ages to come,\r\nhad not a new force broken open their gilded and sculptured shrines,\r\ntorn off their cerements, and exposed them to the light and air. Then a\r\ntouch extinguished them; the armour dropped into dust; the royal robes\r\ndissolved; the royal features disappeared; and the whole illusion left\r\nnothing but its moral behind.\r\n\r\nIt can be no dishonour to the memory of the first of statesmen, to\r\nacknowledge that he had not the gift of prophecy. Europe had never\r\nbefore seen a war of the people. The burning passions, rude vigour, and\r\nremorseless daring of the multitude, were phenomena of which man knows\r\nno more than he knows of the materials of destruction which lie hid in\r\nthe central caverns of the globe, and which some new era may be suffered\r\nto develope, for the new havoc of posterity. Even to this hour, I think\r\nthat the true source of revolutionary triumph has been mistaken. It was\r\nnot in the furious energy of its factions, nor in the wild revenge of\r\nthe people, nor even in the dazzling view of national conquest. These\r\nwere but gusts of the popular tempest, currents of the great popular\r\ntide. But the mighty mover of all was the sudden change from the\r\ndisgusts and depressions of serfdom, into a sense that all the world of\r\npossession lay before the bold heart and the ruthless hand. Every form\r\nof wealth and enjoyment was offered to the man who had begun life in the\r\ncondition of one chained to the ground, and who could never have hoped\r\nto change his toil but for the grave. But the barrier was now cast down,\r\nand all were free to rush in. The treasury of national honours was\r\nsuddenly flung open, and all might share the spoil. This was the true\r\nsecret of the astonishing power of the Revolution. The man who was\r\nnothing to-day, might be everything to-morrow. The conscript might be a\r\ncaptain, a colonel, a general, before the Austrian or Prussian soldier\r\ncould be a corporal. Who can wonder at the march of France, or the\r\nflight of her enemies?\r\n\r\nAlthough every night now produced a debate, and the demand on the\r\nactivity and vigilance of ministers was incessant and exhausting, the\r\nreal debates in both Houses were few in comparison with those of later\r\ntimes. In those pitched battles of the great parties, their whole\r\nstrength was mustered from every quarter; the question was long\r\nannounced; and its decision was regarded as giving the most complete\r\nmeasure of the strength of the Cabinet and Opposition. One of these\r\nnights came, unfortunately for ministers, on the very day in which the\r\nbulletin arrived, announcing the signature of the first Austrian\r\narmistice. The passage of the Tyrol had stripped Austria of its mountain\r\nbarrier. Terror had done the rest; and the armistice was signed within\r\nthree marches of Vienna! The courier who had been sent to the Austrian\r\nambassador, and had been permitted to pass through France, reported the\r\nwhole nation to be in a frenzy of triumph. He had every where seen civic\r\nprocessions, military displays, and illuminations in the cities. The\r\nexultation of the people had risen to the utmost height of national\r\nenthusiasm; and Europe was pronounced, by every Frenchman, from the\r\nDirectory to the postilion, to be at their feet.\r\n\r\nThis intelligence was all but fatal. If a shower of cannon-balls had\r\nbeen poured in upon the ministerial benches, it could scarcely have\r\nproduced a more sweeping effect. It was clear that the sagacity of the\r\n\"independent members\"--only another name for the most flexible portion\r\nof the House--was fully awake to the contingency; the \"waiters upon\r\nProvidence,\" as they were called, with no very reverent allusion, were\r\nevidently on the point of deciding for themselves; and the \"King's\r\nfriends\"--a party unknown to the constitution, but perfectly knowing,\r\nand known by, the treasury--began to move away by small sections; and,\r\ncrowded as the clubs were during the day, I never saw the minister rise\r\nwith so few of his customary troops behind him. But the Opposition bench\r\nwas crowded to repletion; and their leader sat looking round with\r\ngood-humoured astonishment, and sometimes with equally good-humoured\r\nburlesque, on the sudden increase of his recruits. The motion was in\r\nanswer to a royal message on continental subsidies. Nothing could have\r\nbeen more difficult than the topic at that juncture. But I never\r\nlistened to Pitt with more genuine admiration. Fox, in his declamatory\r\nbursts, was superior to every speaker whom I have ever heard. His\r\nappearance of feeling was irresistible. It seemed that, if one could\r\nhave stripped his heart, it could scarcely have shown its pulsations\r\nmore vividly to the eye, than they transpired from his fluent and most\r\neloquent tongue. But if Fox was the most powerful of declaimers, Pitt\r\nwas the mightiest master of the language of national council. He, too,\r\ncould be occasionally glowing and imaginative. He could even launch the\r\nlighter weapons of sarcasm with singular dexterity; but his true rank\r\nwas as the ruler of Empire, and his true talent was never developed but\r\nwhen he spoke for the interests of Empire.\r\n\r\nOn this night he was more earnest and more impressive than ever; the\r\ntrue description would have been, more _imperial_. He spoke, less like a\r\ndebater, than like one who held the sceptre in his hand; and one who\r\nalso felt that he was transmitting his wisdom as a parting legacy to a\r\ngreat people.\r\n\r\nA portion of that speech, which ought never to be forgotten by the\r\nleaders of public affairs in England, was singularly full and powerful.\r\nReferring to the calumniated Revolution of 1688--\"We now stand,\" said\r\nhe, \"almost in the same position with respect to France and Europe, in\r\nwhich the government of William III. stood a century ago. We have only\r\nto substitute the democracy of France for the monarchy; and Europe\r\nenfeebled by the shocks of war, as it is now, for Europe untouched and\r\nintrepid, awake to the ambition of the French king, and determined to\r\nmeet him sword in hand. But the King of England was even then the\r\nguiding mind of Europe. I now demand, what was the redeeming policy of\r\nthat pre-eminent sovereign? It was, never to despair of the triumph of\r\nprinciple; never to doubt of the ultimate fortunes of good in a contest\r\nwith evil; and never to hesitate in calling upon a great and free people\r\nfor the defence of that constitution which had made them great and\r\nfree.\"\r\n\r\nThose high-toned sentiments were received with loud cheers. Even\r\nOpposition felt the natural force of the appeal, and the cheering was\r\nuniversal; party was forgotten for the time, and the name of England,\r\nand the revived glory of those illustrious days, bowed the whole House\r\nat the will of the great orator. In the midst of their enthusiasm, he\r\ntook from the table a volume of the records, and read the final address\r\nof William to his Parliament; the bequest of a dying king to the people\r\nwhom he had rescued from slavery. This royal speech had evidently formed\r\nhis manual of government, and, certainly, a nobler declaration never\r\ncame from the throne.\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords and Gentlemen--I promise myself that you are met together\r\n    with that just sense of the common danger of Europe, and that\r\n    resentment of the late proceedings of the French king, which have\r\n    been so fully and universally expressed in the loyal and seasonable\r\n    addresses of my people.\" In allusion to the French plan of\r\n    universal monarchy in the reign of Louis XIV., the speech\r\n    pronounced that the alliance of Spain was the commencement of a\r\n    system for subjugating Europe. \"It is fit,\" said the King, \"that I\r\n    should tell you that the eyes of all Europe are upon this\r\n    Parliament--all matters are at a stand until your resolutions are\r\n    known; and therefore no time ought to be lost.\r\n\r\n    \"You have yet an opportunity, by God's blessing, to secure to\r\n    yourselves and your posterity the quiet enjoyment of your religion\r\n    and liberties, if you are not _wanting to yourselves_, but will\r\n    exert the utmost vigour of the English nation. But I tell you\r\n    plainly, that if you do not lay hold of this occasion, you have no\r\n    reason to hope for another.\" One of the measures proposed was, for\r\n    the maintenance of the public good faith. \"I cannot but press upon\r\n    you,\" said the King, \"to take care of the public credit, which\r\n    cannot be preserved but by keeping sacred the maxim, that _they\r\n    shall never be losers_ who trust to parliamentary security.\r\n\r\n    \"Let me conjure you to disappoint the only hopes of your enemies by\r\n    your unanimity. I have shown, and will always show, how desirous I\r\n    am to be the common father of all my people: do you, in like\r\n    manner, lay aside parties and divisions; let there be no other\r\n    distinction heard of amongst us, but of those who are for the\r\n    Protestant religion and the present establishment; and of those who\r\n    mean a Popish prince and a French government.\r\n\r\n    \"I shall only add this; that if you do, in good earnest, desire to\r\n    see England hold the balance of Europe, and to be indeed at the\r\n    head of the Protestant interest, it will appear by the present\r\n    opportunity.\"\r\n\r\nDaylight shone on the windows of St Stephen's before the debate closed.\r\nThe minister had retired immediately after his exhausting speech, and\r\nleft his friends to sustain the combat. It was long and fierce; but\r\nOpposition was again baffled, and the division gave us a lingering\r\nmajority. It was now too late, or too early, to go to rest; and I had\r\nreturned to my official apartments, to look over some returns required\r\nfor the next council, when, my friend the secretary tapped at my door.\r\nHis countenance looked care-worn; and for a few moments after he had sat\r\ndown, he remained in total silence, with his forehead resting on his\r\nhands. This was so unlike the cheerful spirit of former times--times in\r\nwhich he had seemed to defy, or almost to enjoy, the struggles of public\r\nlife--that I began to express alarm for his health. But he interrupted\r\nme by a look of the deepest distress, and the words \"Pitt is dying.\" No\r\nwords could be fuller of ill omen, and my anxiety was equal to his own.\r\n\"My meaning,\" said he, \"is not, that he must die to-day, or to-morrow,\r\nnor in six months, nor perhaps in a year, but that the statesman is\r\ndead. He must speak no more, act no more, and even think no more, or he\r\nmust go to his grave. This night has finished the long supremacy of the\r\nnoblest mind that ever ruled the councils of this country. William Pitt\r\nmay live, but the minister has finished his days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet,\" I remarked, \"I never heard him more animated or more impressive\r\nthan on this night. He absolutely broke down all resistance. His mind\r\nseemed richer than ever, and his combination of facts and reasoning\r\nappeared to me unequalled by even his greatest previous efforts. I\r\nshould have almost pronounced him to be inspired by the increased\r\ndifficulties of the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"True--yet I conveyed him from the House, fainting;--I have sate, along\r\nwith his physician, at his bedside ever since, applying restoratives to\r\nhim, with scarcely a hope of recovery. It is plain that another night of\r\nsuch effort would be too much for his frame; and the question on which I\r\nhave now come to summon an immediate meeting of our friends, turns on\r\nthe means of calming public opinion until he shall be able to appear in\r\nhis place once more. His career is unquestionably at an end, but his\r\nname is powerful still; and though another trial of his powers in\r\nParliament would cost him his life, still, as the head of the cabinet,\r\nhe might effect, for a while, all the principal purposes of an\r\nadministration.\"\r\n\r\nI doubted the possibility of encountering the present strength of\r\nOpposition, reinforced, as it was, by calamity abroad, and asked,\r\n\"Whether any expedient was contemplated, to restore the public fortunes\r\non the Continent?\"\r\n\r\n\"Every point of that kind has been long since considered,\" was the\r\nanswer. \"Our alliances have all failed; and we are now reproached, not\r\nsimply with the folly of paying for inefficient help, but with the\r\ncruelty of dragging the states of Europe into a contest, where to be\r\ncrushed was inevitable.\"\r\n\r\nI still urged an enquiry into the strength of states which had never\r\nbeen sharers in the war. \"If the minor German powers have been absorbed;\r\nif Prussia has abandoned the cause; if Austria has fought in vain--is\r\nthe _world_ included in Germany?\" I threw the map of Europe on the\r\ntable. \"See what a narrow circle comprehends the whole space to which we\r\nhave hitherto limited the defence of society against the enemy of all\r\nsocial order. Our cause is broader than Austria and Prussia; it is\r\nbroader than Europe; it is the cause of civilization itself; and why not\r\nsummon all civilization to its defence? Russia alone has an army of half\r\na million, yet she has never fired a shot.\" Still, I found it difficult\r\nto convince my fellow minister.\r\n\r\n\"Russia--jealous, ambitious, and Asiatic; Russia, with the Eastern world\r\nfor her natural field--what object can she have in relieving the broken\r\npowers of the Continent? Must she not rather rejoice in the defeats and\r\nconvulsions which leave them at her mercy?\" I still continued to urge\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Rely upon it; it is in the North that we must look for the\r\nreinforcement. If the councils of Catharine were crafty, the councils of\r\nher successor may be sincere. Catharine thought only of the seizure of\r\nTurkey; Paul may think only of the profits of commerce. Yet, is it\r\naltogether justifiable to suppose that monarchs may not feel the same\r\nsympathies, the same principles of honour--nay, the same abhorrence of a\r\nsanguinary republicanism--which a private individual might feel in any\r\nother instance of oppression?\"\r\n\r\n\"Still, Marston, I am at a loss to know by what influence a British\r\ngovernment could urge a Russian despotism into a contest, a thousand\r\nmiles from its frontier; in which it can gain no accession of territory,\r\nand but little accession of military fame; and all this, while it is\r\nitself perfectly secure from all aggression.\"\r\n\r\n\"All true; but remember the striking commencement of Voltaire's Memoir\r\nof Peter--'Who could have pretended to say, in the year 1700, that a\r\nmagnificent and polished court would be formed at the extremity of the\r\nGulf of Finland; that the inhabitants of Cazan and the banks of the\r\nWolga would be ranked among disciplined warriors, and, after beating the\r\nTurk and the Swede, gain victories in Germany? That a desert of two\r\nthousand leagues in length, should, in the space of fifty years, extend\r\nits influence to all the European courts; and that, in 1759, the most\r\nzealous patron of literature in Europe should be a Russian sovereign?\r\nThe man who had said this would have been regarded as the most\r\nchimerical mortal on earth.' But all this has been done, and the career\r\nis not closed. More will be done still. It may even be our most\r\nessential policy to bring Russia into full collision with France. She is\r\nnow the only rival: and I shall scarcely regret the fall of the German\r\nsovereignties, if it clears the field, to bring face to face the two\r\ngreat powers which hold at their sword's point the fate of the\r\nContinent.\"\r\n\r\nA month passed, of perpetual difficulty in the cabinet, of ill news from\r\nabroad, and of violent discontents among the people. A deficient harvest\r\nhad come, to increase the national murmurs; a season of peculiar\r\ninclemency had added its share to the public vexations; and I fully\r\nexperienced the insufficiency of office, and of the showy honours of\r\ncourts, to constitute happiness. But a new scene was reserved for me.\r\nCasual as my conversation with the secretary of state had been, it was\r\nnot forgotten: it had been related to the minister; and it had so far\r\ncoincided with the conceptions of a mind, which seemed to comprehend\r\nevery chance of human things, that I was shortly sent for, to enter into\r\nthe necessary explanations. The result was, the offer of a mission to St\r\nPetersburg. The proposal was so unexpected, that I required time for my\r\nanswer. I must abandon high employment at home for a temporary\r\ndistinction abroad; my knowledge of Russia was slight; the character of\r\nthe Czar was eccentric; and the success of an embassy, dependent on the\r\nmost capricious of mankind, was so uncertain, that the result might\r\nstrip me of whatever credit I already possessed.\r\n\r\nBut, there was one authority, to which I always appealed. I placed the\r\nproposal in the hands of Clotilde; and she settled all my doubts at\r\nonce, by declaring, \"that it was the appointment which, if she had been\r\nsuffered to choose, she would have selected, in preference to all\r\nothers, for its honour and its services.\" I had no power to resist such\r\npleadings--seconded as they were by the rosiest smiles, and the most\r\nbeaming eyes. But Clotilde was still the woman, and I only valued her\r\nthe more for it.--Her sincerity had not a thought to hide; and she\r\nacknowledged her delight at the prospect of once more treading on the\r\nsoil of the Continent; at gazing even on the borders of her native land,\r\nexcluded as she might be from its entrance; at the enjoyment of seeing\r\ncontinental life in the brilliant animation of its greatest court; and\r\nat mingling with the scene in a rank which entitled her to its first\r\ndistinctions.\r\n\r\n\"But, Clotilde, how will you reconcile your tastes to the wild habits\r\nof Russia, and even to the solemn formalities of a northern court?\"\r\n\r\n\"They both present themselves to me,\" was her answer, \"with the charm at\r\nonce of novelty and recollection. From my nursery days, the names of\r\nPeter, Catharine, and their marvellous city, rang in the ears of all\r\nParis. Romance had taken refuge at the pole; Voltaire, Buffon,\r\nD'Alembert--all the wit, and all the philosophy of France--satirized the\r\nFrench court under the disguise of Russian panegyric; and St Petersburg\r\nwas to us the modern Babylon--a something compounded of the wildness of\r\na Scythian desert, and the lustre of a Turkish tale.\"\r\n\r\nThe ministerial note had been headed \"most secret and confidential,\" and\r\nas such I had regarded it. But I soon saw the difficulty of keeping \"a\r\nstate secret.\" I had scarcely sent in my acceptance of the appointment,\r\nwhen I found a letter on my table from my old Israelite friend,\r\nMordecai, congratulating me on \"my decision.\" It was in his usual abrupt\r\nstyle:--\r\n\r\n    \"I was aware of the minister's offer to you within twelve hours\r\n    after it was made. I should have written to you, urging its\r\n    acceptance; but I preferred leaving your own judgment to settle the\r\n    question. Still, I can give you some personal knowledge on the\r\n    subject of Russia. I have been there for the last six months. My\r\n    daughter--for what purpose I have never been able to\r\n    ascertain--took a sudden whim of hating Switzerland, and loving the\r\n    snows and deserts of the North. But I have known the sex too long,\r\n    ever to think of combating their wills by argument.--The only\r\n    chance of success is to give way to them. Mariamne, sick of hills\r\n    and valleys, and unable to breathe in the purest air of the globe,\r\n    determined to try the exhalations from the marshes of the Neva.\r\n    But, she is my child, after all--the only being for whom I\r\n    live--and I was peculiarly grateful that she had not fixed on\r\n    Siberia, or taken a resolution to live and die at Pekin. I do not\r\n    regret my journey. It has thrown a new light on me. I must\r\n    acknowledge to you, that I was astonished at Russia. I had known it\r\n    in early life, and thought that I knew it well. But it is\r\n    singularly changed. The spirit of the people--the country--the\r\n    throne itself--have undergone the most remarkable of silent\r\n    revolutions, and the most effective of all. Russia is now Russia no\r\n    longer; she is Greece, Germany, France--and she will yet be\r\n    England. Her politics and her faculties, alike, embrace the\r\n    civilized world. She is Greece in her subtlety, Germany in her\r\n    intelligence, and France in her ambition. St Petersburg is less the\r\n    capital of her empire, though of all capitals the most magnificent,\r\n    than an emblem of her mind. I often stood on the banks of the Neva,\r\n    and, looking round me on their mass of palaces, involuntarily asked\r\n    myself--Could all this have been the work of a single mind? Other\r\n    capitals have been the work of necessity, of chance, of national\r\n    defence, of the mere happiness of location. But this was founded in\r\n    ambition alone--founded by the sovereign will of one who felt, that\r\n    in it he was erecting an empire of conquest; and that from this\r\n    spot, in after ages, was to pour forth the force that was to absorb\r\n    every other dominion of the world. Peter fixed on the site of his\r\n    city to tell this to the world. I see in its framer, and in its\r\n    site, the living words--'I fix my future capital in a\r\n    wilderness--in a swamp--in a region of tempests--on the shores of\r\n    an inhospitable sea--in a climate of nine months' winter--to show\r\n    that I am able to conquer all the obstacles of nature. I might have\r\n    fixed it on the shores of the Euxine--in the most fertile regions\r\n    of Asia--in the superb plains of central Russia--or on the banks of\r\n    the Danube; but I preferred fixing it in the extremity of the\r\n    North, to show that the mind and power of Russia dreaded no\r\n    impediments, of either man or nature.'\r\n\r\n    \"I am now in London for a week. You will find me in my den.\"\r\n\r\nI visited him \"in his den;\" and it deserved the name as much as ever.\r\nNot a pane had been cleared of its dinginess; not a cobweb had been\r\nswept from its ceiling; nothing had been removed, except the pair of\r\nliving skeletons who once acted as his attendants. They had been\r\nremoved by the Remover of all things; and were succeeded by a pair, so\r\nsimilar in meagreness and oddity of appearance, that I could not have\r\nknown the change, except for its mention by their master, congratulating\r\nhimself on being so \"fortunate\" in finding substitutes. I found Mordecai\r\nimmersed in day-books and ledgers, and calculating the exchanges with as\r\nmuch anxiety as if he were not worth a shilling. But his look was more\r\nlanguid than before, and his powerful eye seemed to have sunk deeper\r\nbeneath his brow.\r\n\r\n\"You are probably surprised at seeing me here;\" said he, \"but I have\r\nmore reason than ever to be here. There is a time for all things, but\r\nnot if we throw it away. My last excursion to Poland has revived my zeal\r\nin behalf of my nation; and as years advance on me, like the rest of the\r\nworld, I find that I must only exert myself the more.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Mordecai, you are opulent; you can have no necessity for\r\nabandoning the natural indulgences of life. You will only shorten your\r\ndays by this toil. At least why do you linger in this dungeon?\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled grimly. \"It _is_ a dungeon, and I only value it the more. To\r\nthis dungeon, as you call it, come, day by day, some of the haughtiest\r\nnames of the land. If I lived in some west-end Square, with my\r\ndrawing-room filled with _Louis Quatorze_ gew-gaws, and half-a-dozen\r\nidle fellows in livery to announce my visitors, I should not feel the\r\nhundredth part of the sense of superiority, the contemptuous triumph,\r\nthe cool consciousness of the tyranny of gold, which I feel when I see\r\nmy shrinking supplicants sitting down among my dusty boxes and\r\neverlasting cobwebs. I shall not suffer a grain of dust to be cleared\r\naway. It is my pride--it is my power--it is my revenge.\"\r\n\r\nHis visage assumed so completely the expression which I had always\r\nimagined for Shylock, that I should scarcely have been surprised if I\r\nhad seen him produce the knife and the scales.\r\n\r\n\"You are surprised at all this,\" said he after a pause, in which he\r\nfixed his searching eyes on me. \"I see by your countenance, that you\r\nthink me a Goth, a monster, a savage.--I think myself none of those\r\nthings. I am a man; and, if I am not much deceived, I am also a\r\nphilosopher. My life has been a perpetual struggle through a world where\r\nevery one worships self. My nation are scorned, and they struggle too.\r\nThe Jew has been injured, not by the individual alone, but by all\r\nmankind; and has he not a right to his revenge? He has at last found the\r\nmeans. He is now absorbing the wealth of all nations. With the wealth he\r\nwill have the power; and another half century will not elapse, before\r\nall the grand questions of public council--nay, of national\r\nexistence--must depend on the will of the persecuted sons of Abraham.\r\nWho shall rise, or who shall fall; who shall make war, or who shall\r\nobtain peace; what republic shall be created, or what monarchy shall be\r\nrent in pieces--will henceforth be the questions, not of cabinets, but\r\nof the 'Change. There are correspondences within this escritoire, worth\r\nall the wisdom of all the ministers of earth. There are commands at the\r\npoint of this pen, which the proudest statesmanship dares not\r\ncontrovert. There is in the chests round you a ruler more powerful than\r\never before held the sceptre--the dictator of the globe; the true Despot\r\nis Gold.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this wild burst, he sank into silence; until, to change the fever\r\nof his thoughts, I enquired for the health of his daughter. The father's\r\nheart overcame him again.\r\n\r\n\"My world threatens to be a lonely one, Mr Marston,\" said he in a feeble\r\nvoice. \"You see a heartbroken man. Forgive the bitterness with which I\r\nhave spoken. Mariamne, I fear, is dying; and what is wealth now to me? I\r\nhave left her in Poland among my people. She seemed to feel some slight\r\nenjoyment in wandering from place to place; but her last letter tells me\r\nthat she is wearied of travelling, and has made up her mind to live and\r\ndie where she may be surrounded by her unhappy nation. I remain here\r\nonly to wind up my affairs, and in a week I quit England--and for ever.\"\r\n\r\nBut a new object caught my glance. Mordecai--who, while he was thus\r\nspeaking in paroxysms of alternate indignation and sorrow, had never for\r\na moment ceased to turn over his books and boxes--had accidentally\r\nshaken a pile of tin cases from its pinnacle, and the whole rolled down\r\nat my feet. On one of them I saw, with no very strong surprise, the\r\nwords--\"Mortgage--Mortimer Castle.\" The eyes of both glanced in the same\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n\"There,\" said the Israelite, \"you have your paternal acres in your\r\nhand--your Plantagenet forests, and your Tudor castle, all in a cubic\r\nfoot. On the chair where you are now sitting, your lordly brother sat\r\nyesterday, gathering up his skirts from the touch of every thing round\r\nhim, and evidently suffering all the torture of a man of fashion, forced\r\nto smile on the holder of his last mortgage. He is ruined--not worth a\r\nsixpence; Melton and Newmarket have settled that question for him. But\r\ndo you recognise that hand?\" He drew a letter from his portfolio. I knew\r\nthe writing: it was from my mother--on whom, now old and feeble, this\r\naccomplished _roue_ had been urging the sale of her jointure. Helpless\r\nand alone, she had consented to this fatal measure; and my noble\r\nbrother's visit to the Israelite had been for the purpose of inducing\r\nhim to make the purchase.\r\n\r\nI started up in indignation; declared that the result must reduce my\r\nunfortunate parent to beggary; and demanded by what means I could\r\npossibly prevent what was \"neither more nor less than an act of\r\nplunder.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see no means,\" said Mordecai coolly, \"except your making the purchase\r\nyourself, and thus securing the jointure to her ladyship. It is only ten\r\nthousand pounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"_I_ make the purchase! I have not the tenth part of the money upon\r\nearth. I ask you, what _is_ to be done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your brother has here the power of selling--and will sell, if the\r\nstarvation of fifty mothers stood in his way. Newmarket suffers no\r\nqualms of that kind; and, when his matters there are settled, his\r\ncoachmaker's bill for landaulets and britchskas will make him a\r\npedestrian for the rest of his life. But _I_ have refused the purchase;\r\nand it was chiefly on this subject that I was induced to invite you to\r\nmy 'dungeon,' as you not unjustly term it.\"\r\n\r\nThe picture of a mother, of whom I had always thought with the\r\ntenderness of a child, cast out in her old age to poverty, with the\r\nadded bitterness of being thus cast out by her reliance on the honour of\r\na cruel and treacherous son, rose before my eyes with such pain, that I\r\nabsolutely lost all power of speech, and could only look the distress\r\nwhich I felt. Mordecai gazed on me with an enquiring countenance.\r\n\r\n\"You love this mother, Mr Marston. You are a good son. We Israelites,\r\nwith all our faults, respect the feelings which 'honour the father and\r\nthe mother.' It is a holy love, and well earned by the cares and sorrows\r\nof parentage.\" He paused, and covered his forehead with his gigantic\r\nhands. I could hear him murmur the name of his daughter. The striking of\r\na neighbouring church clock startled him from his reverie.\r\n\r\nSuddenly again bustling among his papers, he said--\"Within this half\r\nhour, your brother is to call again for my definitive answer. Now,\r\nlisten to me. The jointure shall be purchased.\" I bit my lip; but he did\r\nnot leave me long in suspense--\"And _you_ shall be the purchaser.\" He\r\nwrote a cheque for the amount, and placed it in my hand.\r\n\r\n\"Mordecai, you are a noble fellow! But how am I to act upon this? I am\r\nworth nothing. I might as well attempt to repay millions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, so be it, Mr Marston. You are a man of honor, and a good son. You\r\nwill repay it when you can. I exact but one condition: that you will\r\ncome and visit Mariamne and me in Poland.\"\r\n\r\nA loud knock at the hall-door put an end to our interview.\r\n\r\n\"That is your brother,\" said he. \"You must not see him, as I choose to\r\nkeep the name of the purchaser to myself. Take your mother's letter with\r\nyou; and give her my best advice to write no more--at least to such\r\ncorrespondents as his lordship.\"\r\n\r\nI rose to take my leave. He followed me hastily; and, taking me by the\r\nhand, said--\"Another condition I have to make. It is, that not a\r\nsyllable of all that has passed between us on this subject shall be\r\nsuffered to transpire. I should make but a bad figure on 'Change, if I\r\nwere suspected of transactions in that style. Remember, it must be a\r\nprofound secret to all the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even to my wife?\" I asked. \"Is _she_ included?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" he replied, with a faint laugh; \"I look upon you as a mere\r\nmortal still. All vows are void in their nature, which require\r\nimpossibilities in their execution.\" We parted.\r\n\r\nI told my little city tale to Clotilde. She wept and smiled alternately,\r\nas I told it. Mordecai received all his due praise; and we pledged\r\nourselves to find out his Mariamne, in whatever corner of the Lithuanian\r\nwilderness she might have hidden her fantastic heart and head. But I had\r\nnow another duty. Within a few hours, we were on our way to the\r\njointure-house. It was a picturesque old building, the residence of the\r\nFather Abbot, in the times before the insatiable hand of Somerset had\r\nfallen upon the monasteries. We reached it in the twilight of a gentle\r\nday, when all its shrubs and flowers were filling the air with freshness\r\nand fragrance. I found my mother less enfeebled than I had expected; and\r\nstill affectionate and tender, as she had always been to her long-absent\r\nson. She was still fully susceptible of the honours which had now opened\r\nbefore me. Clotilde almost knelt before her noble air and venerable\r\nbeauty. My mother could not grow weary with gazing on the expressive\r\ncountenance of my beautiful wife. I had secured my parent's comfort for\r\nlife; and I, too, was happy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy embassy, like all other embassies, had its vexations; but on the\r\nwhole I had reason to congratulate myself on its acceptance. My\r\nreception at St Petersburg was most distinguished; I had arrived at a\r\nfortunate period. The French expedition to Egypt had alarmed the Russian\r\ncouncils for Constantinople; a possession to which every Russian looks,\r\nin due time, as naturally as to the right of his copecks and caftan. But\r\nthe victory of Aboukir, which had destroyed the French fleet, again\r\nraised the popular exultation, and English heroism was the topic of\r\nevery tongue. The incomparable campaign of the Russian army in Italy;\r\nthe recovery, in three months, of all which it had cost the power of\r\nFrance, and the genius of her greatest general, in two years of pitched\r\nbattles, sanguinary sieges, artful negotiation, and incessant intrigue,\r\nto obtain, excited the nation to the highest degree of enthusiasm, and\r\nthe embassy basked in the broadest sunshine of popularity. Fete now\r\nsucceeded fete; the standards taken in Suwarrow's battles, the proudest\r\ntrophies ever won by Russian arms, were carried in procession to the\r\ncathedral; illuminations of the capital, balls in the palaces, and\r\npublic sports on the waters and banks of the Neva, kept St Petersburg in\r\na perpetual tumult of joy.\r\n\r\nBut all was not sunshine: the character of the sovereign in a despotism\r\ndemands perpetual study; and Paul was freakish and headstrong beyond all\r\nhuman calculation. No man was more misunderstood at a distance, nor less\r\ncapable of being understood near. He had some striking qualities. He was\r\ngenerous, bold, and high-principled; but the simplest accident would\r\nturn all those qualities into their reverse. To-day he was ready to\r\ndevote himself to the cause of Europe; every soldier of Russia must\r\nmarch: but, when the morrow came, he revoked the order for his troops,\r\nand cashiered the secretaries who had been rash enough to take him at\r\nhis word. The secret was in his brain; disease was gathering on his\r\nintellect, and he was daily becoming dangerous to those nearest him. The\r\nresult was long foreseen. In Spain, Gil Blas recommends that no man who\r\nwishes for long life should quarrel with his cook. In Russia, let no\r\nCzar rouse the suspicions of his courtiers. As the Pagans hung chaplets\r\non the statues of their gods in victory, and flogged them in defeat, the\r\nRussians, in every casualty of their arms, turned a scowling eye upon\r\ntheir liege lord: and the retreat of Suwarrow, the greatest of Russian\r\nsoldiers, from Switzerland, at once stripped the Emperor of all his\r\npopularity.\r\n\r\nMy position now became doubly anxious. Even despots love popularity, and\r\nthe Czar was alternately furious and frightened at its loss. Guards were\r\nplanted in every part of the city, with orders to disperse all groups.\r\nEvery man who looked at the Imperial equipage as it passed through the\r\nstreets, was in danger of being arrested as an assassin. Nobles were\r\nsuddenly exiled--none knew why, or where. The cloud was thickening\r\nround the palace. It is a perilous thing to be the one object on which\r\nevery eye involuntary turns, as the cause of public evil. Rumours of\r\nconspiracy rose and died, and were heard again. In free governments\r\npublic discontents have room to escape, and they escape. In despotisms\r\nthey have no room to evaporate, and they condense until they explode. St\r\nPetersburg at length became a place of silence and solitude by day, and\r\nof murmurs and meetings by night. It reminded one of Rome in the days of\r\nNero; and I looked with perpetual alarm for the catastrophe of Nero.\r\n\r\nThe Russian is a submissive man, and even capable of strong attachment\r\nto the throne: but there is no spot of the earth where national injury\r\nis more deeply resented; and Paul had been regarded as tarnishing the\r\nfame of Russia. His abandonment of Suwarrow--a warrior, of whom the\r\nannals of the Russian army will bear record to the end of time--had\r\nstung all classes. More than a soldier, Suwarrow was a great military\r\ngenius. He gained battles without tactics, and in defiance of them. He\r\nhad astonished the Austrian generals by the fierce rapidity of his\r\nmovements; he had annihilated the French armies in Italy by the\r\ndesperate daring of his attacks. Wherever Suwarrow came, he was\r\nconqueror. In his whole career he had never been beaten. The soldiery\r\ntold numberless tales of his eccentricity--laughed at, mimicked, and\r\nadored him. The nation honoured him as the national warrior. But the\r\nfailure of some of his detached corps in Switzerland had embarrassed the\r\ncampaign; and Paul, capricious as the winds, hastily recalled him. The\r\npopular indignation now burst out in every form of anger. Placards fixed\r\nat night on the palace walls; gipsy ballads sung in the streets;\r\nmaskers, at the countless balls of the nobles; satires in quaint verse,\r\nand national proverbs, showed the public resentment to be universal.\r\nEvery incident furnished some contemptuous comment. The Czar had built a\r\nwing to one of the palaces of Catharine. The addition wanted the\r\nstateliness of the original fabric. This epigram was posted on the\r\nbuilding, in angry Slavonic:--\r\n\r\n  \"One built a palace, one a stall.\r\n  One marble; one a plaster wall.\r\n  One sure to stand; one sure to fall.\r\n  So much for Catharine--and for Paul!\"\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this growing perplexity, the English messenger arrived.\r\nHis tidings had been long anticipated, yet they came with the effect of\r\na thunderclap. The cabinet had resigned! I of course now waited only for\r\nmy order to return. But, in the mean time, this event formidably\r\nincreased the difficulties of my position. Foreigners will never allow\r\nthemselves to comprehend the nature of any English transaction whatever.\r\nThey deal with them all as if they were scenes on a stage. In the\r\nincorrigible absurdity of their theatrical souls, they imagine a\r\nparliamentary defeat to be a revolution, and the change of a ministry\r\nthe fall of an empire. Paul instantly cast off all his old partialities.\r\nHe pronounced England undone. The star of France was to be the light of\r\nthe west; he himself to be the luminary of the east. The bold ambition\r\nof Catharine was to be realized; however, without the system or the\r\nsagacity of her imperial genius. But Paul was to learn the terrible\r\nlesson of a despotic government. The throne separated from the people,\r\nis the more in peril the more widely it is separated. The people _would_\r\nnot be carried along with their master to the feet of his new political\r\nidol. The substantial virtues of the national character resisted that\r\nFrench alliance, which must be begun at once by prostration and\r\ningratitude. France was their new taunter. England was their old ally.\r\nThey hated France for its republican insolence; they honoured England\r\nfor its resolute determination to fight out the battle, not for its own\r\nsake alone, but for the cause of all nations. Paul, in the attempt to\r\npartition the globe, was narrowing his supremacy to his own sepulchre.\r\n\r\nYet, this time of national gloom was the most splendid period of the\r\ncourt. With the double purpose of recovering his popularity, and\r\nconcealing his negotiations, Paul plunged into the most extraordinary\r\nfestivity. Balls, masquerades, and fetes succeeded each other with\r\nrestless extravagance. But the contrast of the saturnine Emperor with\r\nthe sudden change of his court was too powerful. It bore the look of\r\ndesperation; though for what purpose, was still a mystery to the\r\nmillion. I heard many a whisper among the diplomatic circle, that this\r\nwhirl of life, this hot and fierce dissipation, was, in all Russian\r\nreigns, the sure precursor of a catastrophe; though none could yet\r\nventure to predict its nature. It was like the furious and frenzied\r\nindulgence of a crew in a condemned ship, breaking up the chests and\r\ndrinking the liquors, in the conviction that none would survive the\r\nvoyage. Even I, with all my English disregard of the speculative\r\nfrivolities which to the foreigner are substance and facts, was startled\r\nby the increasing glare of those hurried and feverish festivities. More\r\nthan once, as I entered the imperial saloon, crowded with the civil and\r\nmilitary uniforms of every court of Europe, and exhibiting at once\r\nEuropean taste and Asiatic magnificence, I could scarcely suppress the\r\nfeeling that I was only entering the most stately of theatres; where,\r\nwith all the temporary glitter of the stage, the sounds of the\r\norchestra, and the passion and poetry of the characters--the fifth act\r\nwas preparing, and the curtain was to fall on the death of nobles and\r\nkings.\r\n\r\nThe impression that evil was to come, already seemed to be universal.\r\nRumours of popular conspiracy, fresh discoveries by the police, and new\r\ntales of imperial eccentricity, kept the public mind in constant\r\nfitfulness. At length, I received the formal communication of a\r\n\"challenge\" from the Czar to my sovereign, along with all the other\r\ncrowned heads of Europe, to meet him in a _champ-clos_, and, sword in\r\nhand, decide the quarrels of nations. With this despatch came an\r\ninvitation for the whole diplomatic body to a masquerade! in which all\r\nwere commanded to appear as knights in armour--the Czar, as grand-master\r\nof the Order of Malta, exhibiting himself in the panoply in which he was\r\nto settle the disputes of mankind.\r\n\r\nPerplexities like those form a large share of the trials of the foreign\r\nambassador. To attend the fete was embarrassing; but to decline the\r\ninvitation, would have been equivalent to demanding my passports. And I\r\nmust acknowledge, that if the eye was to be gratified by the most superb\r\nand the most curious of all displays, never was there an occasion more\r\nfitted for its indulgence. All the armouries of Europe, and of Asia,\r\nseemed to have been searched for the arms and ornaments of this\r\nassemblage. The Kremlin had given up its barbaric shields and caps of\r\nbronze; the plate-mail of the Crusader; the gold-inlaid morions and\r\ncuirasses of France; the silver chain-mail of the Circassian; the steel\r\ncorslet of the German chivalry; and a whole host of the various and rich\r\nequipments of the Greek, the Hungarian, the Moresco, and the Turkoman,\r\nmade the Winter palace a blaze of knighthood.\r\n\r\nYet, to me, after the first excitement, the whole conveyed a deep\r\nimpression of melancholy. It irresistibly reminded me of the last\r\nceremonial of dead sovereigns, the \"Chapelle Ardente.\" Even the curtains\r\nwhich fell round the throne, fringed with jewels as they were, to me\r\nlooked funereal. The immense golden candelabra were to me the lights\r\nround a bier. I almost imagined that I could see the sword and sceptre\r\nlaid across the coffin, and all of the Lord of Empire that remained, a\r\ncorpse within.\r\n\r\nI was roused from my reluctant reverie by the approach of a group of\r\nmasks, who came dancing towards the recess where I had retired, wearied\r\nwith the general noise, and the exhaustion of the fete. One of the\r\ncasements opened into the famous Conservatory; and I was enjoying the\r\nscents of the thousand flowers and shrubs, of, perhaps, the finest\r\ncollection in the world. But, in the shade, the group had evidently\r\noverlooked me; for they began to speak of matters which they could not\r\nhave designed for a stranger's ear. The conduct of the Czar, the wrongs\r\nof Russia, and the \"necessity of coming to a decision,\" were the topics.\r\nSuddenly, as if to avert suspicion, one of the group struck up a popular\r\nair on the little three-stringed guitar which throws the Russian crowd\r\ninto such ecstasies; and they began a dance, accompanying it by a\r\nmurmuring chorus, which soon convinced me of the dangerous neighbourhood\r\ninto which I had fallen. The words became well known afterwards. No\r\nlanguage excels the Russian in energy; but I must give them in the\r\nweakness of a translation.\r\n\r\n  The Neva may rush\r\n  To its fountain again;\r\n  The bill of a bird\r\n  Lake Ladoga may drain;\r\n  The blast from the Pole\r\n  May be held in a chain;\r\n  But the cry of a Nation\r\n  Was never in vain!\r\n\r\n  When the bones of our chiefs\r\n  Feed the wolf and the kite;\r\n  When the spurs of our squadrons\r\n  Are bloody with flight;\r\n  When the Black Eagle's banner\r\n  Is torn from its height;\r\n  Then, dark-hearted dreamer!\r\n  Beware of the _night_!\r\n\r\n  I hear in the darkness\r\n  The tread of the bold;\r\n  They stop not for iron,\r\n  They stop not for gold;\r\n  But the Sword has an edge,\r\n  And the Scarf has a fold.\r\n  Proud master of millions,\r\n  Thy tale has been told!\r\n\r\n  Now the chambers are hush'd,\r\n  And the strangers are gone,\r\n  And the sire is no sire,\r\n  And the son is no son,\r\n  And the mightiest of Earth\r\n  Sleeps for ever alone,\r\n  The worm for his brother,\r\n  The clay for his throne!\r\n\r\nMy conviction was complete, when, in the whirl of the dance, a small\r\nroll of paper dropped from the robe of one of the maskers, and fell at\r\nmy feet. In taking it up to return it to him, I saw that it was a list\r\nof names, and, at the head, a name which, from private information, I\r\nknew to be involved in dark political purposes. The thought flashed\r\nacross me, in connexion with the chorus which I had just heard, that the\r\npaper was of too much importance to be suffered to leave my\r\npossession.--The life of the sovereign might be involved. The group, who\r\nhad been evidently startled by my sudden appearance among them, now\r\nsurrounded me, and the loser of the paper insisted on its instant\r\nsurrender. The violence of his demand only confirmed my resolution. He\r\ngrew more agitated still, and the group seized me. I laid my hand upon\r\nmy sword. This measure stopped them for the moment. But in the next, I\r\nsaw a knife brandished in the air, and felt myself wounded in the arm.\r\nMy attempt to grasp the weapon had alone saved me from its being buried\r\nin my heart. But the fracas now attracted notice; a crowd rushed towards\r\nus, and the group suddenly scattered away, leaving me still in\r\npossession of the paper. My wound bled, and I felt faint, and desired to\r\nbe led into the open air. My mask was taken off; and this was scarcely\r\ndone when I heard my name pronounced, and saw the welcome countenance of\r\nmy friend Guiscard by my side. He had arrived but on that day, on a\r\nmission from his court; had, with his usual eagerness of friendship,\r\ngone to enquire for me at the hotel of the embassy; and thus followed\r\nme to the fete at the critical time. As he supported me to my equipage,\r\nI communicated the circumstances of the rencontre to his clear head and\r\ngenerous heart; and he fully agreed with me on the duty of instantly\r\napprising the Czar of his probable danger. As I was unable to move\r\nthrough pain and feebleness, he offered to take the roll with him, and\r\ndemand an interview with the sovereign himself, if possible; or, if not,\r\nwith the governor of the palace. The paper contained not only names of\r\nindividuals, all, long before, objects of public suspicion, but a sketch\r\nof the imperial apartments, and, at the bottom, the words--\"three hours\r\nafter midnight.\" I looked at my watch, it was already half-past two.\r\nThis might, or might not be, the appointed night for this dreadful\r\nbusiness; but, if it were, there was but one half hour between the\r\nthrone and the grave. Guiscard hurried off, leaving me in the deepest\r\nanxiety, but promising to return as speedily as in his power. But he\r\ncame not. My anxiety grew intolerable; hour after hour passed away,\r\nwhile I reckoned minute after minute, as if they were so much drained\r\nfrom my own existence. Even, if I had been able to move, it was\r\nimpossible to know where to follow him. His steps might have been\r\nwatched. Doubtless the conspirators were on the alert to prevent any\r\napproach to the palace. He might have fallen by the pistol of some of\r\nthose men, who had not scrupled to conspire against their monarch. The\r\nmost miserable of nights at length wore away; but it was only to be\r\nsucceeded by the most fearful of mornings. The career of Paul was\r\nclosed! On the entrance of the chamberlains into his sleeping apartment,\r\nthe unhappy Czar was found dead. There could be no doubt that he had\r\nperished by treason. He was strangled. The intelligence no sooner spread\r\nthrough the capital, than it produced a burst of national sorrow. All\r\nhis errors were forgotten. All his good qualities were remembered.\r\n\r\nBut where was my gallant and excellent friend--Guiscard?--Of him I heard\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nAnother week of suspense, and he appeared. His history was of the most\r\nsingular kind. On the night when I had last seen him, he had made his\r\nway through all obstacles into the palace, and been promised a private\r\ninterview with the Czar. But, while he urged that no time should be\r\nlost, he had sufficient proof that there could be no chance of an\r\ninterview. A succession of apologies was made: the 'Czar was at\r\nsupper'--'he was engaged with the minister'--'he had gone to rest.' In\r\ntotal hopelessness of communicating his pressing intelligence in person,\r\nhe at length consented to seal the roll, and place it in the hands of\r\none of the officers of rank in the household. But that officer himself\r\nwas in the conspiracy. The paper was immediately destroyed; and the\r\nbearer of it was considered to be too dangerous to be sent back. He was\r\nput under arrest in an apartment of the palace, and told that his life\r\ndepended on his silence. He urged his diplomatic character in vain. The\r\nonly answer was the sword of the conspirator turned to his throat. But\r\nwithin the week the revolution was complete, and he was set at liberty.\r\nA new monarch, a new government, a new feeling followed this dangerous\r\nact. But the character of the young monarch was made to be popular; the\r\nreign of caprice was at an end. The empire felt relieved; and Russia\r\nbegan the most glorious period of her national history.\r\n\r\nMy mission was now accomplished, for I refused to hold the embassy under\r\na rival cabinet; but I carried with me from St Petersburg two\r\ntrophies:--the former was the treaty concluded by Paul with France for\r\nthe march of an army, in conjunction with a French column of 300,000\r\nmen, to invade India--a document which had hitherto baffled all\r\ndiplomatic research; the other was the pathetic and noble letter of\r\nAlexander to the British sovereign, proposing a restoration of the\r\nnational friendship.\r\n\r\nI took my leave of the Russian court with a most gracious audience of\r\nits new monarch. I saw him long afterwards, under different\r\ncircumstances, struggling with a tremendous war, pressed by every\r\ndifficulty which could beset the throne, and throwing the last\r\nmelancholy and doubtful cast for the independence of Europe. But, both\r\nnow and then, I saw him, what nature had made him--a noble being. His\r\nstature was tall and commanding; and he was one of the most striking\r\nfigures of his court when in the uniform of his guards. But his manner\r\nwas still superior--it was at once affable and dignified; he spoke of\r\nEuropean interests with intelligence, of his own intentions with\r\ncandour, and of England with a rational respect for its spirit and\r\ninstitutions. Of his own country, he expressed himself with candour. \"I\r\nfeel,\" said he, \"that I have a great trust laid on me, and I am\r\ndetermined to fulfil it. I shall not make the throne a bed of roses.\r\nThere is still much to be done, and I shall do what I can. I have the\r\nadvantage of a fine material in the people. No being is at once more\r\nsusceptible of improvement, and more grateful for it, than the Russian.\r\nHe has quick faculties and an honest heart. If the common hazards of\r\nempire should come, I know that he will not desert me. In the last\r\nextremity of human fortunes, I shall not desert him.\"\r\n\r\nThose generous declarations were gallantly realized on both sides within\r\na few years. I was not then aware that the Imperial prediction would be\r\nsoon brought to the test. But it was gloriously fulfilled at Moscow, and\r\nproudly registered in the fragments of the throne of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nImpatient as I was to reach England, I left St Petersburg with regret.\r\nClotilde left it with those feelings which belong to the finer fancy of\r\nwoman. She remembered it as the scene where she had enjoyed the most\r\ndazzling portion of her life; where every countenance had met her with\r\nsmiles, and every tongue was prodigal of praise; where the day rose on\r\nthe promise of new enjoyments, and the night descended in royal\r\nfestivity. As we drove along the banks of the Neva, she more than once\r\nstopped the carriage, to give herself a parting glance at the long vista\r\nof stately buildings, which she was then to look upon, perhaps, for the\r\nlast time. The scene was certainly of the most striking order; for we\r\nhad commenced our journey on the evening of one of the national\r\nfestivals; and we thus had the whole population, in all their holiday\r\ndresses, to give animation to the general aspect of the massive and\r\ngigantic architecture. The Neva was covered with barges of the most\r\ngraceful form; the fronts of the citizens' houses were hung with\r\ndecorations; music sounded from a vast orchestra in front of the palace;\r\nand the air re-echoed with the voices of thousands and tens of\r\nthousands, all evidently determined to be happy for the time. We both\r\ngazed in silence and admiration. The carriage had accidentally drawn up\r\nin view of the little hut which is preserved in the Neva as the dwelling\r\nof Peter. I saw a tear glistening on the long eyelash of my lovely\r\nfellow traveller.\r\n\r\n\"If I wanted a proof,\" said she, \"of the intellectual greatness of man,\r\nI should find it in this spot. I may see in that hut the emblem of his\r\nmind. That a Russian, two centuries ago--almost before the name of\r\nRussia was known in Europe--while its court had scarcely emerged from\r\nthe feuds of barbarous factions, and its throne had been but just\r\nrescued from the hands of the Tartar--should have conceived the design\r\nof such an empire, and should have crowned his design with such a\r\ncapital, is to me the most memorable effort of a ruling mind, within all\r\nhuman recollection.\"\r\n\r\n\"Clotilde, I was not aware that you were inclined to give the great Czar\r\nso tender a tribute,\" I said laughingly, at her embarrassment in the\r\ndiscovery of a tear stealing down her cheek.\r\n\r\nTruth was in her reply. \"I agree in the common censure of the darker\r\nportions of his course. But I can now judge of him only by what I see.\r\nWho is to know the truth of his private history? What can be more unsafe\r\nthan to judge of the secret actions of princes, from the interested or\r\nignorant narratives of a giddy court, or foreign enemies? But the\r\nevidence round us allows of no deception. These piles of marble are\r\nunanswerable;--these are the vindications of kings. The man who, sitting\r\nin that hut, in the midst of the howling wilderness, imagined the\r\nexistence of such a city rising round him and his line--at once bringing\r\nhis country into contact with Europe, and erecting a monument of\r\nnational greatness, to which Europe itself, in its thousand years of\r\nprogress, has no equal--must have had a nature made for the highest\r\ntasks of human advancement. Of all the panegyrics of an Imperial life,\r\nSt Petersburg is the most Imperial.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe passed rapidly through the Russian provinces, and, intending to\r\nembark in one of our frigates cruising the Baltic, felt all the delight\r\nof having at length left the damp and dreary forests of Livonia far down\r\nin the horizon, and again feeling the breezes blowing from that ocean\r\nwhich the Englishman instinctively regards as a portion of his home.\r\nBut, as we drove along the smooth sands which line so many leagues of\r\nthe Baltic, and enjoyed with the full sense of novelty the various\r\ncontrast of sea and shore, we were startled by the roar of guns from the\r\nramparts of Riga, followed by the peal of bells. What victory, what\r\ndefeat, what great event, did those announce? The intelligence at length\r\nbroke on us at the gates; and it was well worth all our interest. \"Peace\r\nwith France.\" The English ambassador had arrived in Paris. \"War was at\r\nend, and the world was to be at rest once more.\" I changed my route\r\nimmediately, and flew on the road to Paris.\r\n\r\nMy life was destined to be a succession of scenes. It had been thrown\r\ninto a whirl of memorable incidents, any one of which would have served\r\nfor the tumult of fifty years, and for the meditation of the fifty\r\nafter. But this was the period of powerful, sometimes of terrible,\r\nvicissitudes. All ranks of men were reached by them. Kings and statesmen\r\nonly felt them first: they penetrated to the peasant; and the Continent\r\nunderwent a moral convulsion--an outpouring of the general elements of\r\nsociety--like that of some vast inundation, sweeping away the landmarks,\r\nand uprooting the produce of the soil; until it subsided, leaving the\r\nsoil in some places irreparably stripped--in others, filled with a new\r\nfertility.\r\n\r\nI found France in a state of the highest exultation. The national cry\r\nwas, \"that she had covered herself with glory;\" and to earn that cry,\r\nprobably, no Frenchman who ever existed would hesitate to march to\r\nTimbuctoo, or swim across the Atlantic. The name of \"conquest\" is a\r\nspell which no brain, from Calais to Bayonne, has ever thought of\r\nresisting. The same spell lives, masters, domineers over the national\r\nmind, to this hour; and will last, long after Paris has dropped into the\r\ndepths of its own catacombs, and its fifteen fortresses are calcined\r\nunder the cannon of some Austrian or Russian invader. It will be\r\nimpossible to tell future ages the scene which France then presented to\r\nthe mind. If objects are capable of record, impressions are beyond the\r\npower of the pen. No image can be conveyed to posterity by the\r\nsensations which crowded on Europe in the course of the French\r\nRevolution--the rapidity, the startling lustre, and the deep despair; as\r\nit went forth crushing all that the earth had of solid or sacred. It was\r\nnow only in its midway. The pause had come; but it was only the pause in\r\nthe hurricane--the still heavier trial was at hand. Even as a stranger,\r\nI could see that it was but a lull. Every thing that met the eye in\r\nParis was a preparative for war. The soldier was every thing, and every\r\nwhere. I looked in vain for the Republican costumes which I so fearfully\r\nremembered. They had been flung aside for the uniform of the Imperial\r\nGuard; or were to be seen only on a few haggard and desolate men, who\r\ncame out in the twilight, and sat in silence, and gloomy dreams of\r\nrevenge, in some suburb _cafe_. Where were the deadly tribunals, with\r\ntheir drunken judges, their half-naked assassins, and the eternal clank\r\nof the guillotines?--all vanished; the whole sullen furniture of the\r\nRepublican drama flung behind the scenes, and the stage filled with the\r\nsong and the dance--the pageant and the feast--with all France gazing\r\nand delighted at the spectacle. But, my still stronger curiosity was\r\nfixed on the one man who had been the soul of the transformation. I have\r\nbefore my eye at this moment his slender and _spirituel_ figure; his\r\ncalm, but most subtle glance; and the incomparable expression of his\r\nsmile. His face was classic--the _ideal_ of thought; and, when Canova\r\nafterwards transferred it to marble, he could not have made it less like\r\nflesh and blood. It was intensely pale--pure, profound, Italian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LETTER FROM LONDON.\r\n\r\nBY A RAILWAY WITNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BOGLE,--It is ten thousand pities that you are not here. Why the\r\ndeuce can't you make yourself useful to the commonwealth, by calculating\r\na gradient, laying down a curve, or preparing a table of traffic, in\r\norder to obtain the proper qualification for a railway witness? Nothing\r\nin this world is easier. You have only to sit at your window for a given\r\namount of hours once a-week, and note down the number of the cabs and\r\ncarts which jolt and jingle to the Broomielaw; or, if you like that\r\nbetter, to ascertain the quality of the soil three feet beneath your own\r\nwine-cellar; and you are booked for a month's residence in London, free\r\nquarters in a first-rate hotel, five guineas a-day, and all expenses\r\npaid. I confess that this regimen seems to me both profitable and\r\npleasant. I have been here for six weeks feeding on the fat of the land,\r\ndrinking claret which even a Leith man would scarcely venture to\r\nanathematize, white-baiting at Blackwall, and varying these sensual\r\nqualifications with an occasional trip to Richmond and Ascot races. I\r\nhave, moreover, mark you, a bunch of as pretty bank paper in my pocket\r\nas ever was paid into the Exchequer; and the whole equivalent I have\r\ngiven for this kind and liberal treatment was certain evidence touching\r\nthe iron-trade of Ayrshire, which I poured into the drowsy ears of five\r\nworthy gentlemen, about as familiar with that subject as you are with\r\nthe mythology of the Chinese. Long life to the railway mania, say I! It\r\nhas been treasure-trove to some of us. The only thing I regret is my\r\ninability to carry the war into the enemy's country, and make my fortune\r\nout of the English companies. I have the appetite but not the power;\r\nand, after all, it would hardly make up for Flodden.\r\n\r\nI like this sort of life much better than assorting cargoes and\r\nsuperintending the arrival of sugar casks. There is no want of society,\r\nfor I find myself here surrounded by the old familiar faces. I do not\r\nthink there is a soul in this hotel except townsmen of our own. You meet\r\nin the committee rooms the same excellent fellows whom you have daily\r\nencountered for the last ten years on the Exchange, and they are all\r\ngetting fatter upon their work. Edinburgh, too, has furnished her quota.\r\nWe have Writers to the Signet by the score, and a sprinkling of the\r\nyoung Advocates whom we are accustomed to meet upon circuit. Poor lads!\r\nit does one good to see them thriving. This must be a very different\r\nsort of business from the weariful Parliament House, and the two square\r\nyards of processes, with a fee of three guineas for many an interminable\r\ncondescendence. I believe they would have no objection if the Session of\r\nParliament were declared perpetual; and for that matter no more would I.\r\n\r\nCertainly, of all tribunals ever invented by the ingenuity of man, a\r\nParliamentary Committee is the most extraordinary. It is a court of\r\nenquiry consisting of five members, whose principal qualification is\r\nabsolute previous ignorance of the localities and conflicting interests\r\nwith regard to which they must decide. Of their impartiality, therefore,\r\nthere can be no doubt. You or I might just as well sit down at a\r\nmoment's notice, and adjudicate upon the merits of three competing lines\r\nbetween Pekin and Canton, with an equal chance of arriving at a\r\nsatisfactory conclusion. Of course they must be guided entirely by\r\nevidence, and have plenty of materials laid before them from which they\r\nmay pick and choose. It is the richest thing in the world to see two\r\ncrack engineers pitted against each other. The first, who appears on\r\nbehalf of the line, does not know and cannot conceive the slightest\r\nengineering difficulty. If a mountain stands in his way, he plunges\r\nfearlessly into its bowels, finds in the interior strata of surpassing\r\nmineral wealth, yet marvellously adapted for the purposes of a four-mile\r\ntunnel, and brings you out sound and safe at the opposite side, as\r\nthough he had been perforating a gigantic cheese instead of hammering\r\nhis path through whinstone coeval with the creation. If a lake stands in\r\nthe way, he will undertake to drain it, with immense advantage to the\r\nneighbouring proprietors. If a valley intervenes, he will bridge it with\r\na viaduct, which shall put to shame the grandest relics of antiquity. He\r\nhas no knowledge of such bugbears as steep gradients or dangerous\r\ncurves; a little hocus-pocus with the compasses transforms all these\r\ninto gentle undulations, and sweeps of the most graceful description. He\r\nwill run you his rails right through the heart of the most populous\r\ncity,--yea, even Glasgow herself,--and across the streets, without the\r\nslightest interruption to the traffic. He will contrive so, that the\r\nhissing of the locomotive shall be as graceful a sound as the plashing\r\nof a fountain in the midst of our bisected squares; and he is indignant\r\nat the supposition that any human being can be besotted enough to prefer\r\nthe prospect of a budding garden, to a clean double pair of rails\r\nbeneath his bedroom window, with a jolly train steaming it along at the\r\nrate of some fifty miles per hour.\r\n\r\nThe opposing engineer has a contrary story to tell. He has the utmost\r\nconfidence in the general ability of his scientific friend, but on this\r\noccasion he has the misfortune to differ in opinion. Very carefully has\r\nhe gone over the whole of the line surveyed. He is sorry to say that the\r\ngradients are utterly impossible, and the curves approaching to a\r\ncircle. Tunnelling is out of the question. How are two miles of\r\nquicksand and two of basaltic rock to be gone through? The first is\r\ndeeper than the Serbonian bog, and would swallow up the whole British\r\narmy. The second could not be pierced in a shorter time than Pharaoh\r\ntook to construct the pyramids of Egypt. He considers a railway in the\r\nheart of a town to be an absolute and intolerable nuisance; and, on the\r\nwhole, looking at the plan before him, he has come to the conclusion,\r\nthat a more dangerous and impracticable line was never yet laid before a\r\ncommittee of the United Parliament of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nSo much for the engineering Hector and Achilles. Out of these two\r\nopinions, of necessity, must the five respectable members on the bench\r\nform their judgment; for of themselves they know nothing, having been\r\npurposely selected on account of their superior ignorance.\r\nCross-examination makes the matter still worse. A cantankerous waspish\r\ncounsel, with the voice of an exasperated cockatoo, endeavours to make\r\nthe opposing engineer contradict himself. He might as well try to\r\noverturn Ailsa Crag. He of the impossible gradients is the hero of a\r\nhundred committees, quite accustomed to legal artifice, cool, wary, and\r\nself-collected. He receives every thrust with a pleasant smile, and\r\nsometimes returns them with damaging effect. If close pressed, he is\r\nconscious that behind him is a thicket of algebra, into which neither\r\ncounsel nor judges will dare to follow; and so fortified by the\r\nmysteries of his calling, he is ready to defy the universe. Then come\r\nthe hordes of subordinate witnesses, the gentlemen who are to give\r\nevidence for and against the bill. One side represents the country as\r\nabounding in mineral produce and agricultural wealth: the other likens\r\nit unto Patmos, or the stony Arabia. Tims swears that the people of his\r\ndistrict are mad, insane, rabid in favour of the line. Jenkins, his\r\nnext-door neighbour, on the contrary, protests that if the rails were\r\nlaid down to-morrow, they would be torn up by an insurrection of the\r\npopulace _en masse_. John thinks the Dreep-daily Extension is the only\r\none at all suited to supply the wants of the country; Sandy opines that\r\nthe Powhead's Junction is the true and genuine potato; and both John and\r\nSandy, Tims and Jenkins, are backed by a host of corroborators. Then\r\ncome the speeches of the counsel, and rare specimens they are of\r\nunadulterated oratory. I swear to you, Bogle, that, no later than a week\r\nago, I listened to such a picture of Glasgow and the Clyde, from the\r\nlips of a gentleman eminent alike in law and letters, as would have\r\nthrown a diorama of Damascus into the shade. He had it all, sir, from\r\nthe orchards of Clydesdale to the banks of Bothwell, the pastoral\r\nslopes of Ruglen, and the emerald solitudes of the Green. The river\r\nflowed down towards the sea in translucent waves of crystal. From the\r\nparapets of the bridge you watched the salmon cleaving their way upwards\r\nin vivid lines of light. Never did Phoebus beam upon a lovelier object\r\nthan the fair suburb of the Gorbals, as seen from the Broomielaw,\r\nreposing upon its shadow in perfect stillness. Then came the forest of\r\nmasts, the activity of the dockyards, and\r\n\r\n  \"The impress of shipwrights, whose hard toil\r\n  Doth scarce divide the Sunday from the week.\"\r\n\r\nFurther down, the villas of the merchant princes burst upon your view,\r\neach of them a perfect Sirmio--then Port-Glasgow, half spanned by the\r\narch of a dissolving rainbow--Dumbarton, grand and solemn as became the\r\ndeath-place of the Bruce--Ben Lomond, with its hoary head swathed in\r\nimpenetrable clouds--and lo! the ocean and the isles. Not a Glasgow man\r\nin the committee-room but yearned with love and admiration towards the\r\ngifted speaker, who certainly did make out a case for the Queen of the\r\nWest such as no matter-of-fact person could possibly have believed. And\r\nall this was done by merely substituting a Claude Lorraine glass for our\r\nordinary dingy atmosphere. The outline was most correct and graphic, but\r\nthe secret lay in the handling and distribution of the colours. I shall\r\nnot wonder if the whole committee, clerk included come down this autumn\r\nto catch a glimpse of that terrestrial paradise.\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief and unexaggerated abstract of the transactions of these\r\nrailway committees; and you may judge for yourself how far the members\r\nare likely to understand the true circumstances of the case from\r\nevidence so singularly conflicting. Sometimes three or four days are\r\nwasted before they can even comprehend the precise position of the lines\r\nwhich they are required to consider, and, after all, these impressions\r\nmust be of the haziest description. For my own part, I think the\r\nlegislature has made a most palpable mistake in not intrusting such\r\nimportant functions to parties who possess competent local knowledge;\r\nand I am satisfied that the result of the present session has proved the\r\ninsufficiency of the system. I demur altogether to the propriety of\r\ndevolving upon Members of Parliament the duties of a civil jury. They\r\nhave surely enough to do in weighing and determining the larger\r\nquestions of policy, without entering into the minute details\r\nnecessarily involved in the consideration of railways, roads, bridges,\r\nand canals. These should be transferred to parties conversant with such\r\nsubjects, and responsible to the public for their decisions. Besides\r\nthis, the direct pecuniary loss to Scotland by the present system of\r\nsending witnesses to London--though personally I have no reason to\r\ncomplain--is quite enormous, and demands attention in a national point\r\nof view. It is calculated that not less than a million and a half\r\nsterling, has been expended in the course of last year in carrying the\r\nScottish bills through Parliament, and by far the greater part of this\r\nsum has been absorbed by plethoric London, and cannot by possibility\r\nreturn. Now, the whole annual value of the lands and houses in Scotland\r\ndoes not exceed ten millions, (in 1843, it was little more than\r\nnine)--an amount which is totally inadequate to afford so prodigious a\r\ndeduction as this, for the mere purpose of procuring authority to carry\r\nour own schemes into execution. That the seventh part of the rental of a\r\ncountry should be drawn away from it, and expended beyond its\r\nboundaries, in the course of simple preliminary investigations, is not\r\nonly an exorbitant abuse, but, to my mind, a clear demonstration of the\r\ntotal falsity of the system. It may have worked tolerably when there was\r\nless work to do; but the amazing increase of private bills during the\r\nlast few years must render a new arrangement necessary. I wish our\r\ncountrymen would be a little more alive to the vast benefit of local\r\ninstitutions in a pecuniary point of view. Can there be any doubt, that,\r\nif the details connected with all the private bills applicable to\r\nScotland, were referred to a paid board of commissioners sitting\r\npermanently in Edinburgh, whose judgment of course would be subject to\r\nthe review of Parliament, the business would be got through, not only\r\nmore cheaply, but with greater satisfaction and dispatch? I cannot see\r\nwhy London should be entitled to this exclusive monopoly, or the\r\nprinciple of centralization pushed so far as to injure the extremities\r\nof the empire. The private committee business has already become an\r\nabsolute nuisance to the whole bulk of the members. It is a function for\r\nwhich few of them have been educated, which is in itself highly\r\ndistasteful, and, moreover, interferes most materially with their public\r\nduties. Let them, then, be freed from this thraldom, and Scotland will\r\nhave no reason to complain. We don't ask for any power of legislation;\r\nwe only require that within and among ourselves the necessary\r\ninvestigations shall be made. This can be done in Edinburgh quite as\r\nwell as in London; and very sorely does our poor Metropolis stand in\r\nneed of such indigenous support. Dublin has its viceregal court, and\r\ntherefore can make some stand against centralization. Edinburgh has\r\nnothing left her except the courts of law, which have been pared down by\r\nignorant experimentalists to the smallest possible substance. All that\r\ncould be taken from her has been transferred to London. Her local\r\nboards, her officers of state, have vanished one by one; and scarce any\r\nremonstrance has been made against these useless and unjustifiable\r\naggressions.\r\n\r\nI find myself getting into the Malagrowther vein, so I had better pull\r\nup in time, without hinting at the existence of claymores. Only this,\r\nshould there ever be a decent agitation in Scotland, you will find the\r\nold Tories at the head of it, demanding the restitution of certain\r\nancient rights, which Whiggery has subverted, and Conservatism trodden\r\nunder foot. Undoubtedly, at no very distant period, the great questions\r\nof centralization and uniformity will be gravely and considerately\r\ndiscussed, both within and without the walls of the British Parliament.\r\nNext year it is probable that the transit between Edinburgh and London\r\nwill be effected in fourteen hours. That of itself will go far to bring\r\nmatters to a crisis. If we are to be centralized, let the work be\r\nthoroughly done; if not, let us get back at least a reasonable portion\r\nof our own.\r\n\r\nBut to the committees. You can have no idea, Bogle, of the excitement\r\ncaused by any of their decisions. At the close of the evidence, counsel,\r\nagents, and spectators are unceremoniously hustled out of the room, to\r\ngive leisure for the selected senators to make up their minds on the\r\npropriety of passing or rejecting the preamble of the bill. In the lobby\r\nall is confusion. Near the door stand five-and-twenty speculators, all\r\nof them heavy holders of stock, some flushed in the face like peonies,\r\nsome pale and trembling with excitement. The barristers, for the most\r\npart, have a devil-may-care look, as if it mattered little to them,\r\nwhether the Dreep-daily or Powhead's gentry shall carry the day. And, in\r\ntruth, it is of little consequence. The sittings of this committee\r\ncannot by possibility be prolonged, and as most of the legal gentlemen\r\nhave other briefs--\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow to fresh fields and pastures new.\"\r\n\r\nThe magistrates of Camlachie, though sorely agitated for the integrity\r\nof that important borough, threatened by the Dreep-daily Extension with\r\nimmediate intersection, yet preserve a becoming decorum of feature. The\r\nsenior bailie bows a dignified assent to the protestations of the\r\nParliamentary solicitor, that it is quite impossible the bill can\r\npass--such an interference with vested rights never can be sanctioned by\r\na British House of Commons, &c. &c.; and then, with a shrewd eye to\r\nfuture proceedings, the wily Machiavel hints that at all events the\r\nHouse of Lords will be sure to put the matter right. What in the name of\r\ntorture can make the committee deliberate so long? Two hours have\r\nelapsed since we were excluded, and yet there is no indication of a\r\njudgment. The chairman of the Powhead's line, which on the whole has had\r\nthe worst of it in evidence, begins to gain confidence from the delay.\r\nWhispers arise and circulate that the committee are two to two, the\r\nchairman not being able to make up his mind either way; but as his wife\r\nis a third cousin of a Powheads director, there may yet be balm in\r\nGilead. Hark! the tinkling of a bell--there is a buzz as of a hive\r\noverturned, the doors are opened, and the whole crowd rush elbowing in.\r\nHow provokingly calm are the countenances of the five legislators! Not a\r\ntwinkle in the eye of any of them to betray the nature of their\r\ndecision--nay, with a refinement of cruelty positively appalling, the\r\nchairman is elaborating a quill into a toothpick until order shall be\r\npartially restored. Now for the dictum--\"The Committee, having heard\r\nevidence, are of opinion that the preamble of the Dreep-daily Extension\r\nBill has not been proved, and further, that the preamble of the Powheads\r\nJunction Bill has been satisfactorily proved, and they intend to report\r\naccordingly.\" One second's pause, and a triumphant cheer bursts from the\r\ndignitaries of Camlachie. The five-and-twenty speculators darting at\r\nonce to the door, choke up the entrance for a time--divers coat-tails\r\ngive way, and hats disappear in the scuffle--at last they break out from\r\nthe Cloisters like so many demoniacs, fling themselves into\r\nfour-and-twenty cabs, and offer triple fares for immediate transmission\r\nto the City. One, more knowing than the rest, sneaks down to Westminster\r\nBridge, finds a steamer just starting, makes his way by water to the\r\nExchange; and five minutes before the earliest cab, obstructed by a\r\ncovey of coal-carts in the Strand, can fetch its agitated inmate to his\r\nbroker, his speedier rival has sold several thousand Dreep-dailys to\r\nunwitting and unfortunate purchasers, and has become the coveted\r\npossessor of every Powhead scrip then negotiable in the London market.\r\nIf there is any caricature in this sketch I shall submit to do penance\r\nin the pillory.\r\n\r\nI think I have now bored you sufficiently with railway matters: being a\r\nliterary character, you may like to know how I otherwise employ my time.\r\n_Imprimis_, I have not attended a single debate in the House of Commons.\r\nIt is quite enough to spell one's way through the dreary columns of the\r\n_Times_ after the matutinal muffin, without exposing the mind to the\r\ncruelties of a Maynooth debate, or the body to the tender mercies of the\r\nnovel mode of ventilation. I find the theatres much more amusing, not\r\nfrom the excellence of the dramatic performances, but from their sheer\r\nand gross absurdity, which, without actual experience, is almost too\r\nmonstrous for belief. The fact is, that a new Cockney school has arisen,\r\nten times more twaddling and impotent than the ancient academy of that\r\nname. The old professors, for whom I always had a sneaking kindness,\r\naffected a sort of solitary grandeur, deported themselves with the\r\nconscious swagger of genius, read Tooke's Pantheon, and prated of the\r\nHeathen gods. This was very harmless and innocent pastime; tiresome, to\r\nbe sure, yet laughable withal; nor did it call for any further rebuke\r\nthan an occasional tap upon the cranium of some blockhead who forsook\r\nhis legitimate sphere, thrust himself in your way, and became\r\nunsufferably blatant. Now the spirit of the times has changed. The\r\nliterary youth of London are all in the facetious line. They have\r\nregular clubs, at which they meet to collate the gathered slang and\r\npilfered witticisms of the week; periodical compotations to work these\r\nmaterials into something like a readable shape; and hebdomadal journals,\r\nby means of which their choice productions are issued to a wondering\r\nworld. Now, though a single gnat can give you very little annoyance in\r\nthe course of a summer's night, the evil becomes serious when you are\r\nsurrounded with whole scores of these diminutive vermin, singing in your\r\nears, buzzing in your hair, and lighting incessantly on your face. In\r\nvain you turn aside, in hopes to get rid of the nuisance. Go where you\r\nwill, a perfect cloud of midges keeps hovering round your head, each\r\ntiny bloodsucker sounding his diminutive horn, in the full and perfect\r\nbelief that he discourses most excellent music. Even so, in London, are\r\nyou surrounded with these philosophers of the Cider-cellar. Their works\r\nstare you every where in the face; the magazines abound with their wit;\r\ntheir songs, consisting for the most part of prurient parodies, are\r\nresonant throughout the purlieus of Covent Garden. What is worse than\r\nall, they have wriggled themselves into a sort of monopoly of the\r\ntheatres, persuaded the public to cashier Shakespeare, who is now\r\nutterly out of date, and to instal in his place a certain Mr J.R.\r\nPlanche as the leading swan of the Thames. In giving him this prominent\r\nplace, I merely echo the opinions of his compeers, who with much\r\nmodesty, but at the same time with praiseworthy candour, have\r\nacknowledged his pre-eminence in the modern walk of the drama, and with\r\nhim they decline competition. The new Beaumont and Fletcher, J. Taylor\r\nand Albert Smith, Esquires, thus bear testimony to his merits in one of\r\ntheir inimitable prologues:\r\n\r\n  \"'Fair One with Golden Locks:' no, you won't do--\r\n  PLANCHE has taken the shine out of you:\r\n  Who runs with HIM, it may be safely reckon'd,\r\n  Whate'er the odds, must come in 'a bad second.'\"\r\n\r\nBen Jonson never penned a more delicate or classical compliment, albeit\r\nit halteth a little. Let us then submit to the better judgment of our\r\nbrethren, and bow down promiscuously before any brazen calf which their\r\neager idolatry may rear. Let London promulgate the law of letters, as\r\nwell as the statutes of the land. Therefore, say I, away with Romeo, and\r\ngive us Cinderella; banish Hamlet, and welcome Sleeping Beauty; let the\r\nTempest make room for Fortunio; and Venice Preserved for the gentle\r\nGraciosa and Percinet! Do you, Bogle, disencumber your study as fast as\r\nyou can of these absurd busts of the older dramatists, now fit for\r\nnothing but targets in a shooting-gallery. Fling the effigies, one and\r\nall, into the area; and let us see, in their stead, each on its\r\nappropriate pedestal, with some culinary garland round the head, new\r\nstucco casts of J. R. Planche, Albert Smith, and Gilbert a-Beckett,\r\nEsquires.\r\n\r\nAfter all, is it to be wondered at if the public lacketh novelty?\r\nShakespeare has had possession of the stage for nearly two\r\ncenturies--quite enough, one would think, to pacify his unconscionable\r\n_Manes_. We have been dosed with his dramas from our youth upwards. Two\r\ngenerations of the race of Kean have, in our own day, perished, after a\r\nseries of air-stabs, upon Bosworth field. We have seen twenty different\r\nHamlets appear upon the damp chill platform of Elsinore, and fully as\r\nmany Romeos in the sunny streets of Verona. The nightingale in the\r\npomegranate-tree was beginning to sing hoarsely and out of tune;\r\ntherefore it was full time that our ears should be dieted with other\r\nsounds. Well, no sooner was the wish expressed, than we were presented\r\nwith \"Nina Sforza,\" the \"Legend of Florence,\" and several other dramas\r\nof the highest class. Sheridan Knowles and Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton\r\nprofessed themselves ready to administer any amount of food to the\r\ncraving appetite of the age--but all in vain. Tragedy was not what we\r\nwanted--nor comedy--no, nor even passable melodrama. We sighed for\r\nsomething of a more ethereal sort, and--laud we the gods!--the manna has\r\ndescended in showers. Go into any of the London theatres now, and the\r\nfollowing is your bill of fare. Fairies you have by scores in\r\nflesh-coloured tights, spangles, and paucity of petticoats; gnomes of\r\nevery description, from the gigantic glittering diamond beetle, to the\r\ngrotesque and dusky tadpole. Epicene princes, whose taper limbs and\r\nswelling busts are well worth the scrutiny of the opera-glass--dragons\r\nvomiting at once red flames and witticisms about the fountains in\r\nTrafalgar Square--Dan O'Connell figuring in the feathers of a Milesian\r\nowl--and the Seven Champions of Christendom smoking cigars upon the\r\nparapets of Hungerford Bridge! All these things have I seen, Bogle, yea,\r\nand cheered them to the echo, in company with some thousand Cockneys,\r\nall agape at the glitter of tinselled pasteboard, and the glories of the\r\nCatharine-wheel. Such is the intellectual banquet which London, queen of\r\nliterature, presents to her fastidious children!\r\n\r\nThe form of dramatic composition now most in vogue is the burlesque; or,\r\nin the language of the great Planche, \"the original, grand, comic,\r\nromantic, operatic, melo-dramatic, fairy extravaganza!\" There is a title\r\nfor you, that would have put Polonius to the blush. I have invested some\r\nthree shillings in the purchase of several of these works, in order\r\nthat I might study at leisure the bold and brilliant wit, the elegant\r\nlanguage, and the ingenious metaphors which had entranced me when I\r\nheard them uttered from the stage. I am now tolerably master of the\r\nsubject, and therefore beg leave, before condescending upon details, to\r\nhand you a recipe for the concoction of one of these delectable dishes.\r\nTake my advice, and make the experiment yourself. Red Riding-Hood, I\r\nthink, is still a virgin story; but, unless you make haste, she will be\r\nsnapped up, for they are rapidly exhausting the stores of the \"_Contes\r\ndes Fees_.\" Alexander will probably give you something for it, or you\r\ncan try our old friend Miller at the Green. The process is shortly this.\r\nSelect a fairy tale, or a chapter from the Arabian Nights; write out the\r\n_dramatis personae_, taking care that you have plenty of supernaturals,\r\ngenii, elves, gnomes, ghouls, or vampires, to make up a competent _corps\r\nde ballet_; work out your dialogue in slipshod verse, with as much slang\r\nrepartee as you possibly can cram in, and let every couplet contain\r\neither a pun or some innuendo upon the passing events of the day. This\r\nin London is considered as the highest species of wit, and seldom fails\r\nto bring down three distinct rounds of applause from the galleries. I\r\nfear you may be trammelled a little by the scantiness of local\r\nallusions. Hungerford Bridge and Trafalgar Square, as I have already\r\nhinted, have kept the Cockneys in roars of laughter for years, and are\r\ndragged forward with unrelenting perseverance, but still undiminished\r\neffect, in each successive extravaganza. I suspect you will find that\r\nthe populace of Glasgow are less easy to be tickled, and somewhat\r\njealous of quips at their familiar haunts. However, don't be\r\ndown-hearted. Go boldly at the Gorbals, the Goosedubs, and the great\r\nchimney-stalk of St Rollox; it is impossible to predict how boldly the\r\nmunicipal pulse may bound beneath the pressure of a dexterous finger.\r\nNext, you must compose some stanzas, as vapid as you please, to be sung\r\nby the leading virgin in pantaloons; or, what is better still, a few\r\nparodies adapted to the most popular airs. I see a fine field for your\r\ningenuity in the Jacobite relics; they are entwined with our most sacred\r\nnational recollections, and therefore may be desecrated at will. Never\r\nlose sight for a moment of the manifold advantages derivable from a free\r\nuse of the trap-door and the flying-wires; throw in a transparency, an\r\nElysian field, a dissolving view, and a miniature Vesuvius, and\r\n\r\n  \"My basnet to a 'prentice cap,\r\n  Lord Surrey's o'er the Till,\"\r\n\r\nyou will take all Glasgow by storm, and stand henceforward crowned as\r\nthe young Euripides of the West.\r\n\r\nYou and I, in the course of our early German studies, lighted, as I can\r\nwell remember, upon the Phantasus of Ludwig Tieck. I attribute your loss\r\nof the first prize in the Moral Philosophy class to the enthusiasm with\r\nwhich you threw yourself into his glorious Bluebeard and Fortunatus. In\r\ntruth it was like hearing the tales of childhood told anew, only with a\r\nmanlier tone, and a clearer and more dignified purpose. How lucidly the\r\nearly, half-forgotten images were restored under the touch of that\r\ninimitable artist! What a luxury it was to revel with the first\r\nfavourites of our childhood, now developed into full life, and strength,\r\nand stately beauty! With these before us, how could we dare be infidels\r\nand recreants to our earlier faith, or smile in scorn at the fanciful\r\nloves and cherished dreams of infancy? Such were our feelings, nor could\r\nit well be otherwise; for Tieck was, and is, a poet of the highest\r\ngrade--not a playwright and systematic jest-hunter; and would as soon\r\nhave put forth his hand in impious challenge against the Ark, as have\r\nstooped to become a buffooning pander to the idle follies of the\r\nmillion. It remained for England--great and classic England--no, by\r\nheavens! I will not do her that wrong--but for London, and London\r\n_artists_!--I believe that is the proper phrase--after having exhausted\r\nevery other subject of parody, sacred and profane, to invade the\r\nsanctuary of childhood, and vulgarize the very earliest impressions\r\nwhich are conveyed to the infant. Are not the men who sit down\r\ndeliberately to such a task more culpable than even the nursery jade\r\nwho administers gin and opium to her charge, in order that she may steal\r\nto the back-door undisturbed, and there indulge in surreptitious\r\ndalliance with the dustman? Far better had they stuck to their old trade\r\nof twisting travesties from Shakespeare for the amusement of elderly\r\nidiots, than attempted to people Fairyland with the palpable denizens of\r\nSt Giles. The Seven Champions of Christendom, indeed! They may well lay\r\nclaim to the title of Champions of Cockneydom incarnate, setting forth\r\non their heroic quest from the rendezvous in the Seven Dials.\r\n\r\nLet us look a little into their individual feats, although I must needs\r\nsay, that the whole of these productions bear a marvellous resemblance\r\nto each other. There is no more variety in any of them than can be found\r\nin the copious advertisements of the Messrs Doudney. Still, it cannot\r\nbut be that some gems shall scintillate more than others, or, at all\r\nevents, be of coarser and duller water. With conscious impartiality, and\r\nwithout imputing the palm of slang to any particular individual, I shall\r\ngive the precedence to Gemini, and their last approved duodecimo. Messrs\r\nTaylor and Smith have bestowed upon the public three dramas--to wit,\r\nValentine and Orson, Whittington and his Cat, and Cinderella. I have not\r\nbeen fortunate enough to meet with the earlier portions of this trilogy;\r\nbut I have got by me Cinderella, of which title the authors, with\r\ncharacteristic purity, confess\r\n\r\n    \"'Twould be proper _er_\r\n  To say, 'La Cenerentola,' from the opera.\"\r\n\r\nYou shall have a specimen, Bogle, of this extremely racy production,\r\nwhich I strongly recommend you to keep in view as model. You cannot have\r\nforgotten the tale of the poor deserted maiden, whose loneliness is thus\r\ntouchingly described--\r\n\r\n  \"From poker, tongs, and kitchen stove,\r\n    To the neglected cellar,\r\n  Is all the change I ever know--\r\n    Oh, hapless Cinderella!\"\r\n\r\nBut dear Cinderella_r_ is not doomed to mourn in dust and ashes for\r\never. A prince is coming to her rescue, but in disguise, having changed\r\nsuits with his own valet. Let us mark the manner of his introduction to\r\nthe interesting family of the Baron:--\r\n\r\n_Baron._--The Baron Soldoff, Baroness, and Misses!\r\n          I thought the Prince was here!\r\n          (_To_ CINDERELLA.)

Some hunters appear marching in at the\r\n            door, when_ CAPILLAIRE, _in the ducal cap, puts his head in\r\n            at the entrance and shouts._\r\n\r\n_Capil._--Hold hard! (_music and procession stop._) Come back, you\r\n            muffs, that's not correct,\r\n          You're spoiling a magnificent effect.\r\n          Down those two staircases you've got to go'\r\n          A la 'The Daughter of St Mark,' you know.\r\n\r\n            [C. _They retire._\r\n\r\n_Baron._--That was the Prince who show'd his face just now.\r\n\r\n_Baroness._--What a fine voice!\r\n\r\n_Ronde._--What eyes!\r\n\r\n_Patch._--And what a brow!\r\n\r\n_Cin._--(_aside._) To my mind, as a casual spectator,\r\n              If that's the Prince, he's very like a waiter.\r\n\r\n[_March begins again. A grand procession enters the gallery, and\r\ndeploying in the centre, proceeds down the two staircases\r\nsimultaneously. Pages with hawks on their wrists.

The celibacy of the priesthood, the mysteries of the\r\nconfessional, the usurpations of priestly direction in the economy of\r\nfamilies, in the control of women, and in the education of\r\nchildren--these are the objects against which the historian of France\r\nnow directs the arrows of his indignation, and which he seeks to drive\r\nfrom among his countrymen by his earnest and energetic attacks. His\r\nhostility has probably been prompted, in part, by the strong feelings of\r\njealousy at present existing in France between the Universities and the\r\nChurch. But his work is not professedly, nor principally, directed to\r\nthat subject of controversy. It embraces a larger question, affecting\r\nthe various relations of private life, and not confined to one form or\r\nphasis of fanaticism. It deserves the anxious consideration of all who\r\nare interested in the progress of European civilization, and may teach a\r\nvaluable lesson to many who may, at first sight, seem to be far removed\r\nfrom the mischief which it seeks to remedy.\r\n\r\nFor centuries past, it may be said, that the great disease of France has\r\nbeen the disorder in its domestic relations. That amidst the general\r\nsurrender of its upper classes in former times to levity, \"and something\r\nmore,\" there were many exceptions of family happiness and purity, is as\r\ncertain as that human nature, in its worst state of depravity, will ever\r\nassert its better tendencies, and give indications of the ethereal\r\nsource from which it has sprung. But, that the prevailing tone of those\r\nwho ought to have given the tone to others, was long of the most lax or\r\nlicentious character, admits of little doubt; nor is it wonderful that\r\npublic corruption and anarchy should have followed fast upon the\r\ndissolution of private restraints. The same form of the evil may not now\r\nexist; but the book before us exhibits proofs that there is still a want\r\nof that harmony in conjugal life that is essential as the foundation of\r\nsolid virtue and social prosperity. The husband and the wife are still\r\nseparated from each other; not, it may be, by a lover, but by a priest.\r\nThere is the same want of sympathy as ever, the same mutual alienation\r\nof hearts, the same absence of that kindly agency of mind on mind, which\r\nis needed to strengthen the intellect of the woman and to purify the\r\nspirit of the man. It is this state of things that has roused the\r\nenergies of a writer not remarkable for his prejudices against the\r\nCatholic church in her earlier constitution, but who thinks he sees her\r\nnow at his own door, undermining household authority, and stealing from\r\nevery man the affections of those who are united to him by the tenderest\r\nties, and whom he cannot cease to love, even when his love has ceased to\r\nbe returned.\r\n\r\nMichelet's book is divided into three parts. The first treats of\r\n\"Direction,\" or spiritual superintendence in the seventeenth century;\r\ncontaining a historical view of clerical influence during that period;\r\nand more particularly of the policy and power of the Jesuits. The second\r\ndiscusses the character of \"Direction\" in general, and particularly in\r\nthe nineteenth century. The third is specially devoted to the subject\r\n\"Of the Family,\" and winds up the work, by showing the operation of the\r\npoison in the most vital part of the frame.\r\n\r\nThe preface to the first edition contains powerful passages. We extract\r\nsome of the best of them from the English translation by Mr Cocks, which\r\nis sufficiently respectable for our present purpose.\r\n\r\n    \"The question is about our family:--that sacred asylum in which we\r\n    all desire to seek the repose of the heart, when our endeavours\r\n    have proved fruitless, and our illusions are no more. We return\r\n    exhausted to the domestic hearth; but do we find there the repose\r\n    we sigh for?\r\n\r\n    \"Let us not dissemble, but acknowledge to ourselves how things are:\r\n    there is in our family a sad difference of sentiment, and the most\r\n    serious of all.\r\n\r\n    \"We may speak to our mothers, wives, and daughters, on any of the\r\n    subjects which form the topics of our conversation with indifferent\r\n    persons, such as business or the news of the day, but never on\r\n    subjects that affect the heart and moral life, such as eternity,\r\n    religion, the soul, and God.\r\n\r\n    \"Choose, for instance, the moment when we naturally feel disposed\r\n    to meditate with our family in common thought, some quiet evening\r\n    at the family-table; venture even there, in your own house, at your\r\n    own fireside, to say one word about these things; your mother sadly\r\n    shakes her head, your wife contradicts you, your daughter, by her\r\n    very silence, shows her disapprobation. They are on one side of the\r\n    table, and you on the other--and alone.\r\n\r\n    \"One would think that in the midst of them, and opposite you, was\r\n    seated an invisible personage to contradict _whatever you may say_.\r\n\r\n    \"But how can we be astonished at this state of our family? Our\r\n    wives and daughters are brought up and governed by _our enemies!_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"_Our enemies_, I repeat it, in a more direct sense, as they are\r\n    naturally envious of marriage and family life. This, I know full\r\n    well, is rather their misfortune than their fault. An old lifeless\r\n    system, of mechanical functions, can want but lifeless partisans.\r\n    Nature, however, reclaims her rights: they feel painfully that\r\n    family is denied them, and they console themselves _only by\r\n    troubling ours_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"This lifeless spirit, let us call it by its real name, Jesuitism,\r\n    formerly neutralized by the different manners of living, of the\r\n    orders, corporations, and religious parties, is now the common\r\n    spirit which the clergy imbibes through a special education, and\r\n    which its chiefs make no difficulty in confessing. A bishop has\r\n    said, 'We are Jesuits, all Jesuits;' and nobody has contradicted\r\n    him.\r\n\r\n    \"The greater part, however, are less frank: Jesuitism acts\r\n    powerfully through the medium of those who are supposed to be\r\n    strangers to it; namely, the Sulpicians, who educate the clergy,\r\n    the Ignorantins, who instruct the people, and the Lazarists, who\r\n    direct six thousand Sisters of Charity, and have in their hands the\r\n    hospitals, schools, charity-offices, &c.\r\n\r\n    \"So many establishments, so much money, so many pulpits for\r\n    preaching aloud, so many confessionals for whispering, the\r\n    education of two hundred thousand boys, and six hundred thousand\r\n    girls, the management of several millions of women, form together a\r\n    powerful machine. The unity it possesses in our days might, one\r\n    would suppose, alarm the state. This is so far from being the case,\r\n    that whilst the state prohibits association among the laity, it has\r\n    encouraged it among the ecclesiastics. It has allowed them to form\r\n    a most dangerous footing among the poorer classes, the union of\r\n    workmen, apprentice-houses, association of servants who are\r\n    accountable to priests, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n    \"Unity of action, and the monopoly of association, are certainly\r\n    two powerful levers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"That which constitutes the gravity of this age, I may even say its\r\n    holiness, is conscientious work, which promotes attentively the\r\n    common work of humanity, and facilitates at its own expense the\r\n    work of the future. Our forefathers dreamed much, and disputed\r\n    much. But we are labourers, and this is the reason why our furrow\r\n    has been blessed. The soil which the middle ages left us still\r\n    covered with brambles, has produced by our efforts so plentiful a\r\n    harvest, that it already envelopes, and will presently hide the old\r\n    inanimate post that expected to stop the plough.\r\n\r\n    \"And it is because we are workmen, and return home fatigued every\r\n    evening, that we need more than others the repose of the heart. Our\r\n    board and fireside must again become our own; we must no longer\r\n    find, instead of repose, at home, the old dispute which has been\r\n    settled by science and the world; nor hear from our wife or child,\r\n    on our pillow, a lesson learnt by heart, and the words of another\r\n    man.\r\n\r\n    \"Women follow willingly the strong. How comes it, then, that in\r\n    this case they have followed the weak?\r\n\r\n    \"It must be that there is an art which gives strength to the weak.\r\n    This dark art, which consists in surprising, fascinating, lulling,\r\n    and annihilating the will, has been investigated by me in this\r\n    volume. The seventeenth century had the theory of it, and ours\r\n    continues the practice.\"\r\n\r\nWe shall not follow the writer in his review of Jesuitical influences\r\nin the seventeenth century, though it contains much that might excite\r\nremark and deserve attention. We hasten to the more urgent question--the\r\nstate of matters as they exist at the present hour.\r\n\r\nThe root of the evil, as Michelet thinks, lies in the position of the\r\npriesthood. We are far from adopting all his views, and would decline\r\nany indiscriminate condemnation of a body of men who, under any form of\r\nChristianity, must do good in many quarters, and must contain numerous\r\nexamples of faithful and fervent piety. But in so far as the system of\r\nthe Romish church is vicious and injurious, it is of vital moment that\r\nwe should trace the effect to its cause. Much evil, we think, is\r\nascribable to the doctrines of that church, and of every other that too\r\nhighly exalts the powers and functions of the priest as compared with\r\nthe people. But, dismissing these for the present, the peculiar\r\ndiscipline of the Romish system deserves our immediate consideration;\r\nand here our attention is first attracted by a striking characteristic,\r\nthe CELIBACY of the clergy. Let us hear how so important a peculiarity\r\nis thought to operate by this acute observer:--\r\n\r\n    \"We think, without enumerating the too well-known inconveniences of\r\n    their present state, that if the priest is to advise the family, it\r\n    is good for him to know what a family is; that as a married man (or\r\n    a widower, which would be still better,) of a mature age and\r\n    experience, one who has loved and suffered, and whom domestic\r\n    affections have enlightened upon the mysteries of moral life, which\r\n    are not to be learned by guessing, he would possess at the same\r\n    time more affection, and more wisdom.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"Why torment a blind man by speaking to him of colours? He answers\r\n    vaguely; occasionally he may guess pretty nearly; but how can it be\r\n    helped? he cannot see.\r\n\r\n    \"And do not think that the feelings of the heart can be guessed at\r\n    more easily. A man without wife or child might study the mysterious\r\n    working of a family in books and the world for ten thousand years\r\n    without ever knowing one word about them. Look at these men: it is\r\n    neither time, opportunity nor facility, that they lack to acquire\r\n    knowledge; they pass their lives with women who tell them more than\r\n    they tell their husbands; they know, and yet they are ignorant;\r\n    they know all a woman's acts and thoughts, but they are ignorant\r\n    precisely of what is the best and most intimate part of her\r\n    character, and the very essence of her being. They hardly\r\n    understand her as a lover, (of God or man,) still less as a wife,\r\n    and not at all as a mother. Nothing is more painful than to see\r\n    them sitting down awkwardly by the side of a woman to caress her\r\n    child; their manner towards it is that of flatterers or\r\n    courtiers--anything but that of a father.\r\n\r\n    \"What I pity the most in the man condemned to celibacy, is not only\r\n    the privation of the sweetest joys of the heart, but that a\r\n    thousand objects of the natural and moral world are, and ever will\r\n    be, a dead letter to him. Many have thought, by living apart, to\r\n    dedicate their lives to science; but the reverse is the case. In\r\n    such a morose and crippled life, science is never fathomed; it may\r\n    be varied, and superficially immense; but it escapes--for it will\r\n    not reside there. Celibacy gives a restless activity to researches,\r\n    intrigues, and business--a sort of huntsman's eagerness--a\r\n    sharpness in the subtilties of school-divinity and disputation:\r\n    this is at least the effect it had in its prime. If it makes the\r\n    senses keen and liable to temptation, certainly it does not soften\r\n    the heart. Our terrorists in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries\r\n    were monks. Monastic prisons were always the most cruel. A life\r\n    systematically negative--a life without its functions--developes in\r\n    man instincts that are hostile to life; he who suffers is willing\r\n    to make others suffer. The harmonious and fertile parts of our\r\n    nature, which on the one hand incline to goodness, and on the other\r\n    to genius and high invention, can hardly ever withstand this\r\n    partial suicide.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"I have never been insensible either to the humiliation of the\r\n    church, or to the sufferings of the priest. I have them all\r\n    present, both before my imagination and in my heart. I have\r\n    followed this unfortunate man in the career of privations, and in\r\n    the miserable life into which he is dragged by the hand of a\r\n    hypocritical authority. And in his loneliness, on his cold and\r\n    melancholy hearth, where he sometimes weeps at night, let him\r\n    remember that a man has often wept with him, and that I am that\r\n    man.\"\r\n\r\nWe partly know the object and origin of the middle age institution of\r\ncelibacy among the clergy. It was intended to check the tendency to\r\nsecularize benefices. It was adapted to the condition of a church\r\nmilitant. It might do good, or at least it could do little harm, where\r\naged and self-mortified men were the occupants of the office. But a\r\nyouthful priesthood, established in all the comforts or the luxuries of\r\na state endowment, moving and officiating in a sphere where leisure and\r\nrefinement give an impulse to the heart and fancy, and yet condemned to\r\na renunciation of all the charities of family union, of all the\r\naffections of a lover, a husband, a father--how unnatural a position is\r\nthis, how detrimental to usefulness, how dangerous to virtue! Supposing,\r\neven, that the vow is kept in its spirit, and perhaps its violation is\r\nnot the greatest imaginable mischief, what must be the effect of such\r\nsolitary seclusion on ordinary minds! What power shall protect the mass\r\nof the profession on an envious sourness of heart at the sight of that\r\nhappiness in others, which in a moment, it may be of rashness, they have\r\nrelinquished for themselves. \"Croire qu'un voeu, quelques prieres, une\r\nrobe noire sur le dos, vont vous delivrer de la chair, et vous faire un\r\npur esprit, n'est-ce pas chose puerile?\" We hope and are sure it is not\r\noften so; but can we say that sometimes the dark and deserted spirit of\r\nthe priest may not look on the happiness of families with an approach to\r\nthe feelings of the Evil One, when gazing at our First Parents in their\r\nstate of innocence?--\r\n\r\n    \"Sight hateful! sight tormenting! thus these two\r\n    Emparadised in one another's arms--While I--\"\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. Thus doomed to the dreary isolation of a _manque_\r\nand mutilated life, yet, in the midst of his privations, retaining his\r\nnatural passions, his longings of the heart and affections, the Romish\r\npriest is employed in no ordinary task of clerical occupation or\r\nsuperintendence--in preaching merely or in prayer--in the visitation of\r\nthe sick and afflicted. The CONFESSIONAL is added to his duties, as if\r\non purpose to enhance the misery of his condition, and the mischief of\r\nhis influence. And with whom is the confessional chiefly conversant? The\r\nmale penitent, we presume, is content with a very general acknowledgment\r\nof his errors, and seldom indulges in great outpourings of the spirit,\r\nor would submit to any stretch of authority over his conscience or\r\nconduct. But the softer sex, whose own tenderness of heart, and whose\r\npower over the hearts of others, make all converse with them so potent\r\nfor good or for harm--maidens, and wives in the prime of life, and in\r\nthe pride of beauty, opening their souls to a confessor, revealing all\r\ntheir secret emotions, their hopes, their disappointments, their fears,\r\ntheir failings, submitting to his questions, and hanging upon his words\r\nof acquittal or condemnation; surely this is a subject of contemplation\r\nfull of awful interest, and on which it is impossible to be at ease\r\nwhere the mysterious intercourse is without a witness and without a\r\ncheck--but the consciences of two frail and fallible human beings. Well\r\nmay we say with Michelet, that under such a system the priest ought to\r\nbe truly a ~presbyteros~, \"a man who has seen, learned, and\r\nsuffered much.\" A young priest as a father-confessor is not merely \"a\r\nnonsensical contradiction,\" but a snare and a source of peril both to\r\nhimself and his penitents.\r\n\r\nThe pomp of Popery gives its clergy sufficient aids to their influence\r\nby other means.\r\n\r\n    \"The priest takes advantage of every thing that is calculated to\r\n    make him be considered as a man apart--of his dress, his position,\r\n    his mysterious church, that invests the most vulgar with a poetical\r\n    gleam.\r\n\r\n      *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"What an immense place is this church, and what an immense host\r\n    must inhabit this wonderful dwelling! Optical delusion adds still\r\n    more to the effect. Every proportion changes. The eye is deceived\r\n    and deceives itself, at the same time, with these sublime lights\r\n    and deepening shades, all calculated to increase the illusion. The\r\n    man whom in the street you judged, by his surly look, to be a\r\n    village schoolmaster, is here a prophet. He is transformed by this\r\n    majestic framework; his heaviness becomes strength and majesty; his\r\n    voice has formidable echoes. Women and children tremble and are\r\n    afraid.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"Do you see that solemn figure, adorned with all the gold and\r\n    purple of his pontifical dress, ascending, with the thought, the\r\n    prayer of a multitude of ten thousand men, the triumphal steps in\r\n    the choir of St Denis? Do you see him still, above all that\r\n    kneeling mass, hovering as high as the vaulted roofs, his head\r\n    reaching the capitals, and lost among the winged heads of the\r\n    angels, whence he hurls his thunder? Well, it is the same man, this\r\n    terrible archangel himself, who presently descends for her, and\r\n    now, mild and gentle, goes yonder into that dark chapel, to listen\r\n    to her in the languid hours of the afternoon! Delightful hour of\r\n    tumultuous, but tender sensations! (Why does the heart palpitate so\r\n    strongly here?) How dark the church becomes! Yet it is not late.\r\n    The great rose-window over the portal glitters with the setting\r\n    sun. But it is quite another thing in the choir; dark shadows\r\n    envelope it, and beyond is obscurity. One thing astounds and almost\r\n    frightens us, however far we may be, which is the mysterious old\r\n    painted glass, at the farthest end of the church, on which the\r\n    design is no longer distinguishable, twinkling in the shade, like\r\n    an illegible magic scroll of unknown characters. The chapel is not\r\n    less dark on that account; you can no longer discern the ornaments\r\n    and delicate moulding entwined in the vaulted roof; the shadow\r\n    deepening blends and confounds the outlines. But, as if this chapel\r\n    were not dark enough, it contains, in a retired corner, a narrow\r\n    recess of dark oak, where that man, all emotion, and that trembling\r\n    woman, so close to each other, are whispering together about the\r\n    love of God.\"\r\n\r\nThe details of a priest's education for the confessional office are\r\nnecessarily deplorable. We blame not so much the men as the system. Yet\r\nbooks, apparently, are continued among the preparations for this duty,\r\nwhich might well be dispensed with as wholly unsuited to the age. We\r\nbelieve that Sanchez was a man of holy life, though his purity, after\r\nthe analogy of one of Swift's paradoxes, left him a man of impure ideas;\r\nand no one was ever forced by dire necessity to read his book without\r\ndisgust and dismay. It may be good for the students of medicine to\r\npenetrate into every form in which bodily disease can show itself; but\r\nthe pathology of the mind thus hideously represented is degrading even\r\nto the observer.\r\n\r\n    \"A worthy parish priest has often told me that the sore part of his\r\n    profession, that which filled him with despair, and his life with\r\n    torment, was the confession.\r\n\r\n    \"The studies with which they prepare for it in the seminaries are\r\n    such as entirely ruin the disposition, weaken the body, and\r\n    enervate and defile the soul.\r\n\r\n    \"Lay education, without making any pretension to an extraordinary\r\n    degree of purity, and though the pupils it forms will, one day,\r\n    enjoy public life, takes, however, especial care to keep from the\r\n    eyes of youth the glowing descriptions that excite the passions.\r\n\r\n    \"Ecclesiastical education, on the contrary, which pretends to form\r\n    men superior to man, pure virgin minds, angels, fixes precisely the\r\n    attention of its pupils upon things that are to be for ever\r\n    forbidden them, and gives them for subjects of study terrible\r\n    temptations, such as would make all the saints run the risk of\r\n    damnation. Their printed books have been quoted, but not so their\r\n    copy-books, by which they complete the two last years of seminary\r\n    education: these copy-books contain things that the most audacious\r\n    have never dared to publish.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"This surprising imprudence proceeded originally from the very\r\n    scholastic supposition, that the body and soul could be perfectly\r\n    well kept apart.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is the influence by which the power of the confessor is converted\r\ninto that of the director? It is done in the usual way--by the continual\r\nrepetition of the same process for a length of time. Habit is the\r\ninsidious enemy that, ere it seems to assail, has already conquered and\r\nled captive.\r\n\r\n    \"Stand at this window every day, at a certain hour in the\r\n    afternoon. You will see a pale man pass down the street, with his\r\n    eyes cast on the ground, and always following the same line of\r\n    pavement next the houses. Where he set his foot yesterday, there he\r\n    does to-day, and there he will to-morrow; he would wear out the\r\n    pavement if it was never renewed. And by this same street he goes\r\n    to the same house, ascends to the same story, and in the same\r\n    cabinet speaks to the same person. He speaks of the same things,\r\n    and his manner seems the same. The person who listens to him sees\r\n    no difference between yesterday and to-day; gentle uniformity, as\r\n    serene as an infant's sleep, whose breathing raises its chest at\r\n    equal intervals with the same soft sounds.\r\n\r\n    \"You think that nothing changes in this monotonous equality; that\r\n    all these days are the same. You are mistaken; you have _perceived_\r\n    nothing, yet every day there is a change, slight, it is true, and\r\n    imperceptible, which the person, himself changed by little and\r\n    little, does not remark.\r\n\r\n    \"It is like a dream in a bark. What distance have you come whilst\r\n    you were dreaming? Who can tell? Thus you go on, without seeming to\r\n    move--still, and yet rapidly. Once out of the river, or canal, you\r\n    soon find yourself at sea; the uniform immensity in which you now\r\n    are, will inform you still less of the distance you go. Time and\r\n    place are equally uncertain; no sure point to occupy attention; and\r\n    attention itself is gone. The reverie is profound, and becomes more\r\n    and more so--an ocean of dreams upon the smooth ocean of waters.\r\n\r\n    \"A pleasant state, in which every thing becomes insensible, even\r\n    gentleness itself. Is it death, or is it life? To distinguish, we\r\n    require attention, and we should awake from our dream.--No, let it\r\n    go on, whatever it may be that carried me along with it, whether it\r\n    lead me to life or death.\r\n\r\n    \"Alas! 'tis habit! that gently-sloping, formidable abyss, into\r\n    which we slide so easily! we may say every thing that is bad of it,\r\n    and also every thing that is good, and it will be always true.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be painful and repulsive to follow out the acts which the\r\nacquisition of such spiritual ascendancy may suggest to wicked or even a\r\nweak spirit. The result in general is the complete possession of the\r\nwhole mind of the subdued victim, which lives, and moves, and has its\r\nbeing in the will and wishes of its omnipotent tyrant. This change is of\r\nitself destructive of moral independence; but we must not conceal what\r\nthe writer before us represents as an ulterior effect, and which, even\r\nas a possibility, must be contemplated with fear and horror.\r\n\r\n    \"To be able to have all, and then abstain, is a slippery situation!\r\n    who will keep his footing on this declivity?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"Are you sure you possess the heart entirely, if you have not the\r\n    body?

They offer to league with her in order to transform the\r\n    husband. If it was once firmly established that marriage, instead\r\n    of being unity in two persons, is a league of one of them with a\r\n    stranger, it would become exceedingly scarce.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be unjust to assume that a book written under the influence of\r\nstrong feelings contains an impartial account of actual facts; but even\r\nthe rage with which it has been received by the party attacked, is a\r\nproof that it is true to most damaging extent.

But it is not possible that it should\r\nbe destitute of a broad and deep foundation of melancholy reality.\r\n\r\nWhat now is the remedy which this physician would prescribe for the\r\ndisease he has thus exposed? His words on this subject are well\r\ndeserving of attention.\r\n\r\n    \"Marriage gives the husband a single and momentary opportunity to\r\n    become in reality the master of his wife, to withdraw her from the\r\n    influence of another, and make her his own for ever.

He ought, in the very beginning, when he has\r\n    much influence over her, to let her participate in the activity of\r\n    his mind, his business, and ideas, initiate her in his projects,\r\n    and create an activity in her by means of his own.\r\n\r\n    \"To wish and think as he does, both acting with him and suffering\r\n    with him--this is marriage.

How can we wonder, then, if her affection\r\n    for him be lessened? Ah, if, in the beginning, he made her his own,\r\n    by making her share his ambition, troubles, and uneasiness:--if\r\n    they had watched whole nights together, and been troubled with the\r\n    same thoughts, he would have retained her affections.

People live in a hurry, and can hardly be said\r\n    to live: they follow with a huntsman's eagerness this or that petty\r\n    object, and neglect what is important.\r\n\r\n    \"You, man of business or study, who are so energetic and\r\n    indefatigable, you have no time, say you, to associate your wife\r\n    with your daily progress; you leave her to her _ennui_, idle\r\n    conversations, empty sermons, and silly books; so that, falling\r\n    below herself, less than woman, even less than a child, she will\r\n    have neither moral action, influence, nor maternal authority, over\r\n    her own offspring. Well! you will have the time, as old age\r\n    advances, to try in vain to do all over again what is not done\r\n    twice, to follow in the steps of a son, who, from college to the\r\n    schools, and from thence into the world, hardly knows his family;\r\n    and who, if he travels a little, and meets you on his return, will\r\n    ask you your name. The mother alone could have made you a son; but\r\n    to do so you ought to have made her what a woman ought to be,\r\n    strengthened her with your sentiments and ideas, and nourished her\r\n    with your life.\"\r\n\r\nTrue, O most subtle and sapient Frenchman, the remedy lies in the\r\ndirection you have pointed out; but we have doubts if you have fully\r\ndiscovered its nature, or are prepared to apply it in its necessary\r\nextent. The husband must make the wife the companion of his heart and\r\nthoughts, of his hopes and exertions. Too long has this sympathy and\r\nconfidence been unknown in France, where your women have been but the\r\ntoys and playthings of your lighter or looser hours, and where often to\r\ntheir own husbands they have not even been so much. But, as you partly\r\nsee, this is not all that is needed to be corrected. In order to be the\r\nfitting guide and guardian of the mother of his family, the husband must\r\nshare in those higher feelings which he seeks to regulate and reclaim.\r\nYou do not hope or wish to see your wife and children devoid of\r\nreligion. But if you would not surrender them to the guidance of others\r\nin those momentous concerns, you must care for them and conduct their\r\ncourse yourself, and must learn to travel the road along which they are\r\nto be led. The husband must become himself the priest and the director:\r\nnot by inculcating a vague theism or a cold morality, but by\r\nestablishing in his household the purity and the practice of a Christian\r\nfaith. If the domestic throne is to be upheld on its rightful\r\nfoundation, the altar must be reared by its side. The philosopher and\r\nhistorian must stoop to learn from his own children that simplicity of\r\nwhich they are such powerful teachers, and which will amply repay him\r\nfor all the lessons of a more mature wisdom that his learning and\r\nexperience can impart. Openly and earnestly sympathizing with their\r\ndevout impressions, he will strengthen and support by his intellectual\r\nenergies the soft and more susceptible natures of those placed under his\r\ncharge, and will thus shield them from the attempts to mislead and\r\ninflame, to which they must inevitably be exposed if left to find their\r\nonly sympathy in extraneous influences. This re-establishment of a\r\npatriarchal piety is one of the great boons which the true spirit of\r\nProtestantism purchased for its followers, and which alone can protect\r\nthe weaker members of the household from becoming a prey to priestly\r\ninterference and false enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe book contains a touching tribute, such as able men have often paid\r\nto the maternal affection that formed their minds:--\r\n\r\n    \"Whilst writing all this, I have had in my mind a woman, whose\r\n    strong and serious mind would not have failed to support me in\r\n    these contentions; I lost her thirty years ago, (I was a child\r\n    then;) nevertheless, ever living in my memory, she follows me from\r\n    age to age.\r\n\r\n    \"She suffered with me in my poverty, and was not allowed to share\r\n    in my better fortune. When young, I made her sad, and now I cannot\r\n    console her. I know not even where her bones are: I was too poor\r\n    then to buy earth to bury her!\r\n\r\n    \"And yet I owe her much. I feel deeply that I am the son of woman.\r\n    Every instant, in my ideas and words (not to mention my features\r\n    and gestures,) I find again my mother in myself. It is my mother's\r\n    blood that gives me the sympathy I feel for bygone ages, and the\r\n    tender remembrance of all those who are now no more.\r\n\r\n    \"What return then could I, who am myself advancing towards old age,\r\n    make her for the many things I owe her? One, for which she would\r\n    have thanked me--this protest in favour of women and mothers; and I\r\n    place it at the head of a book believed by some to be a work of\r\n    controversy. They are wrong. The longer it lives, if it should\r\n    live, the plainer will it be seen, that, in spite of polemical\r\n    emotion, it was a work of history, a work of faith, of truth, and\r\n    of sincerity;--on what, then, could I have set my heart more?\"\r\n\r\nIn a spirit worthy of these feelings, the author contends strongly for\r\nthe benefits of maternal education on the character of sons. We shall\r\ngive the passage in the original, as it contains a good deal that is\r\nFrench, and a great deal that is beautiful:--\r\n\r\n    \"Quand on songe que la vie moyenne est si courte, qu'un si grand\r\n    nombre d'hommes meurent tout jeunes, on hesite d'abreger cette\r\n    premiere, cette meilleure epoque de la vie, ou l'enfant, libre sous\r\n    la mere, vit dans la grace et non dans la loi. Mais s'il est vrai,\r\n    comme je pense, que ce temps qu'on croit perdu est justement\r\n    l'epoque unique, precieuse, irreparable, ou, parmi les jeux\r\n    puerils, le genius sacre essaye son premier essor, la saison ou les\r\n    ailes poussent, ou l'aiglon s'essaye a voler ...

Aujourd'hui laissez-le encore, qu'il\r\n    prenne largement la force et la vie, qu'il aspire d'un grand\r\n    coeur l'air vitale de la liberte.\r\n\r\n    \"Une education trop exigeante, trop zelee, inquiete, est un danger\r\n    pour les enfants.

Ou est\r\n    l'homme, je vous prie? Et c'etait l'homme justement qu'aimait et\r\n    menageait la mere. C'est lui qu'elle respectait dans les ecarts de\r\n    l'enfant. Elle semblait retirer son action, sa surveillance meme,\r\n    afin qu'il agit, qu'il fut libre et fort. Mais, en meme temps, elle\r\n    l'entourait toujours comme d'un invisible embrassement.\r\n\r\n    \"Il y a un peril, je le sais bien, dans cette education de l'amour.\r\n    Ce que l'amour veut et desire par-dessus tout, c'est de s'immoler,\r\n    de sacrifier tout--interets, convenances, habitudes, la vie, s'il\r\n    le faut.\r\n\r\n    \"L'objet de cette immolation peut, dans son egoisme enfantin,\r\n    recevoir, comme chose due, tous les sacrifices, se laisser traiter\r\n    en idole, inerte, immobile, et devenir d'autant plus incapable\r\n    d'action qu'on agira plus pour lui.\r\n\r\n    \"Danger reel, mais balance par l'ambition ardente du coeur\r\n    maternel, qui presque toujours place sur l'enfant une esperance\r\n    infinie, et brule de la realiser.

Tout ce qui lui a fait defaut\r\n    dans sa triste experience de ce monde, il va, lui, ce petite\r\n    enfant, le realiser. Les miseres du present sont rachetees d'avance\r\n    par ce splendide avenir: tout est miserable aujourd'hui; qu'il\r\n    grandisse, et tout sera grand. O poesie!

Oui, qu'il parte, qu'il suive sa\r\n    grande destinee, qu'il accomplisse le beau reve qu'elle fit quand\r\n    elle le portait dans son sein, ou sur ses genoux.

It may be thought that the moral they most clearly\r\ninculcate would point to our fellow countrymen in Ireland. But we own we\r\nhave a different reading of the lesson, and consider that the peculiar\r\nperils here described must as yet have been scarcely felt among the\r\npriesthood of a peasantry. It is in circles where there is less physical\r\nprivation and more sentimental excitement, that the evils of spiritual\r\nfascination and domestic division are likely to arise.\r\n\r\nMichelet has shown that \"Direction,\" in its worst forms, did not\r\nterminate with the seventeenth century, but has revived in his own\r\ntimes. We may be allowed to follow out his opinions, and suggest that\r\nJesuits and Directors are not confined to the Romish faith. It behoves\r\neven a Protestant people to be on their guard against the recurrence of\r\nPopery and its Practices under a new aspect. The same erroneous position\r\nmay be reached from opposite directions. The same constitutional malady\r\nmay show itself in different diseases. Caesar was inaccessible to all\r\nflattery, except that which told him he hated flatterers. And many are\r\nmost in danger of Popish error when it approaches under an\r\nultra-Protestant disguise. We are saved, indeed, from the evils of a\r\ncelibatary clergy. We are not exposed to that ignorance or that envy of\r\nfamily life which such a institution involves. But ambition and interest\r\nwill supply the place of most other vices; and we shall be wise to watch\r\nwhether the same battle is not now being fought among ourselves, and for\r\nthe same immediate object--the occupancy of the female heart. The\r\npictures that have been sometimes drawn of our own doings may have only\r\na limited resemblance. Methodist preachers, and evangelical vicars, may\r\nbe exaggerated delineations or mere individual portraits. But still, is\r\nit not true that the minds of our women, particularly those that are\r\nunmarried or childless, are here, as well as in France, sought to be\r\nengrossed, and alienated from their natural attachments, through\r\npriestly influences and for priestly purposes? Look at any new sect\r\nspringing up among us--Look at the last example of the kind, where a\r\npeculiar religious body is forcing or feeling its way towards an\r\nascendency. Powerful as it seems to be in numbers and in wealth, in what\r\ndoes its main strength consist? It was frankly avowed by one of its\r\napostles, that the female mind alone seemed properly fitted to\r\nappreciate its tenets. A strange confession! We doubt if Luther, Calvin,\r\nor Knox, would have boasted of such a fact as characterizing the\r\nreligious movements to which they gave an impulse. In the purity of\r\nfemale feelings we may have a security that any system that recommends\r\nitself to women, must have a fair semblance of goodness as it appears in\r\ntheir eyes: but it does not follow that their approbation is a test of\r\nits genuine excellence, or of its actual conformity with the type which\r\nit professes to represent. It is no novelty in the history of human\r\nnature, that evil makes its first attempts on the weakness of woman.\r\nWhatever is calculated strongly to excite the affections will gain the\r\nhearts of the more susceptible sex; and, without the aid of stronger\r\nintellects, they will run a risk of following after delusive lights, and\r\nmay be found as often to be the votaries of an amiable and attractive\r\nerror, as the assertors of a severe and sober truth. We would take leave\r\nto affirm, that a religious creed or constitution among whose supporters\r\na vast preponderance of females was to be found, stood in a dubious\r\nposition, and was open to the suspicion that its principles cannot stand\r\nexamination by the standards of reason and argument. Certain it is that\r\nthis severance of the sexes by religious distinctions is an unnatural\r\nstate of society, and a serious evil. It is accompanied too, and\r\naggravated, by another source of danger. The system of hanging the faith\r\nand feelings on the lips of a man, as if he were a special messenger\r\nfrom heaven, is nothing else than Popery, and goes to put a pope in\r\nevery pulpit. Incessant sermons, itinerant speeches, public meetings,\r\ndevotional assemblies, form a round of excitement of a dangerous and\r\ndeceptive kind, and are little else than a species of decent\r\ndissipation. The constant intervention of a favorite or fashionable\r\nminister in all the exercises of religion, identifies too much the\r\nsacred subject itself with the individual who presides over it; while\r\ntheatrical exhibitions of extemporaneous oratory and flights of fancy,\r\nmake the ordinary ritual of public worship, or the quiet practice of\r\nprivate devotion, seem tame and trivial. The tendency of the evil is,\r\nthat the direct access to a communion with above is barred against the\r\ndeluded and dependent devotee, much in the same manner as the votaries\r\nof Romanism are driven for aid to the intermediate intercession of the\r\nVirgin and the Saints. If the devotion of women is to be maintained\r\nmainly by the presence and personal influences of a spiritual guide and\r\nprompter, the selection ought to be made in accordance with other\r\nprinciples. The substitution of the priest or preacher in the place of\r\nthe husband or guardian, presupposes or foreshows a subversion more or\r\nless of the most essential relations of family life. The necessity of\r\nresorting to this means of gaining or maintaining power must degrade the\r\nclergy who depend on it, by tempting them to arts of flattery and\r\nexcitement, and by corrupting their style of instruction to suit the\r\ntastes merely of the more sensitive section of our species, at the\r\nsacrifice of that due proportion of more solid and intellectual grounds\r\nof thought and principle, which are needed to influence thoroughly the\r\nunderstandings of men. The remedy here also is to be found in a similar\r\ncourse of conduct to what has been formerly suggested. Let the heads of\r\nevery house do every thing in their power to call into exercise the good\r\nsense and natural feeling of the females who are dependent upon them, at\r\nthe same time that they give its due place to that all-important subject\r\nwhich is the occasion of the error. By a judicious mixture of sympathy\r\nand sober feeling, they may counteract the extraneous influences that\r\nare now at work, and restore peace to the family, by uniting its members\r\nin the practice of a calm and rational piety, of which, out-of-doors,\r\nthe best assistance and safeguard are to be found in the time-tried\r\ndoctrines and discipline of our PROTESTANT ESTABLISHMENTS.\r\n\r\nREFERENCE: MICHELET, (J.) _Du Pretre, de la Femme, de la Famille._ 1845.\r\n _Priests, Women, and Families._ By J. MICHELET. Translated by G. COCKS.\r\nLondon: Longmans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY COLLEGE FRIENDS.\r\n\r\nNo. II.\r\n\r\nHORACE LEICESTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nOxford! Alma Mater! not to love thee were indeed the ingratitude of a\r\ndegenerate son. Let the whiners of the Conventicle rail at thee for a\r\nmother of heretics, and the Joseph Humes of domestic economy propose to\r\nadapt the scale of thy expenses to their own narrow notions--I uphold\r\nthee to be the queen of all human institutions--the incarnated union of\r\nChurch and State--royal in thy revenues as in thy expenditure--thy\r\ndoctrine as orthodox as thy dinners, thy politics as sound as thy port.\r\n\r\nOxford! who are they that rail at her? who dare to lift their voice\r\nagainst that seat of high and holy memories? The man who boasts a\r\nprivate education, (so private, that his most intimate friends have\r\nnever found it out,) who, innocent himself of all academic experiences\r\nand associations, grudges to others that superiority which they never\r\nboast indeed, but to which his secret soul bears envious witness. Or the\r\nrich nonconformist, risen perhaps from obscurity to a rank in society,\r\nindulging either his spleen or his pride--either to send his eldest son\r\nas a gentleman-commoner to Christ-Church, to swallow the Thirty-nine\r\nArticles with his champagne; or to have his fling at the Church through\r\nher universities--accusing Churchmen of bigotry, and exclusiveness, and\r\nilliberality, because Dissenters do not found colleges.[2] Or, worse\r\nthan all, the unworthy disciple who (like the noxious plant that has\r\ngrown up beneath the shade of some goodly tree) has drawn no nobility of\r\nsoul from the associations which surrounded his ungrateful youth: for\r\nwhom all the reality and romance of academic education were alike in\r\nvain: sneering at the honours which he could not obtain, denying the\r\nexistence of opportunities which he neglected; the basest of approvers,\r\nhe quotes to his own eternal infamy the scenes of riot and dissipation,\r\nthe alternations of idleness and extravagance, which make up his sole\r\nrecollections of the university: and looking, without one glance of\r\naffection, upon the face of his fair and graceful mother, makes the\r\nchance mole, or the early wrinkle, which he traces there, the subject of\r\nhis irreverent jest, forgets the kindness of which he was unworthy, and\r\nremembers for evil the wholesome discipline which was irksome only to\r\nsuch as him.\r\n\r\n     \"Non haec jocosae conveniunt lyrae;\"\r\n\r\nI admit mine is not the tongue or pen for such a subject; and Oxford\r\nhas, I hope, no lack of abler champions. But it was geese, you know, who\r\nonce saved the Capitol; and I must have my hiss at the iniquitous\r\nquackeries which people seek to perpetrate under the taking title of\r\nUniversity Reform. And when I, loving Oxford as I do, see some of her\r\nown sons arrayed against her, I can only remember this much of my\r\nphilosophy--that there are cases when to be angry becomes a duty. Men\r\nwho, knowing nothing of the universities from experience, think proper\r\nto run them down, succeed at all events in exposing one crying evil--the\r\nabsurdity of meddling with what one does not understand. We who know\r\nbetter may afford to smile at once at their spite and their ignorance.\r\nBut he who lifts his voice against the mother that bore him, can fix no\r\ndarker blot upon her fame than the disgrace of having given birth to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nShow me the man who did not like Oxford, and I will show you either a\r\nsulky misanthrope or an affected ass. Many, many indeed, are the\r\nunpleasant recollections which, in the case of nearly all of us, will\r\nmingle with the joy with which we recall our college days. More than the\r\nghosts of duns departed, perhaps unpaid; more than the heart-burnings of\r\nthat visionary fellowship, for which we were beaten (we verily believe,\r\nunfairly) by a neck; more than that loved and lost ideal of first class,\r\nwhich we deserved, but did not get, (the opinions of our examiners not\r\ncoinciding in that point with our own;) yes, more than all these, come\r\nforcibly to many minds, the self-accusing silent voice that whispers of\r\ntime wasted and talents misapplied--kind advice, which the heat of youth\r\nmisconstrued or neglected--jewels of price that once lay strewed upon\r\nthe golden sands of life, then wantonly disregarded, or picked up but to\r\nbe flung away, and which the tide of advancing years has covered from\r\nour view for ever--blessed opportunities of acquiring wisdom, human and\r\ndivine, which never can return.\r\n\r\nYet in spite of all this, if there be any man who can say that Oxford is\r\nnot to him a land of pleasant memories, ~\"Met' hemoi parhestios\r\nghenoito\"~--which is, being freely translated, \"May he never put his legs\r\nunder my mahogany\"--that's all. I never knew him yet, and have no wish\r\nto make his acquaintance. He may have carried off every possible\r\nuniversity honour for what I care; he is more hopelessly stupid, in my\r\nview of things, than if he had been plucked fifteen times. If he was\r\nfond of reading, or of talking about reading; fond of hunting, or\r\ntalking about hunting; fond of walking, riding, rowing, leaping, or any\r\npossible exercise besides dancing; if he loved pleasant gardens or\r\nsolemn cloisters; learned retirement or unlearned jollification--in a\r\nword, if he had any imaginable human sympathies, and cared for any thing\r\nbesides himself, he would have liked Oxford. Men's tastes differ, no\r\ndoubt; but to have spent four years of the spring of one's life in one\r\nof the most magnificent cities and best societies in the world, and not\r\nto have enjoyed it--this is not a variety of taste, but its privation.\r\n\r\nI fancy there is a mistaken opinion very prevalent, that young and\r\nfoolish, older and wiser, are synonymous terms. Stout gentlemen of a\r\ncertain age, brimful of proprieties, shake their heads alarmingly, and\r\ntalk of the folly of boys; as if they were the only fools. And if at any\r\ntime, in the fulness of their hearts, they refer to some freak of their\r\nown youth, they appear to do it with a sort of apology to themselves,\r\nthat such wise individuals as they are now should ever have done such\r\nthings! And as the world stands at present, it is the old story of the\r\nLion and the Painter; the elderly gentlemen are likely to have it their\r\nown way; they say what they like, while the young ones are content to do\r\nwhat they like. And the more absurdity a man displays in his teens, (and\r\nsome, it must be confessed, are absurd enough) the more insupportable an\r\nair of wisdom does he put on when he gets settled. And as there is no\r\nhope of these sedate gentry being sent to College again to teach the\r\nrising generation of under-graduates the art of precocious gravity, and\r\nstill less hope of their arriving at it of themselves, perhaps there is\r\nno harm in mooting the question on neutral ground, whether such a\r\nconsummation as that of putting old heads upon young shoulders is\r\naltogether desirable.\r\n\r\nWherefore, I, Frank Hawthorne--being of the age of nine-and-twenty, or\r\nthereabouts, and of sound mind, and about to renounce for ever all claim\r\nand title to be considered a young man; having married a wife, and left\r\nsack and all other bad habits; having no longer any fellowship with\r\nunder-graduates, or army subs, or medical students, or young men about\r\ntown, or any other class of the heterogeneous irregulars who make up\r\n\"Young England\"--being a perfectly disinterested party in the question,\r\ninasmuch as having lost my reputation for youth, I have never acquired\r\none for wisdom--hereby raise my voice against the intolerable cant,\r\nwhich assumes every man to be a hare-brained scapegrace at twenty, and\r\nSolomon at forty-five. Youth sows wild oats, it may be; too many men in\r\nmore advanced life seem to me to sow no crop of any kind. There are\r\nempty fools at all ages; but \"an old fool,\" &c., (musty as the proverb\r\nis, it is rather from neglect than over-application.) I have known men\r\nby the dozen, who in their youth were either empty-headed coxcombs or\r\nnoisy sots; does my reader think that any given number of additional\r\nyears has made them able statesmen, sound lawyers, or erudite divines?\r\nthat because they have become honourable by a seat in Parliament,\r\nlearned by courtesy, reverend by office, they are therefore really more\r\nuseful members of society than when they lounged the High Street, or\r\nwoke the midnight echoes of the quadrangle? Nay, life is too short for\r\nthe leopard to change his spots, or the Ethiopian his skin; one can but\r\npare the claws of the first, and put a suit of the last European fashion\r\nupon the other.\r\n\r\nLet any man run over in his own mind the list of those school and\r\ncollege companions with whom, after the lapse of ten years or so he has\r\nstill an opportunity of occasionally renewing his acquaintance, and\r\njudging of the effect which time has had upon their habits and\r\ncharacters. In how many cases can he trace any material alteration,\r\nbeyond what results from the mere accidents of time and place? He finds,\r\nit is to be hoped, good principles developed, warm impulses ripened into\r\nactive habits, exaggerations softened down, (for I am giving him credit\r\nfor not choosing his companions, even in youth, among the vicious in\r\nheart and principle;) but if he finds in any what he can call a _change_\r\nat all, then I ask, in how many instances is it a change for the better?\r\nor does he not find it rather where there was no sterling value in the\r\nmetal, which, as the gloss of youth wears off, loses its only charm?\r\n\r\nThirty is the turning-point of a man's life; when marrying becomes a\r\nnow-or-never sort of business, and dinners begin to delight him more\r\nthan dancing. As I said just now, then, I stand just at the corner; and,\r\nlooking round before I turn it, I own somewhat of a shyness for the\r\ncompany of those \"grave and reverend seniors\" who are to be my\r\nfellow-travellers hereafter through life. There are certain points on\r\nwhich I fear we are scarce prepared to agree. I must have one window\r\nopen for the first few miles of the journey at all events--that I may\r\nlook behind me. Life's a fast train, and one can't expect to be allowed\r\nto get out at the stations; still less to ask the engineer to put back,\r\nbecause we have left our youth behind us. Yet there are some things in\r\nwhich I hope always to be a boy; I hope ever to prefer thoughtlessness\r\nto heartlessness, imprudence to selfishness, impulse to calculation. It\r\nis hard enough to part with all the fiery spirits, the glowing\r\nimaginations, the elasticity of mind and body which we lose as age\r\ncreeps on; but if, with the bright summer weather and cloudless skies of\r\nyouth, to which we are content to bid farewell, we must lose, too, the\r\n\"sunshine of the breast\"--the \"bloom of heart\"--then well might the poet\r\ncount him happy who died in early spring--who knew nothing of life but\r\nits fair promises, and passed away in happy scepticism of the winter\r\nwhich was to come.\r\n\r\nTalk of putting old heads upon young shoulders! Heaven forbid! It would\r\nbut be making them stoop prematurely. If indeed we could put young\r\nhearts into old bodies occasionally, we might do some good; or if there\r\ncould ever be combined in some fortunate individual, throughout his\r\nlife, the good qualities peculiar to each successive climacteric; if we\r\ncould mix just enough of the acid and the bitter, which are apt to\r\npredominate so unhappily after a long rubbing through the world, to\r\nqualify the fiery spirit of youth, and prevent its sweetness from\r\ncloying, the compound would undoubtedly be a very pleasant one. But\r\nthis, it is to be feared, like many other desiderata, is too good to be\r\nattainable; and the experience which we undoubtedly want in early life,\r\nwe acquire too often at the cost of that freshness of heart, which\r\nnature intended as a gift still more valuable.\r\n\r\nNowhere does the old Stagyrite display a more consummate knowledge of\r\nwhat men are made of, than in his contrasted characters of youth and\r\nage. I wonder how many of the old gentlemen who call themselves\r\nphilosophers in this degenerate age, ever read or remember what he says\r\non the subject. It is a great comfort, when one is arguing against so\r\nmuch collective wisdom, to feel that one has such authority to fall back\r\nupon; and I have the less hesitation in bringing my old friend Aristotle\r\nforward to help me, because I can assure my unlearned readers, ladies\r\nand others, that I am not going to quote any thing nearly so grave and\r\nsensible as modern philosophy. \"Stingy, ill-natured, suspicious,\r\nselfish, narrow-minded\"--these, with scarce a redeeming quality, are\r\nsome of the choice epithets which he strings together as the\r\ncharacteristics of the respectable old governors and dowagers of his\r\nday; while the young, although, as he confesses, somewhat too much the\r\ncreatures of impulse, and indebted to it for some of their virtues as\r\nwell as vices, are trustful towards others, honest in themselves,\r\nopen-handed and open-hearted, warm friends and brave enemies. It is\r\ntrue, he observes, they have, in a large degree, the fault common to all\r\nhonest men, they are \"easily humbugged;\" a failing which perhaps may let\r\nus into the secret of their sitting down so quietly under the imputation\r\nof a hundred others. He urges, too, elsewhere, a fact I am not disposed\r\nto battle about, that young men do not make good philosophers; but this\r\nis in a book which he wrote for the use of his own son, wherein he\r\nprobably thought it his duty to take the conceit out of his\r\nheir-apparent; but if he ever allowed the young philosopher to get a\r\nsight of the other book containing the two characters aforesaid, it may\r\nbe doubted whether he found him as \"easily humbugged\" afterwards.\r\n\r\nRemember, reader, as I said before I claim to occupy neutral ground. If\r\nI essay to defend youth from some injustice which it suffers at the\r\nhands of partial judges, it is as an amateur advocate rather than an\r\naccredited champion--for I am young no longer. If I am rash enough to\r\ncouch a lance against that venerable phantom, which, under the name of\r\nWisdom, hovers round grey hairs, I am but preparing a rod for my own\r\nback--for I feel myself growing old. I admit it with a sigh; but the\r\nsigh is not for the past only, but even more for the present. I mourn\r\nnot so much for that which Time has taken away, as for the insufficiency\r\nof that which it brings instead. I would rejoice to be relieved from the\r\ndominion of the hot follies of youth, if I could escape at the same time\r\nthe degrading yoke of the cooler vices of maturity. I do not find men\r\ngrow better as they grow older; wiser they may grow, but it is the\r\nwisdom of the serpent. We scarce grow less sensual, less vain, less\r\neager after what we think pleasure; I would we continued as generous and\r\nas warm. We gain the cunning to veil our passions, to regulate even our\r\nvices according to the scale (and that no parsimonious one) which what\r\nwe call \"society\" allows; we lose the enthusiasm which in some degree\r\nexcused our follies, with the light-heartedness which made them\r\ndelightful. Few men among us are they who can look back upon the years\r\ngone by, and not feel that, if these may be justly charged with folly,\r\nthe writing of the accusation that stands against their riper age is of\r\na graver sort.\r\n\r\nIt is melancholy, rather than amusing, to hear men of a certain age rail\r\nagainst the faults and extravagance of their juniors. Angry that they\r\nthemselves are no longer young, they visit with a rod of iron such an\r\nintolerable offence in others. Even newspapers have of late been\r\neloquent against the disgusting immoralities of breaking knockers and\r\nbonneting policemen. The _Times_ turns censor upon such an\r\n\"ungentlemanly outrage;\" the _Weekly Despatch_ has its propriety shocked\r\nby such \"freaks of the aristocracy;\" and both, in their zeal to\r\nreprobate offences so dangerous to the best interests of society,\r\nsacrifice somewhat of that \"valuable space\" which should have been\r\ndevoted to the bulletin of the health, or the history of the travels, of\r\nthe \"gallant officer\" who last deliberately shot his friend in a duel;\r\nor the piquant details of the last _crim. con._, with the extraordinary\r\ndisclosures expected to be made by the \"noble defendant.\" Society has no\r\nsympathy with vices to which it has no temptation; it might have done\r\nfoolish things in its day, but has long ago seen the folly of them. So\r\nwe make a graceful acknowledgment of having been wrong once, for the\r\nsake of congratulating ourselves upon being so very right now.\r\n\r\nLet me then, for some few moments, recall those scenes which, on the\r\nstage of life, have passed away for ever; and forgetting, as memory\r\nloves to do, the evil that was in them, let it be not idle repining to\r\nlament the good.\r\n\r\nOh! dark yet pleasant quadrangle, round whose wide area I might wander\r\nnow, a stranger among strangers, where are they who once gave life and\r\nmirth to cheer those ancient walls? There were full a score of rooms,\r\ncongenial _lares_, in which no hour of day or night would have found me\r\nother than a welcome guest. I had friends, yea, friends, within those\r\nprison-like windows--warm hearts walled in by thy cold grey\r\nstones--friends that had thoughts, and feelings, and pursuits in\r\ncommon--who were not hospitable in words alone, suffering each other's\r\npresence with well-concealed _ennui_--but friends in something more than\r\nin the name. In vain, among the cold conventionalities of life, shall I\r\nlook for the warm and kindly welcome, the sympathy of feeling, the\r\nunrestrained yet courteous familiarity of intercourse, which was part\r\nand parcel of a college life; and if for this only I should say of\r\nOxford, that I shall not look upon its like again--if for this only, I\r\ndoubt whether the years of my youthful pilgrimage were altogether evil,\r\nwho shall gainsay me? Where, or in what society of wise, and orderly,\r\nand respectable \"grown-up children,\" shall I find the sincerity and\r\nwarm-heartedness that once were the atmosphere of my daily life? Where\r\nis the friend of my maturer choosing, into whose house I can walk at any\r\ntime, and feel sure I am no intruder? Where is the man, among those with\r\nwhom I am by hard fate compelled to associate, who does not measure his\r\nregard, his hospitality, his very smiles, by my income, my station in\r\nsociety--any thing but myself? Older and wiser!--oh yes!--youthful\r\nfriendship is very foolish in such matters.\r\n\r\nBut I suppose I must put up, as I best may, with the accumulating weight\r\nof years and wisdom. It won't do to give up one's degree, and begin\r\nagain at the university, even if they leave us a university worth going\r\nto. At all events, one could not go back and find there those \"old\r\nfamiliar faces\" that made it what it was; and it is more pleasant to\r\nlook upon it all--the place and its old occupants--as still existing in\r\nsome dream-land or other, than to return to find an old acquaintance in\r\nevery stick and stone, while every human face and voice is strange to\r\nus.\r\n\r\nYet one does meet friends in old scenes, sometimes, when the meeting is\r\nas unexpected as delightful. And just so, in my last visit to Oxford,\r\ndid I stumble upon Horace Leicester. We met in the quadrangle where we\r\nhad parted some six years back, just as we might if we had supped\r\ntogether the night before; whereas we had been all the time hundreds of\r\nmiles asunder: and we met as unrestrainedly, only far more cordially.\r\nNeither of us had much time to spare in Oxford, but we dined together of\r\ncourse; talked over old friends, and told old stories. As to the first,\r\nit was strange enough to moralize upon the after-fortunes of some of our\r\ncontemporaries. One--of whom, for habitual absence from lectures, and\r\nother misdemeanours many and various, the tutors had prophesied all\r\nmanner of evil, and who had been dismissed by the Principal at his final\r\nleave-taking, with the remark that he was the luckiest man he had ever\r\nknown, inasmuch as having been perseveringly idle without being plucked,\r\nand mixed up in every row without being rusticated--was now working hard\r\nday and night as a barrister, engaged as a junior on committee business\r\nthe whole Session, and never taking a holiday except on the Derby day.\r\nThe ugliest little rascal of our acquaintance, and as stupid as a post,\r\nwas married to a pretty girl with a fortune of thirty thousand. Another,\r\nand one of the best of us--Charley White--who united the business habits\r\nof a man with the frolic of a schoolboy, and who ought to have been\r\nadded to the roll of the College benefactors, as having been the founder\r\nof the Cricket and the Whist Club, and restored to its old place on the\r\nriver, at much cost and pains, the boat which had been withdrawn for the\r\nlast five years, and reduced the sundry desultory idlenesses of the\r\nunder-graduates into something like method and order--Charley White was\r\nnow rector of a poor and populous parish in Yorkshire, busily engaged in\r\nbuilding a new church and schools, opening Provident Societies, and\r\nshutting up beer-shops, and instructing the rising generation of his\r\nparishioners in catechism and cricket alternately. While the steadiest\r\n(I was very near saying the only steady man) among our mutual\r\nacquaintance, who looked at every sixpence before he spent it, checked\r\nhis own washing-lists, went to bed at ten o'clock, and was in short an\r\nexemplary character, (he was held out to me; on my first entrance, as a\r\nvaluable acquaintance for any young man, but I soon despaired of\r\nsuccessfully imitating so bright a model)--well, this gentleman having\r\nbeen taken into partnership, somewhat prematurely perhaps on the\r\nstrength of the aforesaid reputation, by his father's firm--they were\r\nLiverpool merchants of high standing--had thought proper, disgusted\r\nprobably with the dissipations and immoralities of trade, to retire to\r\nAmerica in search of purity and independence, without going through the\r\nform of closing his accounts with the house. The Liverpudleians, indeed,\r\naccording to Horace's account, gave a somewhat ugly name to the\r\ntransaction; he had been cashier to the firm, they said, who were minus\r\nsome tens of thousands thereby; but as the senior partner was known to\r\nhave smoked cigars at a preparatory school (thereby showing what he\r\n_would_ have done had he been sent to Oxford,) whereas our friend was\r\nalways \"a steady man,\" I leave the reader to judge which party is\r\nentitled to the most credit.\r\n\r\nIt was after we had separated that a friend of mine, not an Oxford man,\r\nwho had dined with us and appeared much amused by some of Horace's\r\nreminiscences, asked me the very puzzling question, \"Was your friend\r\nLeicester what they call a 'rowing man' at College?\" Now, I protest\r\naltogether against the division of under-graduates into reading men and\r\nrowing men, as arbitrary and most illogical; there being a great many\r\nwho have no claim to be reckoned either in one class or the other, and a\r\ngreat many who hover between both. And this imaginary distinction,\r\nexisting as it notoriously does at Oxford, and fostered and impressed\r\nupon men by the tutors, (often unintentionally, or with the very best\r\nintentions,) is productive in many cases of a great deal of harm. A man\r\n(or _boy_ if you please) is taught to believe, upon his very first\r\nentrance, that one of these characters will infallibly cling to him, and\r\nthat he has only to choose between the two. For the imaginary division\r\ncreates a real one; in many colleges, a man who joins a boat's crew, or\r\na cricket club, or goes out now and then with the harriers, is looked\r\nupon with suspicion by the authorities at once; and by a very natural\r\nconsequence, a man who wants to read his five or six hours a-day\r\nquietly, finds that some of his pleasantest companions look upon him as\r\na slow coach. So, probably before the end of his first term, he is\r\nhopelessly committed, at nineteen, to a consistency of character rarely\r\nmet with at fifty. If he lays claim to the reputation of a reading man,\r\nand has an eye to the loaves and fishes in the way of scholarships and\r\nfellowships, he is compelled, by the laws of his _caste_, to renounce\r\nsome of the most sensible and healthful amusements which a university\r\nlife offers. He must lead a very humdrum sort of life indeed. It is not\r\nenough that he should be free from the stains of vice and immorality;\r\nthat his principles and habits should be those of a gentleman; that he\r\nshould avoid excesses, and be observant of discipline; this the\r\nuniversity would have a right to expect from all who are candidates for\r\nher honours and emoluments. But there is a conventional character which\r\nhe must put on besides this. I say \"put on;\" because, however natural it\r\nmay be to some men, it cannot possibly be so to all. His exercise must\r\nbe taken at stated times and places: it must consist principally of\r\nwalking, whether he be fond of it or not, varied occasionally by a\r\nsolitary skiffing expedition down the river, or a game of billiards with\r\nsome very steady friend on the sly. His dress must exhibit either the\r\nnegligence of a sloven, (in case he be an aspirant for very high honours\r\nindeed,) or the grave precision of a respectable gentleman of forty. He\r\nmust eschew all such vanities as white trousers and well-cut boots. He\r\nmust be profoundly ignorant of all university intelligence that does not\r\nbear in some way on the schools; must be utterly indifferent what boat\r\nis at the head of the river, or whether Drake's hounds are fox or\r\nharriers. He must never be seen out of his rooms except at lecture\r\nbefore two o'clock, and never return to a wine-party after chapel. His\r\njudgment of the merits of port and sherry must be confined principally\r\nto the fact of one being red and the other white, and the compounding of\r\npunch must be to him a mystery unfathomable. Now, if he can be, or\r\nassume to be, all this, then he will be admitted into the most orthodox\r\nand steady set in his college; and if he have, besides, an ordinary\r\namount of scholarship, and tact enough to talk judiciously about his\r\nbooks and his reading, he may get up a very fair reputation indeed. And\r\nwhen at his final examination he makes, as nine-tenths of such men do\r\nmake, a grand crash, and his name comes out in the third or fourth\r\nclass, or he get \"gulfed\" altogether--it is two to one but his friends\r\nand his tutor look upon him, and talk of him, as rather an ill-used\r\nindividual. He was \"unlucky in his examination\"--\"the essay did not suit\r\nhim\"--they were \"quite surprised at his failure\"--\"his health was not\r\ngood the last term or two\"--\"he was too nervous.\" These are cases which\r\nhave occurred in every man's experience: men read ten hours a-day, with\r\na watch by their side, cramming in stuff that they do not understand,\r\nare talked about as \"sure firsts\" till one gets sick of their very\r\nnames, assume all the airs which really able men seldom do assume, and\r\ntake at last an equal degree with others who have been acquiring the\r\nsame amount of knowledge with infinitely less pretension, and who,\r\nwithout moping the best part of their lives in an artificial existence,\r\nwill make more useful members of society in the end. \"How was it,\" said\r\nan old lady in the country to me one day, \"that young Mr C---- did not\r\nget a first class? I understand he read very hard, and I know he refused\r\nevery invitation to dinner when he was down here in the summer\r\nvacation?\" \"That was the very reason, my dear madam,\" said I; \"you may\r\ndepend upon it.\" She stared, of course; but I believe I was not far out.\r\n\r\nLet men read as much as they will, and as hard as they will, on any\r\nsubjects for which they have the ability and inclination; but never let\r\nthem suppose they are to lay down one code of practice to suit all\r\ntempers and constitutions. Cannot a man be a scholar, and a gentleman,\r\nand a good fellow at the same time?\r\n\r\nAnd, after all, where is the broad moral distinction between these\r\n_soi-disant_ steady men, and those whom they are pleased to consider as\r\n\"rowing\" characters? it has always seemed to me rather apocryphal. If a\r\nman thinks proper to amuse himself with a chorus in his own rooms at one\r\no'clock in the morning, it seems hardly material whether it be Greek or\r\nEnglish--Sophocles or Tom Moore. It's a matter of taste, and tastes\r\ndiffer. Nor do I think the morality of Horace or Aristophanes, or the\r\ntheology of Lucretius, so peculiarly admirable, as to render them, _per\r\nse_, fitter subjects for the exclusive exercise of a young man's\r\nfaculties than \"the Pickwick Papers,\" or \"The Rod and the Gun.\" I have\r\nheard--(I never saw, nor will I believe it)--of the profanity of certain\r\nsporting under-graduates, who took into chapel the racing calendar,\r\nbound in red morocco, instead of a prayer-book; I hold it to have been\r\nthe malicious fiction of some would-be university reformer; but, even if\r\ntrue, I am not sure that I much prefer that provident piety which I have\r\nnoticed getting up its Greek within the same walls by means of a\r\nSeptuagint and Greek liturgy. Religion is one thing, classical learning\r\nanother, and sporting information another; all totally distinct, and\r\ntotally different: the first immeasurably above the other two, but\r\nstanding equidistant from both. It does not make a man one whit the\r\nbetter to know that Coraebus won the cup at Olympia B.C. 776, than it\r\ndoes to know that Priam did _not_ win the St Leger at Doncaster A.D.\r\n1830; from all I can make out, the Greeks on the turf at present are not\r\nmuch worse than their old namesakes; I dare say there was a fair amount\r\nof black-legism on both occasions. Men injure their moral and physical\r\nhealth by reading as much as by other things; it takes quite as much out\r\nof a man, and puts as little in him to any good purpose, to get up his\r\nlogic as to pull in an eight-oar.\r\n\r\nBesides, if one is to read and enter into the spirit of a dozen\r\ndifferent authors, one dull monotonous round of physical existence seems\r\nill fitted to call out the requisite variety of mental powers. I hold\r\nthat there are divers and sundry fit times, and places, and states of\r\nmind, suited to different lines of reading. If a man is at work upon\r\nhistory, by all means let him sport oak rigidly against all visitors;\r\nlet him pile up his authorities and references on every vacant chair all\r\nround him, and get a clear notion of it by five or six hours'\r\nuninterrupted and careful study. Or, if he has a system of philosophy to\r\nget up, let him sit down with his head cool, his window open, (not the\r\none looking into quad.,) let him banish from his mind all minor matters,\r\nand not break off in the chain of argument so long as he can keep his\r\nbrain clear and his eyes open. Even then, a good gallop afterwards, or a\r\ncigar and a glass of punch, with some lively fellow who is no\r\nphilosopher, will do him far more good than a fagging walk of so many\r\nmeasured miles, with the studious companion whose head is stuffed as\r\nfull of such matter as his own, and whose talk will be of disputed\r\npassages, and dispiriting anticipations of a \"dead floorer\" in the\r\nschools. But if a man wants to make acquaintance with such books as\r\nJuvenal, or Horace, or Aristophanes, he may surely do it to quite as\r\ngood purpose, and with far more relish, basking under a tree in summer,\r\nor with a friend over a bottle in winter.\r\n\r\nThe false tone of society of which I have been speaking had its\r\ninfluence upon Horace Leicester. Coming up to the university from a\r\npublic school, with a high character, a fair amount of scholarship, and\r\na host of acquaintances, he won the good-will at once of dons and of\r\nunder-graduates, and bid fair to be as universal a favourite at college\r\nas he had been at Harrow. Never did a man enter upon an academic life\r\nunder happier auspices, nor, I believe, with a more thorough\r\ndetermination to enjoy it in every way. He did not look upon his\r\nemancipation from school discipline as a license for idleness, nor\r\nintend to read the less because he could now read what he pleased, and\r\nwhen he pleased. For, not to mention that Horace was ambitious, and had\r\nat one time an eye to the class list--he had a taste for reading, and a\r\nstrong natural talent to appreciate what he read. But if he had a taste\r\nfor reading, he had other tastes as well, and, as he thought, not\r\nincompatible; much as he admired his Roman namesake, he could not devote\r\nhis evenings exclusively to his society, but preferred carrying out his\r\nprecepts occasionally with more modern companions; and he had no notion\r\nthat during the next four years of his life he was to take an interest\r\nin no sports but those of the old Greeks and Romans, and mount no horse\r\nbut Pegasus. For a term or two, Leicester got on very well, attended\r\nlectures, read steadily till one or two o'clock, when there was nothing\r\nparticular going on, kept a horse, hired an alarm, and seldom cut\r\nmorning chapel, or missed a meet if within reasonable distance. It was a\r\ncourse of life, which, in after days, he often referred to with a sigh\r\nas having been most exemplary; and I doubt whether he was far wrong. But\r\nit did not last. For a time his gentlemanly manners, good humour, and\r\ngood taste, carried it off with all parties; but it was against the\r\nordinary routine, and could not hold up against the popular prejudice.\r\nThe reading men eyed his top-boots with suspicion; the rowing men\r\ncomplained he was growing a regular _sap_, always sporting oak when they\r\nwanted him. Then his wine-parties were a source of endless tribulation\r\nto him. First of all, he asked all those with whom he was most intimate\r\namong his old schoolfellows to meet each other, adding one or two of his\r\nnew acquaintances: and a pretty mess he made of it. Men who had sat on\r\nthe same form with him and with each other at Harrow, and had betrayed\r\nno such marked differences in their tastes as to prevent their\r\nassociating very pleasantly there, at Oxford, he found, had been\r\nseparated wide as the poles by this invisible, but impassable, line of\r\ndemarcation: to such a degree indeed, that although all had called upon\r\nHorace, as they had upon each other, before it seemed decided on which\r\nside they were to settle, yet when they now met at his rooms, they had\r\nbecome strangers beyond a mere civil recognition, and had not a single\r\nsubject to converse upon in common. In fact, they were rather surprised\r\nthan pleased to meet at all; and it was in vain their host tried to get\r\nthem to amalgamate. Many seemed to take a pleasure in showing how\r\ndecidedly they belonged to one set or the other. One would talk of\r\nnothing on earth besides hunting, and sat silent and sulky when Horace\r\nturned the conversation; another affected an utter ignorance of all that\r\nwas going on in the university that was not connected with class-lists,\r\nscholarships, &c. What provoked him most was, that some of those who\r\ngave themselves the most pedantic airs, and would have been double-first\r\nclass men undeniably, if talking could have done it, were those whose\r\nheads he well knew were as empty as the last bottle, and which made him\r\nthink that some men must take to reading at Oxford, simply because they\r\nhad faculties for nothing else.\r\n\r\nAt all events, Horace found the mixed system would not answer for\r\nentertaining his friends. So the next time he asked a few of the reading\r\nmen, some of whom he knew used to be good fellows, together; and as he\r\nreally had a kindred taste with them on many subjects, he found an hour\r\nor so pass away very pleasantly: when just as he was passing the wine\r\nabout the third round, and his own brilliancy and good-humour were\r\nbeginning to infect some of his guests--so that one grave genius of\r\ntwenty had actually so far forgotten himself as to fill a bumper by\r\nmistake--up jumped the senior man of the party, and declaring that he\r\nhad an engagement to walk with a friend at seven politely took his\r\nleave. This was the signal for a general dispersion; in vain did Horace\r\nassure them they should have some coffee in the course of an hour, and\r\nentreat some one or two to return. Off they all went with sundry smiles\r\nand shakes of the head, and left their unfortunate host sitting alone in\r\nhis glory over the first glass of a newly opened bottle of claret.\r\n\r\nI happened to be crossing the quadrangle from chapel in company with\r\nSavile, at the moment when Leicester put his head out of his window as\r\nif to enquire of the world in general what on earth he was to do with\r\nhimself for the next hour or two. Savile he hailed at once, and begged\r\nhim to come up; and though I knew but little of him, and had never been\r\nin his rooms before, still, as I was one or two terms his senior, there\r\nwas nothing contrary even to Oxford etiquette in my accompanying Savile.\r\nWe laughed heartily when he explained his disappointment. Savile tried\r\nto comfort him by the assurance that, as he had an hour to spare, he\r\nwould sit down and help him to finish a bottle or two of claret with a\r\ngreat deal of pleasure; and was inclined to attribute the failure of the\r\nevening, in a great measure, to his name not having been included in the\r\nlist of invitations--an omission by which he declared all parties had\r\nbeen the losers; Horace's reading friends standing very much in need of\r\nsome one to put a little life into them, and himself as a candidate for\r\na degree, having missed a fair opportunity of meeting, among so many\r\nchoice fellows, some one to \"put him up to the examiners' dodges.\" But\r\nLeicester was irrecoverably disgusted. Nothing, he declared, would ever\r\ninduce him to ask a party of reading men to his rooms again; and from\r\nthat hour he seemed to eschew fellowship with the whole fraternity. Not\r\nthat he became idle all at once; on the contrary, I believe, for some\r\ntime he worked on steadily, or at least tried to work; but he was\r\nnaturally fond of society, and having failed to find what he wanted, was\r\nreduced to make the best of such as he could find. So he gradually\r\nbecame acquainted with a set of men who, whatever their good qualities\r\nmight be, had certainly no claim whatever to be considered hard readers,\r\nand who would have considered a symposium which broke up at seven\r\no'clock as unsatisfactory as a tale without a conclusion. Amongst these,\r\nhis gentlemanly manners and kindness of heart made him beloved, while\r\nhis talents gave him a kind of influence; and, though he must have felt\r\noccasionally that he was not altogether in his right place, and that,\r\nbesides his popular qualities, he had higher tastes and endowments with\r\nwhich the majority of his companions could hardly sympathise, he was too\r\nlight-hearted to philosophise much on the subject, and contented himself\r\nwith enjoying his popularity, occasionally falling back upon his own\r\nresources, and keeping up, in a desultory kind of way, his acquaintance\r\nwith scholarship and literature. The reading men of course looked upon\r\nhim as a lost sheep; the tutors shook their heads about him; if he did\r\nwell, it was set down as the result of accident; while all his misdoings\r\nwere labouring in his vocation. For, agreeably to the grand division\r\naforesaid, Horace was now set down as a \"rowing-man;\" and he soon made\r\nthe discovery, and did more thereupon to deserve the character than he\r\never would have done otherwise. He was very willing to go on in his own\r\nway, if all parties would but let him alone; he was not going to be made\r\na proselyte to long walks, and toast and water, nor had he any\r\nconscientious abhorrence of supper-parties; and, as his prospects in\r\nlife were in no way dependent upon a class or a scholarship, and he\r\nseemed to be tacitly repudiated by the _literati_ of his college, young\r\nand old, on account of some of his aforesaid heterodox notions on the\r\nsubject of study, he accustomed himself gradually to set their opinions\r\nat defiance; while the moderate reading, which encouragement and\r\nemulation had made easy at school, became every day more and more\r\ndistasteful.\r\n\r\nHorace's tottering reputation was at last completely overset in the eyes\r\nof the authorities by a little affair which was absurd enough, but in\r\nwhich he himself was as innocent as they were. It happened that a\r\nyouthful cousin of his, whose sole occupation for the last twelve months\r\nof his life had been the not over-profitable one of waiting for a\r\ncommission, had come up to Oxford for two or three days, pursuant to\r\ninvitation, to see a little of the manners and customs of the\r\ninhabitants. I think he had some slight acquaintance with our then\r\nvice-principal--a good-natured, easy man--and Horace had got leave for\r\nhim to occupy a set of very small, dark rooms, which, as the college was\r\nnot very full, had been suffered to remain vacant for the last two or\r\nthree terms; they were so very unattractive a domicile, that the last\r\nFreshman to whom they were offered, as a Hobson's choice, was currently\r\nreported, in the plenitude of his disgust, to have take his name off the\r\nbooks _instanter_. It is not usual to allow strangers to sleep within\r\ncollege walls at all; but our discipline was somewhat lax in those days.\r\nSo Mr Carey had a bed put up for him in the aforesaid quarters. He was,\r\nof course, duly _feted_, and made much of by Horace and his friends; and\r\na dozen of us sat down to a capital dinner in the rooms of the former,\r\non the strength of having to entertain a \"stranger from the country;\"\r\nthe hospitality of Oxford relaxing its rules even in favour of\r\nunder-graduates upon such occasions. It must have been somewhere towards\r\nthe next morning, when two or three of us accompanied young Carey down\r\nto No. 8; and, after chatting with him till he was half undressed, left\r\nhim, as we thought, safe and quiet. However, soon after we had retired,\r\nsome noisy individual in the same staircase thought proper to give a\r\nview-hollo out of his window, for the purpose of wishing the public\r\ngood-night. Now there was one of the Fellows, a choleric little old\r\ngentleman, always in residence, holding some office, in which there was\r\nas little to do, and as much to get as might be, and who seldom troubled\r\nhimself much about college discipline, and looked upon under-graduates\r\nwith a sort of silent contempt; never interfering with them, as he\r\ndeclared himself, so long as they did not interfere with him. But one\r\npoint there was, in which they did interfere with his personal comfort\r\noccasionally, and whereby his peace of mind and rest of body were\r\nequally disturbed. Mr Perkins always took a tumbler of negus at ten\r\nprecisely, and turned in as the college clock struck the quarter past;\r\nby the half-hour he was generally asleep, for his digestion was good,\r\nand his cares few. But his slumbers were not heavy, and any thing like a\r\nrow in the quadrangle infallibly awoke him, and then he was like a lion\r\nroused. He was wont to jump up, throw up his window, thrust out a red\r\nface and a white nightcap, and after listening a few seconds for the\r\nchance of the odious sounds being repeated, would put the very pertinent\r\nquestion usual in such circumstances, to which one so seldom gets an\r\nequally pertinent reply--\"Who's that?\" In case this intimation of Mr\r\nPerkins being wide awake proved sufficient, as it often did, to restore\r\nquiet, then after the lapse of a few more seconds the head and the\r\nnightcap disappeared, and the window was shut down again. But if the\r\nnoise was continued, as occasionally it was out of pure mischief, than\r\nin a minute or two the said nightcap would be seen to emerge hastily\r\nfrom the staircase below, in company with a dressing-gown and slippers,\r\nand Mr Perkins in this disguise would proceed to the scene of\r\ndisturbance as fast as his short legs could carry him. He seldom\r\nsucceeded in effecting a capture; but if he had that luck, or if he\r\ncould distinguish the tone of any individual voice so as to be able to\r\nidentify the performer, he had him up before the \"seniority\" next\r\nmorning, where his influence as one of the senior fellows ensured a\r\nheavy sentence. But he had been engaged in so many unsuccessful chases\r\nof the kind, and his short orations from his window so often elicited\r\nonly a laugh, though including sometimes brief but explicit threats of\r\nrustication against the noisy unknown, strengthened by little expletives\r\nwhich, when quoted by under-graduates, were made to sound somewhat\r\ndoubtfully--that at last he altered his tactics, and began to act in\r\nsilence. And so he did, when upon opening his window he saw a light in\r\nthe ground-floor rooms of the staircase whence the sounds proceeded on\r\nthe evening in question. Carey, by his own account, was proceeding\r\nquietly in his preparations for bed, singing to himself an occasional\r\nstanza of some classical ditty which he had picked up in the course of\r\nthe evening, and admiring the power of the man's lungs in the room above\r\nhim, when he heard a short quick step, and then a double rap at his\r\ndoor. He was quite sufficiently acquainted, by this time, with the ways\r\nof the place, not to be much surprised at the late visit and at the same\r\ntime to consider it prudent to learn the name and _status_ of his\r\nvisitor before admitting him; so he retorted upon Mr Perkins, quite\r\nunconsciously, his own favourite query--\"Who's that?\" his first and\r\nobvious impression being that it was one of the party he had just\r\nquitted, coming probably, in the plenitude of good fellowship, to bring\r\nhim an invitation to wine or breakfast next day.\r\n\r\n\"It's me, sir--open the door,\" was the reply from a deep baritone, which\r\nthe initiated would never have mistaken.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" said Carey again.\r\n\r\n\"My name is Perkins, sir: have the goodness to let me in.\" He was\r\ngetting more angry, and consequently more polite.\r\n\r\n\"Perkins?\" said Carey, pausing in his operations, in the vain endeavour\r\nto recall the name among the score or two to whom he had been\r\nintroduced. \"I'm just in bed--were you up at Leicester's?\"\r\n\r\n\"Open the door, sir, if you please, immediately,\" and then came what our\r\nfriend took for a smothered laugh, but was really a sort of shiver, for\r\nthere was a draft in the passage playing all manner of pranks with the\r\ndressing-gown, and Mr Perkins was getting cold.\r\n\r\nAn indistinct notion came into Carey's mind, that some one who had met\r\nhim in College might have taken him for a Freshman, and had some\r\npractical joke in view; so he contented himself with repeating that he\r\nwas going to bed, and could let no one in.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you, sir, I'm Mr Perkins; don't you know me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you a very good night, Mr Perkins.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's your name, sir? eh? You impudent young puppy, what's your\r\ninfernal name? I'll have you rusticated, you dog--do you hear me, sir?\"\r\n\r\nOn a sudden it struck Carey that this might possibly be a domiciliary\r\nvisit from one of the authorities, and that his best plan was to open\r\nthe door at once, though what had procured him such an honour he was at\r\na loss to imagine. He drew back the spring lock, therefore, and the next\r\nmoment stood face to face with the irate Mr Perkins.\r\n\r\nHis first impulse was to laugh at the curious figure before him; but\r\nwhen demands for his name, and threats of unknown penalties, were\r\nthundered forth upon him with no pause for a reply, then he began to\r\nthink that he had made a mistake in opening the door at all--that he\r\nmight get Leicester into a scrape if not himself--and as his person was\r\nas unknown to Mr Perkins as that gentleman's to him, it struck him that\r\nif he could give him the slip once, it would be all right. In a moment\r\nhe blew out his solitary candle, bolted through the open door, all but\r\nupsetting his new acquaintance, whom he left storming in the most\r\nunconnected manner, alone, and in total darkness. Up to Leicester's\r\nrooms he rushed, related his adventure, and was rather surprised that\r\nhis cousin did not applaud it as a very clever thing.\r\n\r\nWhat Mr Perkins thought or said to himself, what degree of patience he\r\nexhibited in such trying circumstances, or in what terms he\r\napostrophised his flying enemy, must ever remain a secret with himself.\r\nFive minutes after, Solomon the porter, summoned from his bed just as he\r\nhad made himself snug once more after letting out Horace's out-college\r\nfriends, confronted Mr Perkins in about as sweet a temper as that worthy\r\nindividual himself, with this difference, that one was sulky and the\r\nother furious.\r\n\r\n\"Who lives in the ground-floor on the left in No. 8?\"\r\n\r\n\"What, in 'Coventry?' Why, nobody, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody! you stupid old sinner, you're asleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, I ain't,\" and Solomon flashed his lantern in Mr Perkins's face\r\nas if to ascertain whether _his_ eyes were open. Mr Perkins started\r\nback, and Solomon turned half round as if to disappear again.\r\n\r\n\"Who lives there, Solomon, I ask you? Do you mean to tell me you don't\r\nknow? You are not fit--\"\r\n\r\n\"I knows every gentleman's rooms well enough: nobody hasn't lived in\r\nthem as you means not these four terms. Mr Pears kept his fox in 'em one\r\ntime, till the vice-principal got wind of him. There may be some varmint\r\nin 'em for all I knows--they a'n't fit for much else.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's some confounded puppy of a Freshman in them now--at least\r\nthere was--and he lives there too.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know there _be'n't_,\" said the persevering Solomon. And, without\r\ndeigning a word more, he set off with his lantern towards the place in\r\ndispute, followed by Mr Perkins, who contented himself with an angry\r\n\"Now you'll see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, now we shall see,\" replied Solomon, as, somewhat to Mr Perkins's\r\nastonishment, they found the oak sported. Having made a selection from a\r\nhuge bunch of keys, the porter succeeded, after some fumbling, in\r\ngetting the door open. The room bore no traces of recent occupation.\r\nThree or four broken chairs and a rickety table were the only furniture:\r\nas far as the light of Solomon's lantern could penetrate, it looked the\r\nvery picture of desolation. Solomon chuckled.\r\n\r\n\"There _is_ a man living here. I'll swear there is. He was undressing\r\nwhen I came. Look in the bedroom.\"\r\n\r\nThey opened the door, and saw a bare feather-bed and bolster, the usual\r\n_materiel_ in an unoccupied college chamber. \"Seeing's believing,\" said\r\nthe porter.\r\n\r\nBut, with Mr Perkins, seeing was not believing. He saw Solomon, and he\r\nsaw the empty room, but he did not believe either. But he had evidently\r\nthe worst side of the argument as it stood, so he wished the porter a\r\nsulky good-night, and retreated.\r\n\r\nThe fact was, that the noisy gentleman in the rooms above, as soon as he\r\ncaught the tones of Mr Perkins's voice at Carey's door, had entered into\r\nthe joke with exceeding gusto, well aware that the visit was really\r\nintended as a compliment to his own vocal powers. Carey's sudden bolt\r\npuzzled him rather; but as soon as he heard Mr Perkins's footsteps take\r\nthe direction of the porter's lodge, he walked softly down-stairs to the\r\nfield of action, and, anticipating in some degree what would follow,\r\nbundled up together sheets, blankets, pillow, dressing apparatus, and\r\nall other signs and tokens of occupation, and made off with them to his\r\nown rooms; sporting the oak behind him, and thus completing the\r\nmystification.\r\n\r\nAs the facts of the case were pretty sure to transpire in course of\r\ntime, Horace took the safe course of getting his cousin out of college\r\nnext morning, and calling on Mr Perkins with a full explanation of the\r\ncircumstances, and apologies for Carey as a stranger unacquainted with\r\nthe police regulations of their learned body, and the respect due\r\nthereto. Of course the man in authority was obliged to be gracious, as\r\nLeicester could not well be answerable for all the faults of his family;\r\nbut there never from that time forth happened a row of any kind with\r\nwhich he did not in his own mind, probably unconsciously, associate poor\r\nHorace.\r\n\r\nWhether my readers will set down Horace Leicester as a rowing man or\r\nnot, is a point which I leave to their merciful consideration: a reading\r\nman was a title which he never aspired to. He took a very creditable\r\ndegree in due season, and was placed in the fourth class with a man who\r\ntook up a very long list of books, and was supposed to have read himself\r\nstupid.\r\n\r\n\"He ought to have done a good deal more,\" said one of the tutors; \"he\r\nhad it in him.\" \"I think he was lucky not to have been plucked, myself,\"\r\nsaid Mr Perkins; \"he was a very noisy man.\"\r\n\r\n  HAWTHORNE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Why do not these universal rational religionists found\r\ncolleges for themselves, and get an university established on a scale of\r\nsplendour commensurate with their liberality, so as to cut out Oxford,\r\nwith its antiquated notions, altogether? How very funny it would be! It\r\nmust be the absurdity of the idea that prevents them--it cannot be\r\nstinginess as to the means. Fancy Oxford in the hands of the three\r\ndenominations! the under-graduates hauled up for cutting meeting!--a\r\nWesleyan proctor, delighting in black gowns, stopping by mistake a\r\nQuaker Freshman, with a reproof for being in broad-brim instead of\r\nacademicals, and being answered with \"Friend, I am not of thy\r\npersuasion!\" Then the dissenting D.D.s flocking to the university sermon\r\nat Mount Pisgah Chapel, (late St. Mary's,) wherein all denominational\r\ntopics were to be carefully avoided, and the sharp look-out that would\r\nbe kept upon any preacher whose harangues savoured of bigotry! Then the\r\nboat-races; fancy the Independents' boat bumping the Particular\r\nBaptists', and the Quakers' colours--drab-and-all-drab--floating at the\r\nhead of the flag-staff! And as to \"tufts\"--that vile distinction which\r\nindependent M.P.s are so indignant at--why, if a dissenting\r\nnobleman--even the seventh son of an Irish peer--were to be had for love\r\nor money, what a price he would fetch in such an Utopia of\r\nnonconformity! Nay, if they could get even a Nova Scotia baronet--a Sir\r\nAnybody Anything--we know pretty well what a fuss they would make about\r\nhim. There is no such fawner on the aristocracy, if he has but a chance\r\nof getting any thing out of them, as a _parvenu_ by birth, a liberal in\r\npolitics, and an Independent by \"_religious persuasion_.\"\r\n\r\nThe great danger, I suppose, would be, lest some more than usually\r\nnonconforming under-graduate should start a \"connexion\" of his own, and\r\nproceed to argue that all the university authorities, heads of houses\r\nand all, were under an awful delusion, and that it was a necessary\r\nconsequence of civil and religious liberty, that under-graduates should\r\nelect their own tutors and proctors, and be governed on the voluntary\r\nprinciple.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZUMALACARREGUI.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a dull damp October morning of the year 1833--concerning the more\r\nexact date of which it can only be ascertained that it was subsequently\r\nto the twentieth day of the month--a man rather above the middle height,\r\nwrapped in a military cloak of dark grey cloth, and wearing an oilskin\r\nschako upon his head, was seen proceeding through the streets of\r\nPampeluna in the direction of the gate known as the Puerta del Carmen.\r\nAlthough the cloak and schako, which were all that could at first be\r\ndistinguished of his dress, indicated their wearer to be an officer, it\r\nwas observed, that on passing the guard-house at the gate, he took some\r\npains to conceal his face, as though fearful of being recognised. Once\r\noutside the walls, he crossed the river Arga by the Puente Nuevo, and\r\ncontinued his progress along the Irurzun road. He had arrived at about\r\ncannon-shot distance from the fortress of Pampeluna, when a man, leading\r\na small horse by the bridle, suddenly emerged from a place of\r\nconcealment by the roadside. The officer hastily fastened on a spur\r\nwhich he had brought with him, put foot in stirrup, and mounted. For a\r\nfew moments he remained motionless, gazing at Pampeluna, as though\r\nbidding a silent adieu to the friends he left behind him; then striking\r\nhis single spur into his horse's flank, he rapidly disappeared. Two\r\nhours later he entered at full trot the village of Huarte Araquil, five\r\nleagues from Pampeluna. The officer alighted at the house of a friend,\r\nwhere there presently came to meet him a respectable inhabitant of\r\nPampeluna, by name Don Luis Mongelos, and the vicar or parish priest of\r\nHuarte, Don Pedro Miguel Iraneta. The latter, as well by his sacred\r\ncharacter as by reason of the services that, at a former period, he had\r\nrendered to the cause of the Spanish monarchy, enjoyed some influence in\r\nhis district.\r\n\r\nThe conference that Mongelos and Iraneta held with the unknown officer\r\nlasted till a late hour of the night, when they separated to take a few\r\nhours' repose. At early dawn they reassembled, and set out for the\r\nvalley of Berrueza, where they were told that they would find the chief\r\nof the Navarrese Carlists, Don Francisco Iturralde, whom they were\r\ndesirous of seeing. They were fortunate enough to meet with him that\r\nsame day at the village of Piedramillera.\r\n\r\nIn those early days of the Royalist insurrection, and in the state of\r\nanxiety and fermentation in which men's minds then were, the appearance\r\nin the Carlist camp of an officer of rank could not do less than excite,\r\nin the highest degree, the curiosity and interest of the inhabitants,\r\nespecially of those who had taken up arms for Don Carlos. Accordingly,\r\nwhilst the three strangers were with Iturralde, there was rapidly formed\r\nat the door of the latter's quarters a large group, composed of\r\nvolunteers and peasants, and even of women and children. All were eager\r\nto know who the person in the colonel's uniform might be; but\r\nnevertheless, when he at last came out, and the crowd pressed forward to\r\nexamine him, not one of the numerous assemblage could tell his name.\r\nThe disappointed gazers were dispersing, when a party of officers\r\ncame up; and no sooner did these behold the stranger, than they\r\nexclaimed simultaneously, and in a tone of mingled surprise and\r\nenthusiasm--\"ZUMALACARREGUI!\"\r\n\r\nRarely has the axiom, that circumstances and opportunity make the man,\r\nbeen more fully exemplified than in the person of the chief whose name\r\nwe have just written. For forty-five years he lived unknown and\r\nunnoticed beyond a very limited circle, remarked only by his own\r\ncomrades, and by the generals under whom he served, as a good drill and\r\nan efficient regimental officer. After twenty-five years' service, he\r\noccupied the undistinguished post of colonel of a Spanish line regiment.\r\nThe probabilities were, that he would end his life with the embroidered\r\ncuff of a brigadier-general, and be forgotten as soon as the earth had\r\nclosed over him. One man died, leaving a disputed crown; and spurred on,\r\nas some say, by injustice done to him, as others maintain, by an\r\nenthusiastic devotion to a principle, Zumalacarregui, in the twenty\r\nmonths of life that were still accorded to him, raised and organized, by\r\nhis own unaided energies, a numerous and efficient army,\r\noutmanoeuvred the practised leaders, and defeated the veteran troops\r\nthat were sent against him, and made himself a name that has been\r\nrepeated with respect and admiration by some of the highest military\r\nauthorities in Europe.\r\n\r\nDon Tomas Zumalacarregui, a native of Guipuzcoa, was twenty years of age\r\nwhen he first saw fire at Saragossa in 1808. When the French raised the\r\nsiege, he returned home, and remained there till Guipuzcoa, following\r\nthe example of the other Spanish provinces, declared against the\r\nusurpation of Napoleon. He then immediately joined Jauregui, better\r\nknown as El Pastor or the Shepherd, on account of his having, like\r\nanother Viriatus--but without becoming a bandit--exchanged the crook for\r\nthe sabre. In spite of the youth of his new follower, El Pastor found\r\nhim of great assistance; and it is even said that Zumalacarregui,\r\nashamed of having for leader a man who could not write, undertook to\r\nteach him, and succeeded in so doing. The war of independence at an\r\nend, Areizaga, captain-general of the Basque provinces, appointed\r\nZumalacarregui his aide-de-camp; and finally, by his interest and\r\nrecommendation, procured him a captain's commission in the line. In this\r\nnew position the young officer made himself remarked for two things--an\r\ninflexible firmness of character, and an enthusiastic love of his\r\nprofession. All his leisure was passed in the study of tactics, and he\r\nrarely opened a book that treated of any other subject.\r\n\r\nIn 1822, under the constitutional _regime_, Zumalacarregui, being of\r\nknown Royalist opinions, was deprived of his company. He joined Quesada,\r\nwho was at the head of the _realistas_ in Navarre, and from him received\r\ncommand of a battalion, which he kept till, at the end of the war, it\r\nwas disbanded in common with all the Navarrese corps. Whilst holding\r\nthis command, his skill and merit, and a certain air of superiority,\r\nwhich was natural to him, excited the envy and dislike of some of his\r\nbrother officers; but to the intrigues and artifices employed to\r\ninjure him, he only opposed a redoubled zeal in the execution of\r\nhis duty. Subsequently he commanded a regiment with the rank of\r\nlieutenant-colonel, and was at last made full colonel of the 3d light\r\ninfantry. The excellent state into which he brought this corps, caused\r\nit to be sent from Valencia to Madrid, to form part of the military\r\npageant by which Queen Christina's first arrival at the capital of Spain\r\nwas celebrated. This piece of duty, it was expected, would have procured\r\nZumalacarregui his brigadier's rank; but the only thing he got by it was\r\na fall from his horse, from the effects of which he afterwards suffered.\r\n\r\nZumalacarregui's last command in the service of Ferdinand was that of\r\nthe 14th of the line. A curious narrative of the circumstances that\r\noccurred whilst he had this regiment, is to be found in a letter from\r\nthe Carlist general, Don Carlos Vargas, who was at that time\r\naide-de-camp to Eguia, captain-general of Galicia, in which province the\r\n14th was quartered.\r\n\r\n\"From time immemorial,\" says Vargas, \"there had existed in the district\r\nof the Ferrol a society of robbers, regularly sworn in and organized,\r\nhaving branches all over the country, and so well directed in their\r\noperations, that it was found impossible to make an end of them, or to\r\ndiscover who they were. When any one of the associates was seen to\r\nfalter, or was suspected of an intention to betray his companions, he\r\nwas immediately assassinated, and almost always in some horrible\r\nmanner. Persons of every class and description belonged to this\r\nassociation--even women, old men, and government functionaries of high\r\ngrade. From 1826 to 1832, a merchant of the name of C---- was at the\r\nhead of it--a very wealthy man, with respect to whom no one could\r\nexplain how it was that in so few years he had accumulated such great\r\nriches. The public authorities, whose duty it was to discover and\r\nsuppress so infamous a society, had been drawn into it by bribery or\r\nintimidation, or both; so that, instead of preventing the robberies,\r\nthey protected the robbers, and gave them all the opportunities in their\r\npower. In spite of his known zeal, energy, and activity, General Eguia\r\nhad been unable to destroy, or even discover, this numerous band. He had\r\nbeen deceived by the apparent zeal of the _alcalde mayor_ of the Ferrol,\r\nDon V.G. D----, and of an _escribano_, named R----, a captain of\r\nroyalist volunteers. These two men denounced and prosecuted sundry small\r\noffenders who formed no part of the grand association; and, by the good\r\nunderstanding between them, baffled all the efforts of the\r\ncaptain-general.\"\r\n\r\nEguia, finding that the robberies continued to as great an extent as\r\nbefore, and that the temporary governor of the Ferrol did not aid him\r\nefficaciously in detecting their perpetrators, removed him from his post\r\nand conferred it on Zumalacarregui, with whose character he was well\r\nacquainted. The latter in a very few days obtained a clue to the whole\r\nconfederacy, and arrested C---- and other rich accomplices. Various\r\nanonymous offers of large sums of money were now made to Zumalacarregui,\r\nand repeated threats of assassination held out to him; but he was\r\nneither to be bribed nor frightened, and the wealthy and influential\r\nconfederates set every engine at work to bring about his dismissal and\r\nruin. Being known as a Royalist, the events that occurred at La Granja\r\nin 1832 facilitated the designs of his enemies. At the same time\r\nBrigadier-General Chacon, then commanding the royal corps of marines at\r\nthe Ferrol, and who has since been political chief of Madrid and one of\r\nthe cabinet, was also manoeuvring against Zumalacarregui, whose\r\ncharacter, it appears, awed him considerably. Under a pretext that a\r\nCarlist _pronunciamento_ was contemplated, Chacon shut himself up in the\r\narsenal with his marines, and persisted in remaining there in spite of\r\nthe assurances of safety given to him by the governor. At last, having\r\nhad an interview at Santiago with the Captain-General Eguia, the latter\r\nsucceeded in tranquillizing his fears, and the marines came out of their\r\nstronghold, looking very like a parcel of children whose nurse has\r\nthreatened them with a bugbear. Notwithstanding the absurdity of\r\nChacon's demonstration, it attracted the attention of the Christino\r\nparty, then in power; and as at that period all the officers of rank\r\nknown to entertain Royalist opinions were deprived, one after the other,\r\nof their commands, there was nothing surprising in the same measure\r\nbeing adopted with regard to Zumalacarregui, although nothing could be\r\nalleged against him, whether as a man of honour or in a military or\r\npolitical point of view. As soon as he left the Ferrol, the proceedings\r\nagainst the robbers became paralysed; those of them who had been taken\r\nwere set at liberty, and resumed with impunity their course of crime.\r\n\r\nIn July 1833 Zumalacarregui took up his residence at Pampeluna, where,\r\nthree months later, he learned the death of Ferdinand VII. and the\r\ndeclaration of General Santos Ladron in favour of Don Carlos. He would\r\nprobably have immediately departed to join the insurgents, had not the\r\nauthorities of Pampeluna had their eyes upon him. General Sola, then\r\ngovernor of that fortress, hearing that he had been negotiating the\r\npurchase of a horse, sent for him and enquired if such were really the\r\ncase. Zumalacarregui replied that even if it were so, it need not\r\nsurprise any body, for all his life he had been accustomed to keep a\r\nhorse. \"Nevertheless,\" returned Sola, \"for the present your Senoria must\r\nbe pleased to do without one.\" And this was the motive of the\r\nclandestine manner in which Zumalacarregui left Pampeluna.\r\n\r\nIt has been already shown that although, from earliest manhood,\r\nZumalacarregui employed himself diligently in cultivating those\r\nqualities, and acquiring that knowledge, by the judicious application of\r\nwhich he afterwards gained such celebrity, his really public and\r\nimportant life extended over a period of little more than a year and a\r\nhalf. But within that short space how much was comprised! What hardship\r\nand exertion--what efforts both mental and bodily--what an amount of\r\nactivity, excitement, peril, and success were accumulated in those few\r\nmonths of existence! From the peculiar circumstances under which\r\nZumalacarregui's achievements occurred, an historian was very difficult\r\nto be found for them. Those who surrounded him were generally speaking\r\nmen of action, less skilled in handling the pen than the sabre; and\r\nmoreover, during the six years' struggle, in which most of those who\r\nsurvived its sanguinary contest took part to its close, the succession\r\nof events was so rapid, the changes were so constant, that the incidents\r\nof to-day might well cause those of yesterday to be imperfectly\r\nremembered. Even the newspaper emissaries who hovered about the scene of\r\nthe contest, striving to collect intelligence, were foiled in so doing\r\nby the constant movements of the Carlist general, by the wild country\r\nand inclement season in which he carried on his operations. In the year\r\n1836, a young Englishman, whom a love of adventure and zeal for the\r\ncause had induced to draw his sword in behalf of Charles V., published a\r\nnarrative of twelve months' service with Zumalacarregui. There is much\r\nin his book to amuse and interest, and Captain Henningsen, as we have\r\nreason to know from other sources than the internal evidence of his\r\nwritings, is a gallant and accomplished officer. His descriptions are\r\ngraceful and agreeable, the sketches and anecdotes he gives are the very\r\nromance of civil warfare--not that, as we believe, he either did or had\r\nany occasion to embellish his account of a campaign which abounded in\r\nthe picturesque and the dramatic. He was only with Zumalacarregui,\r\nhowever, during the latter half of his career, when the forces of the\r\nCarlists had already assumed a certain numerical importance, and their\r\nresources were on the increase. Of its earlier portion he could speak\r\nbut from hearsay; and it was during that earlier period that\r\nZumalacarregui had the greatest difficulties to contend\r\nwith--difficulties in overcoming which he displayed extraordinary talent\r\nand perseverance. Besides this, we have always looked upon Captain\r\nHenningsen's book rather as a slight, though interesting and truthful,\r\nnarrative of personal adventure, than as a record of Zumalacarregui's\r\ncareer; nor does he claim for it a higher character than the one we are\r\ndisposed to concede to it. \"I have merely,\" he says, \"drawn a rough\r\nsketch with charcoal on a guard-house wall--neither memoir, travels, nor\r\nhistory--but which may have the merit of being a sketch from the life.\"\r\nThis is a correct definition. But the character and exploits of\r\nZumalacarregui were worthy of a chronicler who should treat the subject\r\nmore seriously--and such a one has lately been found. A personal friend,\r\nwho followed him from the first day that he took up arms for Don Carlos,\r\na native of the province in which the war was chiefly carried on, fully\r\nacquainted with its state and the feelings of its inhabitants, as well\r\nas with the incalculable disadvantages under which Zumalacarregui\r\nlaboured and the few advantages he enjoyed, has undertaken the task. Ten\r\nyears after Zumalacarregui's death, the Carlist general, Don Juan\r\nAntonio Zaratiegui, has written, from the country of his exile, the\r\nmemoirs of his former leader.\r\n\r\nAlthough the arrival of Zumalacarregui was hailed with the most lively\r\njoy by the insurgents, and notwithstanding that he was senior in rank to\r\nany officer then with the Navarrese Carlists, there were still\r\ndifficulties in the way of his taking the command. The whole force in\r\nNavarre consisted but of nine hundred men--peasants for the most part,\r\nmany without arms, others with old and unserviceable ones; yet was the\r\ncolonelcy of this ragged and badly equipped regiment an object of\r\ncompetition. Iturralde, who held it, refused to give it up,\r\nalthough--with the exception of Juan Echevarria, the priest of Los\r\nArcos, who afterwards made his name infamous for his crimes and\r\nexcesses--all the officers and influential persons there assembled were\r\ndesirous he should resign it in favour of Zumalacarregui. Captain\r\nHenningsen relates that Iturralde sent two companies of infantry to\r\narrest his rival, who, \"reversing the game, sternly commanded them to\r\narrest Iturralde, and was obeyed.\" Of this we see no mention in the book\r\nbefore us, where we are told, on the contrary, that Zumalacarregui,\r\nfinding Iturralde obstinate in retaining the command, was mounting his\r\nhorse with the intention of departing and offering his services to the\r\nAlavese Carlists, when he was prevented on so doing by the mass of\r\nofficers and persons of distinction in the camp, who compelled him to\r\nreturn to his quarters, promising that they would find means of\r\narranging matters satisfactorily. The captains formed up their\r\ncompanies, and marched them to the parade-ground. When all were\r\nassembled, Major Juan Sarasa, who was looked upon by the soldiers as\r\nsecond in command, drew his sword, and exclaimed in a loud voice,\r\n\"Volunteers! In the name of King Charles the Fifth, Colonel Don Tomas\r\nZumalacarregui is recognised as Commandant-General of Navarre!\" It is\r\ncertain that as Don Carlos was then far away from Navarre, and ignorant\r\neven of what was going on there, he could not make this nomination; but\r\nneither had he appointed Iturralde nor any of the other chiefs who\r\ncommanded in the various provinces. Under such circumstances this was\r\nperhaps the most proper and solemn way of conferring the command,\r\nespecially when the choice fell upon the officer of the highest rank\r\nthere present. Before sheathing his sword, Sarasa ordered the guard of\r\nhonour at Iturralde's quarters to be relieved, and that Iturralde\r\nhimself should be kept under arrest until further orders from the new\r\nchief. All this having taken place without opposition or disturbance,\r\nZumalacarregui made his appearance upon the parade, passed the troops in\r\nreview, and then causing them to form a circle round him, he addressed\r\nthem at some length.\r\n\r\nFrom the first formation of a Carlist force in Navarre, the men had been\r\nin the habit of receiving two reals, about fivepence sterling, a-day.\r\nThis rate of pay had been established by General Santos Ladron, and\r\ncontinued by Iturralde, with the view of attracting volunteers. The\r\nnecessary funds had hitherto been supplied from certain moneys that had\r\nbeen found at the beginning of the war in the hands of various\r\nsubordinate administrations. These funds, however, were now nearly\r\nexhausted, and Zumalacarregui's first announcement to the soldiery was,\r\nthat he should reduce their pay one-half till times were better.\r\nConsidering the circumstances under which he had assumed the command,\r\nthis was a bold step. Most generals would have sought rather to\r\nconciliate their men by an increase than to risk exciting discontent by\r\na reduction. Nevertheless, owing to Zumalacarregui's tone of mingled\r\nfirmness and conciliation, this alteration was made without exciting a\r\nmurmur.\r\n\r\nReleasing Iturralde from his arrest Zumalacarregui appointed him second\r\nin command, whilst Sarasa cheerfully descended to the third\r\nplace--thereby proving that in what he had done in favour of\r\nZumalacarregui, the good of the cause he had espoused was his only\r\nmotive. The command in chief, however, was merely _ad interim_. On the\r\narrival of Colonel Eraso, who was then detained in France, it was to be\r\ngiven up to him. But when Eraso made his appearance, so convinced was he\r\nof Zumalacarregui's superiority of talent, that he insisted, in spite of\r\nthe latter's urgent entreaties, in taking only the second post.\r\n\r\nUpon assuming the command, Zumalacarregui at once determined on adopting\r\na defensive system of warfare--the only one, indeed, that was\r\npracticable with his wretched resources and handful of men. Just at that\r\ntime General Sarsfield was marching with a strong column to the scene of\r\nthe insurrection; and at his approach the Castilian Carlists, under\r\nMerino and Cuevillas, fled and dispersed to their homes. Sarsfield moved\r\non, and occupied Vittoria with little opposition. Soon afterwards\r\nZumalacarregui, who had betaken himself to the banks of the Ebro in\r\nhopes of seizing some arms and horses, received an urgent summons to\r\nrepair to Bilboa, then held by the Royalists, and which Sarsfield was\r\nadvancing to attack. He hastened to obey the call, but only arrived at\r\nthat extremity of Navarre nearest to Biscay, in time to meet the remnant\r\nof the Biscayan Carlists flying before the triumphant Christinos. The\r\ntroops in the Basque provinces, which, the evening before, had amounted\r\nto five or six thousand men, were now reduced to as many hundreds. Their\r\narms, ammunition, and artillery, the latter consisting of four guns, had\r\nbeen abandoned, and were in the power of the conquerors; and so complete\r\nwas the dissolution of the Carlist forces, that a vast number of persons\r\nwho were compromised by their conduct or opinions, seeing themselves\r\nwithout defence, crossed the frontier into France. Zumalacarregui, with\r\nthree scanty, ill-armed battalions, which he had formed out of the\r\nhandful of Navarrese peasants before alluded to, was now the only hope\r\nof the cause. The war was, to all appearance, at an end; and so it\r\nundoubtedly would have been but for Zumalacarregui's extraordinary\r\nqualities. When he left Pampeluna, the three Basque provinces and the\r\ngreater part of the Rioja, or plains of the Ebro, were held by the\r\nCarlists. Merino had just issued a proclamation announcing himself to be\r\nat the head of twenty thousand Castilian volunteers. In all, there were\r\nnearly forty thousand men under arms for Don Carlos, and ready to\r\nsupport the Navarrese rising. Suddenly this brilliant perspective had\r\ndisappeared like a scene in a play, and the twelve or fifteen hundred\r\nmen, half-naked, without uniform, and badly armed, who were assembled in\r\nthe valley of the Borunda, found themselves alone and unprotected in\r\nfront of a formidable and well-provided foe. All was confusion and\r\npanic, when Zumalacarregui opposed his zeal and energy to the contagion\r\nof alarm that was rapidly spreading amongst his men. His precautions,\r\nhis decided and inflexible character, gave life to a cause apparently at\r\nthe last gasp. Encouraging some, rousing others from the lethargy into\r\nwhich they were sinking, he proceeded resolutely with the organization\r\nof his three battalions, introduced strict discipline and subordination,\r\nand procured five hundred muskets, and a supply of cartridges, from\r\nBiscay and Guipuzcoa. General Villareal, who had saved one battalion\r\nfrom the wreck of the Alavese troops, joined him; and the juntas and\r\ndeputations of the various provinces named Zumalacarregui\r\ncommander-in-chief of all the Carlist forces.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Sarsfield's movements appearing too dilatory to the Christino\r\ngovernment, he was replaced by General Valdes, and appointed Viceroy of\r\nNavarre. The arrival of winter, however, and a heavy fall of snow, in\r\nsome degree paralyzed the operations of the Christinos, whilst this\r\noccasioned incredible sufferings to the Carlists. One battalion of the\r\nlatter, in passing from Navarre to Guipuzcoa, across the mountains of\r\nAralar, lost 460 men out of 620, of which it consisted. Numbed by cold,\r\nand worn out by fatigue, they remained to die upon the road, or dragged\r\nthemselves for shelter to lonely hamlets and isolated farmhouses, where\r\nmany of them were discovered and taken by Christino detachments sent to\r\nhunt them down. \"Truly,\" says Zaratiegui, \"it was a lamentable sight to\r\nbehold these unfortunate men, who were unable to move hand or foot, thus\r\npersecuted. But even in this state of impotence and peril, not one of\r\nthem chose to avail himself of the pardon which the Christino generals\r\nat that time freely offered to those who should renounce Don Carlos.\r\nDoubtless a great proof of how noble and constant was their first\r\nresolution.\"\r\n\r\nIn order not to inconvenience the inhabitants, Zumalacarregui was in the\r\nhabit of distributing his troops over large districts, himself\r\nfrequently remaining with only a handful of men about him. On one of\r\nthese occasions an incident occurred which is related at considerable\r\nlength by General Zaratiegui, who evidently attaches the greatest\r\nimportance to his late chief's most trifling actions, and, in the course\r\nof his book, compares him to or sets him above various renowned heroes\r\nof ancient and modern times. The anecdote, however, is curious, as\r\nshowing the constant state of vigilance and anxiety in which the\r\nCarlists were kept during these early days of their uprising.\r\n\r\n\"Zumalacarregui had taken up his quarters in the hamlet of Zabal, which\r\nconsisted of only four houses; and, as the season was unfavourable for a\r\nbivouac, he had scattered the troops through various small villages in\r\nthe neighbourhood. With himself there remained only a guard of fifteen\r\nor twenty men, and a few aides-de-camp. It was in the middle of\r\nDecember, when the nights are at the longest, and consequently the most\r\nfavourable time of the year for an enemy to accomplish a surprise. The\r\nCarlist general lay awake in his bed, watching for the dawn, which\r\nseemed to him longer than usual in appearing; till at last his own\r\nrestlessness and impatience made him fancy that the Christinos were\r\ncoming to surprise him. A distant noise which he heard, and which\r\nresembled the trot of horses, confirmed the hallucination. He sprang\r\nfrom his bed, and, nearly naked as he was, descended the stairs, opened\r\nthe door of the house, and tried to snatch away the musket of the\r\nsentinel posted there, in order to defend himself against the\r\napproaching enemy. The sentry, at once recognising him, kept him off\r\nwith his hand, and said firmly--'General, leave me my arms; when\r\nneedful, I shall know how to use them.' The man had only joined the\r\nCarlists three days before, and, excepting his musket, bore no mark or\r\nsign of his new profession, not even a cartouch-box; and, to complete\r\nthe singularity of the scene, he was mounting guard bareheaded. The\r\nhorses, of which Zumalacarregui, with extraordinary fineness of ear, had\r\ndetected the approach at a very great distance, soon afterwards made\r\ntheir appearance. They were mounted by the men whose duty it was to go\r\nfrom one village to another during the night, collecting rations. Things\r\nreturned to their previous state of tranquillity, and the sentinel was\r\nrewarded for his steadiness and presence of mind.\r\n\r\n\"This incident,\" concludes Zaratiegui, \"recalls to my recollection an\r\nanecdote told by a Spanish author, of the great Captain Gonzalo de\r\nCordova. When that hero was laying siege to a fortress on the island of\r\nCephalonia, which was defended by the Turks, he was many times seen to\r\nget up in his sleep, and to cry out to his soldiers to come and repel\r\nthe enemy; and it is also said, that owing to these alarms the Spaniards\r\nmore than once escaped a surprise.\"\r\n\r\nWithout reference to a map, it would be difficult for our readers to\r\nappreciate a description of the extraordinary marches and countermarches\r\nby which Zumalacarregui avoided his enemy until such time as he was able\r\nto fight him. Sarsfield had no sooner established himself in his\r\nvice-royalty at Pampeluna, that he collected all the troops he had at\r\nhis disposal, and began running after the Carlist chief. He displayed\r\ngreat activity, made forced and rapid marches, and on arriving one\r\nevening at the town of Puente la Reyna, found himself, by the result of\r\na well-planned movement, within an hour and a half's march of Artajona,\r\nwhere Zumalacarregui had halted. Sarsfield made sure of coming to blows\r\nthe next morning; but he had forgotten to take into consideration the\r\ninsensibility to fatigue, and capacity of exertion, of the Navarrese\r\nmountaineers. In the middle of the night, Zumalacarregui turned out his\r\nmen in dead silence, without sound of drum or trumpet, and began\r\nretracing his steps along the road which he had that day followed. The\r\nnext morning, before Sarsfield arrived at Artajona, Zumalacarregui was\r\nat Dicastillo, a long day's march off, and precisely at the same\r\ndistance from the Christino general at which he had been when the latter\r\ncommenced his pursuit. Sarsfield found matter for reflection in this,\r\nand perceiving, doubtless, that a war in such a country as Navarre, and\r\nagainst such a man as Zumalacarregui, was likely to prove a shoal upon\r\nwhich more than one military reputation would be wrecked, he confided\r\nthe direction of operations to Generals Lorenzo and Oraa, and returned\r\nto Pampeluna, whence he no more issued forth.\r\n\r\nThe first encounter between Zumalacarregui and the Christinos took place\r\non the 29th of December, near the village of Asarta. The Carlist force\r\nconsisted of seven small battalions or corps, together about 2500 men,\r\nknowing, for the most part, little or nothing of a soldier's duty. Many\r\nof the muskets were useless, and the ammunition so scarce, that ten\r\ncartridges formed the allowance with which these troops went, for the\r\nfirst time, under fire. In the combat that ensued, the Christinos\r\nsuffered considerable loss; and although the Carlists, who had most of\r\nthem expended their ammunition, finally retreated in haste and disorder,\r\nthe mere fact of having sustained for some time the assault of an enemy\r\nso far superior to them in discipline and equipments, inspired these raw\r\nrecruits with fresh courage and confidence. The resistance that had been\r\nmade contrasted advantageously with the facility with which, at the\r\nfirst commencement of the war, far larger bodies of the insurgents had\r\nbeen put to flight. Several Christino officers came over to the Carlists\r\nafter this trifling action, of which the moral effect was altogether\r\nhighly favourable to the cause of Don Carlos.\r\n\r\nDividing his forces into three detachments, Zumalacarregui sent two of\r\nthese to draw off the attention of Lorenzo and Oraa, whilst he himself\r\nsuddenly appeared before the royal manufactory of shot and shell at\r\nOrbaiceta, near the French frontier. The garrison, consisting of two\r\nhundred men, capitulated, although it might very well have held out the\r\nplace against an enemy without artillery, until the arrival of\r\nassistance, which would have been certain to come in two or three days.\r\nHere were found two hundred excellent muskets, a brass four-pounder, and\r\nmore than 50,000 cartridges; besides an immense quantity of round-shot\r\nand other projectiles, which at that time were useless to the Carlists,\r\nas they had no artillery.\r\n\r\nWhen, instead of the news which they had been expecting to receive, of\r\nthe extermination of the royalist faction, the Pampelonese learned that\r\nOrbaiceta was captured; and that Lorenzo and Oraa had succeeded in\r\nnothing except in knocking up their horses and fagging their men; they\r\nsent to Valdes, the general-in-chief of the army of the North, who was\r\nthen in Biscay, imploring him to come and make an end of the Carlists.\r\nValdes hastened to Pampeluna, and on arriving there at once made a\r\nsortie with five or six thousand men. Zumalacarregui posted himself in a\r\nnarrow pass, on the road along which the Christinos were advancing, and\r\nawaited their arrival. Having done this, he sent out a number of\r\nofficers and soldiers, who were well acquainted with the country, to\r\nobserve the movements of the Queen's troops, and give notice of their\r\napproach. The evening was drawing in, when a peasant came up in all\r\nhaste, laden with a large stone of a thin flat form, nearly a foot and a\r\nhalf long. On reaching the presence of Zumalacarregui, he laid it down,\r\nand requested the general to read what was written on it. One of the\r\nscouts having no writing materials, and thinking the peasant incapable\r\nof bearing a verbal message correctly, had taken this novel means of\r\nconveying intelligence to his chief. In danger of being outflanked,\r\nZumalacarregui was compelled to abandon his advantageous position. The\r\nfollowing day a skirmish took place without result; and at last Valdes,\r\nfinding that he only fatigued his men uselessly, by pursuing an\r\nadversary whom it was impossible to overtake, remained for some days\r\ninactive.\r\n\r\nA week had elapsed, which Zumalacarregui had passed at Navascues, busied\r\nin organizing his troops, and making various important administrative\r\narrangements, when the approach of Oraa compelled him to a change of\r\nplace. On the evening of the 17th of February, the Christino general\r\nhaving put up his infantry in the hamlets of Zubiri and Urdaniz, and the\r\ndetachments of cavalry that accompanied him, at a large _venta_ or inn\r\nbetween those two places, Zumalacarregui resolved upon a nocturnal\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nIt was at midnight that, by the light of a dozen trees, which had been\r\nset on fire, and served for gigantic torches, the Carlist leader formed\r\nup five companies in a thick wood, and after communicating to them his\r\nproject, directed them how to proceed. The post of honour was assigned\r\nto a student of the name of Amezqueta, who, by his feats of courage,\r\nsubsequently rose from the rank of a simple volunteer to that of\r\ncolonel, and died in consequence of wounds received in action. One\r\ncompany was sent to open a fire upon Zubiri, in which Oraa himself was\r\nlodged; another was to attack the venta, where the cavalry were\r\nquartered; and the remaining three were to penetrate into the streets\r\nand houses of Urdaniz, which were occupied by five or six hundred\r\nChristinos.\r\n\r\nThe night had at first been bright and moonlit, but was now cloudy and\r\ndark; and Zumalacarregui, in order to avoid the terrible consequences\r\nthat might ensue if his soldiers mistook one another for the enemy,\r\nordered them to put on their shirts over their other garments. It\r\nhappened to be Carnival time, and the men, not at once understanding the\r\nreason of this order, took it as a sort of masquerade proceeding, and\r\nmade themselves exceedingly merry about it. The result showed how\r\nnecessary a precaution it was. After various difficulties, occasioned by\r\nthe bad roads and extreme darkness, the three detachments reached their\r\nrespective destinations at about half-past two in the morning, and the\r\nfire against Zubiri and Urdaniz commenced almost at the same moment. In\r\nthe first-named place, the Christinos kept themselves shut up in the\r\nhouses, from the windows of which they returned the fire, guided in\r\ntheir aim by the flashes of their assailants' muskets. The sole object\r\nof the Carlists was, to keep them employed, in order that they might not\r\ninterfere with what was going on at the two other points of attack. The\r\ncavalry at the venta having neglected all precautions, and possessing no\r\neffective means of defence, soon fell into the power of the Carlists;\r\nbut at Urdaniz, which was held by infantry, and against which the\r\nexpedition was more particularly directed, a hard-contested fight took\r\nplace. The first picket which the Carlists encountered was cut to pieces\r\nto a man; the fire of a second outpost spread the alarm; but,\r\nnevertheless, the attacking party penetrated into the ground-floor of\r\nmost of the houses, and a desperate contest ensued upon the stairs. The\r\nhorses in the stables were either carried off or killed; and nothing\r\nwould have been easier than to have set fire to the houses, and so\r\nensured the destruction of all the Christinos. From this latter\r\nsanguinary measure, which a Cabrera or a Valmaseda would probably not\r\nhave hesitated to adopt, Zumalacarregui abstained. \"It did not agree,\"\r\nsays his biographer, \"with the principles of equity and justice which he\r\nobserved relatively to the villages and their inhabitants;\" from which\r\nwe are left to infer, that the burning alive of five hundred Christino\r\nsoldiers, could it have been done without injuring houses or peasants,\r\nwould have been rather an acceptable holocaust to the Carlist chief.\r\n\r\nWhen all the advantages calculated upon from this expedition had been\r\nobtained, the retreat was sounded, and, forming up his men with the\r\ngreatest celerity, Zumalacarregui marched rapidly away, carrying off the\r\narms, horses, and prisoners, that had been taken. With all his haste,\r\nhowever, early upon the following day Lorenzo and Oraa were close upon\r\nhis heels; but the wary Carlist had omitted no precaution, and, in\r\nanticipation of a hot pursuit, had ordered four battalions to meet him\r\nat the neighbouring pass of Lizarraga, where he accordingly found them\r\nwaiting his arrival, and immediately prepared to give the Christinos a\r\nwarm reception. The latter, on arriving in front of the position,\r\nprobably considered it too formidable a one to attack; for they\r\nforthwith retreated, leaving Zumalacarregui in the peaceable enjoyment\r\nof a triumph which greatly increased his reputation and the confidence\r\nof his followers.\r\n\r\nQuesada, who succeeded Valdes in the command of the Queen's army, was\r\nthe first to introduce the horrible system of reprisals, or, it should\r\nrather be said, to occasion it, by cruelty towards his prisoners.\r\nValdes, if he had done little towards terminating the war, had at least\r\nnot envenomed it, or rendered its character more ferocious than he had\r\nfound it. Although it was impossible to suspect him of any leaning\r\ntowards his opponents, he always showed great moderation and humanity,\r\nand caused the wounded Carlists who fell into his hands to be treated\r\nwith as much care as if they had been his own men. Quesada, on the\r\ncontrary, irritated at the failure of certain attempts he had made to\r\nseduce Zumalacarregui, and subsequently other Carlist leaders, from\r\ntheir allegiance to him they called their King, and acting under the\r\ninfluence of a disposition which many events in his life sufficiently\r\nproved to be cruel and bloodthirsty, had scarcely assumed the command\r\nwhen he gave the signal for reprisals, by shooting at Pampeluna the\r\nCarlist officer, Don Juan Hugalde, although Zumalacarregui had offered\r\nto give a Christino officer and two sergeants in exchange for him. This\r\nwas followed by numerous similar acts of cruelty, which at last were\r\ncause that Villareal, by order of Zumalacarregui, shot more than a\r\nhundred prisoners who had been taken a short time previously at a\r\nvillage near Vittoria. Fortunately, at that particular period, the\r\nprisoners on neither side were very numerous. In an action near Segura,\r\nLeopold O'Donnell, cousin of the present governor of the Havannah, and\r\nson of the well-known Count of Abisbal, fell into the hands of the\r\nCarlists, with four other officers and a number of rank and file. The\r\nfive officers were shot, in retaliation for some recent execution of\r\nCarlist prisoners; but Zumalacarregui, willing to make another effort\r\nfor the establishment of a more humane system, spared the lives of the\r\nmen, and ordered that seven amongst them who were wounded should be\r\ntaken care of, and, when cured, sent back to Pampeluna. In return for\r\nthis act of mercy, Quesada shot every prisoner he had, wounded or not.\r\nAmongst others, a Captain Bayona, who had received two desperate wounds,\r\nand was at the point of death, was dragged from his bed and shot on the\r\npublic square of the village of Lacunza. Zumalacarregui might have\r\nrepaid this atrocity by the slaughter of the Christino prisoners who\r\nwere still in his power, but having promised them their lives, he would\r\nnot recall his word.\r\n\r\nA few days after this, four officers were made prisoners by Iturralde,\r\nwho entered the town of Los Arcos with a battalion, and captured them\r\nbefore they had time to retreat to the fort. Quesada feeling very sure\r\nof the fate reserved for them, hit upon a stratagem by which he hoped to\r\nsave their lives. He caused to be arrested at Pampeluna the parents of\r\nseveral Carlist officers of rank, shut them up in the citadel, and sent\r\nconfessors to them. They were to be shot, he said, the very moment he\r\nshould learn the death of the officers whom Iturralde had taken. The\r\nunfortunate captives begged permission to write to their sons and\r\nrelatives in the Carlist army, and this request, which was what Quesada\r\nhad reckoned upon, was granted. Those to whom the letters were sent\r\npresented themselves before Zumalacarregui in the most profound\r\naffliction, and implored him to show mercy to the four men on whose\r\nlives depended the existence of persons so dear to them. But\r\nZumalacarregui, who saw at once that such a precedent would be in the\r\nhighest degree dangerous, inasmuch as most of the Carlists had friends\r\nand near relatives in the Christino country, was firm in his refusal.\r\nThe officers were shot, but Quesada did not dare to incur the odium\r\nwhich reprisals of the nature he had threatened would have heaped upon\r\nhis head. It was remarked also that he was greatly discouraged by the\r\nproof he on this occasion obtained of his opponent's firmness and\r\nenergy, and of the unlimited authority and influence he enjoyed over\r\nthose under his command. The shooting of prisoners of war continued\r\nwithout intermission till the Eliot convention took place.\r\n\r\nThe month of April had arrived without any one of the Carlist leaders\r\nhaving received a communication, either verbal or written, from the\r\nprince for whom they had now been six months under arms. At last, on the\r\n11th of April, Zumalacarregui, who was then in the valley of the\r\nBerrueza, received the much wished-for letter from the hands of a native\r\nof Burgos, who, in the disguise of a muleteer, managed to reach his\r\ncamp. In this letter, which was dated the 18th of March 1834, Don Carlos\r\ndeclared that his \"royal heart and soul were sweetly affected by the\r\ncontemplation of the heroical efforts that were being made in the cause\r\nof religion and his legitimate rights.\" He promised to maintain the\r\n_fueros_ of the provinces, approved all that had been done, and gave\r\nvarious and extensive powers to Zumalacarregui, whom he styled Mariscal\r\nde Campo of the royal armies. The enthusiasm which this document\r\noccasioned amongst the troops and the people of the provinces was so\r\ngreat, that Zumalacarregui declared it to be worth a reinforcement of\r\ntwenty thousand men. It is probable also, although no express mention is\r\nmade of it, that about or rather before this time, some small supplies\r\nof money had been received from the friends of Don Carlos in Spain, or\r\nother countries; for we find the junta of Navarre busied in providing\r\nnew clothing for a part of the troops. The taxes levied in the districts\r\nin which the Carlists operated, and those duties on goods passing the\r\nfrontier which they were able to collect, must at that period have been\r\nof very trifling amount, and insufficient to meet the expenses even of\r\nZumalacarregui's small army.\r\n\r\nDuring three months that Quesada had held the command, which he assumed\r\nwith a force that he himself admitted to consist of 23,000 infantry, and\r\n1400 horse, he had accomplished literally nothing. On the other hand,\r\nthe Carlists had had several partial successes against himself and his\r\nsubordinates; he had lost a vast number of men; and finally, at the\r\naction of Gulinas, near Pampeluna, Linares, one of his generals was so\r\nill-treated by Zumalacarregui, that all the carts and vehicles in\r\nPampeluna, including the bishop's carriage, were insufficient to carry\r\nthe wounded into the town. After this last disaster, the Spanish\r\ngovernment resolved to give Quesada a successor; and General Rodil, who\r\nhad just returned from his expedition into Portugal, upon which he had\r\ngone in the vain hope of seizing the person of Don Carlos, was ordered\r\nto repair to the northern provinces with the troops under his command.\r\nAfter being detained some days at Madrid by Queen Christina, who had a\r\nfancy to review the division, Rodil, whose activity was his best\r\nquality, continued his march, and soon reached the Ebro with ten\r\nthousand infantry, a proportionate number of cavalry, and a prodigious\r\ntrain of baggage and artillery. It is said that more than a thousand\r\ncarts, and a still greater number of baggage animals, followed his army.\r\nGenerals Cordova, Figueras, Carandolet and others of note, formed part\r\nof his brilliant staff, and at Logrono he was joined by Lorenzo and\r\nOraa with their divisions. The imposing force thus got together was\r\nsufficient, it might well have been thought, to crush, ten times over,\r\nthe few companies of raw guerillas under Zumalacarregui's command.\r\n\r\nThe clash of arms and note of war-like preparation that now resounded\r\nalong the right bank of the Ebro, crossed the stream, and penetrated\r\ninto the valleys of Navarre. The eyes of the Carlists, both soldiers and\r\ncivilians, were fixed upon their chief, who, far from trying to conceal\r\nthe approaching danger, rather exaggerated its magnitude. There was\r\nnothing he dreaded more than that his followers should think he was\r\ntrying to deceive them. That, he knew, would destroy their confidence in\r\nhim. He issued a proclamation to the troops, in which, after talking of\r\nthe formidable preparations of the enemy, he put a question to them.\r\n\"Volunteers!\" he said, \"shall you quail at the sight of this numerous\r\narray?\" When the officer who read the proclamation in front of the\r\nassembled Navarrese battalions came to this question, a unanimous \"No!\"\r\nunpremeditated and heartfelt, burst from the lips of every man present.\r\nUpon learning this indication of the temper of the troops,\r\nZumalacarregui resolved upon a movement of unparalleled audacity. He had\r\ninformation that on the following day Lorenzo and Oraa were to leave\r\nLogrono for Pampeluna, followed twenty-four hours later by Rodil, with\r\nthe troops he had brought from Portugal. Zumalacarregui determined to\r\nadvance rapidly from the mountains amongst which he then found himself,\r\nand to fall upon Rodil's left flank, trusting that troops unaccustomed\r\nto that description of warfare would resist but feebly a sudden and\r\nunexpected attack. However this daring plan might have succeeded, it\r\nwould certainly have been attempted, had not a totally unlooked-for,\r\nand, to the Carlists, a most important event occurred to prevent it.\r\n\r\nAt midnight, on the 11th of July, the Carlist troops were about to\r\ncommence their march, when Legarra, the abbot of Lecumberri, suddenly\r\nappeared before Zumalacarregui, and placed in his hands a sealed letter\r\nof very small dimensions. The handwriting was unknown to the general,\r\nand the sole address consisting of the two words, \"_For\r\nZumalacarregui,_\" he asked Legarra, previously to opening the letter,\r\nwhence and from whom it came. The sole information the abbot could give\r\nwas that he had received it from the junta of Navarre, and had been\r\ndesired to use all haste in its delivery. The general then opened and\r\nread the missive; and as he did so, all those who were present were able\r\nto note upon his countenance the great satisfaction with which the few\r\nwords it contained inspired him. He immediately countermanded the march,\r\nordered the horses to be unsaddled, and the troops to take up their\r\nquarters for the night.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the note which caused all these changes, were as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n     \"Zumalacarregui: I am very near Spain, and to-morrow I trust by\r\n     God's help to reach Urdax. Take the necessary measures, and\r\n     communicate this to no one.\r\n\r\n\"CARLOS.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of this last injunction, Zumalacarregui, calculating that Don\r\nCarlos must by this time be on Spanish ground, could not refuse himself\r\nthe pleasure of telling such good news to his personal friends. They\r\nrepeated to others, and it soon became known throughout the camp, that\r\nthe King was coming. At daybreak the next morning, Zumalacarregui set\r\nout, and at eleven at night reached the frontier town of Elizondo, where\r\nhe found Don Carlos, who, tired with his journey, had already gone to\r\nbed, but, nevertheless, immediately received his faithful adherent. On\r\nthe following day he had several conferences with Zumalacarregui, on\r\nwhom he conferred the rank of Lieutenant-general and Chief of his Staff.\r\nThe same afternoon the bells were set ringing, and a _Te Deum_ was sung\r\nfor the happy arrival of the royal fugitive. It was attended by Don\r\nCarlos, Zumalacarregui, the Baron de los Valles, and various other\r\nnotabilities.\r\n\r\nHis partizans as yet possessing no fortified town or stronghold in which\r\nhe could remain with security, Don Carlos was compelled, as soon as he\r\narrived in Spain, to seek safety in constant change of place.\r\nZumalacarregui, on the other hand, with Valdes and his formidable army\r\nmenacing him on all sides, could spare but little time to play the\r\ncourtier. After conducting Don Carlos through the valleys of Araquil,\r\nthe Borunda, and the two Amezcoas, in all of which that prince was\r\nreceived, we are informed, with the most lively demonstrations of joy,\r\nhe confided him to the care of General Eraso, who marched him off to the\r\nBasque provinces, to show him to the people, and keep him out of harm's\r\nway. The Christino government and generals had at first affected to\r\ndisbelieve the arrival of Don Carlos, and had spread reports that a\r\nperson who resembled him had been chosen by the Carlist leaders to\r\npersonate the prince, and deceive the people. Soon, however, the fact\r\nwas placed beyond a doubt; and Rodil, sending several of his generals to\r\nfind Zumalacarregui, set out with twelve thousand men in pursuit of Don\r\nCarlos, who was then in Biscay with a retinue of only twelve persons.\r\nThe small number of the Prince's attendants proved his best safeguard.\r\nThe Christinos advanced, displaying a vast front, and confident of\r\ncatching him; but favoured by the intricacies of the mountains, the\r\nextensive forests and deep barrancas of Biscay, having, moreover, the\r\npeasantry in his favour, and persons perfectly acquainted with the\r\ncountry for guides, Don Carlos had little difficulty in eluding pursuit.\r\nAll Rodil's front and flank marches and countermarches served but to\r\nsend a vast number of his men into hospital, and to immortalize his name\r\nin that province by the devastations and incendiarism that the soldiery\r\ncommitted.\r\n\r\nWhilst this was going on, Zumalacarregui was buzzing like an enraged\r\nhornet round the divisions of Oraa, Carandolet, Lorenzo, and other\r\ngenerals, cutting off outposts, surprising detachments, and doing them a\r\nvast deal of mischief, with little or no loss to his own troops. General\r\nCarandolet was particularly unfortunate; twice did Zumalacarregui\r\nsurprise him; first in the pass of San Fausto, where his column was\r\nnearly destroyed; and a second time in the town of Viana, on the Ebro.\r\nOn this last occasion the affair was decided by the Carlist cavalry,\r\nwhich for the first time had an opportunity of distinguishing itself. It\r\nconsisted of 250 ill-equipped and undrilled lancers, at the head of\r\nwhich Zumalacarregui put himself, and charging the Christino horsemen,\r\nwho were nearly twice as numerous, broke them and put them to flight.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary, and would be monotonous, to follow Zumalacarregui,\r\nstep by step, through the summer campaign of 1834, which was a most\r\nimportant one for the cause he defended. With the increase of numerical\r\nforce, which his successes, and the arrival of Don Carlos, brought to\r\nhis standard, the lack of arms, money, and ammunition began to make\r\nthemselves nearly as sensibly felt as at the commencement of the war.\r\nWhen Don Carlos arrived in Spain and formed a ministry, Zumalacarregui\r\nhoped and expected that the men composing the latter would possess some\r\ninfluence abroad, and would be able to procure assistance of various\r\nkinds. In this, however, he found himself mistaken; and to make matters\r\nworse, he appears to have been already thwarted, in his plans and\r\narrangements, by the persons about Don Carlos. The division of counsels,\r\nwhich subsequently ruined the Carlist cause, was already beginning to be\r\nfelt.\r\n\r\nAt the arrival of Don Carlos, the army was composed entirely of\r\nvolunteers, but a levy was now ordered of all the men capable of bearing\r\narms. Zumalacarregui opposed this strenuously, but was finally compelled\r\nto give way, and four new battalions were formed, although there was\r\nscarcely a musket in store to give to them. By this ill-advised measure,\r\nthe agricultural interests of the country were materially compromised,\r\nand new and heavy charges imposed upon the military chest, for the\r\nmaintenance of troops which, being unarmed, were of course useless. This\r\nwas a source of great vexation to Zumalacarregui, who certainly had\r\nenough to do to make head against the enemy opposed to him, without\r\nbeing compelled at the same time to procure supplies, arms, and\r\nammunition for his troops, and to attend, in great measure, to the\r\nadministrative arrangements, which usually fall to the charge of the\r\ncivil authorities. At the commencement of the war, fifty thousand\r\ncartridges were all he possessed, and those were soon consumed, as well\r\nas some that were taken from the Christinos. It was very difficult and\r\ncostly to get powder from France, which could only be introduced in\r\nquantities of three or four pounds, or little more. Unable to support\r\nthe delay and expense of this, Zumalacarregui established manufactories\r\nin secluded corners of Navarre and the Basque provinces; and then, with\r\ninfinite risk, caused saltpetre to be brought from the very heart of\r\nArragon, and subsequently from France. The powder that was at first\r\nproduced was very weak and bad, and the manufacturers worked day and\r\nnight till they found means of improving it. The rules introduced into\r\nthe battalions, in order to economize this precious commodity, were\r\nsingular enough. The soldiers were forbidden to load their muskets till\r\nthe very moment of commencing an action; and then were only to fire when\r\nthe enemy was very near and fully exposed. Even the guards and pickets,\r\nin view of the Christinos, had but a single musket loaded, which the\r\nsentinels passed from one to another when relieved. Zumalacarregui\r\nhimself made frequent inspections of the men's ammunition, and would\r\noften stop soldiers whom he met in the street or on the road, to\r\nascertain that they had not lost or wasted their cartridges.\r\n\r\nThe security of the Carlist army did not so much depend on the vigilance\r\nof outposts and advanced guards, as on the system of transmitting\r\ninformation that was established amongst the village alcaldes, and on\r\nthe zeal and fidelity of the _confidentes_ or spies. Without reckoning\r\nthose persons who acted in the latter capacity in the vicinity of their\r\nown homes, Zumalacarregui always had about him eighteen or twenty\r\nregularly paid spies; and to these, even in the moments of his greatest\r\npoverty and difficulty, he showed himself liberal to prodigality.\r\nNotwithstanding that it was out of his power to recompense sufficiently\r\nthe risks they ran, and the important services they rendered, these men\r\nperformed their arduous duties with admirable fidelity. Zaratiegui\r\nrelates an anecdote of one of them who, having been guilty of some\r\nneglect, received, by order of Zumalacarregui, two hundred blows with a\r\nstick, and was then turned out of the camp. The evening of the same day\r\non which this took place, when the general called as usual for his\r\n_confidentes_, the man who had been beaten made his appearance with the\r\nothers. Although Zumalacarregui was acquainted with the characteristic\r\nfidelity of these men, he could not help being struck with this instance\r\nof it. His natural generosity of character prevented him from hesitating\r\na moment in restoring his confidence to the offender. \"Rest yourself\r\nto-night,\" he said to him; \"to-morrow you will have to go upon a\r\nservice of the greatest importance, and which you alone are able to\r\nperform.\" And the man left the room, perfectly consoled for the pain and\r\nhumiliation of his beating, by these few kind words, addressed to him in\r\npresence of his comrades.\r\n\r\nAnother anecdote will illustrate the affection of the Carlist soldiers\r\nfor their leader, and their sympathy with his difficulties. The troops\r\nall wore _alpargatas_--a species of sandal, of which the sole is of\r\nplaited hemp. These are admirably adapted for long marches in dry\r\nweather, but the wet destroys them, and they go to pieces directly. Of\r\nthese sandals, as of every other description of equipment, there was\r\nsometimes great difficulty in obtaining a sufficient supply. One day\r\nthat it rained heavily, Zumalacarregui was going to pass, with several\r\nbattalions, from the Ulzama to the valley of Ollo. The soil was clay,\r\nand there was sure to be a great destruction of the hempen shoes.\r\nZumalacarregui, who at that time had no others wherewith to replace\r\nthem, rode along the line of march, and spoke to man here and there. \"A\r\npeseta,\" said he, (about tenpence sterling,) \"for every man who presents\r\nhimself this evening with a sound pair of alpargatas.\" The word was\r\npassed from mouth to mouth; the soldiers understood the difficulty in\r\nwhich their general was, took off their shoes, and performed a long and\r\ntoilsome march barefoot. The next day, when Zumalacarregui ordered the\r\npromised recompense to be distributed, the commandants of battalions\r\nsaid that it was unnecessary, for that none of the men claimed it.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, Zumalacarregui made an expedition beyond the Ebro, with\r\nthe view of carrying off a quantity of woollen cloth from the\r\nmanufactories at Escaray. He was unsuccessful in the immediate object of\r\nthe expedition; but, at a short distance from Logrono, he fell in with a\r\nconvoy, escorted by two companies of infantry and three strong squadrons\r\nof dragoons. The latter charged the Carlist cavalry, which was of much\r\ninferior force, and threw it into complete disorder. Zumalacarregui, who\r\nwas a short way behind, saw the disgraceful flight of his lancers, set\r\nspurs to his horse, came up with the fugitives, and rallied them. As\r\nsoon as he had got together fifty men, he charged the Christinos,\r\nregardless of the great disparity of force. The charge took place on the\r\nhigh-road, where there was no room to form front by troops or squadrons.\r\nSix or eight Christino dragoons of gigantic stature, _tiradores_ or\r\npioneers as they were called, occupied the whole width of the road,\r\nwhilst the convoy made all haste to gain the town. Zumalacarregui, with\r\nsix of his men, attacked them, and scarcely had their lances crossed the\r\nChristino sabres, when the dragoons were all killed or wounded. The\r\nCarlists charged onwards; the whole of the Christino cavalry was cut to\r\npieces or forced to run, and the convoy remained in the hands of the\r\nconquerors. It consisted of two thousand muskets, and came very\r\nopportunely to arm the four new battalions, which had been more than\r\nthree months in idleness, waiting for weapons.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th and 28th of October, just one year after Zumalacarregui had\r\ntaken command of the Carlist army, occurred the two famous actions in\r\nthe plains of Vittoria, when General O'Doyle and two thousand Christinos\r\nfell into the hands of the victors, and nearly as many more were left\r\ndead upon the field. O'Doyle and some of the officers taken were shot;\r\nbut the lives of the men were spared, and soon afterwards, at their own\r\nrequest, their arms were restored to them, and they were incorporated in\r\nthe Carlist battalions. This, and other disasters, which about this time\r\nbefell Rodil's army, occasioned his recall by the Queen's government,\r\nand the celebrated Mina was appointed in his stead.\r\n\r\nThe increase of Zumalacarregui's forces, and the advantages he had\r\ngained, inspired him with the idea of capturing some of the Christino\r\nforts in Navarre and the Basque provinces; the said forts being\r\nexceedingly prejudicial to his operations. The great obstacle to his\r\nwishes was, the weakness of his artillery. This consisted only of three\r\nsmall field-pieces, such as are carried on the backs of mules, and could\r\nbe of little service in attacking fortifications. Of shot and shell he\r\nhad a large supply, which had been taken at the manufactory of\r\nOrbaiceta. For seven or eight months these stores had been lying there\r\nneglected, none of the Queen's generals having had the foresight to\r\nremove them to a place of safety. Zumalacarregui now caused them to be\r\ntaken away, and concealed in the most intricate recesses of the\r\nmountains. But these projectiles were of little use without guns; and to\r\nprocure the latter the ingenuity of the Carlists was taxed to the very\r\nutmost. Zumalacarregui remembered that, upon a sandy spot on the\r\nBiscayan coast, an old iron twelve-pounder was lying neglected and\r\nforgotten. This he ordered to be brought to Navarre. A rude carriage was\r\nconstructed, on which it was mounted, and it was then dragged by six\r\npair of oxen over mountains, and through ravines, to the Sierra of\r\nUrbasa, where it was buried. Soldiers are very ingenious in inventing\r\nappropriate names; and as soon as the Carlist volunteers saw this\r\nunwieldy old-fashioned piece of ordnance, full of moss and sand, and\r\ncovered with rust, they christened it the Abuelo, or the Grandfather, by\r\nwhich appellation it was ever afterwards known. The only artillery\r\nofficer at that time with Zumalacarregui was Don Tomas Reina, who now,\r\nin conjunction with one Balda, a professor of chemistry, began to devise\r\nmeans for founding some guns. In the villages and hamlets within a\r\ncertain circumference, a requisition was made for all articles composed\r\nof copper and brass, such as brasiers, stew-pans, chocolate pots,\r\nwarming-pans, &c.; but as it was found impossible to get sufficient of\r\nthese, the three field-pieces were added, and the whole melted together.\r\nIn the midst of a forest this strange foundery was established, and\r\nafter numerous failures, occasioned by want of experience and of the\r\nproper tools, Reina succeeded in making a couple of howitzers, which,\r\nalthough of uncouth appearance, it was thought might answer the purpose\r\nfor which they were intended.\r\n\r\nNever were the Christinos more confident of a speedy termination to the\r\nwar than when Mina took the command. The well-earned reputation of that\r\nchief, his peculiar aptitude for mountain warfare, and intimate\r\nacquaintance with the country of Navarre, which had been the scene of\r\nhis triumphs during the war against Napoleon, certainly pointed him out\r\nas the most fitting man to oppose to Zumalacarregui. Forgetting that\r\nsimilar hopes had been founded on the skill of Quesada and Rodil, and on\r\nthe imposing forces they commanded, hopes which had been so signally\r\nfrustrated, the Queen's partizans now set up a premature song of\r\ntriumph, soon to be turned into notes of lamentation. The Mina of 1834,\r\nold and bed-ridden, with his energies, mental perhaps as well as\r\nphysical, impaired by long inaction, was a very different man from the\r\nMina of 1810. When fighting against the French, the sympathies of the\r\nNavarrese were with him; now they were against him, and in a war of this\r\ndescription, that difference was of immense importance. In spite of the\r\nwintry season and of the badness of his health, one of the first things\r\nhe did on assuming the command was to make an excursion to Puente la\r\nReyna, Maneru, and other places, where, in days gone by, he had had his\r\nheadquarters, and which he had then never entered without being greeted\r\nas a hero and patriot, and welcomed with enthusiastic _vivas_. He\r\nflattered himself that this enthusiasm would be again awakened by his\r\nappearance; and was so much the more shocked when he found himself\r\nreceived with the utmost coldness and indifference. His illness was\r\naggravated by disappointment, and he returned angry and disgusted to\r\nPampeluna. Thence, incapacitated by his infirmities from exerting\r\nhimself in the field, he directed from his cabinet the operations of his\r\nlieutenants, and issued orders, the cruelty of some of which soon caused\r\nhis name to be as much execrated in Navarre as it had there once been\r\nvenerated. At no period of the war was less mercy shown to each other by\r\nthe contending parties than during Mina's command. Besides shooting all\r\nprisoners taken with arms in their hands, he caused the wounded whom he\r\nfound in the Carlist hospitals to be slain upon their beds, and\r\n_garroted_ or strangled a gentleman of Pampeluna, for no reason that\r\ncould be discovered except that he had two sons with the Carlists.\r\nSeveral forts having about this time being taken or battered by\r\nZumalacarregui, Mina determined to get possession of the guns with which\r\nthis had been done. He was aware of the difficulty the Carlists had in\r\nobtaining artillery; and knowing that it could not easily be transported\r\nfrom one place to another in that rugged and mountainous country, he\r\nconjectured that they were in the habit of burying it, which was\r\nactually the case. In order to obtain information as to the whereabout\r\nof the mortars with which the enemy had been shelling Elizondo, he\r\ndecimated the male inhabitants of Lecaros, and then burnt the village\r\nitself to the ground. Such atrocities as these, far from advancing the\r\ncause of Queen Isabel, materially injured it, offering as they did a\r\nstrong contrast with the conduct of Zumalacarregui, who, at the taking\r\nof Los Arcos, Echarri-Eranaz, and other places, had shown mercy, and\r\neven great kindness, to the wounded and prisoners he took. At last Mina\r\nhaving ventured out in person with a division of the troops, carried in\r\na litter because he too ill to sit his horse, was signally beaten by\r\nZumalacarregui at a place called Siete Fuentes, or the Seven Fountains,\r\nand himself narrowly escaped being taken prisoner. Soon after this\r\ndisaster he was deprived of the command, having done nothing whilst he\r\nheld it but lose men and forts, and exasperate the Navarrese peasantry\r\nto an unparalleled extent.\r\n\r\nAn attempt that was made about this time to assassinate Espartero, who\r\nthen commanded a moveable column in Biscay, is thus narrated by General\r\nZaratiegui:--\r\n\r\n\"The constant passage of Espartero between Bilboa and Orduna, inspired a\r\npeasant, who occupied a farmhouse near Luyando, with the idea of\r\nattempting that general's life. It was said that the man had been robbed\r\nor ill-treated by the soldiers of Espartero's division; but it is quite\r\nas probable that the peasant fancied in his simplicity, that if he could\r\nkill the Christino general, the war and the evils it inflicted on his\r\ncountry would be at an end. Taking a large tree trunk, he fashioned it\r\ninto a sort of cannon, fixed it at a spot where it commanded the\r\nhigh-road, and loaded it to the very mouth. The next time Espartero\r\npassed that way, the peasant watched his moment, set fire to the fuse of\r\nthis singular piece of artillery, and then ran away. The Christino\r\nsoldiers hurried to the spot whence the explosion had proceeded, and\r\nfound the wooden cannon burst into fifty pieces. It was evidently the\r\nact of an individual; but nevertheless the unlucky village of Luyando,\r\nbeing the nearest to the scene of the event, was immediately set on\r\nfire. Out of the sixty houses composing it, more than one half were\r\nconsumed; and if the others escaped, it was merely because the\r\nChristinos happened to want them at the moment for their own\r\noccupation.\"\r\n\r\nValdes was the last Christino general opposed to Zumalacarregui. Being\r\nminister of war at the time of Mina's dismissal from the command, he\r\nordered all the troops that could possibly be spared to march to\r\nNavarre, and himself followed to direct their operations. Upon his\r\nappearance the war assumed a more humane character; and soon afterwards\r\nthe arrival of the British commissioner, and his successful\r\nintervention, put an end to the system of reprisals, although after\r\nZumalacarregui's death it was again more than once resorted to by the\r\nmost ferocious of the leaders on either side. In honour of Lord Eliot,\r\nZumalacarregui set at liberty the prisoners he had made in the recent\r\naction of the Amezcoas, in which Valdes had been roughly handled. Lord\r\nEliot having expressed a wish for an autograph of the Carlist leader,\r\nZumalacarregui took a pen and wrote, in Spanish, as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"At Asarta, a village of the valley of Berrueza, celebrated for the\r\nvarious combats which have occurred there in the course of the present\r\ncentury, the honour of receiving his Excellency Lord Eliot was enjoyed,\r\non the 25th April 1835, by Tomas Zumalacarregui.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Gurwood made the Carlist chief a present of an excellent field\r\nglass, which had been used by the Duke of Wellington on some occasion\r\nduring the Peninsular war. \"This telescope was so esteemed by\r\nZumalacarregui,\" says his biographer, \"that as long as he lived he\r\nalways carried it with him; and at the present day, in spite of its\r\ntrifling intrinsic value, it is treasured by his family as the most\r\nprecious heir-loom they possess.\"\r\n\r\nThe non-success of Valdes's expedition to the valleys of the Amezcoas,\r\nand the fatigues and losses sustained there by his troops, had greatly\r\ndiscouraged the latter. On all sides the Carlists were obtaining\r\nadvantages, and their adversaries began to entertain a panic terror of\r\nZumalacarregui, who availed himself of this discouragement and temporary\r\ninaction of the foe to attack several fortified places. Amongst others,\r\nthe town of Trevino, situated between Vittoria and the Ebro, and at only\r\nthree or four hours' march from the cantonments of Valdes's army, fell\r\ninto the hands of the Carlists. Assembling thirteen battalions at the\r\nVenta of Armentia, Zumalacarregui brought up his artillery, consisting\r\nof one cannon and one howitzer, with which in two days he forced the\r\nplace to capitulate. Although Valdes, from where he was, could hear the\r\nsound of the guns, he did not venture to show himself till the Carlists\r\nhad destroyed the fortifications, and effected their retreat with\r\nprisoners and artillery.\r\n\r\nIt was after this successful expedition, and at what may be considered\r\nthe most fortunate period of Zumalacarregui's career, that Don Carlos\r\nconceived the idea of conferring a title on him. He caused this to be\r\nintimated to the general, and also that he was only waiting to know what\r\ntitle it would be the most agreeable to him to receive. \"We will talk\r\nabout it,\" replied Zumalacarregui, \"after entering Cadiz. As yet we are\r\nnot safe even in the Pyrenees, and a title of any kind would be but a\r\nstep towards the ridiculous.\" It was not till eleven months after his\r\ndeath that Don Carlos issued a decree, making him grandee of Spain, by\r\nthe titles of Duke of Victory and Count of Zumalacarregui.\r\n\r\nThe garrisons of Estella and of various other fortified towns in the\r\ninterior of Navarre and the Basque provinces, were now withdrawn by\r\norder of Valdes; other strong places were taken or capitulated, the\r\ngarrisons remaining for the most part prisoners of war. Within two\r\nmonths after the Eliot convention, the Carlists had got 300 Christino\r\nofficers and 2000 rank and file, prisoners in their various depots,\r\nwithout reckoning those who, on being captured, took up arms for Don\r\nCarlos. To exchange against these, the Queen's generals had not a single\r\nprisoner. About this time Espartero was beaten at Descarga by Eraso;\r\nwhilst Oraa met the same fate in the valley of the Baztan at the hands\r\nof Sagastibelza. Jauregui abandoned Tolosa, leaving behind him a\r\nquantity of ammunition and stores, and shut himself up in St Sebastian.\r\n\r\nThe intrigues and manoeuvres of certain individuals who surrounded Don\r\nCarlos, pandered to his weaknesses, and worked upon his superstitious\r\nbigotry, began to occasion Zumalacarregui serious annoyance, and to\r\ninterfere in some instances with his plans. During a short visit to\r\nSegura, where the Carlist court then was, he experienced much disgust\r\nand vexation. His health, moreover, began to fail him; and a week later,\r\nfrom the town of Vergara, which he had just taken, with its garrison of\r\n2000 men, he sent in his resignation. The following day Don Carlos\r\nhimself came to Vergara, and had a short conference with Zumalacarregui,\r\nafter which the latter marched upon Durango and Ochandiano, towns on the\r\nBilboa road, and took the latter, whilst the former was abandoned by its\r\ngarrison. It was now his wish to attack Vittoria, which was the nearest\r\nlarge town, and the easiest to take; but just at this time, Don Carlos,\r\nit appears, had been disappointed of a loan, and his flatterers and\r\nadvisers had been consoling him for it, by holding out a prospect of\r\ntaking Bilboa, which opulent commercial city contained, they said,\r\nenough riches to get him out of all his difficulties. Zumalacarregui\r\nopposed this plan, but his deference for Don Carlos finally caused him\r\nto yield; and with a heavy heart, and a train of artillery totally\r\ninadequate to the reduction of so strong a town, he sat down before\r\nBilboa. Two twelve-pounders and one six-pounder, two brass fours, two\r\nhowitzers and a mortar, were all that he had to oppose to the strong\r\ndefences and forty or fifty guns with which the capital of Biscay was\r\nprovided. There was also a great lack of certain descriptions of\r\nammunition. For the mortar there were only six-and-thirty shells; and to\r\nadd to the misfortunes of the attacking party, their two largest guns,\r\nthe twelve-pounders, burst on the very first day of the siege. During\r\nthe whole of that day and night, Zumalacarregui neither ate nor slept;\r\nand on the morrow, which was the 15th of June, he wrote a letter to the\r\nheadquarters of Don Carlos, then at Durango, informing the ministers,\r\nthat owing to the immense disproportion between his means of attack and\r\nthe enemy's powers of defence, he expected it would be necessary to\r\nraise tire siege.\r\n\r\nAfter sending off this despatch, a great weight seemed removed from the\r\nmind of Zumalacarregui, and he went down to the batteries. With the view\r\nof observing whether the Bilbainos had made any repairs or thrown up\r\nworks in the course of the night, he ascended to the first floor of a\r\nhouse situated near the sanctuary of Our Lady of Begona, and from the\r\nbalcony began to examine the enemy's line. Whilst standing there, a\r\nbullet struck him on the right leg, about two inches from the knee. Nine\r\ndays afterwards he was dead--killed, there can be little doubt, less by\r\nthe wound or its effects than by the gross ignorance of his medical\r\nattendants. Three Spanish doctors, a young English surgeon, and a\r\n_curandero_, or quack, named Petriquillo, whom Zumalacarregui had known\r\nfrom his youth, and in whose skill he had great confidence, were called\r\nin. The Englishman, however, returned after two days to the squadron to\r\nwhich he was attached, giving as his opinion, which agreed with that of\r\nDon Carlos's own surgeon, one Gelos, that in a fortnight Zumalacarregui\r\nwould be on horseback again. Whilst Petriquillo was applying ointments\r\nand frictions, and a doctor of medicine cramming the patient with drugs,\r\nGelos and another surgeon kept tormenting the wound with their probes.\r\nThe wounded man's general health, already affected by the various\r\nannoyances he had recently experienced, began to give way; and at last,\r\nwithin three or four hours after the extraction of the ball, an\r\noperation that appears to have been performed in the most butcherlike\r\nmanner, Zumalacarregui breathed his last. He was forty-six years of age,\r\nand left a wife and three daughters. All his worldly possessions\r\nconsisted of three horses and a mule, some arms, the telescope given him\r\nby Colonel Gurwood, and fourteen ounces of gold.\r\n\r\nIf that weak and incapable prince, Don Carlos de Borbon, had allowed\r\nZumalacarregui to follow up his own plans of campaign, instead of\r\ndictating to him unfeasible ones, there can be little doubt that in less\r\nthan another year he would have entered Madrid. The immense importance\r\nof the _prestige_ attached to a general is well known. That of\r\nZumalacarregui was fully established, both with his own men and the\r\nQueen's troops. The latter trembled at his very name; the former, at his\r\ncommand, were ready to attack ten times their number.\r\n\r\n\"Are there only two battalions yonder?\" enquired Captain Henningsen of a\r\nCarlist soldier, pointing to a position which was menaced by a large\r\nbody of the enemy. \"That is all, Senor,\" was the reply; \"but the general\r\nis there.\" The man was as confident of the safety of the position as\r\nthough there had been twenty battalions instead of two. And such was the\r\nfeeling throughout the Carlist army.\r\n\r\nThe only one of the Carlist or Christino leaders who united all the\r\nqualities essential to success was Zumalacarregui. Some were honest, a\r\nfew were perhaps good tacticians, others were not deficient in energy,\r\nbut none were all three. The Christino generals were generally\r\nconspicuous for their indecision, and for their want of zeal for the\r\ncause they defended. Many of them would have been sorry to see an end\r\nput to a war which gave them occupation, rapid promotion, decorations,\r\ntitles, and money. When Zumalacarregui began his campaign with a handful\r\nof men, no one could catch him; when he got stronger and showed fight,\r\nno one could stand against him. As soon as he died, his system of\r\nwarfare was abandoned, and victory ceased to be faithful to the Carlist\r\nstandard. The battle of Mendigorria, which occurred within a month after\r\nhis death, and in which the Carlists were signally defeated by Cordova,\r\ntaught the former that their previous successes had been owing at least\r\nas much to their general's skill as to their own invincibility.\r\n\r\nThe most salient points in Zumalacarregui's character were his\r\ngenerosity and energy. The former was carried almost to an excess. He\r\ncould not see persons in want without relieving them; and as his sole\r\nincome whilst commanding the Carlist army consisted of 2500 reals, or\r\ntwenty-five pounds sterling, a-month, which he took for his pay, he\r\nfrequently found himself without a maravedi in his pocket. It is related\r\nof him, amongst many other anecdotes of the same kind, that once in\r\nwinter, the weather being very cold, he had ordered a coat, having only\r\none, and that much worn. The tailor had just brought it home and been\r\npaid for it, when Zumalacarregui, happening to look out of the window,\r\nsaw one of his officers passing in a very ragged condition. He called\r\nhim up, made him try on his new coat, and finding that it fitted him,\r\nsent him away with it, himself remaining in the same state as before.\r\n\r\nFor the charges of cruelty of disposition which have been brought\r\nagainst Zumalacarregui, we are inclined to believe there was very\r\ninsufficient ground. He was a severe disciplinarian, shot his own men\r\nwhen they deserved it, and his prisoners when the Christinos set him the\r\nexample; but if he had not done so he had better have sheathed his sword\r\nat once, and left Don Carlos to fight his own battles, in which case\r\nthey would very soon have been over. His present biographer, who writes\r\ncoolly and dispassionately, and appears as sparing of indiscriminate\r\npraise of his friends as of exaggerated blame of his foes, gives\r\nnumerous instances of Zumalacarregui's goodness of heart and humane\r\nfeeling. Of a bilious habit and a hasty temper, he could ill bear\r\ncontradiction, and at times would say or do things for which he was\r\nafterwards sorry. In such cases he was not ashamed to acknowledge, and\r\nif possible repair, his fault.\r\n\r\nThe death of Zumalacarregui was the subject of unbounded exultation to\r\nthe Christinos; and for long afterwards there might be seen upon the\r\nwalls of their towns and villages the remains of a proclamation\r\nannouncing it, and predicting a speedy annihilation of the faction.\r\nAlthough this prophecy was not made good, and the war was protracted for\r\nupwards of four years longer, it soon became evident that the loss\r\nsustained was irreparable, and that the hopes of Carlism in the\r\nPeninsula lay buried in the grave of Tomas Zumalacarregui.\r\n\r\nREFERENCE: _Vida y Hechos de Don Tomas Zumalacarregui, Duque de la\r\nVictoria, Conde de Zumalacarregui, y Capitan-General del Ejercito\r\nde S.M.

ZARATIEGUI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH'S SPECIMENS OF THE BRITISH CRITICS.\r\n\r\nNo. VII.\r\n\r\nMAC-FLECNOE AND THE DUNCIAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe field which we have invaded is one obviously of a vast\r\ncomprehension. Taking it up, as we have rightly done, from Dryden, more\r\nthan a century and a half of our literature lies immediately and\r\nnecessarily within it. For the fountain of criticism once opened and\r\nflowing, the criticism of a country continually reflects its literature,\r\nas a river the banks which yield it a channel, and through which it\r\nwinds.\r\n\r\nBut the image falls short of the thing signified; for criticism is\r\nretrospective without limit, as well as contemporaneous. Heaven only\r\nknows whether it may not be endowed with a gift of prophecy; and for its\r\nhorizon--is this narrower than the world? We have undertaken a field\r\nwhich seems limited, only because it stretches beyond sight. Let us\r\nhope, however, that we shall find some art of striking our own road\r\nthrough it, without being obliged to study, both in the reflection and\r\nin the original, all the books of all nations and ages, criticising, as\r\nwe go along, both originals and criticisms. Every subject, said\r\nBurke--we remember his remark, though not the very words--branches out\r\ninto infinitude. The point of view draws a horizon--the goal determines\r\na track. \"The British Critics\" themselves are a host,\r\n\r\n    \"Innumerable as the stars of night,\r\n    Or stars of morning; dewdrops which the sun\r\n    Impearls on every leaf and every flower.\"\r\n\r\nBut discreet conscientious Oblivion has infolded under his loving\r\npinions nine hundred and ninety-nine in every thousand; while we think\r\nof concerning ourselves with those only whose names occupy some notable\r\nniche, pedestal, or other position, in the august house of the great\r\ngoddess, Fame. We desire to show the spirit and power of British\r\ncriticism, to display the characteristic working of the British\r\nintellect in this department of intellectual activity. Therefore, among\r\nknown names, we shall dwell the most upon those writers whose works the\r\nmind of the nation has the most frankly, cordially, and unreservedly\r\ntaken to itself, recognising them, as it were, for its own\r\nproductions--those writers whose reputation the country has the most\r\ndistinctly identified with her own renown.\r\n\r\nWe have taken hold upon two such names, Dryden and Pope. And tens of\r\nthousands have experienced with us the pleasures that arise from a\r\nrenewed or new intimacy with powerful spirits. The acquaintance is not\r\nspeedily exhausted. It grows and unfolds itself. When you think to have\r\ndone with them, and lift up your bonnet with a courteous gesture of\r\nleave-taking, your host draws your arm within his, and leads you out\r\ninto his garden, and threading some labyrinthine involution of paths,\r\nconducts you to some hidden parterre of his choicest flowers, or to the\r\naerial watch-tower of his most magnificent prospect.\r\n\r\nThe omnipotent setter of limits, Death, freezes the tuneful tongue,\r\nunnerves the critical hand, from which the terrible pen drops into dust.\r\nShakspeare has written his last play--Dryden his last tale. You may\r\ndream--if you like--of what projected and unwritten--what unprojected\r\nbut possible comedies, histories, tragedies, went into the tomb in the\r\nchurch of Stratford upon Avon! In the meanwhile, you will find that what\r\nis written is not so soon read. Read for the first time it soon is--not\r\nfor the last. For what is \"to read?\" \"_Legere_\" is \"to gather.\"\r\nShakspeare is not soon gathered--nor is Dryden.\r\n\r\nWalk through a splendid region. Do you think that you have seen it? You\r\nhave begun seeing it. Live in it fifty years, and by degrees you may\r\nhave come to know something worth telling of Windermere! Our vocation\r\nnow, gentles all, is not simply the knowing--it is the showing too; and\r\nhere, too, the same remark holds good. For we think ten times and more,\r\nthat now surely we have shown poet or critic. But not so. Some other\r\nattitude, some other phasis presents itself; and all at once you feel\r\nthat, without it, your exposition of the power, or your picture of the\r\nman, is incomplete.\r\n\r\nYou have seen how the critics lead us a dance. Dryden and Pope criticise\r\nShakspeare. We have been obliged to criticise Shakspeare, and this\r\ncriticism of him. Dryden measures himself with Juvenal, Lucretius, and\r\nVirgil. We, somewhat violently perhaps--with a gentle violence--construe\r\na translation into a criticism, and prate too of those immortals.\r\nGlorious John modernizes Father Geoffrey; and to try what capacity of\r\npalate you have for the enjoyment of English poetry some four or five\r\ncenturies old, we spread our board with a feast of veritable Chaucer.\r\nYet not a word, all the while, of the Wife of Bath's Tale of Chivalry\r\nand Faery, which is given with fine spirit by Dryden--nor of the Cock\r\nand the Fox, told by the Nun's priest, which is renewed with infinite\r\nlife and gaiety, and sometimes we are half-inclined to say, with\r\nfidelity in the departure, by the same matchless pen. Good old father\r\nChaucer! Can it be true that century rolling after century thickens the\r\ndust upon Adam Scrivener's vellum! Can it be true that proceeding time\r\nwidens the gulf yawning betwixt thee and ourselves, thy compatriots of\r\nanother day, thy poetical posterity! The supposition is\r\nunnatural--un-English--un-Scottish. Thou hast been the one popular poet\r\nof England. Shakspeare alone has unseated thee. Thou hast been taken to\r\nthe heart of Scottish poets, as though there were not even a dialectical\r\nshadow of difference distinguishing thine and their languages. A dim\r\ntime, an eclipsing of light and warmth fell upon the island, and to read\r\nthee was a feat of strange scholarship, a study of the more learned. But\r\nhappier years shall succeed. As Antaeus the giant acquired life and\r\nstrength by dropping back upon the bosom of his mother earth--she, the\r\nuniversal parent, was, you know, in a more private and domestic meaning\r\nhis mother--so, giants of our brood, dropping back upon they bosom, O\r\nFather Chaucer! shall from that infusive touch renew vitality and\r\nvigour, and go forth exultingly to scale, not Olympus, but Parnassus.\r\nAnd now, in illustration of the ruling spirit--known and felt in its\r\nfull power only by ourselves--of this series--NORTH'S SPECIMENS OF THE\r\nBRITISH CRITICS--we invite unexpectedly--(for who can foresee the\r\nensuing segment of our orbit?)--the people of these realms to admire\r\nwith us the critical genius of Dryden and of Pope, displayed in their\r\nmatchless satires--MAC-FLECNOE and the DUNCIAD.\r\n\r\nIn regard to these poems, shall we seek to conciliate our countrymen by\r\nadmitting, at the outset, that there is something in both to be\r\nconfessed and forgiven? That there is something about them that places\r\nthem upon a peculiar footing--that is not quite right? They must be\r\ndistinguished from the legitimate poems, in which the poet and the\r\nservant of the Muses merely exercises his ministry. He then furnishes to\r\nthe needs of humanity, and is the acknowledged benefactor of his kind.\r\nBut these are _wilful_ productions. They are from the _personal_ self of\r\nthe poet. They are arbitrary acts of mighty despots. They kill, because\r\nthey choose and can. And we, alas!--we are bribed by the idolatry of\r\npower to justify the excesses of power. Let not our maligners--our\r\nfoes--hear of it, for it is one of our vulnerable points.\r\n\r\nYet as long as men and women are weak and mortal, genius will possess a\r\nprivilege of committing certain peccadilloes that will be winked at and\r\nhushed up. We proclaim poetry for an organ of the highest, profoundest\r\ntruth. But every now and then, when we are in difficulties, we shroud\r\nthe poet and ourselves under the undeniable fact, that poetry is\r\nfiction; and under that pretext, wildly and wickedly would throw off all\r\nresponsibility from him, and from ourselves, his retainers and abettors;\r\nand yet something, after all, is to be conceded to the mask of the poet.\r\nAll nations and times have agreed in not judging him by the prosaic\r\nlaws to which we who write and speak prose are amenable. His is a\r\nplayful part, and he has a knack of slipping from under the hand of\r\nserious judgment. He is a Proteus, and feels himself bound to speak the\r\nbare truth only when he is reduced to his proper person, not whilst he\r\nis exercising his preternatural powers of illusion. He holds in his\r\ngrasp the rod of the Enchanter, Pleasure, and with a touch he unnerves\r\nthe joints that would seize and drag him before the seat of an ordinary\r\npolice. But we must remember that we are now scrawling unprivileged\r\nprose; and beware that we do not, like other officious and uncautious\r\npartizans, bring down upon our own defenceless heads the sword which the\r\ndelinquency of them mightier far has roused from the scabbard.\r\n\r\nLet us see, then, how stands the case of such satirists.\r\n\r\nWar enters into the kingdom of the Muses. Rival wits assail one\r\nanother--Dryden and Shadwell. _Nec dis nec viribus aequis._ This is a\r\nduel--_impar congressus Achillei_. But when Pope undertakes to hunt down\r\nthe vermin of literature, this is no distraction of the Parnassian realm\r\nby civil war. This is the lawful magistrate going forth, armed perhaps\r\nwith extraordinary powers, to clear an infested district of vulgar\r\nmalefactors and notorious bad characters.\r\n\r\nVile publishers, vile critics, vile scribblers of every denomination, in\r\nprose and verse--all those who turn the press, that organ of light for\r\nthe world, into an engine of darkness--who may blame the poet for\r\nclothing them in such curses as shall make them for all time at once\r\nloathsome and laughable in Christian lands?\r\n\r\nLetters! sent by heaven for accomplishing the gift of speech. The\r\nindividual thinker, by turning his thoughts into words, advances himself\r\nin the art and power of thought--unravels, clears up, and establishes\r\nthe movements of \"the shadowy tribes of mind.\" And so the federal\r\nrepublic of nations, by turning the spoken word into the written,\r\nadvance their faculty of thinking, and their acquisition of thought. The\r\nthought has gained perpetuity when it is worded--the word has gained\r\nperpetuity when it is written. Reason waits her completed triumph from\r\nthe written work, which converts, and alone can convert, the thought of\r\nthe individual mind into that of the universal mind; thus constituting\r\nthe fine act of one aspiring intelligence the common possession of the\r\nspecies, and collecting the produce of all wits into the public treasury\r\nof knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe misusers of letters are therefore the foes of the race. The\r\nlicentious thinker and writer prejudices the liberty of thinking and\r\nwriting. Those who excel in letters, and in the right use of letters,\r\nare sensitive to their misapplication. Hence arises a species of satire,\r\nor, if you will, satirist--THE SCRIBLERO-MASTIX. He must attack\r\nindividuals. A heavily-resounding lash should scourge the immoral and\r\nthe profane. Light stripes may suffice for quelling the less nocent\r\ndunces. In commonplace prose criticism, whatever form it may take, this\r\ncan be done without supposed personal ill-will; for the Mastix is then\r\nonly doing a duty plainly prescribed. The theologian must censure, and\r\ntrample as mire, the railing assailant of the truths which in his eyes\r\ncontain salvation. The reviewer must review. But what, it may be asked,\r\nmoves any follower of the Muses to satirise a scribbler? He seems to go\r\n_out of his way_ to do so; for verse has naturally better associations.\r\nBut the personal aggression on the wit by the dunce, may fairly\r\ninstigate the wit to flay the dunce. Now he finds the object of his\r\nsatire _in the way_. The fact is, that Dryden's poem and Pope's were\r\nboth moved in this way. The grew out of personal quarrels. Are they on\r\nthat account to be blamed? Not if the dunces, by them \"damned to\r\neverlasting fame,\" were the unhappy aggressors.\r\n\r\nDryden's times, and possibly something in his own character, trained his\r\nmuse to polemics. His pen was active in literary controversies, which\r\nwere never without a full infusion of personalities. More thoroughly\r\nmoved at one time against one offender--though the history of the feud\r\nis in some parts imperfectly traceable--he compelled the clouds and\r\nhurled the lightning, in verse, on the doomed head of Thomas Shadwell.\r\nThe invention of the poem entitled MAC-FLECNOE is very simple. Richard\r\nFlecnoe was a voluminous writer, and exceedingly bad poet--a name of\r\nscorn already in the kingdom of letters. Dryden supposes him to be the\r\nKing of Dulness, who, advanced in years, will abdicate his\r\nwell-possessed throne. He selects Shadwell from amongst his numerous\r\noffspring, all the Dunces, as the son or Dunce the most nearly\r\nresembling himself--hence the name of the poem--and appoints him his\r\nsuccessor. That is the whole plan. The verse flows unstinted from the\r\nfull urn of Dryden. The perfect ease, and the tone of mastery\r\ncharacteristic of him, are felt throughout. He amuses himself with\r\nlaughing at his rival, and the amusement remains to all time; for all\r\nwho, having felt the pleasure of wit, are the foes of the Dunces. It is\r\nnot a laboured poem--it is a freak of wit. You cannot imagine him\r\nattaching much importance to the scarcely two hundred lines, thrown off\r\nin a few gleeful outpourings. To _us_, Shadwell is _nothing_. He is a\r\nphantom, an impersonation. His Duncehood is exaggerated, for he was a\r\nwriter of some talent in one walk; but being selected for the throne, it\r\nwas imperative to make him Dunce all through. To us, there, he is merely\r\na Type; and we judge the strokes of Dryden in their universality, not\r\nasking if they were truly applicable to his victim, but whether they\r\nexpress pointedly and poignantly the repulsion entertained by Wit for\r\nDulness. In this enlarged sense and power we feel it as poetry. When the\r\nfather, encouraging his heir, says--\r\n\r\n    \"And when false flowers of ret'ric thou wouldst cull, Trust Nature;\r\n    do not labour to be dull; But, write they best, and top\"----\r\n\r\nNothing can be happier. The quiet assumption of Dulness for the highest\r\npoint of desirable human attainment--the good-nature and indulgent\r\nparental concern of the wish to save the younger emulator of his own\r\nglory from spending superfluous pains on a consummation sure to come of\r\nitself--the confidence of the veteran Dullard in the blood of the race,\r\nand in the tried and undegenerate worth of his successor--the sufficient\r\ndirection of a life and reign comprehended, summed up, concentrated in\r\nthe one master-precept--\"do not labour to be dull\"--are inimitable. You\r\nfeel the high artist, whom experience has made bold; and you feel your\r\nown imagination roused to conceive the universe of Dunces, each yielding\r\nto the attraction of his genius, fluttering his pinions with an\r\nexquisite grace, and all, without labour or purpose, arriving at the\r\ngoal predestined by nature and fate.\r\n\r\nWe know of no good reason why, for the delectation of myriads in their\r\nminority, Maga should not give MAC-FLECNOE entire; but lest old and\r\nelderly gentlemen should think it too much extract, she gives all she\r\ncan, and lets you dream the rest.\r\n\r\n    \"Now Empress Fame had publish'd the renown\r\n  Of Shadwell's coronation though the Town.\r\n  Rouz'd by report of fame, the nations meet,\r\n  From near Bunhill, and distant Watling-street.\r\n  No Persian carpets spread th' imperial way,\r\n  But scatter'd limbs of mangled poets lay;\r\n  From dusty shops neglected authors come,\r\n  Martyrs of pies, and reliques of the bum.\r\n  Much Heywood, Shirley, Ogleby, there lay,\r\n  But loads of Shadwell almost chok'd the way.\r\n  Bilk'd stationers, for yeomen, stood prepar'd,\r\n  And Herringman was captain of the guard.\r\n  The hoary prince in majesty appear'd,\r\n  High on a throne of his own labours rear'd;\r\n  At his right hand our young Ascanius sate,\r\n  Rome's other hope, and pillar of the state:\r\n  His brows thick fogs, instead of glories, grace,\r\n  And lambent Dulness play'd around his face.\r\n  As Hannibal did to the altars come,\r\n  Sworn by his sire a mortal foe to Rome;\r\n  So Shadwell swore, nor should his vow be vain,\r\n  That he till death true Dulness would maintain;\r\n  And, in his father's right, and realm's defence,\r\n  Ne'er to have peace with wit, nor truce with sense.\r\n  The king himself the sacred unction made,\r\n  As king by office, and as priest by trade.\r\n  In his sinister hand, instead of ball,\r\n  He plac'd a mighty mug of potent ale;\r\n  Love's kingdom to his right he did convey,\r\n  At once his sceptre, and his rule of sway;\r\n  Whose righteous lore the Prince had practis'd young,\r\n  And from whose loins recorded Psyche sprung.\r\n  His temples, last, with poppies were o'erspread,\r\n  That, nodding, seem'd to consecrate his head.\r\n  Just at the point of time, if Fame not lie,\r\n  On his left hand twelve rev'rend owls did fly.\r\n  So Romulus, 'tis sung by Tiber's brook,\r\n  Presage of sway from twice six vultures took.\r\n  Th' admiring throng loud acclamations make,\r\n  And omens of his future empire take.\r\n  The sire then shook the honours of his head,\r\n  And, from his brows, damps of oblivion shed,\r\n  Full on the filial Dulness: long he stood,\r\n  Repelling from his breast the raging god;\r\n  At length burst out in the prophetic mood.\r\n  'Heav'ns bless my son, from Ireland let him reign\r\n  To fair Barbadoes on the western main;\r\n  Of his dominion may no end be known,\r\n  And greater than his father's be his throne;\r\n  Beyond Love's kingdom let him stretch his pen!'\r\n  He paus'd, and all the people cry'd, 'Amen.'\r\n  Then thus continu'd he: 'My son, advance\r\n  Still in new impudence, new ignorance.\r\n  Success let others teach; learn thou from me\r\n  Pangs without birth, and fruitless industry.\r\n  Let virtuosos in five years be writ;--\r\n  Yet not one thought accuse thy toil--of wit.\r\n  Let gentle George in triumph tread the stage,\r\n  Make Dorimant betray, and Loveit rage;\r\n  Let Cully, Cockwood, Fopling, charm the pit,\r\n  And, in their folly, show the writer's wit:\r\n  Yet still thy fools shall stand in thy defence,\r\n  And justify their author's want of sense.\r\n  Let them be all by thy own model made\r\n  Of dulness, and desire no foreign aid;\r\n  That they to future ages may be known,\r\n  Not copies drawn, but issue of thy own.\r\n  Nay, let thy men of wit, too, be the same,\r\n  All full of thee, and diff'ring but in name.\r\n  But let no alien Sedley interpose,\r\n  To lard with wit thy hungry Epsom prose.\r\n  And when false flowers of rhet'ric thou wouldst cull,\r\n  Trust Nature; do not labour to be dull;\r\n  But, write thy best, and top; and, in each line,\r\n  Sir Formal's oratory will be thine:\r\n  Sir Formal, though unsought, attends thy quill,\r\n  And does thy northern dedications fill.\r\n  Nor let false friends seduce thy mind to fame,\r\n  By arrogating Johnson's hostile name.\r\n  Let father Flecnoe fire thy mind with praise,\r\n  And uncle Ogleby thy envy raise.\r\n  Thou art my blood, where Johnson has no part:\r\n  What share have we--in nature or in art?\r\n  Where did his wit on learning fix a brand,\r\n  And rail at arts he did not understand?\r\n  Where made he love in Prince Nicander's vein,\r\n  Or swept the dust in Psyche's humble strain?\r\n  Where sold he bargains, Whip-stitch, Kiss me ----,\r\n  Promis'd a play, and dwindled to a farce?\r\n  When did his muse from Fletcher scenes purloin,\r\n  As thou whole Eth'rege dost transfuse to thine?\r\n  But so transfus'd as oil and waters flow;\r\n  His always floats above, thine sinks below.\r\n  This is thy province, this thy wondrous way.\r\n  New humours to invent for each new play;\r\n  This is that bloated bias of thy mind,\r\n  By which, one way, to dulness 'tis inclin'd:\r\n  Which makes thy writings lean, on one side, still;\r\n  And in all changes, _that_ way bends thy will.\r\n  Not let thy mountain-belly make pretence\r\n  Of likeness; thine's a tympany of sense.\r\n  A tun of man in thy large bulk is writ,\r\n  But sure thou art but a kilderkin of wit.\r\n  Like mine, thy gentle numbers feebly creep;\r\n  Thy Tragic Muse gives smiles, thy Comic sleep.\r\n  With whate'er gall thou sett'st thyself to write,\r\n  Thy inoffensive satires never bite.\r\n  In thy felonious heart though venom lies,\r\n  It does but touch thy Irish pen, and dies.\r\n  Thy genius calls thee not to purchase fame\r\n  In keen Iambics, but mild Anagram.\r\n  Leave writing Plays, and chuse for thy command\r\n  Some peaceful province in Acrostic land:\r\n  There thou may'st wings display, and altars raise,\r\n  And torture one poor word ten thousand ways:\r\n  Or if thou would'st thy diff'rent talents suit,\r\n  Set thy own songs, and sing them to thy lute.'\r\n  He said; but his last words were scarcely heard; }\r\n  For Bruce and Longvil has a trap prepar'd        }\r\n  And down they sent the yet-declaiming bard.      }\r\n  Sinking, he left his drugget robe behind,\r\n  Borne upwards by a subterranean wing:\r\n  The mantle fell to the young prophet's part,\r\n  With double portion of his father's art.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Mac-Flecnoe_ of Dryden suggested--no more--the _Dunciad_ of Pope.\r\nThere is nothing of transcript. Flecnoe, who,\r\n\r\n    \"In prose and verse, was own'd without dispute,\r\n    THROUGH ALL THE REALMS OF NONSENSE, ABSOLUTE,\"\r\n\r\nsettles the succession of the state on Shadwell. That idea Pope adopts;\r\nbut the Kingdom of Dulness is re-modelled. It is no longer an aged\r\nmonarch, who, tired out with years and the toils of empire, gladly\r\ntransfers the sceptre to younger and more efficient hands, but the\r\nGODDESS OF DULNESS who is concerned for her dominion, and elects her new\r\nvice-regent on the demise of the Crown. The scale is immeasurably\r\naggrandized--multitudes of dunces are comprehended--the composition is\r\nelaborate--the mock-heroic, admirable in Dryden, is carried to\r\nperfection, and we have, _sui generis_, a regular epic poem.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1727, amongst the works first given to the public in the\r\nMiscellancies of Pope and Swift, was the treatise of Martinus\r\nScriblerus, ~Peri Bathous~, or the _Art of Sinking in Poetry_.\r\nThe exquisite wit and humour of this piece, which was almost wholly\r\nPope's, enraged the Dunces to madness; and the mongrel pack opened in\r\nfull cry, with barbarous dissonance, against their supposed whipper-in.\r\nNever was there such a senseless yell: for the philosophical treatise\r\n\"On the Profund\" overflows with amenity and good-nature. Pope is all the\r\nwhile at play--diverting himself in innocent recreation; and, of all the\r\nsatires that ever were indited, it is in spirit the most inoffensive to\r\nman, woman, and child. The Dunces, however, swore that its wickedness\r\nwent beyond the Devil's, and besought the world to pay particular\r\nattention to the sixth chapter as supra-Satanic. Therein Martinus ranges\r\n\"the confined and less copious geniuses under proper classes, and, the\r\nbetter to give their pictures to the reader, under the name of animals.\"\r\nThe animals are Flying Fishes, Swallows, Ostriches, Parrots, Didappers,\r\nPorpoises, Frogs, Eels, and Tortoises. Each animal is characterized in a\r\nfew words, that prove Pope to have been a most observant zoologist; and\r\nsome profundists, classified according to that arrangement, are\r\nindicated by the initial letters of their names. The chapter is short,\r\nand the style concise--consisting of but four pages. Some of the initial\r\nletters had been set down at random; but profundists rose up, with loud\r\nvociferation, to claim them for their own; and _gli animali parlanti_,\r\non foot, wing, fin, \"or belly prone,\" peopled the booksellers' shops. C.\r\nG., \"perplexed in the extreme,\" was the cause of perplexity to others,\r\nfiguring now as a flying-fish, and now as a porpoise. While J. W. was\r\nnot less problematical--now an Eel, and now a Didapper.\r\n\r\n\"Threats of vengeance,\" says Roscoe, \"resounded from all quarters, and\r\nthe press groaned under the various attempts at retaliation to which\r\nthis production gave rise. Before the publication of the _Dunciad_,\r\nupwards of sixty different libels, books, papers, and copies of verses,\r\nhad been published against Pope.\" The allied forces--_vae\r\nvictis!_--published _a Popiad_. Threats of personal violence were\r\nfrequently held out--a story was circulated of his having been whipped\r\nnaked with rods; and, to extent the ridicule, an advertisement, with his\r\ninitials, was inserted in the _Daily Post_, giving the lie to the\r\nscandal. Were such brutalities to be let pass unpunished? Dr Johnson\r\nsays that \"Pope was by his own confession the aggressor\"--and so say Dr\r\nWarton and Mr Bowles. The aggressor! Why, the Dunces had been maligning\r\nhim all their days, long before the treatise on the _Profund_. And that\r\nis bad law, indeed, that recognises a natural right in blockheads to be\r\nblackguards, and gives unlimited license of brutality towards any man of\r\ngenius who may have been ironical on the tribe. But then, quoth some\r\nhypocritical wiseacre, is not satire wicked? Pope was a Christian; and\r\nshould have learned to forgive. Stop a bit.\r\n\r\nWe talk of poets and books, as if we who occupy the tribunal were,\r\nduring that moment at least, miracles of clear-sighted incorruptible\r\njustice, and of all the virtues generally. Conscience reasserts her\r\nwhole sway in our minds as soon as we sit on other men's merits and\r\ndemerits; almost the innocence of Eden re-establishes itself in our\r\nbreasts. Self-delusion! Men we are at the guilty bar--Men on the\r\nblameless bench. There is a disorderly spirit in every one of us--a\r\nspice of iniquity. Human nature forgives a crime for a jest. Not that\r\ncrimes and jests are commensurable or approximable; but they are before\r\nthe same judge. He dislikes, or professes to dislike, the crime.\r\nIndubitably, and without a pretence, he likes the jest. Here, then, is\r\nan opportunity given of balancing the liking against the disliking; and,\r\nunder that form, the jest against the crime. If he likes the jest more\r\nthan he dislikes the crime, the old saw holds good--\r\n\r\n\"Solvuntur risu tabulae, tu missus abibis.\"\r\n\r\nWell, then, the wit of Dryden and Pope is irresistible. What follows?\r\nFor having contented our liking, we let them do any thing that they\r\nlike. Poor Og! poor Shadwell! poor Bayes, poor Cibber! He sprawls and\r\nkicks in the gripe of the giant, and we--as if we had sat at bull-fights\r\nand the shows of gladiators--when the blood trickles we are tickled,\r\nand--oh, shame!--we laugh.\r\n\r\nThe DUNCIAD suffers under the law of compensations. As the renown of the\r\nactor is intense whilst he lives, and languishes with following\r\ngenerations, so is it with poems that embrace with ardour the Present.\r\nWhen the Present has become the Past, they are, or at least their\r\nliveliest edge is, past too. No commentary can restore the fiery hates\r\nof Dante--nor the repellent scorn of Hudibras--nor the glow of laughter\r\nto MAC-FLECNOE and the DUNCIAD. Eternal things are eternal--transitory\r\nthings are transitory. The transitory have lost their zest--the eternal\r\nhave their revenge.\r\n\r\nYet, a hundred years and more after the DUNCIAD, a critic may wish that\r\nthe matter had been a little more diligently moulded, with more\r\nconsideration of readers to come--that there had been less of mere\r\nnames--that every Gyas and Cloanthus had somewhat unfolded his own\r\nindividuality upon the stage--had been his own commentary--had, by a\r\nword or two, painted himself to everlasting posterity, in hue, shape,\r\nand gesture, as he stood before the contemporary eye. 'Tis an idle\r\nspeculation! The thing, by its inspiring passion, personal anger and\r\noffence, belonged to the day. The poet gives it up to the day. He uses\r\nhis poetical machinery to grace and point a ridicule that is to tell\r\nhome to the breasts of living men--that is to be felt tingling by living\r\nflesh--that is to tinge living cheeks, if they can still redden, with\r\nblushes.\r\n\r\nYet, for all that, the Dunciad still lives; ay, in spite of seeming\r\ninconsistency, we declare it to be immortal. For, build with what\r\nmaterials she may, the works of genius that stand in the world of\r\nthought survive all time's mutations, cemented by a spirit she alone can\r\ninterfuse. It must not be said that a poem shelved is dead and buried.\r\nOpen it at midnight, and the morning is in your chamber.\r\n\r\nWe love to commune with the rising and new-risen generations; elderly\r\npeople we do not much affect; and, for that we are old ourselves, we are\r\naverse from the old. Now, of our well-beloved rising and new-risen\r\ngenerations, how many thousands may there be in these islands who have\r\nread the Dunciad? Not so many as to make needless in our pages a few\r\nexplanatory sentences respecting its first appearance, and the not\r\ninconsiderable changes of form it was afterwards made to assume. At the\r\nhead of the Dunces at first stood one Theobald, who, with some of the\r\nrequisite knowledge and aptitude for a reviser of the text of\r\nShakspeare, was a poor creature, and a dishonest one, but too feeble and\r\ntoo obscure for the place. Fifteen years afterwards, (1742,) at the\r\ninstigation of Warburton, Pope added to the Dunciad a Fourth Book. In it\r\nthere was _one line, and one line only_, about Colley Cibber.\r\n\r\n\"She mounts the throne: her head a cloud conceal'd,\r\nIn broad effulgence all below reveal'd,\r\n('Tis thus aspiring Dulness ever shines,)\r\n_Soft on her lap her Laureate Son reclines._\"\r\n\r\nDr Johnson calls that an acrimonious attack! \"to which the provocation\r\nis not easily discoverable;\" and says, \"that the severity of this satire\r\nleft Cibber no longer any patience.\" The Doctor speaks, too, of the\r\n\"incessant and unappeasable malignity\" of Pope towards Cibber, and takes\r\nthe part of that worthy in the quarrel. Colley was absolutely\r\npoet-laureate of England; and having no longer any patience in his\r\npride, \"gave the town\" an abusive pamphlet, in which he swore that he\r\nwould no longer tamely submit to such insults, but fight Pope with his\r\nown weapons. Dr Johnson says--\"Pope had now been enough acquainted with\r\nhuman life to know, _if his passion had not been too powerful for his\r\nunderstanding_, that from a contention like his with Cibber, the world\r\nseeks nothing but diversion, which is given at the expense of the higher\r\ncharacter.\" Pope had no contention with Cibber. Two or three times he\r\nhad dropped him a blistering word of contempt--once a word of praise to\r\nthe _Careless Husband_. But now Pope eyed the brazen bully, and saw in\r\nhim the proper hero of the Dunciad. Theobald vacated the throne, and\r\nretired into private life. Cibber was made to reign in his stead--and in\r\nthe lines written by Pope on the coronation, the monarch's character is\r\ndrawn, if we mistake not, in a style that sufficiently vindicates the\r\nPoet from the Doctor's charge, \"that his passion had been too powerful\r\nfor his understanding.\" True, \"the world seeks diversion,\" and she had\r\nit here to her heart's content; but not from any undignified\r\n\"contention\" with Cibber, which Pope disdained, but from matchless\r\npoetry that \"damned to everlasting fame.\" \"Cibber,\" says Johnson, \"had\r\nnothing to lose. When Pope had exhausted all his malignity upon him, he\r\nwould rise in the esteem both of his friends and his enemies.\" Cibber,\r\nthen, in the Dunciad, had a triumph over Pope!! Good.\r\n\r\nBut how, you ask, did Pope contrive to place Cibber in Theobald's shoes,\r\nwithout injury to the rest of the poem? Why, he did not place Cibber in\r\nTheobald's shoes. Theobald walked off in his shoes into the shades.\r\nSamuel says, that by the substitution, Pope has \"depraved his\r\npoem\"--inasmuch as he has given to Cibber the \"old books, the cold\r\npedantry and sluggish pertinacity of Theobald.\" That is not true.\r\nCompare the places in the original Dunciad, in which Theobald figures at\r\nlarge, with that now filled by Cibber, and you will admire by what\r\nwizard power the transformation is effected. Many lines, far too good to\r\nbe lost, are retained--and among them there may be a few more\r\ncharacteristic of the old Dunce than the new. But Cibber is Cibber all\r\nover--notwithstanding; nor needed Joseph Warton, who was as ready to\r\nindulge in a nap as any one we have known, to object that \"to slumber in\r\nthe goddess's lap was adapted to Theobald's stupidity, not to the\r\nvivacity of his successor.\" Pope knew better--\r\n\r\n    \"Dulness with transport eyes the lively Dunce,\r\n    Remember she herself was Pertness once.\"\r\n\r\nHere he comes.\r\n\r\n    \"In each she marks her image full exprest,\r\n  But chief in Bayes's monster-breeding breast;\r\n  Bayes, form'd by Nature's Stage and Town to bless,\r\n  And act, and be, a coxcomb with success.\r\n  Dulness with transport eyes the lively Dunce,\r\n  Remembering she herself was Pertness once.\r\n  Now (Shame to Fortune!) an ill run at play\r\n  Blank'd his bold visage, and a thin third day;\r\n  Swearing and supperless the hero sate,\r\n  Blasphem'd his gods, the dice, and damn'd his fate;\r\n  Then gnaw'd his pen, then dasht it on the ground,\r\n  Sinking from thought to thought, a vast profound!\r\n  Plung'd for his sense, but found no bottom there,\r\n  Yet wrote and flounder'd on in mere despair.\r\n  Round him much embryo, much abortion lay,\r\n  Much future ode, and abdicated play;\r\n  Nonsense precipitate, like running lead,\r\n  That slipt through cracks and zigzags of the head;\r\n  All that on Folly Frenzy could beget,\r\n  Fruits of dull heat, and sooterkins of wit.\r\n  Next, o'er his books his eyes began to roll,\r\n  In pleasing memory of all he stole;\r\n  How here he sip'd, how there he plunder'd snug,\r\n  And suck'd all o'er like an industrious bug.\r\n  Here lay poor Fletcher's half-eat scenes, and here\r\n  The frippery of crucify'd Moliere;\r\n  There hapless Shakspeare, yet of Tibbald sore,\r\n  Wish'd he had blotted for himself before.\r\n  The rest on outside merit but presume,\r\n  Or serve (like other fools) to fill a room;\r\n  Such with their shelves as due proportion hold,\r\n  Or their fond parents dress'd in red and gold;\r\n  Or where the pictures for the page atone,\r\n  And Quarles is saved by beauties not his own.\r\n  Here swells the shelf with Ogilby the Great;\r\n  There, stamp'd with arms, Newcastle shines complete;\r\n  Here all his suff'ring brotherhood retire,\r\n  And 'scape the martyrdom of jakes and fire:\r\n  A Gothic library! of Greece and Rome\r\n  Well purg'd, and worthy Settle, Banks, and Broome.\r\n    \"But, high above, more solid learning shone,\r\n  The Classics of an age that heard of none;\r\n  There Caxton slept, with Wynkyn at his side,\r\n  One clasp'd in wood, and one in strong cow-hide;\r\n  There, sav'd by spice, like mummies, many a year,\r\n  Dry bodies of divinity appear;\r\n  De Lyra there a dreadful front extends,\r\n  And here the groaning shelves Philemon bends.\r\n    \"Of these twelve volumes, twelve of amplest size,\r\n  Redeem'd from tapers and defrauded pies,\r\n  Inspir'd he seizes: these an altar raise;\r\n  An hecatomb of pure, unsully'd lays\r\n  That altar crowns; a folio common-place\r\n  Founds the whole pile, of all his works the base:\r\n  Quartos, Octavos, shape the less'ning pyre,\r\n  A twisted birth-day ode completes the spire.\r\n    \"Then he, great tamer of all human art!\r\n  First in my care, and ever at my heart;\r\n  Dulness! whose good old cause I yet defend,\r\n  With whom my Muse began, with whom shall end,\r\n  Ere since Sir Fopling's periwig was praise,\r\n  To the last honours of the Butt and Bays:\r\n  O thou! of bus'ness the directing soul!\r\n  To this our head like bias to the bowl,\r\n  Which, as more pond'rous, made its aim more true,\r\n  Obliquely waddling to the mark in view:\r\n  O! ever gracious to perplex'd mankind,\r\n  Still spread a healing mist before the mind;\r\n  And, lest we err by Wit's wild dancing light,\r\n  Secure us kindly in our native night.\r\n  Or, if to wit a coxcomb make pretence,\r\n  Guard the sure barrier between that and sense;\r\n  Or quite unravel all the reas'ning thread,\r\n  And hang some curious cobweb in its stead!\r\n  As, forc'd from wind-guns, lead itself can fly,\r\n  And pond'rous slugs cut swiftly through the sky;\r\n  As clocks to weight their nimble motion owe,\r\n  The wheels above urg'd by the load below;\r\n  Me Emptiness and Dulness could inspire,\r\n  And were my elasticity and fire.\r\n  Some daemon stole my pen (forgive th' offence)\r\n  And once betray'd me into common sense:\r\n  Else all my prose and verse were much the same;\r\n  This prose on stilts, that, poetry fall'n lame.\r\n  Did on the stage my fops appear confin'd?\r\n  My life gave ampler lessons to mankind.\r\n  Did the dead letter unsuccessful prove?\r\n  The brisk example never fail'd to move.\r\n  Yet sure, had Heav'n decreed to save the state,\r\n  Heav'n had decreed these works a longer date.\r\n  Could Troy be sav'd by any single hand,\r\n  This gray goose weapon must have made her stand.\r\n  What can I now?

Ourself. Still, still remain\r\n  Cibberian forehead, and Cibberian brain.\r\n  This brazen brightness, to the 'squire so dear;\r\n  This polish'd hardness, that reflects the peer:\r\n  This arch absurd, that wit and fool delights,\r\n  This mess, toss'd up of Hockley-hole and White's;\r\n  Where dukes and butchers join to wreathe my crown,\r\n  At once the Bear and Fiddle of the Town.\r\n  \"O born in sin, and forth in folly brought!\r\n  Works damn'd, or to be damn'd; (your father's fault.)\r\n  Go, purify'd by flames, ascend the sky,\r\n  My better and more Christian progeny!\r\n  Unstain'd, untouch'd, and yet in maiden sheets,\r\n  While all your smutty sisters walk the streets.\r\n  Ye shall not beg, like gratis-given Bland,\r\n  Sent with a pass and vagrant through the land;\r\n  Nor sail with Ward, to Ape-and-monkey climes,\r\n  Where vile Mundungus trucks for viler rhymes.\r\n  Not sulphur-tipt, emblaze an ale-house fire!\r\n  Not wrap up oranges, to pelt your sire!\r\n  O! pass more innocent, in infant state,\r\n  To the mild limbo of our father Tate:\r\n  Or peaceably forgot, at once be blest\r\n  In Shadwell's bosom with eternal rest!\r\n  Soon to that mass of nonsense to return,\r\n  Where things destroy'd are swept to things unborn.\"\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the goddess have been fixed, with sleepy fondness more than\r\nmaternal, upon him, her chosen instrument, during all his address; and\r\nwe can imagine the frowsy Frow weeping big fat tears with him as he\r\nweeps. Pope's \"passion had _not_ been too powerful for his\r\nunderstanding,\" nor for his imagination neither, when he was inditing\r\nthe following pathetic and picturesque lines:--\r\n\r\n  \"With that a tear (portentous sign of grace!)\r\n  Stole from the master of the seven-fold face,\r\n  And thrice he lifted high the Birth-day brand,\r\n  And thrice he dropt it from his quivering hand;\r\n  Then lights the structure, with averted eyes;\r\n  The rolling smoke involves the sacrifice.\r\n  The opening clouds disclose each work by turns;\r\n  Now flames the Cid, and now Perolla burns;\r\n  Great Caesar roars, and hisses in the fires;\r\n  King John in silence modestly expires;\r\n  No merit now the dear Nonjuror claims;\r\n  Moliere's old stubble in a moment flames.\r\n  Tears gush'd again, as from pale Priam's eyes,\r\n  When the last blaze sent Ilion to the skies.\r\n  Roused by the light, old Dulness heav'd the head\r\n  Then snatch'd a sheet of Thule from her bed;\r\n  Sudden she flies, and whelms it o'er the pyre,\r\n  Down sink the flames, and with a hiss expire.\"\r\n\r\nWhat next? The compact Argument informs us _she_ forthwith reveals\r\nherself to him, transports him to her Temple, unfolds her arts, and\r\ninitiates him into her mysteries; then announcing the death of Eusden\r\nthe poet-laureate, anoints him, carries him to court, and proclaims him\r\nsuccessor. The close of the Book was as much improved as the opening by\r\nthe changes consequent on the substitution of Cibber for Theobald. In\r\n1727, when the poem was composed, Eusden, \"a drunken parson,\" wore the\r\nlaurel; but now Cibber had been for years one of the successors of\r\nSpenser, and of the predecessors of Wordsworth--though indeed that last\r\nfact could not be known to Pope--and well he deserved this still higher\r\nelevation. And here again we must dissent from Dr Johnson's judgment,\r\n\"that by transferring the same ridicule (_not the same_) from one to\r\nanother, he destroyed its efficacy; for, by showing that what he said of\r\none he was ready to say of another, he reduced himself to the\r\ninsignificance of his own magpye, who from his cage calls cuckold at a\r\nventure.\" We love and honour the sage, but here he is a Sumph.\r\n\r\nOh! do read the Second Book, for we can afford but a few extracts; and,\r\nto whet you up, shall prate to you a few minutes about it.\r\n\r\nThe two ancient kings of heroic song have left us exemplars of Games.\r\nThe occasions are similar and mournful, although the contests are\r\ninspired by, and inspire a jocund mood. At the funeral of Patroclus,\r\nAchilles appoints eight games. He gives prizes for a chariot-race, a\r\ncestus-fight, a wrestling-match, a foot-race, a lance-fight, a\r\ndisk-hurling, a strife of archery and of darters. AEneas, on the first\r\nanniversary of his father's funeral, proposes five trials of skill--for\r\nthe chariot-race of Homer, suitably to the posture of the Trojan\r\naffairs, a sailing-match; then, the foot-race, the terrible cestus,\r\narchery, and lastly, the beautiful equestrian tournament of Young Troy.\r\nThe English Homer of the Dunces treads in the footsteps of his august\r\npredecessors, and celebrates, with imitated solemnities, a joyous\r\nday--that which elevates the arch-Dunce to the throne. Here too we have\r\ngames, but with a dissimilitude in similitude. He adopts an intermediate\r\nnumber, six. The first is exceedingly fanciful and whimsical. The\r\ngoddess creates the phantom of a poet. It has the shape of a\r\ncontemptible swindler in literature, a plagiarist without bounds, named\r\nMore. He is pursued by two booksellers, and vanishes from the grasp of\r\nhim who has first clutched the fluttering shade. \"Gentle Dulness ever\r\nloves a joke;\" and the aforesaid admirable jest having kindled\r\ninextinguishable laughter in heaven, Gentle Dulness repeats it (she\r\nloves to repeat herself,) and starts three phantoms in the likenesses\r\nrespectively of Congreve, Addison, Prior. Three booksellers give chase,\r\nand catch Heaven knows what, three foolish forgotten names. For the\r\nsecond exertion of talent, confined to the booksellers Osborne and Curl,\r\nthe prize is the fair Eliza, and Curl is Victor. Osborne, too, is\r\nsuitably rewarded; but as this game borders on the indelicate, it shall\r\nbe nameless. Hitherto, after the simplicity of ancient manners, there\r\nhave been contentions of bodily powers. But the games of the Dunces\r\nbelong to an advanced age of the world, and a part of them are\r\naccordingly spiritual. The third falls under this category. A patron is\r\nproposed as the prize. He who can best tickle shall carry him off. The\r\ndedicators fall to their task with great zeal and adroitness. Alas!\r\nthere steps in a young thief of a competitor unknown to Phoebus, but\r\ndeep in the counsels of Venus! He, aided by the goddess, and a votaress\r\nof her order whom the goddess deputes, avails himself of the noble\r\nprize's most susceptible side,\r\n\r\n    \"And marches off, his Grace's secretary.\"\r\n\r\nThe fourth game sets up a desirable rivalry with monkeys and asses. Who\r\nshall chatter the fastest? Who the loudest shall bray?\r\n\r\n  ----\"Three cat-calls be the bribe\r\n  Of him whose chatt'ring shames the monkey tribe:\r\n  And his this drum, whose hoarse heroic base\r\n  Drowns the loud clarion of the braying ass.\"\r\n\r\nSo numerous are the monkey-mimics that the claims of the chatterers\r\ncannot be adjusted--\r\n\r\n  \"Hold (cried the Queen) a cat-call each shall win;\r\n  Equal your merits! equal is your din!\r\n  But that this well-disputed game may end,\r\n  Sound forth, my Brayers, and the welkin rend.\"\r\n\r\nSir Richard Blackmore, with his six epics and sundry other poems, brays\r\nlouder and longer than the most leathern or brazen of the other throats;\r\nChancery Lane and Westminster Hall taking prominent part in the\r\nreverberating orchestra. The place is to be ranked amongst the famous\r\necho-descriptions, and beats Drayton's and Wordsworth's hollow.\r\n\r\nThe fifth game is DIVING.\r\n\r\n    \"This labor past, by Bridewell all descend,\r\n  (As morning pray'r and flagellation end)\r\n  To where Fleet-ditch, with disemboguing streams\r\n  Rolls the large tribute of dead dogs to Thames,\r\n  The king of dykes! than whom, no sluice of mud\r\n  With deeper sable blots the silver flood.\r\n  'Here strip, my children! here at once leap in,\r\n  Here prove who best can dash through thick and thin,\r\n  And who the most in love of dirt excel,\r\n  Or dark dexterity of groping well:\r\n  Who flings most filth, and wide pollutes around\r\n  The stream, be his the Weekly Journals bound;\r\n  A pig of lead to him who dives the best;\r\n  A peck of coals a-piece shall glad the rest.'\r\n    \"In naked majesty Oldmixon stands,\r\n  And, Milo-like, surveys his arms and hands;\r\n  Then sighing thus, 'And am I now threescore?\r\n  Ah, why, ye Gods! should two and two make four?'\r\n  He said, and climb'd a stranded lighter's height,\r\n  Shot to the black abyss, and plung'd downright:\r\n  The senior's judgment all the crowd admire,\r\n  Who but to sink the deeper rose the higher.\r\n    \"Next Smedley div'd; slow circles dimpled o'er\r\n  The quaking mud, that clos'd and op'd no more.\r\n  All look, all sigh, and call on Smedley lost;\r\n  Smedley in vain resounds through all the coast.\r\n    \"Then ** essay'd; scarce vanish'd out of sight,\r\n  He buoys up instant, and returns to light;\r\n  He bears no tokens of the sabler streams,\r\n  And mounts far off among the swans of Thames.\r\n    \"True to the bottom, see Concanen creep,\r\n  A cold, long-winded, native of the deep;\r\n  If perseverance gain the diver's prize,\r\n  Not everlasting Blackmore this denies:\r\n  No noise, no stir, no motion canst thou make,\r\n  Th' unconscious stream sleeps o'er thee like a lake.\r\n    \"Next plung'd a feeble, but a desperate pack,\r\n  With each a sickly brother at his back:\r\n  Sons of a day! just buoyant on the flood,\r\n  Then number'd with the puppies in the mud.\r\n  Ask ye their names? I could as soon disclose\r\n  The names of these blind puppies as of those.\r\n  Fast by, like Niobe, (her children gone,)\r\n  Sits Mother Osborne, stupify'd to stone!\r\n  And monumental brass this record bears,\r\n  'These _are_, ah no! these _were_ the Gazetteers!'\r\n    \"Not so bold Arnall; with a weight of scull\r\n  Furious he drives, precipitately dull.\r\n  Whirlpools and storms in circling arm invest,\r\n  With all the might of gravitation blest.\r\n  No crab more active in the dirty dance,\r\n  Downward to climb, and backward to advance,\r\n  He brings up half the bottom on his head,\r\n  And loudly claims the Journal and the Lead.\r\n    \"The plunging Prelate, and his pond'rous Grace,\r\n  With holy envy gave one layman place.\r\n  When lo! a burst of thunder shook the flood,\r\n  Slow rose a form in majesty of Mud;\r\n  Shaking the horrors of his sable brows,\r\n  And each ferocious feature grim with ooze.\r\n  Greater he looks, and more than mortal stares;\r\n  Then thus the wonders of the deep declares.\r\n    \"First he relates how, sinking to the chin,\r\n  Smit with his mien, the mud-nymphs suck'd him in;\r\n  How young Lutetia, softer than the down,\r\n  Nigrina black, and Merdamente brown,\r\n  Vy'd for his love in jetty bow'rs below,\r\n  As Hylas fair was ravish'd long ago.\r\n  Then sung, how shown him by the Nut-brown maids\r\n  A branch of Styx here rises from the shades,\r\n  That tinctured as it runs with Lethe's streams,\r\n  And wafting vapors from the land of dreams,\r\n  (As under seas Alpheus' secret sluice\r\n  Bears Pisa's offering to his Arethuse)\r\n  Pours into Thames; and hence the mingled wave\r\n  Intoxicates the pert, and lulls the grave:\r\n  Here brisker vapours o'er the Temple creep;\r\n  There, all from Paul's to Aldgate drink and sleep.\r\n    \"Thence to the banks where rev'rend bards repose,\r\n  They led him soft; each rev'rend bard arose;\r\n  And Milbourn chief, deputed by the rest,\r\n  Gave him the cassock, surcingle, and vest.\r\n  'Receive (he said) these robes, which once were mine,\r\n  Dulness is sacred in a sound divine.'\r\n  He ceas'd, and spread the robe; the crowd confess\r\n  The rev'rend flamen in his lengthen'd dress.\r\n  Around him wide a sable army stand,\r\n  A low-born, cell-bred, selfish, servile band,\r\n  Prompt or to guard or stab, to saint or damn,\r\n  Heav'n's Swiss, who fight for any god, or man.\r\n    \"Through Lud's fam'd gates, along the well-known Fleet,\r\n  Rolls the black troop, and overshades the street,\r\n  Till show'rs of sermons, characters, essays,\r\n  In circling fleeces whiten all the ways:\r\n  So clouds replenish'd from some bog below,\r\n  Mount in dark volumes, and descend in snow.\"\r\n\r\nThe last of the contests offers one or two difficulties. The goddess\r\nwill appoint her Supreme Judge in the Court of Criticism, and she\r\nordains a trial of qualifications. This is the manner of ordeal. A dull\r\npiece in prose, and a dull piece in verse, is to be read aloud. The\r\nauditor who remains the longest awake carries the election. The two\r\npreparations of Morphine exhibited, are a sermon of H--ley's (Henley or\r\nHoadley?) and Blackmore's Prince Arthur. Six candidate heroes present\r\nthemselves, three from the University, and three from the Inns of Court.\r\nSome explanation seems to be required of an arrangement which allots\r\nextraordinarily high promotion in the State of Dulness to a real and\r\nprodigious effort of mental energy. What explanation can be given? Are\r\nthe affairs of Dulness conducted, in some respects, by the same rules\r\nwhich obtain in the Commonwealth of Wit? Is it held there, as here, that\r\nthe first step to be taken, in order to forming a judgment of any book,\r\nis to read it? Was it prudently considered that the dullest of critics\r\ncan read only as long as his eyes are open? and that the function of\r\njudge must incessantly bring under his cognisance papaverous volumes,\r\nwith which only a super-human endowment of vigilance could hope\r\nsuccessfully to contend? so that the goddess is driven, by the necessity\r\nof the game, to admit within the circuit of her somnolent sway, a virtue\r\nto which she is naturally and peculiarly hostile? Or are we mistaken in\r\nsupposing that vigour of mind really qualifies for hearing a dull book\r\nthrough? Is it dulness itself that the most ably listens to dulness? We\r\nare out of our element, we presume, for we arrive at no satisfactory\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nBe all this as it may, the method of competition fails of accomplishing\r\nits end; and the chair, after all, is left vacant. Not that the divinity\r\nhas in the least misjudged the way of operation proper to her beloved\r\ntomes; but she has miscalculated the strength of her sons. Every dull\r\nhead of the congregated multitude--of the illustrious competitors--and\r\nof the two officiating readers, bows overcome. There is, perforce, an\r\nend; and the chair is yet open to the whole kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe trial involves another matter of some doubt. Do the two clerks read\r\naloud at one and the same time? and to the same audience? The\r\ndescription conveys the impression that they do. If so, one might have\r\nbeen tempted to fear that the sermon and the poem might have neutralized\r\neach other; but, on the contrary, the mixture worked like a patent.\r\n\r\nWhere has Cibber been all the while, and what has he been doing? \"_What\r\nsu'd he hae been doin'? Sittin' on his nain lowpin'-on-stane--lukin'\r\nfrae him._\" Joe Warton complains that he is too much of a passive hero.\r\nWhy, he is not so active as Achilles, or even Diomed; yet in Book Second\r\nhe is equal to AEneas. He is almost as long-winded, and excels the Pious\r\nin this, that he braves a fire of his own raising, whereas the other\r\nflies from one kindled much against his will--\r\n\r\n  \"High on a gorgeous seat, that far outshone\r\n  Henley's gilt tub, or Flecknoe's Irish throne,\r\n  Or that where on her Curls the public pours\r\n  All-bounteous, fragrant grains and golden showers,\r\n  GREAT CIBBER SATE!\r\n                 ----All eyes direct their rays\r\n  On him, _and crowds turn coxcombs as they gaze_!\"\r\n\r\nIs that being passive? The crowds are passive--not he surely, who, in\r\nthe potent prime of coxcombhood, without shifting his seat of honour,\r\nbreathes over all his subjects such family resemblance that they seem\r\none brotherhood, sprung from his own royal loins. Besides, who ever\r\nheard, in an Epic poem, of a hero contending in games instituted in his\r\nown honour? Yet we do not fear to say, that had he, inspired by the\r\nspectacle of Curl and Osborne displaying their prowess for the fair\r\nEliza, leapt from his gorgeous \"seat,\" and amid the shouts of the\r\nlieges, in rainbow glory jointed the contest, that infallibly he had won\r\nthe day. We have the authority of Aristotle on our side.\r\n\r\nYou cry aloud for an extract. Here is a superb one:--\r\n\r\n    \"'Ye Critics! in whose heads, as equal scales,\r\n  I weigh what author's heaviness prevails;\r\n  Which most conduce to sooth the soul in slumbers,\r\n  My H--ley's periods, or my Blackmore's numbers;\r\n  Attend the trial we propose to make:\r\n  If there be man who o'er such works can wake,\r\n  Sleep's all-subduing charms who dares defy,\r\n  And boasts Ulysses' ear with Argus' eye;\r\n  To him we grant our amplest pow'rs to sit\r\n  Judge of all present, past, and future wit;\r\n  To cavil, censure, dictate, right or wrong,\r\n  Full and eternal privilege of tongue.'\r\n    \"Three college sophs, and three pert Templars came,\r\n  The same their talents, and their tastes the same;\r\n  Each prompt to query, answer, and debate,\r\n  And smit with love of poesy and prate.\r\n  The pond'rous books two gentle readers bring;\r\n  The heroes sit, the vulgar form a ring.\r\n  The clam'rous crowd is hush'd with mugs of mum,\r\n  Till all, tun'd equal, send a gen'ral hum.\r\n  Then mount the clerks, and in one lazy tone\r\n  Through the long, heavy, painful page drawl on;\r\n  Soft creeping, words on words, the sense compose,\r\n  At ev'ry line they stretch, they yawn, they doze.\r\n  As to soft gales top-heavy pines bow low\r\n  Their heads, and lift them as they cease to blow;\r\n  Thus oft they rear, and oft the head decline,\r\n  As breathe, or pause, by fits, the airs divine.\r\n  And now to this side, now to that they nod,\r\n  As verse, or prose, infuse the drowsy god.\r\n  Thrice Budgel aim'd to speak, but thrice supprest\r\n  By potent Arthur, knock'd his chin and breast.\r\n  Toland and Tindal, prompt at priests to jeer,\r\n  Yet silent bow'd to _Christ's no kingdom here_.\r\n  Who sat the nearest, by the words o'ercome,\r\n  Slept first; the distant nodded to the hum;\r\n  Then down are roll'd the books, stretch'd o'er 'em lies\r\n  Each gentle clerk, and mutt'ring seals his eyes.\r\n  As what a Dutchman plumps into the lakes,\r\n  One circle first, and then a second makes;\r\n  What dulness dropt among her sons imprest,\r\n  Like motion from one circle to the rest:\r\n  So from the midmost the nutation spreads,\r\n  Round and more round, o'er all the _sea of heads_.\r\n  At last Centlivre felt her voice to fail,\r\n  Motteux himself unfinish'd left his tale.\r\n  Boyer the state, and Law the stage gave o'er,\r\n  Morgan and Mandeville could prate no more;\r\n  Norton from Daniel and Ostroea sprung,\r\n  Bless'd with his father's front and mother's tongue,\r\n  Hung silent down his never-blushing head,\r\n  And all was hush'd, as Folly's self lay dead.\r\n    \"Thus the soft gifts of Sleep conclude the day,\r\n  And stretch'd on bulks, as usual, poets lay.\r\n  Why should I sing what bards the nightly Muse\r\n  Did slumb'ring visit, and convey to stews;\r\n  Who prouder march'd, with magistrates in state,\r\n  To some fam'd round-house, ever-open gate!\r\n  How Henley lay inspir'd beside a sink,\r\n  And to mere mortals seem'd a priest in drink:\r\n  While others, timely, to the neighb'ring Fleet\r\n  (Haunt of the Muses) made their safe retreat.\"\r\n\r\nUlysses and AEneas presented themselves alive and in the body, as\r\nvisitors in the land of departed souls. A descent to the shades is not\r\nwanting in our Epos. It fills the whole Third Book. But our poet again\r\nmanages a discreet difference in his imitation. Our Dunce hero visits\r\nElysium _in a dream_; whilst he sleeps, his head recumbent on the lap of\r\nthe goddess, in the innermost recess of her sanctuary. His vision\r\nresembles the Trojan's rather than the Greek's adventure. \"A slipshod\r\nsibyl,\"\r\n\r\n\"In lofty madness meditating song,\r\n\r\nleads him. She seems to be typical of the half-crazed human poetess, in\r\nusual sublime dishabille. Venerable shades of the Dull greet him. As in\r\nVirgil's Elysian fields a glimpse is afforded into the dark philosophy\r\nof human existence, and we see the Lethean bank crowded with spirits,\r\nwho taste and become prepared to live again--so here. And as AEneas finds\r\nAnchises engaged in taking cognizance of the ghosts that are to animate\r\nRoman bodies, so here Cibber sees a great Patriarch of Dulness, Bavius,\r\n(him of old classical renown,) dipping in Lethe the souls that are to be\r\nborn dull upon the earth. The poet cannot resist a slight deviation from\r\nthe doctrine of his original. By the ancient theory the Lethean dip\r\nextinguishes the memory of a past life, of its faults, and of their\r\npunishment; and thence the willingness to inhabit the gross, earthy\r\nframe, as generated anew. But the dip of Bavius is more powerful; it\r\nquenches the faculties that are innate in a spirit, fitting it\r\n\r\n  \"for a skull\r\n  Of solid proof, impenetrably dull.\"\r\n\r\nThe subterranean traveller then falls in with the ghost of Elkanah\r\nSettle, who properly represents Anchises, and expounds the glories of\r\nthe Kingdom of Dulness. Something is borrowed also from the vision of\r\nAdam, in the Eleventh Book of _Paradise Lost_. And something is\r\noriginal; for that which has been is declared as well as that which\r\nshall be; and the kingdom of intellectual darkness to the earth's verge\r\ndisplayed in visible presentment, which the speaker interprets. The\r\nEmperor Chi Ho-am-ti, who ordered a universal conflagration of books\r\nthroughout his celestial dominions--the multitude of barbarous sons\r\nwhich the populous North poured from her frozen loins to sweep in deluge\r\naway the civilization of the South--figure here. Here is Attila with his\r\nHuns. Here is the Mussulman. Here is Rome of the dark ages. Great\r\nBritain appears last--the dulness which has blessed, which blesses, and\r\nwhich shall bless her. We extract the prophetical part. The visioned\r\nprogress of Dulness has reached the theatres; and some sixteen verses\r\nwhich contain--says Warton, well and truly--\"some of the most lively and\r\nforcible descriptions any where to be found, and are perfect pattern of\r\na clear picturesque style,\" call up into brilliant and startling\r\napparition the ineffable monstrosities and impossibilities which\r\nconstituted the theatrical spectacles of the day. The sight extorts the\r\nopening exclamation--\r\n\r\n  \"What pow'r, he cries, what pow'r these wonders wrought?\r\n  Son, what thou seek'st is in thee! look and find\r\n  Each monster meets his likeness in thy mind.\r\n  Yet would'st thou more? in yonder cloud behold,\r\n  Whose sarsenet skirts are edg'd with flamy gold,\r\n  A matchless youth! his nod these worlds controls,\r\n  Wings the red lightning, and the thunder rolls.\r\n  Angel of Dulness, sent to scatter round\r\n  Her magic harms o'er all unclassic ground:\r\n  Yon' stars, yon' suns, he rears at pleasure higher,\r\n  Illumes their light, and sets their flames on fire.\r\n  Immortal Rich! how calm he sits at ease,\r\n  Midst snows of paper, and fierce hail of pease!\r\n  And proud his mistress' orders to perform,\r\n  Rides in the whirlwind, and directs the storm.\r\n    \"But lo! to dark encounter in mid air\r\n  New wizards rise; I see my Cibber there!\r\n  Booth in his cloudy tabernacle shrin'd,\r\n  On grinning dragons thou shalt mount the wind.\r\n  Dire is the conflict, dismal is the din,\r\n  Here shouts all Drury, there all Lincoln's Inn;\r\n  Contending theatres our empire raise,\r\n  Alike their labours, and alike their praise.\r\n    \"And are these wonders, Son, to thee unknown?\r\n  Unknown to thee! these wonders are thy own.\r\n  These Fate reserv'd to grace thy reign divine,\r\n  Foreseen by me, but, ah! withheld from mine.\r\n  In Lud's old walls, though long I rul'd, renown'd\r\n  Far as loud Bow's stupendous bells resound;\r\n  Though my own aldermen conferr'd the bays,\r\n  To me committing their eternal praise,\r\n  Their full-fed heroes, their pacific may'rs,\r\n  Their annual trophies, and their monthly wars:\r\n  Though long my party built on me their hopes,\r\n  For writing pamphlets, and for roasting Popes;\r\n  Yet lo! in me what authors have to brag on!\r\n  Reduc'd at last to hiss in my own dragon.\r\n  Avert in Heav'n! that thou, my Cibber, e'er\r\n  Shouldst wag a serpent-tail in Smithfield fair!\r\n  Like the vile straw that's blown about the streets,\r\n  The needy poet sticks to all he meets;\r\n  Coach'd, carted, trod upon, now loose, now fast,\r\n  And carry'd off in some dog's tail at last.\r\n  Happier thy fortunes! like a rolling stone,\r\n  Thy giddy dulness still shall lumber on,\r\n  Safe in its heaviness, shall never stray,\r\n  But lick up ev'ry blockhead in the way.\r\n  Thee shall the Patriot, thee the Courtier taste,\r\n  And ev'ry year be duller than the last;\r\n  Till rais'd from booths, to theatre, to court,\r\n  Her seat imperial Dulness shall transport.\r\n  Already Opera prepares the way,\r\n  The sure forerunner of her gentle sway:\r\n  Let her thy heart, next drabs and dice, engage,\r\n  The third mad passion of thy doting age.\r\n  Teach thou the warring Polypheme to roar,\r\n  And scream thyself as none e'er scream'd before!\r\n  To aid our cause, if Heav'n thou canst not bend,\r\n  Hell thou shalt move; for Faustus is our friend;\r\n  Pluto with Cato, thou for this shalt join,\r\n  And link the Mourning Bride to Proserpine.\r\n  Grub Street! thy fall should men and gods conspire,\r\n  Thy stage shall stand, insure it but from fire.\r\n  Another AEschylus appears! prepare\r\n  For new abortions, all ye pregnant fair!\r\n  In flames like Semele's, be brought to bed,\r\n  While op'ning hell spouts wildfire at your head.\r\n    \"Now, Bavius, take the poppy from thy brow,\r\n  And place it here! here, all ye heroes, bow!\r\n    \"This, this is he, foretold by ancient rhymes:\r\n  Th' Augustus born to bring Saturnian times.\r\n  Signs following signs lead on the mighty year!\r\n  See! the dull stars roll round, and reappear.\r\n  See, see, our own true Phoebus wears the bays!\r\n  Our Midas sit Lord Chancellor of plays!\r\n  On poets' tombs see Benson's titles writ!\r\n  Lo! Ambrose Philips is preferr'd for wit!\r\n  See under Ripley rise a new Whitehall,\r\n  While Jones' and Boyle's united labours fall:\r\n  While Wren with sorrow to the grave descends,\r\n  Gay dies unpension'd, with a hundred friends;\r\n  Hibernian politics, O Swift! thy fate;\r\n  And Pope's, ten years to comment and translate.\r\n    \"Proceed, great days! 'till Learning fly the shore,\r\n  Till Birch shall blush with noble blood no more;\r\n  Till Thames see Eton's sons for ever play,\r\n  Till Westminster's whole year be holiday;\r\n  Till Isis' elders reel, their pupils' sport,\r\n  And Alma Mater lie dissolv'd in Port!\r\n    \"Enough! enough! the raptur'd Monarch cries!\r\n  And through the iv'ry gate the vision flies.\"\r\n\r\nIn Book Fourth the goddess occupies her throne. All the rebellious and\r\nhostile powers--wit, logic, rhetoric, morality, the muses--lie bound;\r\nand diverse votaries of Dulness successively move into presence. The\r\nfirst is OPERA, who puts Handel to flight. Then flow in a crowd of all\r\nsorts. A part have been described:--\r\n\r\n    \"Nor absent they, no members of her state,\r\n  Who pay her homage in her sons, the great;\r\n  Who false to Phoebus, bow the knee to Baal,\r\n  Or impious, preach his word without a call.\r\n  Patrons, who sneak from living worth to dead,\r\n  Withhold the pension, and set up the head;\r\n  Or vest dull Flattery in the sacred gown,\r\n  Or give from fool to fool the laurel crown;\r\n  And (last and worst) with all the cant of wit,\r\n  Without the soul, the Muse's hypocrite.\r\n    \"There march'd the bard and blockhead side by side,\r\n  Who rhym'd for hire, and patroniz'd for pride.\r\n  Narcissus, prais'd with all a parson's power,\r\n  Look'd a white lily sunk beneath a shower.\r\n  There mov'd Montalto with superior air:\r\n  His stretch'd out arm displayed a volume fair;\r\n  Courtiers and patriots in two ranks divide,\r\n  Through both he pass'd, and bow'd from side to side;\r\n  But as in graceful act, with awful eye,\r\n  Conpos'd he stood, bold Benson thrust him by:\r\n  On two unequal crutches props he came,\r\n  Milton's on this, on that one Jonson's name.\r\n  The decent Knight retir'd with sober rage,\r\n  Withdrew his hand, and clos'd the pompous page:\r\n  But (happy for him as the times went then)\r\n  Appear'd Apollo's may'r and aldermen,\r\n  On whom three hundred gold-capt youths await,\r\n  To lug the pond'rous volume off in state.\r\n  \"When Dulness, smiling--'Thus revive the wits!\r\n  But murder first, and mince them all to bits!\r\n  As erst Medea (cruel, so to save!)\r\n  A new edition of old AEson gave;\r\n  Let standard authors thus, like trophies borne,\r\n  Appear more glorious as more hack'd and torn.\r\n  And you my Critics! in the chequer'd shade,\r\n  Admire new light through holes yourselves have made.\r\n    \"'Leave not a foot of verse, a foot of stone,\r\n  A page, a grave, that they can call their own,\r\n  But spread, my sons, your glory thin or thick,\r\n  On passive paper, or on solid brick.\r\n  So by each bard an alderman shall sit,\r\n  A heavy lord shall hang at ev'ry wit,\r\n  And while on Fame's triumphal car they ride,\r\n  Some slave of mine be pinion'd to their side.'\"\r\n\r\nA dreadful figure appears--THE SCHOOLMASTER. He eulogizes the system of\r\neducation, which teaches nothing but words and verse-making.\r\n\r\n    \"A hundred head of Aristotle's friends\"\r\n\r\npour in from the colleges--Aristarchus (Richard Bentley) at their head.\r\nHe displays his own merits as a critic, and extols the system of\r\nteaching in the universities; but strides away disgusted on seeing\r\napproach a band of young gentlemen returned from their travels on the\r\nContinent, and accompanied by their travelling tutors and their\r\nmistresses. One of the tutors reports at large to the goddess on the\r\nstyle and advantages of their travels, and presents his own pupil. Where\r\nis such another passage to be found in English poetry? It surpasses\r\nCowper's celebrated strain on the same subject.\r\n\r\n    \"In flow'd at once a gay embroider'd race,\r\n  And titt'ring push'd the pedants off the place:\r\n  Some would have spoken, but the voice was drown'd\r\n  By the French horn, or by the op'ning hound.\r\n  The first came forwards with as easy mien,\r\n  As if he saw St James's and the Queen.\r\n  When thus the attendant Orator begun;\r\n  Receive, great Empress! thy accomplish'd son:\r\n  Thine from the birth, and sacred from the rod,\r\n  A dauntless infant! never scar'd with God.\r\n  The sire saw, one by one, his virtues wake;\r\n  The mother begg'd the blessing of a rake.\r\n  Thou gav'st that ripeness which so soon began,\r\n  And ceas'd so soon, he ne'er was boy nor man;\r\n  Through school and college, thy kind cloud o'ercast,\r\n  Safe and unseen the young AEneas past;\r\n  Thence bursting glorious, all at once let down,\r\n  Stunn'd with his giddy larum half the town.\r\n  Intrepid then, o'er seas and lands he flew;\r\n  Europe he saw, and Europe saw him too.\r\n  There all thy gifts and graces we display,\r\n  Thou, only thou, directing all our way!\r\n  To where the Seine, obsequious as she runs,\r\n  Pours at great Bourbon's feet her silken sons;\r\n  Or Tiber, now no longer Roman, rolls,\r\n  Vain of Italian arts, Italian souls:\r\n  To happy convents, bosom'd deep in vines,\r\n  Where slumber abbots, purple as their wines;\r\n  To isles of fragrance, lily silver'd vales,\r\n  Diffusing languor in the panting gales:\r\n  To lands of singing, or of dancing slaves,\r\n  Love-whisp'ring woods, and lute-resounding waves.\r\n  But chief her shrine where naked Venus keeps,\r\n  And Cupids ride the Lion of the deeps;\r\n  Where, eas'd of fleets, the Adriatic main\r\n  Wafts the smooth eunuch and enamour'd swain.\r\n  Led by my hand, he saunter'd Europe round,\r\n  And gather'd ev'ry vice on Christian ground;\r\n  Saw ev'ry court, heard ev'ry king declare\r\n  His royal sense, of op'ras or the fair;\r\n  The stews and palace equally explor'd,\r\n  Intrigu'd with glory, and with spirit whor'd;\r\n  Tried all _hors d'oeuvres_, all _liqueurs_ defin'd,\r\n  Judicious drank, and greatly-daring din'd;\r\n  Dropt the dull lumber of the Latin store,\r\n  Spoil'd his own language, and acquir'd no more;\r\n  All classic learning lost on classic ground;\r\n  And last turn'd Air, the echo of a sound!\r\n  See now, half-cur'd, and perfectly well-bred,\r\n  With nothing but a solo in his head;\r\n  As much estate, and principle, and wit,\r\n  As Jansen, Fleetwood, Cibber shall think fit;\r\n  Stol'n from a duel, follow'd by a nun,\r\n  And, if a borough choose him, not undone;\r\n  See, to my country happy I restore\r\n  This glorious youth, and add one Venus more.\r\n  Her too receive, (for her my soul adores,)\r\n  So may the sons of sons of sons of whores,\r\n  Prop thine, O Empress! like each neighbour throne,\r\n  And make a long posterity thy own.\r\n  Pleas'd she accepts the hero, and the dame\r\n  Wraps in her veil, and frees from sense of shame.\"\r\n\r\nA set of pure idlers appear loitering about. Annius, an antiquary, begs\r\nto have them made over to him, to turn into virtuosos. Mummius, another\r\nantiquary, quarrels with him, and the goddess reconciles them. The\r\nminute naturalists follow \"thick as locusts.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Each with some wondrous gift approach'd the Power,\r\n    A nest, a toad, a fungus, or a flower.\"\r\n\r\nA florist lodges a heavy complaint against an entomologist. The singular\r\nbeauty of the pleading on both sides has often been noticed, and by the\r\nbest critics, from Thomas Gray to Thomas De Quincey.\r\n\r\n    \"The first thus open'd: Hear thy suppliant's call,\r\n  Great Queen, and common mother of us all!\r\n  Fair from its humble bed I rear'd this flow'r,\r\n  Suckl'd, and cheer'd with air, and sun, and show'r,\r\n  Soft on the paper ruff its leaves I spread,\r\n  Bright with the gilded button tipt its head.\r\n  Then thron'd in glass, and nam'd it Caroline:\r\n  Each maid cry'd, Charming; and each youth, Divine!\r\n  Did Nature's pencil ever blend such rays,\r\n  Such vary'd light in one promiscuous blaze?\r\n  Now prostrate! dead! behold that Caroline:\r\n  No maid cries charming! and no youth divine!\r\n  And lo the wretch! whose vile, whose insect lust\r\n  Laid this gay daughter of the Spring in dust,\r\n  Oh punish him, or to th' Elysian shades\r\n  Dismiss my soul, where no carnation fades.\r\n  He ceas'd, and wept. With innocence of mien\r\n  The accus'd stood forth, and thus address'd the Queen:\r\n    \"Of all th' enamel'd race, whose silv'ry wing\r\n  Waves to the tepid zephyrs of the spring,\r\n  Or swims along the fluid atmosphere,\r\n  Once brightest shin'd this child of heat and air.\r\n  I saw, and started from its vernal bow'r\r\n  The rising game, and chas'd from flow'r to flow'r.\r\n  It fled, I follow'd, now in hope, now pain;\r\n  It stopt, I stopt; it mov'd, I mov'd again.\r\n  At last it fixed, 'twas on what plant it pleas'd,\r\n  And where it fixed, the beauteous bird I seiz'd:\r\n  Rose, or carnation, was below my care;\r\n  I meddle, Goddess! only in my sphere.\r\n  I tell the naked feet without disguise,\r\n  And, to excuse it, need but show the prize;\r\n  Whose spoils this paper offers to our eye,\r\n  Fair ev'n death! this peerless butterfly.\"\r\n\r\nThe mighty mother cannot find it in her heart to pronounce a decision\r\nwhich must aggrieve one of such a devoted pair. She extols them both,\r\nand makes over to their joint care and tuition the _faineants_\r\naforesaid. The subject leads her into a more serious strain of thinking.\r\nThere is an evident danger; for the studies which she recommends are\r\nstudies of nature, and the study of nature tends to rise out of nature.\r\nThe goddess, accordingly, is strenuous in cautioning her followers to\r\nkeep within the pale of trifles, and of the sensible. The suggestion of\r\nthe hazard fires a clerk, a metaphysician, who, on the behalf of the\r\nmetaphysicians, undertakes for a theology that shall effectually shut\r\nout and keep down religion. Gordon, the translator of Tacitus, and\r\npublisher of the irreligious \"Independent Whig,\" being mentioned by the\r\norator of the metaphysicians with praise, under the name of Silenus,\r\nrises and advances, leading up, apparently, the Young England of the\r\nday. He presents them as liberated from priest-craft, and ready for\r\ndrinking the cup of a \"Wizard old,\" attached to the suite of the\r\ngoddess. This \"Magus\" extends to them the cup of self-love.\r\n\r\n    \"Which whoso tastes, forgets his former friends,\r\n    Sire, ancestors, HIMSELF.\"\r\n\r\nThere is philosophy enough in the last piece of oblivion.\r\n\r\nImpudence, pure mild Stupidity, Self-conceit, Interest, the\r\nAccomplishment of Singing, under the auspicious smile of the goddess,\r\ntake possession, sundrily, of her children; and the two great arts of\r\nGastronomia, scientific Eating and Drinking.\r\n\r\nThe Queen confers her titles and degrees, assisted by the two\r\nuniversities. She then dismisses the assembly with a solemn charge:--\r\n\r\n    \"Then, blessing all, Go, children of my care!\r\n  To _practice_ now from _theory_ repair.\r\n  All my commands are easy, short, and full;\r\n  My sons! be proud, be selfish, and be dull.\r\n  Guard my prerogative, assert my throne:\r\n  This nod confirms each privilege your own.\r\n  The cap and switch be sacred to his Grace;\r\n  With staff and pumps the Marquis leads the race;\r\n  From stage to stage the licens'd Earl may run,\r\n  Pair'd with his fellow-charioteer, the Sun;\r\n  The learned Baron butterflies design,\r\n  Or draw to silk Arachne's subtle line;\r\n  The Judge to dance his brother sergeant call!\r\n  The Senator at cricket urge the ball;\r\n  The Bishop stow (pontific luxury!)\r\n  An hundred souls of turkeys in a pie;\r\n  The sturdy Squire to Gallic masters stoop,\r\n  And drown his lands and manors in a soup.\r\n  Others import yet nobler arts from France,\r\n  Teach kings to fiddle, and make senates dance.\r\n  Perhaps more high some daring son may soar,\r\n  Proud to my list to add one monarch more;\r\n  And, nobly conscious, princes are but things\r\n  Born for first ministers, as slaves for kings,\r\n  Tyrant supreme! shall three estates command,\r\n  _And make one mighty Dunciad of the land_!\r\n    \"More she had spoke, but yawn'd--All Nature nods:\r\n    What mortal can resist the yawn of gods?\r\n  Churches and Chapels instantly it reach'd;\r\n  (St James's first, for leaden G---- preach'd;)\r\n  Then catch'd the Schools; the Hall scarce kept awake;\r\n  The Convocation gap'd, but could not speak:\r\n  Lost was the Nation's sense, nor could be found,\r\n  While the long solemn unison went round: Wide, and\r\n  more wide, it spread o'er all the realm;\r\n  Ev'n Palinurus nodded at the helm;\r\n  The vapour mild o'er each Committee crept;\r\n  Unfinish'd treaties in each office slept;\r\n  And chiefless Armies doz'd out the campaign;\r\n  And Navies yawn'd for orders on the main.\r\n    \"O Muse! relate, (for you can tell alone,\r\n  Wits have short memories, and dunces none,)\r\n  Relate who first, who last, resign'd to rest;\r\n  Whose heads she partly, whose completely blest,\r\n  What charms could faction, what ambition lull,\r\n  The venal quiet, and intrance the dull;\r\n  Till drown'd was Sense and Shame, and Right and Wrong--\r\n  O sing, and hush the nations with thy song!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  In vain, in vain--the all-composing hour\r\n  Resistless falls; the Muse obeys the pow'r.\r\n  She comes! she comes! the sable throne behold\r\n  Of Night primeval, and of Chaos old!\r\n  Before her fancy's gilded clouds decay,\r\n  And all its varying rainbows die away.\r\n  Wit shoots in vain its momentary fires,\r\n  The meteor drops, and in a flash expires.\r\n  As one by one, at dread Medea's strain,\r\n  The sick'ning stars fade off the ethereal plain;\r\n  As Argus's eyes, by Hermes' wand opprest,\r\n  Clos'd one by one to everlasting rest,\r\n  Thus at her felt approach, and secret might,\r\n  Art after Art goes out, and all is night.\r\n  See skulking Truth to her old cavern fled,\r\n  Mountains of Casuistry heap'd o'er her head!\r\n  Philosophy, that lean'd on Heav'n before,\r\n  Shrinks to her second cause, and is no more.\r\n  Physic of Metaphysic begs defence,\r\n  And Metaphysic calls for aid on Sense!\r\n  See Mystery to Mathematics fly!\r\n  In vain! they gaze, turn giddy, rave, and die.\r\n  Religion, blushing, veils her sacred fires,\r\n  And unawares Morality expires.\r\n  Nor public flame, nor private, dares to shine;\r\n  Nor human spark is left, nor glimpse Divine;\r\n  Lo! thy dread empire, Chaos! is restor'd;\r\n  Light dies before thy uncreating word:\r\n  Thy hand, great Anarch! lets the curtain fall;\r\n  And universal Darkness buries All.\"\r\n\r\nMr Bowles, himself a true poet, thinks the Fourth Book the best. \"The\r\nobjects of satire,\" he says, \"are more general and just: the one is\r\nconfined to persons, and those of the most insignificant sort; the other\r\nis directed chiefly to things, such as faults of education, false\r\nhabits, and false taste. In polished and pointed satire, in richness of\r\nversification and imagery, and in the happy introduction of characters,\r\nspeeches, figures, and every sort of poetical ornament adapted to the\r\nsubject, this Book yields, in my opinion, to none of Pope's writings of\r\nthe same kind.\" Excellently well said. But what inconsistency in saying,\r\nat the same time, \"These observations of Dr Warton are, in general, very\r\njust and sensible.\" And again, \"I by no means _think so meanly_ of it as\r\nDr Warton.\" Meanly, indeed! Why, he has just told us he thinks it equal\r\nto any thing of the same kind Pope ever wrote. But the distinguished\r\nWintonian chose to speak nonsense, rather than speak harshly of old Joe.\r\nWhat are Dr Warton's \"in general very just and sensible observations?\"\r\n\"Our poet was persuaded by Dr Warburton, unhappily enough, to add a\r\nFourth Book to his finished piece, of such a very different cast and\r\ncolour, as to render it at last one of the most motley compositions\r\nthere is, perhaps, any where to be found in the works of so exact a\r\nwriter as Pope. For one great purpose of this Fourth Book (where, by the\r\nway, the hero does nothing at all) was to satirize and proscribe\r\ninfidels and freethinkers, to leave the ludicrous for the serious, Grub\r\nStreet for theology, the mock-heroic for metaphysics--which occasion a\r\nmarvellous mixture and jumble of images and sentiments, pantomime and\r\nphilosophy, journals and moral evidence, Fleet Ditch and the High Priori\r\nroad, Curl and Clarke.\" That reads like a bit of a prize-essay by a\r\nbachelor of arts in the \"College of the Goddess in the City.\" The\r\n_Dunciad_ is rendered not only a motley, but, perhaps, the most motley\r\ncomposition of an exact writer, by a Book added to it when it was in a\r\nstate of perfection--for as a Poem in Three Books, \"it was clear,\r\nconsistent, and of a piece.\" This is not the way to make a poem motley,\r\nnor a man. \"Motley's the suit I wear,\" might have taught the Doctor\r\nbetter. They who don't like the Fourth Book can stop at the end of the\r\nThird, and then the Poem is motley no more. It is in a higher strain\r\nthan the Three, and why not? The goddess had a greater empire than\r\nWarton, who was a provincial, had ever dreamt of in his philosophy; but,\r\nin Pope's wide imagination, it stood with all its realms. The hero had\r\nno more to say or to do--Cibber was banished to Cimmeria for life, to\r\nwork in the mines--and Dulness had forgotten she ever saw his face.\r\n\r\n  \"Then rose the seed of Chaos, and of Night,\r\n  To blot out order, and extinguish light,\r\n  Of dull and venal a new world to mould,\r\n  And bring Saturnian days of lead and gold.\"\r\n\r\nThat long clumsy sentence about \"a marvellous mixture and jumble of\r\nimages and sentiments,\" &c. &c. &c., is pure nonsense. In itself, the\r\nFourth Book is most harmoniously constructed as a work of art, and it\r\nrises out of, and ascends from the Third, a completed creation. To call\r\nthat YAWN mock-heroic, would be profane--it is sublime!\r\n\r\n\"Speaking of the _Dunciad_,\" continues the Doctor, \"as a work of art, in\r\na critical, not religious light, I must venture to affirm, that the\r\nsubject of this Fourth Book was foreign and heterogeneous, and the\r\naddition of it is injudicious, ill-placed, and incongruous, as any of\r\nthose similar images we meet with in Pulci or Ariosto.\" The addition of\r\na Fourth Book to a poem, previously consisting of Three, is not an image\r\nat all, look at it how you will, and cannot therefore be compared with\r\n\"any of those dissimilar images we meet with in Pulci or Ariosto.\" We\r\nmuch admire Pulci and Ariosto, especially Ariosto, but they and their\r\ndissimilar images have no business here; and were Dr Joseph alive any\r\nwhere in the neighbourhood, we should whistle in his ear not to be so\r\nostentatious in displaying his Italian literature, which was too thin to\r\nkeep out the rain.\r\n\r\n\"It is,\" he keeps stuttering on, \"like introducing a crucifix into one\r\nof Teniers's burlesque conversation pieces.\" We see no reason why a\r\ncrucifix should not be in the room of a good Catholic during a burlesque\r\nconversation; and Teniers, if he never have, might have painted one in\r\nsuch a piece without offence, had he chosen to do so; but the question\r\nwe ask, simply is, what did Doctor Joseph Warton mean? Just nothing at\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\"On the whole,\" stammereth the Doctor further on, \"the chief fault of\r\nthe _Dunciad_ is the violence and vehemence of its satire.\" The same\r\nfault may be found with vitriolic acid, nay, with Richardson's Ultimate\r\nResult. No doubt, that for many domestic purposes water is\r\npreferable--for not a few, milk--and for some, milk and water. But not\r\nwith that latter amalgam did Hannibal force his way through the Alps.\r\n\r\nBut, softly--the Doctor compares the violence and vehemence of Pope's\r\nsatire--no--not the violence and vehemence, but the height--to\r\nwater--but to water rare among the liquid elements. \"And the excessive\r\nheight to which it is carried, and which therefore I may compare to that\r\nmarvellous column of boiling water near Mount Hecla in Iceland, thrown\r\nupwards, _above ninety feet_, by the force of subterraneous fire.\" And\r\nhe adds in a note, to please the incredulous, \"Sir Joseph Banks, our\r\ngreat philosophical traveller, had the satisfaction of seeing this\r\nwonderful phenomenon.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are the impressions,\" eloquently asks the inspired Joseph \"left\r\nupon the mind after a perusal of this poem? Contempt, aversion vexation,\r\nand anger. No sentiments that enlarge, ennoble, move, or mend the heart!\r\nInsomuch so, that I know a person whose name would be an ornament to\r\nthese papers, if I were suffered to insert it, who, after reading a book\r\nof the _Dunciad_, always soothes himself, as he calls it, by turning to\r\na canto of the _Faery Queene_.\" There is no denying that satire is apt\r\nto excite the emotions the Doctor complains of, and few more strongly\r\nthan the _Dunciad_. Yet what would it be without them--and what should\r\nwe be? But other emotions, too, are experienced at some of the games;\r\nand some of an exalted kind, by innumerable passages throughout the\r\npoem. Were it not so, this would be a saturnine world indeed. Would we\r\nhave had the name of the wise gentleman, that it might ornament these\r\npapers, who so frequently indulged in \"contempt, aversion, vexation, and\r\nanger\" over Pope, that he might soothe himself, as he called it, with\r\nSpenser. We wonder if he occasionally left the bosom of the _Faery\r\nQueene_ for that of the Goddess of Dulness.\r\n\r\n\"This is not the case with that very delightful poem _Mac-Flecnoe_, from\r\nwhich Pope has borrowed many hints and images and ideas. But Dryden's\r\npoem was the offspring of contempt, and Pope's of indignation; one is\r\nfull of mirth, and the other of malignity. A vein of pleasantry is\r\nuniformly preserved through the whole of _Mac-Flecnoe_, and the piece\r\nbegins and ends in the same key.\" That very beautiful and delightful\r\npoem, _Mac-Flecnoe!_ That very pretty and agreeable waterfall, Niagara!\r\nThat very elegant and attractive crater of Mount Vesuvius! That very\r\ninteresting and animated earthquake, vulgarly called the Great\r\nEarthquake at Lisbon! Having ourselves spoken of the good-humour of\r\nDryden, (some twenty pages back, about the middle of this article,) we\r\nmust not find fault with Warton for saying that a vein of pleasantry is\r\npreserved through the whole of _Mac-Flecnoe_; but what thought\r\nMac-Flecnoe himself? \"Ay, there's the rub.\" Then what a vein of\r\npleasantry is preserved through the whole of _Og_! So light and delicate\r\nis the handling, that you might be charmed into the soft delusion, that\r\nyou beheld Christopher with his Knout.\r\n\r\n\"Since the total decay,\" innocently exclaims this estimable man, \"was\r\nforetold in the _Dunciad_, how many very excellent pieces of criticism,\r\npoetry, history, philosophy, and divinity, have appeared in this\r\ncountry, and to what a degree of perfection has almost every art, either\r\nuseful or elegant, been carried?\" Mr Bowles--_mirabile dictu_--backs his\r\nold schoolmaster against the goddess. \"Can it be thought,\" says the\r\nCanon--standing up for the age of Pope himself--\"that this period was\r\nenlightened by Young, Thomson, Glover, and many whose characters\r\nreflected equal lustre on religion, morals, and philosophy? But such is\r\nsatire, when it is not guided by truth.\" All this might have been said\r\nin fewer words--\"LOOK AT BLACKWOOD'S MAGAZINE.\" There is not, in the\r\n_Dunciad_ itself, an instance of such stupidity recorded, as this\r\nindignant attribution of blindness to the present, and to the future,\r\n\"as far off its coming shone,\" to \"the seed of Chaos and old night,\" by\r\ntwo divines, editors both of the works of Alexander Pope, Esq. in eight\r\n(?) and in ten volumes.\r\n\r\nLord Kames, in his _Elements of Criticism_, urges an objection to the\r\nopening of the _Dunciad_, which, if sustained, is sufficient to prove\r\nthe whole poem vicious on beginning to end. \"This author (Pope) is\r\nguilty of much greater deviation from the rule. Dulness may be imagined\r\na Deity or Idol, to be worshipped by bad writers; but then some sort of\r\ndisguise is requisite, some bastard virtue must be bestowed, to give\r\nthis Idol a plausible appearance. Yet, in the _Dunciad_, Dulness,\r\nwithout the least disguise, is made the object of worship. The mind\r\nrejects such a fiction as unnatural.\" Warburton meets this objection\r\nwith his usual _fierte_ and acumen. \"But is there no bastard virtue in\r\nthe mighty Mother of so numerous an offspring, which she takes care to\r\nbring to the ears of kings? Her votaries would, for this single virtue,\r\nprefer her influence to Apollo and the Nine Muses. Is there no bastard\r\nvirtue in the peace of which the poet makes her the author?--'The\r\ngoddess bade Britannia sleep.' Is she not celebrated for her beauty,\r\nanother bastard virtue?--'Fate this _fair_ idol gave.' One bastard\r\nvirtue the poet hath given her; which, with these sort of critics, might\r\nmake her pass for a wit; and that is, her love of a joke--'For gentle\r\nDulness ever loved a joke.' Her delight in games and races is another of\r\nher bastard virtues, which would captivate her nobler sons, and draw\r\nthem to her shrine; not to speak of her indulgence to young travellers,\r\nwhom she accompanies as Minerva did Telemachus. But of all her bastard\r\nvirtues, her FREE-THINKING, the virtue which she anxiously propagates\r\namongst her followers in the Fourth Book, might, one would think, have\r\nbeen sufficient to have covered the poet from this censure. But had Mr\r\nPope drawn her without the least disguise, it had not signified a rush.\r\nDisguised or undisguised, the poem had been neither better nor worse,\r\nand he has secured it from being rejected as unnatural by ten thousand\r\nbeauties of nature.\" This is too Warburtonian--and Lord Kames must be\r\nanswered after another fashion, by Christopher North.\r\n\r\nWhat would his lordship have? That she should be called by some other\r\nmore specious name? By that of some quality to which writers and other\r\nmen do aspire, and under the semblance of which Dulness is actually\r\nfound to mask itself--as Gravity, Dignity, Solemnity? Why, two losses\r\nwould thus be incurred. First, the whole mirth of the poem, or the\r\ngreater part of it, would be gone. Secondly, the comprehensiveness of\r\nthe present name would be forfeited, and a more partial quality taken.\r\n\r\nThe vigour and strength of the fiction requires exactly what Pope has\r\ndone--the barefaced acceptance of Dulness as the imperial power. The\r\npoet acts, in fact, under a logical necessity. She is really the goddess\r\nunder whose influence and virtue they, her subjects, live; whose\r\ninspiration sustains and governs their actions. But it would be against\r\nall manners that a goddess should not be known and worshipped under her\r\nown authentic denomination. To cheat her followers out of their worship,\r\nby showing herself to them under a diversity of false appearances, would\r\nhave been unworthy of her divinity.\r\n\r\nAs to the probability of the fiction, the answer is plain and ready.\r\nNobody asks for probability. Far otherwise. The bravery of the jest is\r\nits improbability. There is a wild audacity proper to the burlesque Epos\r\nwhich laughs at conventional rules, and the tame obligations of ordinary\r\npoetry. The absurd is one legitimate source of the comic.\r\n\r\nFor example, are the GAMES probable? Take the reading to sleep--which is\r\npurely witty--a thing which the poet does not go out of his way to\r\ninvent. It lies essentially on the theme, being a literary ~agon~; and\r\nit is indeed only that which is continually done, (oh, us miserable!)\r\nthrown into poetical shape. But it is perfectly absurd and improbable,\r\ndone in the manner in which it is represented--not therefore to be\r\nblamed, but therefore to be commended with cachinnation while the world\r\nendures.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that the Dunces are there, not for the business of saying\r\nwhat they think of themselves, or not that alone, but they must say that\r\nwhich we think of them. They must act from motives from which men do not\r\nact. They must aspire to be dull, and be proud of their dulness. They\r\nmust emulate one another's dulness, or they are unfaithful votaries. In\r\nshort, they are poetically made, and should be so made, to do,\r\nconsciously and purposely, that which, in real life, they do\r\nundesignedly and unawares.\r\n\r\nLord Kames goes wrong--and very far wrong indeed--though Warburton was\r\nnot the man to set him right--through applying to a composition\r\nextravagantly conceived--an epic extravaganza--rules of writing that\r\nbelong to a sober and guarded species. In a comedy, you make a man play\r\nthe fool without his knowing that he is one; because that is an\r\nimitation of human manners. And if you ironically praise the virtues of\r\na villain, you keep the veil of irony throughout. You do not now and\r\nthen forget yourself, and call him a villain by that name. But the\r\nspirit and rule of the poem here is, that discretion and sobriety are\r\nthrown aside. Here is no imitation of manners--no veil. The persons of\r\nthe poem, under the hand of the poet, are something in the condition of\r\nthe wicked ghosts who come before the tribunal of the Gnossian\r\nRhadamanthus; and whom he, by the divine power of his judgment-seat,\r\nconstrains to bear witness against themselves. The poor ghosts do it,\r\nknowing that they condemn themselves. Here the mirth of the poet makes\r\nthe Dull glorify themselves by recounting each misdeed under its proper\r\nappellation.\r\n\r\nJoseph Warton mistakes the whole matter as much as Lord Kames. \"Just\r\ncriticism,\" says he, \"calls on us also to point out some of the passages\r\nthat appear exceptionable in the _Dunciad_. Such is the hero's first\r\nspeech, in which, contrary to all decorum and probability, he addresses\r\nthe goddess Dulness, without disguising her as a despicable being, and\r\neven calls himself fool and blockhead. For a person to be introduced\r\nspeaking thus of himself, is in truth unnatural and out of character.\"\r\nWould that the Doctor had been alive to be set at ease on this point by\r\nour explanations--but he is dead. They would have quieted his mind, too,\r\nabout the celebrated speech of Aristarchus. \"In Book IV.,\" he adds, \"is\r\nsuch another breach of truth and decorum, in making Aristarchus\r\n(Bentley) abuse _himself_, and laugh at his _own_ labours.\r\n\r\n  \"The mighty scholiast, whose unweary'd pains\r\n  Made Horace dull, and humbled Maro's strains,\r\n  Turn what they will to verse, their toil is vain,\r\n  Critics like me shall make it prose again.\r\n  For Attic phrase in Plato let them seek,\r\n  I poach in Suidas for unlicens'd Greek.\r\n  For thee we dim the eyes, and stuff the head\r\n  With all such reading as was never read:\r\n  For thee explain a thing till all men doubt it,\r\n  And write about it, Goddess, and about it.\"\r\n\r\nIf Bentley has turned Horace and Milton (Warton blunderingly reads Maro)\r\ninto prose by his emendations, (Milton assuredly he has--Pope may be\r\nwrong about Horace?) he has rendered vast service to the empire of\r\nDulness; and it would be quite unreasonable that he should not claim of\r\nthe goddess all merited reward and honour, by announcing exactly this\r\nachievement. With what face could he pretend to her favour by telling\r\nher that he had restored the text of two great poets to its original\r\npurity and lustre? She would have ordered him to instant execution or to\r\na perpetual dungeon.\r\n\r\nFinally, how happened it that such perspicacious personages as Lord\r\nKames and Dr Warton, to say nothing of their hoodwinked followers,\r\nshould have thus objected to the passages and speeches singled out for\r\ncondemnation, as if they alone deserved it, without perceiving that the\r\nwhole poem, from the first line to the last, was, on their principle,\r\nliable to the same fatal objection? And what, on their principle, would\r\nthey have thought, had they ever read it, of _Mac-Flecnoe_?\r\n\r\nPope takes the name Dulness largely, for the offuscation of heart and\r\nhead. He said, long before,\r\n\r\n    \"Want of decency is want of _sense_;\"\r\n\r\nand he now seems to think himself warranted in attributing vices and\r\ncorruptions to a clouded understanding--so to Dulness. At least, the\r\ndarkness and weakness of the moral reason came under the protection of\r\nthe mighty mother--the daughter of Chaos and of Night. She fosters the\r\ndisorder and the darkness of the soul. Mere bluntness and inertness of\r\nintellect, which the name would suggest, he never confines himself to.\r\nOf sharp misused power of mind, too, she is the tutelary goddess. Errors\r\nwhich mind arrives at by too much subtlety, by self-blinding activity,\r\nserve her purpose and the poet's; and so some names of powerful\r\nintellects are included, which, on a question of their merits, indeed,\r\nhad better been left out. So the science of mathematics, far\r\noverstepping, as the poet conceives, the boundary of its legitimate\r\nactivity--\r\n\r\n    \"Mad Mathesis alone----\r\n    Now running round the circle, finds it square.\"\r\n\r\nThe real foe of Dulness, then, is Truth--not simply wit or genius. The\r\nnight of mind is all that Dulness labours to produce. Misdirected wit\r\nand genius help on this consummation, and therefore deserve her\r\nsmile--all the more that they are her born enemies, turned traitors to\r\ntheir native cause; and most formidable enemies too, had they remained\r\nfaithful. Needs must she load them with dignity and emoluments. Trace\r\nthe thought. The poem begins from the real dull Dunces; and _their_\r\ngoddess is Dulness, inevitably: nothing can be gainsaid there. This is\r\nthe central origin. Go on. Pert or lively dunces, who are not real dull,\r\nwill come in of due course. And from that first foundation the poet may\r\nlawfully go on to bring in perverted intelligence and moral vitiation of\r\nthe soul. Reclining on our swing-chair--and waiting for the devil--with\r\nthe _AEneid_ in the one hand and the _Dunciad_ in the other, we have this\r\nmoment made a remarkable discovery in ancient and in modern classic\r\npoetry. Virgil, in his eighth book, tells us that the pious AEneas,\r\nhandling and examining with delight the glorious shield which the Sire\r\nof the Forge has fabricated for him, wonders to peruse, storied there in\r\nprophetical sculptures, the fates and exploits, and renown, of his\r\nearth-subduing descendants. In one of these fore-shadowing\r\nrepresentations--that of the decisive sea-fight off the promontory of\r\nActium--you might believe that, under the similitude of the conflict and\r\nvictory which delivered the sovereignty of the Roman world into the hand\r\nof Augustus, the sly Father of the Fire has willed by hints to prefigure\r\nan everlasting war of light and darkness, the irreconcilable hostility\r\nof the Wits and Dunces, and the sudden interposition of some divine\r\npoet, clothed with preternatural power, for the \"foul dissipation and\r\nforced rout\" of the miscreated multitude.\r\n\r\nThe foe, whose pretensions to the empire of the world are to be signally\r\ndefeated, advances to the combat--\"ope barbarica\"--helped with a\r\nconfederacy of barbarians. Queen Dulness herself is characteristically\r\ndescribed as heartening and harking forward her legions with pure\r\nnoise.\r\n\r\n    \"REGINA in mediis _patrio_ vocat agmina\r\n    sistro,\"\r\n\r\nthat is, rather with her father Chaos's drum, or the drum native to the\r\nland of Dulness. Either interpretation forcibly marks out the most\r\nturbulent and unintellectual of all musical instruments; and we think at\r\nonce of her mandate on a later day,\r\n\r\n  \"'Tis yours to shake the soul\r\n  With thunder rumbling, from the mustard-bowl.\"\r\n\r\nThe contending powers are presented under a bold allegory.\r\n\r\n    \"Omnigenumque Deum MONSTRA et LATRATOR Anubis,\r\n    Contra NEPTUNUM et Venerem, contraque Minervam,\r\n    Tela tenent.\"\r\n\r\nNeptune prefigures this island, the confessed ruler of the waves and the\r\nprecise spot of the globe vindicated, as we have seen, by two great\r\npoets from the reign of Dulness. Venus is here understood in her noblest\r\ncharacter, as the Alma Venus of Lucretius's invocation, as the Power of\r\nLove and the Beautiful in the Universe. The Goddess of Wisdom speaks for\r\nherself. Against them a heterogeneous rabble of monsters direct their\r\nartillery, under a dog-headed barking protagonist, (what a chosen symbol\r\nof an impudent, wide-mouthed, yelping Bayes!) the ringleader of the Cry\r\nof Dunces.\r\n\r\nBehold the striking and principal figure of the poet himself, armed and\r\nready to loose from his hand his unerring shafts.\r\n\r\n    \"Actius haec cernens arcum intendebat Apollo\r\n    Desuper.\"\r\n\r\nThe poet, impersonated in the patron god of all true poets, is high\r\nVirgilian; and the proud station and posture, and the godlike\r\nannihilating menace of that \"DESUPER\" is equally picturesque and\r\nsublime.\r\n\r\nThe same verse continued brings out the effect of the god's, or of the\r\npoet's interposition, in the instantaneous consternation and utter\r\nscattering of the rascal rout.\r\n\r\n    \"... Omnis eo terrore AEgyptus et Indus,\r\n    Omnis Arabs, omnes vertebant terga Saboei.\"\r\n\r\nThe entire progeny of barbarism are off, in full precipitation, for a\r\nplace of refuge, if harbour or haven may be had. Or, as the same\r\ninspired bard elsewhere has it--\"fugere ferae\"--the wild beasts have\r\nfled.\r\n\r\nThe triumph is complete. The panic seizes their imperial mistress\r\nherself, who, turning her prow, sweeps with all sails set from the lost\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n    \"Ipsa videbatur ventis REGINA vocatis\r\n    Vela dare et laxos jam jamque immittere funes;\r\n    Illam inter caedes, pallentem morte futura,\r\n    Fecerat Ignipotens undis et Iapyge ferri.\"\r\n\r\nAnd why is Augustus made Victor? Does not his name stand, to all time,\r\nas the emperor of good letters? Is an Augustan age a less precise and\r\npotential phrase for a golden age of the arts, than a Saturnian age for\r\nthe same of the virtues? And why is Antony beaten? Surely, because he\r\nrepresents the collective Antony-Lumpkinism of literature. And what has\r\nthe dear Cleopatra to do in the fight? The meretricious gipsy--the word\r\nis Virgil's own--by her illicit attractions, and by the dusk grain of\r\nher complexion, doubly expresses to the life the foul daughter of Night\r\nwhom the Dunces obey and worship.\r\n\r\nVulcan, says Virgil, made the shield, like a god, knowing the future.\r\nBut here Virgil makes Vulcan. And we have now seen enough fully to\r\njustify the later popular tradition of his country in steadfastly\r\nattributing to him the fame of an arch-wizard. Looking at the thing in\r\nthis light, we derive extreme consolation from the final augurous words\r\nof our last citation--\"pallentem morte futura\"--which we oppose with\r\nconfidence to the appalling final prophecy of Pope, and believe that the\r\ngoddess is, as the nymphs were said to be, exceedingly long-lived, but\r\nnot immortal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Edinburgh: Printed by Ballantyne and Hughes, Paul's Work._",
