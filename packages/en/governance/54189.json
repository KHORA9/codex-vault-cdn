That is why the Paris Conference will remain powerless if\r\nit cannot terminate the civil war in Russia. All that the Conference\r\nhas done and is doing at the present time will be brought to nothing\r\nand will be a waste of time unless a normal and peaceful state of\r\nthings is established in Eastern Europe. Until the Peace Conference\r\nhas settled these questions, humanity will continue to be overshadowed\r\nby the menace of such a catastrophe that the disasters of the four\r\nyears of war will appear in comparison as mere child’s play.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PARIS CONFERENCE FACED BY THE RUSSIAN SPHINX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Peace Conference finds itself facing the Russian sphinx, whose\r\nproblems a mind of western culture can neither comprehend nor solve.\r\n\r\nThe agglomeration of heterogeneous peoples in Russia leaves the\r\nragged Hapsburg empire far behind. In Russia you have the complicated\r\npsychology of the Oriental, barely intelligible to his western brother.\r\nYou have also the tangled economic questions and the centuries-old\r\ncrimes of corrupt governments, the devastation of a world-war, and\r\nstill more the material and moral destruction brought about by the\r\nawakening instincts of the half-barbaric masses which call themselves\r\nBolsheviki. And all this is intermingling and boiling over in an\r\nindescribable chaos which even the liveliest imagination could not\r\nconceive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REPRESENTATIVES OF RUSSIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no lack of amateurs ready to solve the riddle of the Russian\r\nsphinx. Each government represented at the Peace Conference possesses\r\nits own point of view on the Russian question; each political party,\r\neach organ of the Press has its own remedy for saving Russia. Nor is\r\nthat all, for there are Orientals who have come to plead on behalf of\r\ntheir Fatherland before the world’s Forum. Russia teems with people\r\nand opinions, so each group of the crowd assembled in Paris brings\r\nforward a programme of salvation. There is the RUSSIAN POLITICAL\r\nCONFERENCE, consisting of Sazonoff, Tzarist ex-Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs; the prince Lvoff, ex-Premier; Tchaikovsky, President of\r\nthe NORTH RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT, and Maklakoff, ex-Ambassador\r\nof Russia under the Provisional Government. This Conference has a\r\ntheorist, an ex-director of the Juridical Department of the Ministry\r\nof Foreign Affairs of Russia under the Provisional Government, M.\r\nAndré Mandelstam, who has published a series of pamphlets in which\r\nhe sets forth the theoretical and practical bases of the views of\r\nthe Russian Political Conference. Outside this Conference, Kerensky,\r\nex-Premier, is busying himself; and with him, Avksentieff, Zenzinoff,\r\nArgounoff, Rogovsky, Minor, Sokoloff, Slonin, all members of the\r\nAll-Russian Constituent Assembly. We find also the PARIS SECTION\r\nFOR THE REGENERATION OF RUSSIA and the RUSSIAN REPUBLICAN\r\nLEAGUE. Add to these the representatives of the government of\r\nAdmiral Koltchak and of General Denikin. From the South of Russia comes\r\nSchreider, ex-mayor of Petrograd, at present the president of the\r\n“Committee of the South,” who was compelled to leave the four other\r\nmembers of his delegation behind on the Prinkipo island. Finally, to\r\nclose the name-list, there is A. N. Briantchaninoff, “Chairman of\r\nthe Slav Congress in Moscow and of the Russian National Committee\r\nin London.” In the _Pages Modernes_ are collaborating Savinkoff, L.\r\nAndreeff, Strouve, etc. Briefly, the Russian chaos is completely enough\r\nrepresented, and the plans of salvation are not lacking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATIONS BETWEEN RUSSIA AND THE BORDERLAND PEOPLES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problems which the following pages deal with are somewhat more\r\nmodest in comparison with the Russian imbroglio. They are those\r\nconcerning the so-called “borderland peoples of Russia,” _i.e._,\r\nnationalities which have for a long time suffered under the Russian\r\ndomination, which have been relegated to second and third class, and\r\nwhich, quite tired of this intolerable position, are looking for a\r\nbetter lot and greater possibility of development in an independent\r\nnational life, by means of separation from Russia.\r\n\r\nThey have formed, for that purpose, a series of small independent\r\nStates desirous of getting their independence recognised by the Peace\r\nConference, which, in solving the riddle of the Russian sphinx, will\r\nhave to pronounce the decisive word on this question. Every one, be he\r\nRussian or a representative of the nationalities, is trying to solve\r\nthis question in accordance with his point of view. The aim of the\r\nfollowing pages is to elucidate it from the point of view of Latvia.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPOSAL TO POSTPONE THE SOLUTION CONCERNING “THE BORDERLAND\r\nPEOPLES OF RUSSIA”\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us first consider the proposals of the RUSSIAN POLITICAL\r\nCONFERENCE:--“The question of the Russian borderland peoples must\r\nbe postponed until it can be decided with the co-operation of the\r\nRussian people, for the questions relating to the future status of the\r\nnationalities included within the borders of ancient Russia cannot be\r\nsolved outside the Russian people and without their consent.” That is\r\nwhat the Russian Political Conference proposed in its note of the 6th\r\nMarch, 1919--the solution of the problem must be postponed as long as\r\nthe Russian people is not in a position to make its will fully known\r\nand to take part in the settlement of these questions.\r\n\r\nEvidently perceiving how impossible this proposal is, the Russian\r\nPolitical Conference is considering a compromise, and proposes “to\r\napply in the meantime, before a definite settlement is arrived at, a\r\nprovisional régime in accordance with the present necessities” of the\r\nStates that have separated themselves from Russia, but “no definite\r\nsolution should intervene.” In other words, the Russian Political\r\nConference proposes to recognise the _de facto_ governments of the\r\nStates detached from Russia on the condition that, in an undetermined\r\nfuture, the Russian people, expressing its will by the voice of\r\nthe Constituent Assembly or by other means, shall say the final and\r\ndecisive word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE POSTPONING OF THE QUESTION\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is supremely clear that this compromise of the Russian Political\r\nConference would not give any practical solution, either at the present\r\ntime or in the near future. The proof of this is in Latvia’s desperate\r\nstruggles on two fronts--against the Bolsheviki who have thrown\r\nthemselves on her, and against the German army of occupation which has\r\nno wish at all to surrender the territory. In such circumstances, of\r\nwhat importance would be the recognition of the _de facto_ situation?\r\nMoral help is indispensable; besides, it is necessary to have a solid\r\njuridical basis, recognised by the Powers, in order to exact from the\r\nBolsheviki and the Germans, not another _de facto_ situation in the\r\nplace of the one they have caused, but the substitution of Right for\r\ntheir illegal tyranny. Without this, the success of the struggle\r\nagainst the Bolsheviki and the Germans would become impossible, or\r\nat least more complicated. Consequently, arms and munitions become\r\nindispensable. Were they supplied by the governments backing up the\r\nLetts, means for the equipment and maintenance of the army would yet be\r\nlacking. These means cannot be obtained if the country does not provide\r\nits own finances, which in turn cannot be established until the State\r\nis judicially recognised. Strong in such a recognition, the Lettish\r\narmy, for instance, would long since have occupied Riga and delivered\r\nit from the Bolshevist tyranny, but it simply dared not do it because\r\nof the lack of revictualling for the inhabitants. Assuredly, who\r\nwould risk delivering goods on credit without knowing who is legally\r\nresponsible for the debts? To be successful in the struggle it would\r\nbe indispensable to restore the means of transport, the communications\r\ndestroyed by the Bolsheviki, and to replace the rolling stock carried\r\naway by the Germans. But who would concern himself with that and\r\ninvest his capital in such an enterprise if there is no one judicially\r\nresponsible, and if one does not know to whom the country is to belong\r\nand who is to rule it in the future?\r\n\r\nThe recognition of the present situation would in no way help the\r\nLettish people to hasten its resurrection, so that it represents no\r\nprogress towards the practical solution of the question in dispute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE WILL SOON BE IN A\r\nPOSITION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SOLUTION OF THESE QUESTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nOf necessity, one could come to an agreement on this point if it were\r\npossible to foresee that such a situation would not last too long,\r\nbut would soon disappear in the presence of durable and well-defined\r\njuridical relations. But this cannot be foreseen by anybody if the\r\nLettish question is made dependent on the Russian people. Who would\r\nventure to affirm that the Russian people will soon be in a position\r\nto manifest freely its will and share in the settlement of these\r\nquestions?\r\n\r\nAdmiral Koltchak, for instance, has obtained, on certain conditions\r\naccepted by him, the promise of support from the Allied and Associated\r\nPowers, and he is backed up by the Russian Political Conference. But\r\nhe is as yet only in Siberia; much time will elapse before he reaches\r\nthe Volga, and from there Moscow is yet far; but after all Moscow is\r\nnot the whole of Russia. Meanwhile, in the South, the Bolsheviki have\r\ndecided, it appears, to give final battle to Admiral Koltchak. Even\r\nsupposing that Admiral Koltchak wins the most brilliant of victories,\r\nmuch time will pass before tranquillity returns to the country, before\r\nhe succeeds in re-establishing the administrative machinery, and a\r\nConstituent Assembly is elected in which the “Russian people will be in\r\na position to make its will known freely.”\r\n\r\nEven leaving these arguments aside, can one be sure that the government\r\nof Admiral Koltchak and the Constituent Assembly convened by him will\r\nbe recognised as authoritative and as the expression of the free\r\nwill of the Russian people? It is evident that in no case will this\r\nhappen without the hottest opposition. Kerensky and his above-named\r\ncolleagues, the Paris Section of the Union for Russian Regeneration,\r\nand the Russian Republican League in their declaration (_Humanité_,\r\n21st May, 1919) say, evidently aiming at the party of Koltchak, “It is\r\nnecessary that the governments of the free peoples declare openly that\r\nthey will never recognise, in Russia, any government whatsoever which\r\nis a dictatorship of one man or of a group and does not acknowledge\r\nthe principle of popular sovereignty nor take the essential measures\r\nfor its realisation.” In another direction, the Russian National and\r\nDemocratic Union (_Bloc_), comprising the various leagues set up for\r\nthe regeneration of Russia, protests violently against the conditions\r\nimposed by the Allied and Associated Powers on Admiral Koltchak and\r\naccepted by him (_Patrie_, 15th June, 1919). So the future opposition\r\nto the future Russian government is already there, and even makes an\r\nappeal for support to all the free peoples. But who can say definitely\r\nthat with this support either Kerensky or Koltchak will be in a\r\nposition to get the upper hand?\r\n\r\nAnd again, should the government of Lvov-Kerensky, or simply that of\r\nthe latter alone, be recognised as enjoying legal continuity?\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful that the Russian Political Conference and Admiral\r\nKoltchak are agreed. M. A. N. Briantchaninoff, the Chairman of the\r\nSlav Congress in Moscow and of the Russian National Committee in\r\nLondon, talks openly of the unheard-of inability of the Lvov-Kerensky\r\nand Co. government (_Daily Telegraph_, 24th May, 1919). And the\r\nAll-Russian Constituent Assembly of the 5th January, 1918, under the\r\nfamous presidency of M. V. Tchernoff, which included Messrs. Lenin\r\nand Trotsky? But M. Gregory Schreider proves that the members of the\r\nConstituent Assembly of 5th January, 1918, were shot by order of\r\nAdmiral Koltchak (_Daily Telegraph_, 28th May, 1919). Koltchak would\r\nperhaps like to continue in the same way. In any case, before taking\r\nup the case of Latvia, the Constituent Assembly would have to decide\r\nthe question of summoning Admiral Koltchak to judgment; and that might\r\ntake up much time, considering the complexity of the question and the\r\nbias of the representatives of the Russian people, entailing debates\r\nof indefinite length. Consequently, whoever the candidate may be whose\r\npower will be recognised as expressing the free will of the Russian\r\npeople, one may be quite confident that a violent struggle will ensue\r\nagainst him. For, to talk of free expression of the will of the people,\r\neither with or without the assistance of a foreign commission, in a\r\ncountry devastated by war and corrupted by Bolshevism, is naturally\r\ninadmissible until the most elementary order is established and the\r\nbillows of political passion have subsided. And thus years will pass\r\nby, during which the question of the countries detached from Russia\r\nwill remain without solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRIGHT OF THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SOLUTION OF THE\r\nLETTISH QUESTION\r\n\r\n\r\nOutside the purely practical reasons, there is a matter of principle;\r\nand looking more closely at the proposal of the Russian Political\r\nConference, one cannot but be amazed by it. By what right do they claim\r\nthat the question of the Lettish people “cannot be solved without\r\nRussian knowledge and consent”? Who made the Lettish people Slaves of\r\nthe Russians? Who made the Russians guardians of the Letts? President\r\nWilson has declared the equality of nations and their equal right to\r\ndispose of themselves. The second paragraph of President Wilson’s\r\nmessage of the 22nd January, 1917, says: “The equality of nations on\r\nwhich peace must be founded in order to be durable, must imply the\r\nequality of rights; the exchanged guarantees must neither recognise nor\r\nimply a difference between the big nations and the small, between those\r\nthat are powerful and those that are weak.” In the speech delivered on\r\nthe 27th September, 1918, Wilson declares: “The impartial justice we\r\nwant should not make any difference between those in regard to whom we\r\nare willing to be just and those in regard to whom we are not willing\r\nto be just. It should be a justice not knowing any favouritism, but\r\nonly the equal rights of the different peoples.” Then, after such clear\r\ndeclarations on the part of President Wilson, can one who declares\r\nhimself in agreement with this theory and expresses (like the note\r\nof the Russian Political Conference) his sympathy with the peoples\r\ndetached from Russia, can he require the other nations to wait and not\r\nproceed with the restoration of their affairs until the Russian people\r\nhas had the leisure to manifest its opinion? And, after the Lettish\r\npeople have got rid of Bolshevism at the price of inconceivable efforts\r\nand have, with the assistance of the Allies, liberated Latvia from the\r\nGerman armies of occupation, and when they have finally succeeded in\r\nrestoring their economic and intellectual life, by what right would\r\nthe Russians, recovering themselves and facing a problematical future,\r\narrogate to themselves the authority to possess and rule a people\r\nfor the regeneration of which they have not moved a finger? Granted\r\nthe right of the nations to dispose of themselves, how could the\r\nRussian Constituent Assembly or the government of Admiral Koltchak be\r\ncompetent to decide the fate of the Lettish people and yet the Lettish\r\nConstituent Assembly or the Peace Conference be incompetent--the latter\r\nhaving already decided the destiny of many races?\r\n\r\nTo all these painful questions there is only one possible answer:\r\nWould not the Russian Political Conference admit that at the bottom\r\nof its proposition there shows itself all too clearly a point of view\r\nhabitual to the old Tzarist régime, according to which the borderland\r\npeoples have no other right than to be the object of the dominant\r\nnation’s rights? But with such opinions, borrowed from the old Tzarist\r\nrégime’s domestic habits or home-policy, it would simply not be safe\r\nto appear before the Peace Conference, which has proclaimed a just and\r\nhappy future for all peoples, inaugurating a new era of international\r\njustice. Undoubtedly, the Russian Political Conference is cruelly\r\ndeceived, both in regarding their proposition as “a practical way out\r\nof the present situation,” and even in thinking they have given “a real\r\nproof of the new spirit of Russia.” In point of fact, there is neither\r\na new spirit nor a practical solution of the question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA DEFINITE AND IMMEDIATE SOLUTION OF THE QUESTION OF LATVIA IS\r\nNECESSARY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of the formation of a State for the Lettish people must\r\nbe settled definitely and as soon as possible. The Lettish people can\r\nclaim it as a right, for it finds itself in the first rank of the\r\npeoples who have suffered from the war. The interests of the other\r\nnations also require it, for they will feel the greater security the\r\nfewer undecided questions there are, the fewer centres of trouble and\r\ndisorder.\r\n\r\nThe definite solution can be arrived at in two ways: either by the\r\nreconstitution of Russia in her former boundaries, excluding perhaps\r\nPoland, which would find its ethnographic frontiers again, and that is\r\nthe proposal of the Russian Political Conference, of M. A. Mandelstam,\r\nand other people and institutions pretending to represent the Russian\r\npeople; or by the absolute recognition of the independence of the\r\npeoples which have separated themselves from Russia, and that is what\r\ntheir representatives are working for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RECONSTITUTION OF RUSSIA\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, M. A. Mandelstam, the literary idealist of the Russian\r\nPolitical Conference, declares, in his _Memorandum on the Delimitation\r\nof the Rights of States and Nations_ (Paris, 1919), that the interests\r\nof the countries detached from Russia, their right to free development\r\nof their economic and intellectual culture, will be guaranteed and\r\ncan only be guaranteed by their reunion with Russia. This reunion, he\r\nadds, is necessary not only in the interests of Russia, but also in the\r\ninterests of these same countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROJECT OF AN ALL-RUSSIAN FEDERATION\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is certain that they do not propose the reconstitution of the\r\nold Tzarist régime, which, according to M. A. Mandelstam, is no\r\nless detested by the Russian people than by those of the border\r\ncountries; their aim is rather to form a new Russia built on a quite\r\ndifferent foundation and distinguished by a perfect justice towards\r\nall the peoples inhabiting her territory. “Russia, emerging from the\r\nRevolution,” says the Russian Political Conference, “and definitely\r\ndivorced from the centralising tendencies of the old régime, is largely\r\ndisposed to satisfy the legitimate wish of these nationalities to\r\norganise their national life. The new Russia does not conceive her\r\nreconstitution otherwise than in a free co-existence of the peoples\r\nforming part of her, on the principles of autonomy and federalism.” And\r\nM. A. Mandelstam, forgetting that it is very difficult for him, not\r\nbeing of Russian origin himself, to speak and make promises in the name\r\nof the Russian people, asserts: “The Russian people has never been\r\nin agreement with the old Russian policy in regard to the borderland\r\npeoples, and has always suffered with them from the same absence of\r\npolitical rights. It will only wish to be allowed to work side by side\r\nwith its non-Russian brethren, mindful of their rights as it will be of\r\nits own.... The common life could be organised on the basis of autonomy\r\nor on that of the federative principle, or else on that of union. In\r\nany case, the borderland peoples would no longer need to fear any\r\nattacks on their personality on the part of New Russia.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINT OF VIEW OF THE RUSSIAN GROUPS IN REGARD TO THE FEDERATION OF\r\nRUSSIA\r\n\r\n\r\nNo doubt, there are many good intentions and nice promises abroad; but\r\nnevertheless we will allow ourselves slightly to doubt their perfect\r\nsincerity, be it only in regard to some of the representatives of the\r\nRussian groups.\r\n\r\nHow, for instance, do they reconcile this crop of promises with the\r\nfollowing facts? When, at the beginning of the year 1917, _i.e._,\r\neven before the Revolution, the Lettish deputies in the Imperial Douma\r\nraised the question of self-government for Latvia, M. Miliukoff,\r\nthen the all-powerful genius of the Progressive Coalition (_Bloc_),\r\nexpressed a hostile opinion on this question, and underlined it with\r\nthe following words: “Then it will be necessary to grant autonomy\r\neven to the Samoyedes!” When, the same year, but already after\r\nthe Revolution, under the régime of Kerensky, the law concerning\r\nself-government for the Baltic provinces was in elaboration, and\r\nthe Lettish deputies pointed out the absolute necessity of fusion,\r\ncompact and with well-defined boundaries, of all the territories\r\ninhabited by the Letts, in a unity of self-government without which the\r\ndevelopment of the Lettish civilisation would become difficult, the\r\nRussian Government replied with a refusal, based on the inconvenience\r\nof altering the existing departmental boundaries. More recently, in\r\nthe _Pall Mall Gazette_ of May 6th, 1919, M. C. Nabokoff, emphasising\r\nhis status as a Russian diplomatic representative in London, puts the\r\nLetts and Esthonians in the same rank as the negroes of Texas. Their\r\nleaning towards autonomy is described by him as a “self-determination\r\nin a nursery,” and he regards the Letts and Esthonians as “victims\r\nof Teutonic propaganda,” to which he, M. C. Nabokoff, will never and\r\nin no circumstances submit. Consequently, as regards the promises of\r\nthe Russian Political Conference and the assurances of M. Mandelstam,\r\nwe have testimonies of the representatives of the different Russian\r\npolitical groups at different periods in their different situations,\r\nbefore the Revolution, after the Revolution, and after the second\r\nRevolution; testimonies, thoughtless perhaps, and ill-calculated, but\r\nso much the more sincere.\r\n\r\nHowever, the “Russian diplomatic representative in London,” who, from\r\nthe service of the Tzarist government, has gone over, without much\r\neffort, to that of the government represented by M. Mandelstam--after\r\nhaving acquired a fuller knowledge of Texas, and even without this,\r\nwill be quite willing to change his views about the Letts and the\r\nEsthonians in accordance with the views and intentions of his new\r\nchiefs. No doubt M. Miliukoff, who has been able to master his\r\nantipathy to Germany, will, for reasons of necessity, vanquish also his\r\naversion for the self-government of Latvia. But how can the Lettish\r\npeople, or the Peace Conference as it decides the fate of nations, be\r\nassured that in the future and under new conditions, Messrs. Nabokoff\r\nand Miliukoff will not reconvert M. Mandelstam, Admiral Koltchak, etc.,\r\nalong with themselves and the Russian Political Conference? Can one\r\nexpect the Lettish people or the Peace Conference to have faith in\r\ntheir word when the Russian groups themselves have not full confidence\r\nin one another?\r\n\r\nKerensky and his colleagues do not believe a bit in the promises of\r\nAdmiral Koltchak in regard to the convening of the Constituent Assembly\r\non a democratic basis. M. A. N. Briantchaninoff categorically rejects\r\nM. Kerensky. M. Miliukoff, as it appears, professes no confidence in\r\nthe Constituent Assembly presided over by V. Tchernoff, and Admiral\r\nKoltchak even shoots its members, which crime M. Schreider will never\r\nforgive him. If there exists such a complete mistrust among the Russian\r\ngroups in regard to one another, if people who know the valuable\r\nqualities of their fellow-countrymen release floods of accusations on\r\none another, what faith is it possible to have, I will not say in the\r\nsincerity of their promises, but in the possibility of fulfilling them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPOSSIBILITY OF A RUSSIAN FEDERATION\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides personal confidence or mistrust, there are also much deeper\r\nreasons of an objective kind which clearly show that the promises\r\nof the Russian groups are, in spite of their good will, absolutely\r\nunrealisable. One would need to be imbued with an absolute Bolshevist\r\ndisregard for the laws of historical continuity to admit that Russia,\r\nby the mere force of a decree and solely by the good will of honest\r\npeople, will straightway pass from being a country subject to Tzarist\r\ndespotism and unaccustomed to the respect of rights, of personality,\r\nand of nationalities, to a régime of equality of rights and justice\r\nfor all. There are no big jumps in History; and if they are attempted,\r\nthey are paid for grievously. The proof of this is afforded by the\r\nhappenings in Russia, which, it was boasted, had passed without\r\nbloodshed from the autocratic régime of the Tzar to the “freest régime\r\nin the world”--the Lvov-Kerensky régime; but streams of blood and\r\nunheard-of cruelties have followed. Russia has fallen to ruins under\r\nthe despotic régime of Lenin and Trotsky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL IMPOSSIBILITY OF AN ALL-RUSSIAN FEDERATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of centuries, customs and habits, rooted usages and\r\npopular psychology are much more effectual than the best intentions\r\nand decrees, which in the most favourable circumstances can only bring\r\nabout an external change. But under the mask of the latter the Past\r\ncontinues to exist. We have already shown that in the proposal itself\r\nof the Russian Political Conference, under a new phraseology, there is\r\nconcealed at the bottom the psychology of the Tzarist bureaucracy, of\r\nwhich the Russian Political Conference has not succeeded in freeing\r\nitself. If the old psychology is so sturdy in the minds of the best\r\nsons of Russia, who are accustomed to direct themselves according to\r\nthe best theoretical conceptions, and who have been brought up in\r\nthe atmosphere of European ideas, what then can be expected from the\r\nover-excited instincts of ignorant masses reared in utter contempt of\r\nanother’s personality and rights?\r\n\r\nIt is certain that the rebirth of Russia will coincide with an\r\nextraordinary upheaval of the nationalist wave, a quite natural\r\nupheaval after the humiliation of national dignity suffered by Russia,\r\nan upheaval of which all that is foreign and non-Russian will be\r\nthe inevitable victim. This wave will clear the ground for Messrs.\r\nMandelstam, Sazonoff, Kerensky, Schreider, etc. M. C. Nabokoff will\r\nincontestably allow himself to be carried away by that wave, and if\r\nAdmiral Koltchak and General Denikin do not, at least those that will\r\ncome after them, perhaps M. Briantchaninoff, will benefit by it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA COMMON CIVILISATION, INDISPENSABLE TO A FEDERATION, DOES NOT\r\nEXIST\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat will be the effect of this Chauvinist wave on the All-Russian\r\nFederation planned by the Russian groups, and composed of a series of\r\nnational States? In accordance with the laws of reaction, the Russian\r\nnationalist upheaval will call forth a similar movement in the other\r\nnationalities of the Russian Federation. Besides, these peoples are\r\neven now in different stages of civilisation. They are being besought\r\nfrom various directions, and the exasperation of the national feeling\r\nin each of them will set up another and a still more sensitive\r\ndifference. There will not be that spiritual community without which a\r\nfree co-existence is inconceivable. This spiritual community did not\r\nexist under the Tzarist régime, which however tried to create it by\r\nenforced russification, going even so far as to prohibit the use of the\r\nmother-alphabet and the public use of the mother-language, and ordering\r\nthat teaching in the elementary schools should be given in Russian to\r\nchildren who did not understand a word of it. By such proceedings, a\r\nkind of spiritual community among the peoples of Russia has indeed been\r\ncreated; no one doubts it--there is unanimous opposition against such\r\nmeans of furthering Russian civilisation.\r\n\r\nNo harmony of civilisation could exist, even in the projected\r\nAll-Russian Federation. Within its limits there would be nations which,\r\nowing to favourable geographical situation and greater activity, have\r\nlong led the intensive life of western civilisation; and there would\r\nalso be peoples which are as yet in the first stage of civilisation.\r\n\r\nFor instance, what harmony is it possible to imagine as existing\r\nbetween the Letts and the Samoyedes of M. Miliukoff, or between the\r\nEsthonians and the Fetishists of Siberia? Russia is populated by\r\nnations unable to understand one another, not only on account of the\r\ndifference of language, but also because of the contrasting customs\r\nand habits, ideas, religious creeds, and popular psychology. No one of\r\nthese nationalities possesses such a strong preponderance in the matter\r\nof numbers and civilisation, nor such powerful influence, that the\r\nother peoples should submit to it of their own free will.\r\n\r\nM. Victoroff-Toporoff finds (_Pages Modernes_, No. 1, April, 1919,\r\np. 24) that there is something which unites all the nationalities\r\nof Russia--“the great intellectual force of the people of Greater\r\nRussia,” which through the medium of masterpieces of the famous\r\nRussian teachers and writers, has spread broadcast among all the\r\npeoples of Russia. It is certain that no one will try to minimise\r\nthe importance of Russian literature, nor dispute the place which is\r\nits due among the literatures of the world. But Russian literature\r\nby itself is not yet world-literature, and the literature of other\r\nnations as well has exercised an enormous influence on the peoples of\r\nRussia. For instance, the influence of the French masters on Lettish\r\nculture is far stronger than that of Russian art. But apart from this,\r\neach nationality detached from Russia has its national literature,\r\nwhich we all admit does not perhaps possess great masterpieces like\r\nRussian literature, but has nevertheless its individual character, and\r\nconsequently stands nearer and dearer to its people and is capable of\r\ngreater influence on it than all the masterpieces of foreign art.\r\n\r\nThe All-Russian Federation has no common basis for its diverse members\r\nin the field of civilisation. Consequently, there are two courses open\r\nto it:--either to give to each people the liberty of development, in\r\nwhich case the nationalities would very soon disperse intellectually in\r\nall directions; or to revive the russifying centralist tendencies, the\r\nlikelihood of which is made evident by the expected rising of Russian\r\nchauvinism. In both cases there remains nothing of the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ECONOMIC PROBLEM OF A FEDERATED RUSSIA\r\n\r\n\r\nIf between the peoples of Russia there are no interests in common as\r\nregards intellectual culture, there is still less in common in the\r\neconomic relationships of the different parts of Russia.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that Russia, since the ministries of Vishnegradsky\r\nand Witte, leaned more and more consciously towards the protectionist\r\nsystem; and having created the autonomous Customs tariff of 1893,\r\nleaned towards the creation Of a self-supporting economic unit. This\r\npolicy was based on balancing the agricultural interests on the one\r\nside and the industrial interests on the other. Industry was protected\r\nat the expense of agriculture, but without exceeding the limits which\r\nallowed the world’s markets to be preserved for Russian agricultural\r\nproducts, for otherwise this would have led to the destruction of\r\nRussia’s commercial equilibrium. This was a quite reasonable policy,\r\nand indispensable from the point of view of a one and indivisible\r\nRussia with an economic system completely centralised. And this policy,\r\nsupposing its necessity, must be reverted to in a reunited Russia.\r\n\r\nBut it is also quite clear that to the interests of this policy,\r\nindispensable to a self-sufficient economic unit, important interests\r\nof the different parts of Russia have been sacrificed. For instance,\r\nthe corn-growing central provinces of Russia have lost the English\r\nmarket, with difficulty retaining the much less profitable market in\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Latvia, in no way interested in the export of\r\ncereals, was obliged, in order to assist the Russian grain export,\r\nand in virtue of the commercial treaties concluded between Russia and\r\nGermany in 1894 and 1904, to submit to concessions in regard to German\r\nindustry which were incompatible with her own industrial interests.\r\n\r\nBy the case of Finland, it is possible to form an idea of the results\r\nof such an economic system. From the importation of Russian corn,\r\nFinland passed to the importation of German and American flour;\r\ninstead of Russian sugar she used German. In return the products of\r\nRussian industry have not been able to conquer the Finnish market, in\r\nview of the impossibility of their competition with German products.\r\nFinland, having Customs frontiers with Russia, was able to avoid the\r\ntoo disadvantageous consequences for her of that Russian economic\r\npolicy which sacrificed local economic interests to a centralised\r\neconomic system for Russia. If there had not been Customs frontiers\r\nbetween Finland and Russia, Finland would have had to pay much dearer\r\nfor her bread and to purchase industrial products at a much higher\r\nprice. The other parts of Russia, not enjoying economic autonomy, have\r\nnot been able to avoid the disastrous consequences of the Russian\r\npolicy as Finland has done.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the founders of Federated Russia will have to solve the\r\nfollowing question: Must we revert to a centralised policy and neglect\r\nthe local interests of the different parts of Russia, or must we grant\r\nthe right of an autonomous economic policy to the different members of\r\nthe Federation? In the former case, there would remain very little of\r\nthe “free co-existence of the peoples forming part of it on principles\r\nof autonomy and federation.” From this point of view the nationalities\r\nwould be less favoured than Finland, which, as is well known, was far\r\nfrom feeling outside the danger of Russian pretensions. If, on the\r\ncontrary, the founders of the Federated Republic of Russia propose to\r\ngive to the various States the right of an autonomous economic policy,\r\nthen the Federation will very soon fall to pieces, for the economic\r\ninterests of the different States tend in different directions, and\r\neconomic interests are much more powerful than historical memories.\r\n\r\nThe economic problem will therefore be solved either to the\r\nadvantage of a Russia which supports herself, but is at the same\r\ntime centralised, or to the advantage of the independence of the\r\nnationalities which have separated themselves from Russia. In either\r\ncase there is no place for federation!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALL-RUSSIAN FEDERATION FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF CONSTITUTIONAL\r\nLAW\r\n\r\n\r\nThere still remains to be elucidated the project of an All-Russian\r\nFederation from the point of view of constitutional law, _i.e._, the\r\npossibility of creating, with the aid of the nationalities of Russia, a\r\ndurable State on the basis of federation.\r\n\r\nThe definite and authorised answer to this question was given by the\r\nlate M. Kokoshkin, professor at the University of Moscow, in his\r\nreport (Summer, 1917) to the Congress of the Constitutional Democratic\r\nParty on the subject of the desirable form for the future State of\r\nRussia. He proved the utter impossibility, from the point of view of\r\nconstitutional law, of reconstructing Russia on a federative basis; and\r\nthe Congress of the Party entirely subscribed to his opinion. There\r\nremains little to say after the view of Professor Kokoshkin.\r\n\r\nAll federations of States can work on one condition only, viz., that\r\nthere is one among them which has the power, owing to its importance\r\nand influence, to support and unite all the other members. Germany\r\ngives us an instance of this law. First, in 1866, Bismarck was\r\ncompelled to exclude Austria by force from the German Confederation,\r\non account of her competition with Prussia, so that he could, in 1871,\r\ngather round him the German Federation, in which Prussia, both by\r\nher real force and in accordance with constitutional law, became the\r\npredominant partner. And the Prussian spirit guided Germany. Prussia\r\nwas the cause of Germany’s extraordinary development, and also of her\r\nunprecedented defeat. The contrary is instanced by Austria-Hungary,\r\nwhich tottered in proportion as German Austria increasingly lost her\r\npreponderance.\r\n\r\nCan one reckon on finding, among the nationalities of Russia, a member\r\nof the projected Federation with enough authority, from the point of\r\nview of constitutional law, to unite and support the other members\r\nof the Federation? To this question Professor Kokoshkin has given a\r\nnegative and categorical reply, and we must abide by this opinion.\r\n\r\nEvidently, the section of the Great-Russians could, in the first place,\r\nlay claim to such a part. But they count only 65 millions out of the\r\n180 millions forming the population of Russia. Besides, this section is\r\nfar from having preponderant economic importance, and it has remained,\r\nin the matter of civilisation, well behind the other members of the\r\nprojected All-Russian Federation. If the leading part is given to this\r\nsection--a majority of votes in the Council of the Federation, for\r\ninstance--it would be a great injustice to the other nationalities,\r\nand they would never consent to it; an otherwise senseless injustice,\r\nbecause the section of the Great-Russians will evidently never be in a\r\nposition to perform the part assigned to them, nor could they perform\r\nit except by using physical force, _i.e._, by re-establishing the\r\npolicy of centralist absolutism, the policy which has sustained so\r\ncomplete a defeat, and that not only by a mere historical chance.\r\n\r\nIf there is no directing centre, it is clear that the All-Russian\r\nFederation will fall to pieces on the morrow of its foundation on\r\npaper, for there will be no power in a position to reconcile the\r\ndivergent interests of the various members of the Federation. Georgia,\r\nfor instance, will never consent to vote credits for the development\r\nof Northern railway systems. Latvia will give no contribution for the\r\nconstruction of Black Sea ports; and Ukraine will not send her sons to\r\ndefend the Baltic Sea. The combination of these interests, so different\r\nand so scattered, would only result in a State-structure so weak that\r\nit would fall to pieces at the first serious blow.\r\n\r\nThus, from the point of view of constitutional law, we arrive at the\r\nsame conclusion to which the analysis of the tendencies of civilisation\r\nand economic life led us--that the All-Russian Federation will\r\ntransform itself either into a centralised State maintained by force,\r\nor it will divide itself into independent States.\r\n\r\nThere is no place for a Federation in Russia! Neither the land nor\r\nthe men upon it were made for it; this is proved by History. The\r\nhistory of Russia in her beginnings shows us a certain number of\r\nprincipalities, independent of one another, and on the whole not\r\nsubject to any authority. Owing to the efforts of the more powerful\r\nprinces, and under the duress of the Tartar yoke, the principalities\r\nunited, not into a Federation, but into a centralised State; and each\r\nprincipality, deprived of its independence, did not become a member of\r\na Federation, but passed into another State.\r\n\r\nThe same course was followed in regard to the contiguous and\r\nneighbouring countries conquered by Russia.\r\n\r\nNot only Finland and Poland, but also the Baltic, Ukraine, and Georgia\r\nwere united to Russia, and received from her at least the guarantee\r\nof their special rights and of their separate position in the Russian\r\nState; but Russia did not keep her word in regard to all these States,\r\nbut had them all subject to a centralised policy, after having\r\ndestroyed, or attempted to destroy, all the individuality of these\r\ncountries. And this is in no way by mere chance. The Russian plain,\r\nhaving almost no natural divisions, is not a favourable field for the\r\ncreation of a Federation, and the Russian soul, understanding no _via\r\nmedia_ between “all” and “nothing,” is not the cement with which it\r\nwould be possible to build a Federation always based on the limitation\r\nof one will by other wills, and on a clever and experienced blend of\r\nthe different inclinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEANING OF THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA TOWARDS INDEPENDENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nNot being able to put their trust in the All-Russian Federation and not\r\nfinding therein enough guarantee for their natural rights, the peoples\r\nof Russia have separated themselves from her and are building up their\r\nindependent national life. This is what is rousing the opposition of\r\nthe representatives of the Russian groups. The grounds for it are\r\ngiven by M. Mandelstam in several pamphlets published by the Russian\r\nPolitical Conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC DISADVANTAGE OF SEPARATION FROM RUSSIA\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst of all, M. Mandelstam finds that the independence to which the\r\nnationalities detached from Russia are aspiring is disadvantageous\r\nto these peoples themselves: “So they would merely find in their\r\nindependence a satisfaction of their national vanity, too heavily paid\r\nfor by the loss of their economic prosperity.” (_Memorandum on the\r\nDelimitation of the Rights of States and Nations_, p. 79.) Concerning\r\nLatvia in particular, M. Mandelstam foresees that the commerce of her\r\nports will enormously suffer, for they will lose the benefit of the\r\nRussian transit trade. Agriculture, which will lose the Russian market,\r\nwill equally suffer from it; her industry will be deprived of fuel\r\nand raw materials (p. 60). Finally, Latvia will not be in a position\r\nto guarantee “the reimbursement of the enormous amounts spent for the\r\ndevelopment of her economic prosperity and for her defence” (p. 79).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSETTLEMENT OF ACCOUNTS BETWEEN LATVIA AND RUSSIA\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us take the last point first, viz., the mutual settlement of\r\naccounts between Latvia and Russia.\r\n\r\nIt seems that here M. Mandelstam wishes either to frighten us or simply\r\nto “overcharge” us.\r\n\r\nNow from the statements of the Ministry of Finance it is evident that\r\nLatvia has given yearly to the State a surplus of revenue over and\r\nabove the expenditure, which is valued at about 30 million roubles,\r\nafter having paid out of her own revenues all the expenses of the State\r\nwithin the boundaries of Latvia, including expenditure on numerous\r\ninstitutions, on strong armies and frontier guards, etc. In how many\r\nyearly instalments does M. Mandelstam intend to repay that surplus to\r\nLatvia?\r\n\r\nIt is absolutely impossible to understand of what expenses for the\r\ndefence of Latvia M. Mandelstam is speaking. Latvia’s share in the\r\nState Budget, including army and navy, as we have already seen, is paid\r\noff with a surplus for the Russian Budget. Of what other expenditure\r\nthen is M. Mandelstam speaking? Of war expenses for a defence which was\r\na failure and brought Latvia nothing but destruction and ruins? Who\r\nwould pay for a task so badly done? And if that is the expense referred\r\nto, what is the cost M. Mandelstam puts on the senseless and aimless\r\ndevastation carried out in Latvia by Russian armies? They are very well\r\ndepicted in the exhaustive work by M. J. Sahlit, member of the Imperial\r\nDouma.[2]\r\n\r\nAnother indiscreet question: At what rate of exchange does M.\r\nMandelstam suggest paying the mass of Russian credit-notes with which\r\nLatvia was deluged, and against which the Russian Government has\r\nreceived goods of a fixed weight and at a fixed price?\r\n\r\nIf a reckoning is set up--for conscience’ sake, naturally--Latvia will\r\nhave to receive from Russia amounts which will be a considerable\r\nbalance in the establishment of her own finances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC INTERESTS OF LATVIA\r\n\r\n\r\nConcerning the economic interests of Latvia, it is scarcely probable\r\nthat M. Mandelstam need defend them against the Letts themselves. This\r\ntime M. Mandelstam has evidently gone to unnecessary trouble. If the\r\neconomic interests of Latvia so weightily necessitate her reunion with\r\nRussia, the Letts, being accustomed to calculate quite dispassionately,\r\nwill soon see their advantage and will be anxious to adhere to the\r\nAll-Russian Federation projected by M. Mandelstam of their own free\r\nwill. Consequently, why does M. Mandelstam insist on establishing\r\nLatvia’s happiness by force and compulsion? Is it possible he has\r\nforgotten that he who tries to prove too much proves nothing?\r\n\r\nBesides, M. Mandelstam appears to be ill-informed on the economic\r\nlife of Latvia. It is not true that Latvia needs the Russian market\r\nfor her agricultural products. It will not be difficult for her to\r\nfind a more profitable market in the West. It is equally not true\r\nthat Latvia will be deprived of the transit trade of Russia, for her\r\nports are the most convenient transit points for Russia; and Latvia,\r\nfor the purpose of increasing and developing this transit trade, will\r\ndo her best to further her own interests. M. Mandelstam is equally\r\nmistaken as regards Lettish industry. Fuel, in the shape of coal, has\r\nbeen supplied to her up to the present not by Russia, but principally\r\nby England, and Russian iron ore could easily be replaced by Swedish.\r\nGenerally speaking, one may say that Latvia, being in a better economic\r\nsituation than Russia, can rightly hope that the latter will look for\r\nnormal economic relations with Latvia, and it would have been more\r\ncomprehensive and more natural if M. Mandelstam had only taken up the\r\ndefence of Russia’s economic interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASPIRATIONS OF THE LETTS\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Mandelstam may unhesitatingly leave the defence of Lettish interests\r\nto the Letts themselves. They have studied them and understand them\r\nwell. Lettish aspirations were born neither to-day nor yesterday. The\r\nbirth of the Lettish movement took place in 1860. Since that time it\r\nhas been under the double oppression of the Baltic barons and the\r\nRussian bureaucracy. But it has courageously borne this double yoke,\r\nand has proved its vitality and activity. It has thrived and developed;\r\nit has taken deep root in the soul of the people whence it cannot be\r\neradicated again. It is certain that the Lettish people possesses what\r\nPresident Wilson calls “well-defined national aspirations.” These have\r\nclearly appeared in the sharp and closely-followed line maintained\r\nby the Lettish people during the whole war in perfect unanimity. The\r\nLetts have fought with all their might against Germany to defend\r\ntheir aspirations against Teutonic tendencies. The National Council\r\nof Latvia, in the fatal period of the Russian flight and the German\r\noccupation of a considerable portion of Latvia, was able to centre in\r\nitself the whole social activity and political thought of the Lettish\r\npeople. In its first session, from 16th to 19th November, 1917, it\r\nasked for the Lettish nation the right to dispose of themselves. In\r\nthe second, from 15th to 19th January, 1918, it very categorically\r\nstated that “Latvia asks to be recognised as a sovereign, independent\r\nand indivisible State.” The National Council informed Russia of its\r\ndecision in the speech of its representative, J. Goldman, in the\r\nConstituent Assembly of Russia, on the 5th January, 1918. The National\r\nCouncil, in spite of the personal danger to its members, in a protest\r\nnote addressed on the 4th April, 1918, to the German Chancellor, Count\r\nHertling, explicitly opposed the German inclination to unite Latvia\r\nto Germany. Already in July, 1918, the National Council had addressed\r\nitself to the Allied Governments and the opinion of the whole world,\r\nprotesting against the peace of Brest-Litovsk and revealing the clumsy\r\ndeceit of the German occupation authority in proclaiming as the will\r\nof the Lettish people the decisions of the Landesrath, a usurping body\r\ncomposed of German barons and their servants; and the National Council\r\nemphasised the unbending decision of the Lettish people to attain the\r\nrealisation of its natural rights to independence. The National Council\r\nof Latvia considered it a great honour that its aspirations were\r\ncrowned with success. It was recognised as an independent body by the\r\nGovernments of England and Japan.\r\n\r\nHaving suffered long at the hands of both Russia and Germany, the\r\nLettish people has come to the conclusion that it would find its\r\ninterests guaranteed only by independence. It is not a passing mood,\r\nbut a firm conviction, for which the Lettish people has suffered\r\nand which it will never and in no case surrender. And it awaits the\r\nrealisation of its aspirations and the solemn proclamation of its\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTESTS OF THE RUSSIAN GROUPS\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, the Russian groups protest in the name of the interests of\r\nthe Russian people, who, they say, will oppose the separation of\r\nan independent Latvia. One might briefly reply that the one-sided\r\ninterests of the Russian people would not solve this question, and\r\nthat an exclusive solution in favour of the interests of the Russian\r\npeople would be in opposition to the principle of international\r\nrelations proclaimed by the Allies. In his speech delivered on the\r\n4th July, 1918, President Wilson declared: “The settlement of any one\r\nof the questions concerning either territories, national sovereignty,\r\neconomic or political relations, must be made on the basis of the free\r\nacceptation of such a settlement by the peoples directly concerned, and\r\nnot on the basis of material interest or advantage of any other nation\r\nor people.” And in the message of September 27th, 1918, President\r\nWilson said: “No individual or special interest of a nation or a group\r\nof nations shall be able so to inspire a part of the arrangement that\r\nit would not be in agreement with the united interests of all.”\r\n\r\nIt would seem that these declarations leave nothing to be desired\r\nfrom the point of view of clearness and conciseness, and they were\r\npronounced in the most solemn manner and adopted both by the Allies and\r\ntheir adversaries as a basis on which future international relations\r\nmight be established. It would seem also that these declarations do\r\nnot leave any doubt about the fact that the question of Latvia and her\r\nfate should be solved on the basis of the aspirations and wishes of the\r\nLettish people, and not in accordance with the interests of Russia.\r\nHowever, to complete the picture, we might as well discuss the question\r\nof those Russian interests which, we are told, would suffer by the\r\nseparation of Latvia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC INTERESTS OF RUSSIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Russian groups and their ideologists put forward the economic\r\ninterests of Russia, which, they say, do not in any way permit\r\nthe separation of Latvia. “Russian foreign trade,” says Mandelstam\r\n(_Memorandum on the Delimitation of the Rights of States and Nations_),\r\n“was principally sea-borne; from this point of view the Baltic\r\nports were of the highest importance to it” (p. 58). “The complete\r\nseparation of the Baltic provinces from Russia would put this latter\r\nin an extremely difficult and grave situation, by depriving her of her\r\noutlets in the Baltic, which are not only the most important but also\r\nthe only practicable ones in the winter” (p. 60).\r\n\r\nThe fact in itself is certainly correct. Before the war almost half of\r\nthe imports and more than two-fifths of the exports of European Russia\r\nby sea passed through the great ports of Latvia: Riga, Libau, Windau.\r\nBut who would suppose that Latvia will close her ports to the transit\r\ntrade of Russia? On the contrary, Latvia understands quite well that\r\nshe is the natural intermediary between East and West, and will, in\r\nher own interests, do her best by every means to encourage trade with\r\nRussia. The natural destiny of Latvia is to be a storehouse for goods\r\ncoming from the West to Russia and _vice versa_. And everything makes\r\nus believe that Latvia will be in a position to perform that rôle\r\nbetter than Russia herself.\r\n\r\nThe chief conditions required by commerce are the following: Suitable\r\ntechnical establishments, simple and precise juridical relations, and\r\nlastly, order and tranquillity. Russia has not been able to provide\r\nthese conditions. To be satisfied of this, one has but to remember\r\nthe wretched equipment of the ports, so disproportionate to their\r\nworld-importance, the miserable state of the railways, the lack of\r\nmeans of transport, the abuses and disorder. Judicial relations were\r\nregulated by laws dating almost from the Flood, the same for the\r\nRussian villages as for the towns of universal importance, laws which\r\nwould much better have suited the former alone. The proceedings at the\r\ncourts of law were of fabulous duration; the code of laws affecting\r\ncommercial houses and companies was out of date; conditions of credit\r\nwere of the worst; and, in consequence, Germany, which enjoys\r\nthe ability to accommodate herself to all the Russian conditions,\r\nincreasingly invaded the economic life of the Baltic Sea, dispersing\r\nthe competition of others. No, it was neither Russian firms nor capital\r\nwhich prevailed there, but those of Germany, and the watchword came\r\nnot from Petrograd but from Berlin. Russia would not have succeeded as\r\nquickly as Latvia in freeing herself from the preponderating influence\r\non the shores of the Baltic. That is why Russia’s interests will in\r\nno way suffer if the intermediary’s rôle is played neither by her nor\r\nGermany, but by those who are familiar with the Baltic, whom nature has\r\nattached to it, and who consequently have natural rights to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRATEGICAL INTERESTS OF RUSSIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Russian groups lay great stress on the strategical interests of\r\nRussia. The separation of Latvia, they say, would greatly prejudice\r\nthese. The frontiers of Russia, after Latvia’s separation, would\r\nstrategically be so disadvantageous that it would be difficult to\r\ndefend them successfully. The former frontiers, with Latvia included,\r\nwere on the contrary very favourable. Yet Russia did not and could\r\nnot defend them. There is no doubt that if, in 1914, the Germans had,\r\ninstead of throwing themselves on France, directed their forces to\r\nthe East, they would have occupied without much difficulty the whole\r\nterritory of Latvia; and Russia would have been deprived anyhow of\r\nthe advantages of strategical frontiers and bases for her fleet. This\r\nhypothesis has been fully proved by the events that followed. In the\r\nspring of 1915, the German forces, relatively weak, easily succeeded in\r\nseizing the South of Courland, with the very important base for their\r\nnavy at Libau, and took up positions on the River Venta. An attempt\r\nwas then made to draw the attention of the Commander-in-Chief, Grand\r\nDuke Nicholas Nikolaievich, to the necessity of a vigorous defence of\r\nCourland in view of her military, political and economic importance.\r\nIt was then that the Grand Duke, not sharing the opinion of the\r\nRussian groups on the strategical importance of Latvia, made his\r\nfamous retort, “I don’t give a damn for your Courland!”--words which\r\nto-day still resound in the ears of every Lett. And in the summer of\r\n1915, a few German detachments were seen occupying, almost without any\r\nresistance on the part of the Russians, the greater part of Courland.\r\nIt is easy to believe in the little importance of the German forces\r\nand in Courland’s weak defence when one learns that mere patrols of\r\ncavalry took possession of whole towns almost without firing a shot.\r\nSeeing this, two sections of Lettish reservists who had been ordered to\r\nretreat, begged to be allowed to defend Mitau, and the permission was\r\ngranted to them. These heroic soldiers offered to the Germans such a\r\nviolent and unexpected resistance that the latter hesitated for a long\r\ntime before coming nearer to the town.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1915, the front was established on the line of the\r\nRiver Daugava (Dwina). The Russian Political Conference will perhaps\r\nsay that this is precisely the strategic line which they contemplate.\r\nIf that is so, it is fresh proof that in the hands of Russia\r\nstrategical advantages have no importance. We know from the words\r\npublicly pronounced by the commander of an army on the Riga front,\r\nRadko-Dmitrieff, that Riga would have fallen in the autumn of 1915\r\nbut for the bravery of the Lettish troops, raised, as it is known, by\r\nLettish patriots, after heated argument with the Russian bureaucracy.\r\nIn the main, it was not the Russians so much as the Letts who defended\r\nthe Riga front. It is enough to recollect the long siege which they\r\nsustained without respite on the “island of death,” near Ixküle, and\r\nthe famous breach made by them in the German front near Mangoul, a\r\nbreach which unfortunately led to nothing, owing to the lack of Russian\r\ntroops to support them. Let us quote the characteristic and significant\r\nwords spoken by the Kaiser after an inspection of the Riga front:\r\n“Riga will fall into my hands like a ripe fruit when eight stars have\r\ndied out on that front.” He meant by this the eight detachments of the\r\nLettish army.\r\n\r\nThe 2nd September, 1917, the Germans broke through the Riga front, and\r\nat least two Russian divisions would have been made prisoners if it\r\nhad not been for the stubborn resistance of certain Lettish regiments,\r\nwhich were then annihilated. After this struggle they existed only in\r\nname, a glorious name with which the Bolsheviki continued to frighten\r\ntheir Russian adversaries.[3]\r\n\r\nBy this we can see that favourable strategical positions, in unskilful\r\nhands, become rather a snare than an advantage. The fact is that you\r\ncannot get immediate advantage out of a favourable strategical line\r\nif you have not the wish, the will, and the capacity to profit by it.\r\nRussia lacked both the goodwill and the capacity; they were absent in\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief as well as in that moujik deserter from Riazan\r\nwho replied to all exhortations: “Why should I fight? I’m not going to\r\nfish in that sea.”\r\n\r\nThe world-war has proved that patriotic spirit in an army and an\r\nunderstanding of duty are no less indispensable than the technique,\r\nfavourable positions, etc. Will Russia be able to make her Grand Dukes\r\nand moujiks believe that their feeling of duty must extend to the\r\nstrategic frontiers of the Baltic Sea, in a foreign land? We doubt it.\r\nTherefore, Russia’s defence will not be prejudiced if the strategical\r\npoints aimed towards the West fall into stronger and surer hands than\r\nhers.\r\n\r\nAnd the question of Russia’s defence must be examined from another\r\npoint of view. Against whom is Russia preparing her defence in the\r\nWest? Against Latvia? It would be a grave insult to Russia to pretend\r\nthat Latvia, with her two million and a half inhabitants, could\r\ndream of an aggressive act against Russia, which, counting only the\r\nGreat-Russians, possesses 65 million inhabitants. Against Esthonia\r\nthen, with her million and a half inhabitants? Against Lithuania, with\r\nher six million inhabitants? To put these questions is to answer them.\r\nAgainst Poland or Ukraine? But in that case the strategical positions\r\nof the Baltic Sea have nothing to do with it. Against a coalition\r\nof all these States? This is questionable, for strong and adequate\r\nas a defensive coalition of all these States might be regarded, an\r\noffensive coalition on their part against Russia is obviously unlikely\r\nand futile, for in the latter case there could be neither community of\r\ninterest nor a common object in aggression.\r\n\r\nThere remains the hypothesis of M. Mandelstam (_Memorandum on the\r\nDelimitation of the Rights of States and Nations_, p. 57), that\r\nthe territory of Latvia may serve as a very favourable point of\r\ndisembarkation for armies attacking Russia. If M. Mandelstam has\r\nGermany in view as a potential adversary, one can set him at ease by\r\ntelling him that all the interests of Latvia are directed against\r\nGermany, and to suspect her of a future alliance with Germany is simply\r\ninadmissible. In the case of an aggressive tendency on the part of\r\nGermany, Latvia will have to defend herself, and one can suppose that\r\nshe will do it more successfully than Russia, which could not thus be\r\nother than much obliged to her, in view of Latvia’s carrying out for\r\nher a task which had proved beyond Russia’s power.\r\n\r\nRussia’s defence will thus in no way be prejudiced by the shores of\r\nthe Baltic not being guarded by herself but by a more watchful sentry,\r\nof whom one could not expect any aggressive tendency, but who would\r\nnevertheless oppose himself, in the name of his own interests, to any\r\naggression coming either from the West or East.\r\n\r\nThe Lettish people claims the realisation of its natural right to an\r\nindependent existence and free development. Within the boundaries of\r\nRussia this was and will be impossible. Consequently, the Lettish\r\npeople is right in demanding its constitution as an independent State,\r\nand this all the more because the interests of the Russian people will\r\nnot suffer by it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGUARANTEES OF THE WORLD-PEACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be possible to end here if the question was merely one of\r\ntracing a line of delimitation between the interests of the Russian\r\npeople and those of the Lettish people. But that is not so--one could\r\nnot lose sight of a more universal interest. What will be the result of\r\nthe limits traced between the Lettish people and the Russian people,\r\nin the matter of other nations’ interests? A new international dawn\r\nwill rise when the Paris Conference has established guarantees for the\r\nmaintenance of peace. Everything must be done to avoid the disasters of\r\na future war.\r\n\r\nAnd precisely from this point of view, voices are heard proclaiming\r\nthat in the interests of political equilibrium, a strong Russia must be\r\nrebuilt, as far as possible within her former frontiers. They even say\r\nthat if no Russia existed, one must be invented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPLE OF POLITICAL EQUILIBRIUM\r\n\r\n\r\nCertainly, it is possible to make a primary reply to this opinion by\r\nsaying that political equilibrium is incriminated, and that in its\r\nplace will come the League of Nations guaranteeing peace and justice\r\nfor all. The reply is valid. But we are also disposed to agree with\r\nthose who say that the League of Nations will be formed only in the\r\nfuture and at present it is incapable of fulfilling all the tasks which\r\nwe await from it. For this reason, if only as a subsidiary factor, one\r\nmust not lose sight of the problems of political equilibrium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA AS A FACTOR IN POLITICAL EQUILIBRIUM\r\n\r\n\r\nThis equilibrium does not establish the necessity of re-creating\r\nRussia as she was before the war, for Russia was in no way a factor\r\npowerful enough to support that equilibrium. Knowing Russia’s internal\r\nweakness, Germany had no fear in launching the world-war. And during\r\nthe war Russia’s forces proved insufficient to weigh down the scales of\r\nvictory on the Allies’ side. On the contrary, during all the time the\r\nhostilities lasted, Russia was strategically, as well as politically\r\nand economically, the weakest point of the Allies. Finally she left\r\nthem to the grace of God after having made them a present of the pest\r\nof Bolshevism. It is clear that, even in the case of reconstruction in\r\nher former boundaries, Russia will not for a long time be in a position\r\nto perform the part of an ally and help to maintain the European\r\nequilibrium. Russia is ruined; ruined not only by the war, but also,\r\nand much more, by Bolshevism; ruined physically, economically and\r\nmuch more morally and intellectually. More than a generation will be\r\nrequired before Russia can count as a factor in European policy. And\r\nwho will maintain the equilibrium in the meantime?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERNAL WEAKNESS OF RUSSIA\r\n\r\n\r\nBut even after a long rest and complete external reconstruction,\r\nRussia, in the case of serious aggression, will always prove internally\r\nto be a considerably weaker factor than it would be possible to\r\njudge of from the outside. That was the case during the Japanese war\r\nin 1904-5. And so she was also during the war which has just ended.\r\nRussia’s external strength has always been imaginary, for she has\r\nalways been weak internally. And this is not an accidental, momentary\r\nor passing weakness, but a weakness dependent on Russia’s composition\r\nand her home-policy. We have already shown that Russia is composed\r\nof a series of regions which by their population, history, culture\r\nand economic interests are not bound together, but tend in different\r\ndirections, and are merely held together by perpetual compulsion.\r\nBy reason of this there will always be a centralised home-policy in\r\nRussia, and, consequently, a lot of unsolved and insoluble problems\r\ntherein; a policy the principal means of which will always be force\r\nand compulsion. And as soon as compulsion relaxes, the problems and\r\nanomalies artificially kept under come again to the surface and\r\nparalyse all the forces of Russia. The history of Russia shows that\r\nprecisely on account of her internal weakness and under the threat of\r\nrevolution, she has been unable to end with success any one of the last\r\nwars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL LEANINGS OF RUSSIA TOWARDS GERMANY\r\n\r\n\r\nBut besides that, as concerns Russia, it will never be possible to tell\r\nin which direction she will turn. At the beginning of the last century,\r\nallied to Prussia and Austria, she fought against France, and became\r\nthe inspirer of the Holy Alliance which was directed, in full accord\r\nwith the character of Russia’s home-policy, against all the rights\r\nof peoples. In the middle of the last century, she fought against\r\nEngland, France, and Sardinia, after having secured the neutrality of\r\nAustria and Prussia. In 1870, her friendly neutrality gave Prussia\r\nthe opportunity to crush France. There is something fateful in her\r\ntraditional friendship with Germany. Behind the back of France, though\r\nallied to her, it was towards Germany that Nicholas II. felt himself\r\nattracted (see his correspondence with William II., published in\r\nBourtzeff’s paper _L’Avenir_, 1917), as well as his ministers Sturmer\r\nand Protopopoff, unmasked in the speech of P. Miliukoff in the Imperial\r\nDouma, in February, 1917; M. Miliukoff himself (_Pages Modernes_, April\r\nnumber, 1919, page 6); and the Tzar’s General Skoropadsky; and Lenin\r\nand Trotsky who signed peace with Germany of the Kaiser and wanted\r\nan alliance with Germany of Scheidemann at any cost. At heart, M.\r\nMandelstam also is not too remote from this fatal leaning. He threatens\r\nwar if the Paris Conference shows itself disposed to recognise the\r\nindependence of the States detached from Russia (_Some Reflections on\r\nthe Question of a Great Poland and the Shores of the Baltic_, p. 10;\r\n_Memorandum on the Delimitation of the Rights of States and Nations_,\r\np. 81). With what war and in alliance with whom does M. Mandelstam\r\nthreaten us?\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the Russian Political Conference is not free from\r\nthat fatal inclination. Its representative, M. Sazonoff, former\r\nMinister, is revealed by Prince Lichnovsky as ready to abandon France,\r\n“Russia’s cherished ally,” to Germany for plunder, on condition\r\nthat the latter consents to give Russia a free hand in regard to\r\nAustria-Hungary.\r\n\r\nIt is also very interesting to notice that the crusade against the\r\nindependent States of the Baltic, preached by M. Mandelstam in Paris,\r\nis put into execution in Latvia by the armies of General von der\r\nGoltz which have upset the legal Government of Latvia recognised by\r\nEngland and Japan. The hand of M. Mandelstam, seeking allies for the\r\ncrusade against Latvia, has not remained in the air; von der Goltz\r\nhas grasped it enthusiastically. Future Russia and bygone Germany\r\nhave met in a common intrigue against independent Latvia. Finland,\r\nEsthonia, Lithuania, Ukraine and independent Poland are specks in the\r\neyes of both; and who can guarantee that the points of contact will not\r\nincrease with the lapse of time?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA AS A PROBABLE DESTROYER OF THE WORLD-PEACE\r\n\r\n\r\nRussia has been and will be an ally too unsteady to count as a factor\r\nof equilibrium in European politics. Moreover, she is a troublesome\r\nfactor, and likely to become directly or indirectly the instigator of a\r\nEuropean war. In 1904, Russia got herself involved in war with Japan,\r\nwhich exhausted all her forces. During a sequence of years, Germany\r\nhad her hands completely free in the East, and it was certainly not\r\nRussia’s balancing forces, but considerations of a quite different\r\nnature, which then prevented Germany from falling upon France. On\r\nthree occasions during the last century Russia’s leanings towards\r\ncomplete possession of the Black Sea have served as causes of war;\r\nand in that just ended, Russia’s interests in the Balkans were the\r\nmotives for aggression on the part of Austria and Germany. With\r\nRussia’s reconstitution her leanings towards possession of the Black\r\nSea and particularly the Straits will necessarily revive; this has\r\nalready been announced by the “Chairman of the Slav Congress in Moscow\r\nand of the Russian Conference in London,” M. Briantchaninoff, with\r\nthe idea that the mandate of guardianship over the Dardanelles and\r\nConstantinople should in all justice be entrusted to nobody but Russia.\r\n\r\nM. Briantchaninoff’s opinion is not a mere accident; we have no reason\r\nto regard it as such. There is no doubt that, in a reconstituted\r\nRussia, by a natural reaction from the humiliations and outrages\r\nsuffered by the country, the nationalist wave will rise very high.\r\nThis nationalism will have as its aims those of militant Slavism.\r\nOne of these aims has always been the orthodox Cross towering over\r\n“Haghia-Sophia.” And the Straits were promised to Russia. M. Sazonoff\r\nspoke of that in the Imperial Douma amidst a storm of applause. This\r\nlong-pursued object has escaped from Russian hands thanks only to the\r\nmicrobes which made their way into M. Lenin’s sealed-up carriage. It\r\nwas almost reached, and it can be reached. It is necessary to try to\r\nreach it. Lenin is already no more. M. Briantchaninoff will be heard\r\nwith thundering voice; M. Miliukoff will not be able to refuse his\r\nhelp, having shown interest in the Dardanelles during his whole life.\r\nM. Sazonoff has in his hands the Allies’ promises, which only for a\r\ntime fell into the hands of “Comrade” Tchitcherin. Thus the watchword:\r\n“To Constantinople!” And that means: “To Belgrade! To Athens! To\r\nBucharest!” and also “To Paris! To London! To Washington!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA’S POLICY IN THE BALTIC\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the direction of the Baltic Sea, reconstituted Russia threatens\r\nus with another political danger. This danger comes from the strange\r\npolicy Russia has pursued in the Baltic countries, a policy whose\r\nrepetition is revealed by many signs. Feeling instinctively her\r\nadministrative incapacity, Russia thus distinctly shows the effects of\r\nthe influence of German elements in the staff of her administrators.\r\nDuring all the time of her domination over these countries, she left\r\nfull power in the hands of the Baltic barons who--except in some\r\naccidental and temporary cases--have been the administrators and the\r\nreal masters of the land. They took great advantage of this situation,\r\nendeavouring to give the country a German character. Further, they\r\norganised systematic German colonisation, for the realisation of which\r\nBerlin put large sums at their disposal. This colonisation took on\r\nsuch vast proportions and was carried on so openly that it finally\r\nattracted the attention of the Russian Government itself, which, in\r\norder to paralyse its effects, set up Russian colonisation in its turn.\r\nThe latter, however, led to no results, the Russian peasant not being\r\nprepared for the intensive agricultural methods adopted in the country.\r\nThe feelings and leanings of the Baltic nobility have clearly shown\r\nthemselves during the war. It is enough to remember that they offered\r\nto General Hindenburg a third part of their lands for the purpose of\r\ncolonisation. Their leanings were in perfect accord with the aims of\r\nthe Pan-Germans, of whom many were emigrants from the Baltic, and\r\nwho, like Professor Schiemann and P. Rohrbach, have not been playing\r\nan unimportant part. It is extremely interesting to observe that these\r\ntendencies have not ceased with the defeat of Germany. It is known that\r\nthe Germans have promised to Latvia energetic assistance against the\r\nBolsheviki if a right to the land is granted to all the combatants.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that after the war there will be a surplus of population\r\nin Germany, and it is not for nothing that Count Brokdorff-Rantzau\r\ncomplains in one of his notes that it will be difficult to find room\r\nfor this surplus of inhabitants, as it is probable that the principal\r\nStates will close their doors to them. There is no doubt whatever that\r\na large part of this excess of population will go over to the Baltic,\r\nwhere they will find land ready for them and will be received with open\r\narms by the Baltic barons of Pan-German mind. The Russian Government,\r\nas past experience has proved, will be unable to oppose this fresh\r\n_Drang nach Osten_, and if the Lettish people do not possess enough\r\nfreedom of action, that is to say, if there is no independent Latvia,\r\none can be supremely sure that German influence will be very great. On\r\nthe other hand, the resolution of the various Landestags, Landesrats,\r\nand Regentschaftsrats, which have asked for the closest _rapprochement_\r\nwith Germany, militarily and economically, and have offered the ducal\r\ncrown to the Hohenzollern dynasty, leaves no doubt about the direction\r\nin which the sympathies of the Baltic Germans will go. The Baltic is,\r\nin the hands of Russia, a borderland with predominant German interests,\r\na land to which Germany stretches out her hand, a land always ready, at\r\na moment favourable to Pan-Germanism, to detach itself from Russia and\r\npass over to the side of her adversaries. Thus, to be logical in the\r\nmatter of the Baltic States, one must decide, not between Russia and\r\nLatvia, but between the latter and Germany.\r\n\r\nAnd thus the argument of political motives leads to a conclusion which\r\nis not at all to the advantage of Russia’s reconstitution. For the\r\nre-establishment of equilibrium in European politics, Russia is of no\r\nvalue. She is not, to that end, something which should be invented if\r\nshe did not exist.[4]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POLITICAL RÔLE OF THE NEW STATES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to have an absolutely clear idea of the question, it is still\r\nnecessary to look at the other side; _i.e._, to represent to oneself\r\nthe probable policy of the States detached from Russia. We have\r\nalready shown that one cannot expect aggression from these States,\r\nbecause of the relative external weakness of them individually. It is\r\nequally unimaginable that they should form an aggressive alliance,\r\nfor one cannot realise a common aggressive aim for all these States.\r\nConsequently one cannot expect a violation of peace from their side.\r\n\r\nBut taking into account their relative weakness, will these States\r\nnot be subject to envy and aggression on the part of their stronger\r\nneighbours, and will they not in this way, against their will, be the\r\ncause of disturbing the peace? It is necessary to envisage this peril,\r\nbut it is possible to avert it. In this one may rightly rely on the\r\nLeague of Nations in which the small nations put all their hope.\r\n\r\nAssuredly, the League of Nations is just now not strong enough; but,\r\nin view of the general national exhaustion, one cannot expect, as soon\r\nas peace is concluded, aggression against the States which have the\r\nauthority of the Peace Conference on their side. If aggressive forces\r\ngather later, the League of Nations will have had time in the interval\r\nto organise itself definitely and to command moral and material\r\nstrength sufficient to check aggression.\r\n\r\nThere is another way, too, of guaranteeing the security of the new\r\nStates: an alliance between them, or at least between those of them\r\nwhich have access to the Baltic Sea; viz., Finland, Esthonia, Latvia,\r\nLithuania, Poland, and probably White-Russia, an alliance with many\r\ncertain chances of development in one direction or another. Assuredly,\r\nthere are still ancient accounts to be settled between some of these\r\nnations, but common and vital interests are so strong that History will\r\nbe no obstacle in the matter. All these nationalities have always had\r\ncontinual relations with Western civilisation, and there would quickly\r\nand easily be formed between them a community of intellectual and moral\r\ninterests. The economic intercourse between them is also capable of\r\nvast development. For instance, Poland can supply all the other States\r\nwith her coal, and Lithuania can supply the corn which Finland needs.\r\nUndoubtedly, there are common interests between all the above-named\r\nStates in the trade of the Baltic Sea. Each one of them has a natural\r\n_Hinterland_, and, consequently, is vitally interested in the guarantee\r\nof freedom of trade in the Baltic Sea. Besides, the mere political\r\ninterest of common defence is a strong enough basis for an alliance of\r\nall the Baltic States, for they are under the double menace of Germany\r\non one side and Russia on the other. All these States have experienced\r\nin fact the gravity of this menace, and so all will understand the\r\ngreat value of this defensive alliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOMINIUM MARIS BALTICI\r\n\r\n\r\n(Command of the Baltic Sea) has been for centuries a bone of contention\r\nbetween the Northern and Eastern States of Europe. For this the Teutons\r\nhave contended, and Poland, Lithuania, Sweden, Denmark, Russia.\r\nGermany had the same aim, and before the war had nearly reached it.\r\nDuring the whole of history, every State which acquired strength and\r\nauthority in the North or East of Europe, evinced this inevitable\r\nleaning towards possession of the Baltic Sea, and it was only in the\r\nmeasure of its success in that direction that it could play its part as\r\na Great Power, a rôle which ceased the moment the State was deprived\r\nof that DOMINIUM MARIS BALTICI. To give it again to one of\r\nthe coastwise States would mean a fresh menace to the peace of Europe;\r\nbut by putting it into the hands of those to whom it belongs by\r\nnatural right, that is to say, into the common possession of the States\r\nsurrounding that sea, one would remove one of the causes of probable\r\nconflicts in the future of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINE OF PARTITION BETWEEN RUSSIA AND GERMANY\r\n\r\n\r\nFor yet another reason the Baltic States, or rather their alliance,\r\nwill have a great rôle to play--that of a boundary line of economic and\r\npolitical culture between Russia and Germany. This partition--which\r\nmight be called a _cordon sanitaire_--is absolutely indispensable.\r\nGermany’s direct influence on Russia, with no obstacle between them, is\r\na real danger. To the naïve and dreamy soul of the childlike Russian\r\nvillagers, the extreme sociological theories of the West, born from\r\na very complex economic situation, are a direct temptation and a\r\ndangerous poison, as illustrated by M. Lenin’s sealed railway carriage.\r\nThe teachings of German Social Democracy have taken such root in\r\nRussian soil and have produced such a harvest that it has caused much\r\nmerriment to the Teuton Field-Marshals; while to Russia it has brought\r\nextreme abasement and almost irretrievable disaster.\r\n\r\nAnd this is likely to happen again, everywhere and always, whenever a\r\nbackward race, neighbour of another highly developed, would fain borrow\r\nfrom the latter and put into immediate operation “the latest advances\r\nof civilisation.”\r\n\r\nIt is the same in regard to economic relations. Germany, deprived of\r\nher colonies, and lacking sufficient resources in raw materials and\r\nrich markets, will necessarily direct the surplus of her economic\r\nenergy towards Russia, which will easily become a German colony and\r\nsubmit entirely to German influence. In this respect, Germany had\r\nalready arrived at considerable results before the war. She will\r\nwork in the same direction, and after the signing of peace with\r\nstill greater activity, which will assuredly lead to results hardly\r\ndesirable from the political point of view. A Russia invaded by capital\r\nand technical forces from Germany, and a Germany with Russian raw\r\nmaterials and Russia’s market at her disposal, will be such great\r\neconomic powers that each will separately appear a serious menace, and\r\nall the more so if in alliance.\r\n\r\nBut what is more clear and more important is the line of political\r\npartition between Germany and Russia. The political security of Europe\r\nused to be constantly under the menace of an alliance between Russia\r\nand Germany, an alliance which would have radically destroyed the\r\nbalance of power. This menace was in no way artificial but perfectly\r\nreal, and might have been realised at any moment. As we have tried to\r\nprove, it will inevitably reappear with the reconstitution of Russia.\r\nThe vanquished two of this great war will not at once submit to their\r\nfate; both will be discontented and will cogitate ways of improving\r\ntheir situation. This alone is a sufficient basis for a _rapprochement_\r\nor an alliance. Russia will not resist for long the temptation of an\r\nalliance with Germany, of which the leaders beyond the Rhine are\r\nalready openly talking. Consequently, it is necessary to separate\r\nRussia from Germany, that is, to prevent their direct union, and to\r\nthat end it would be impossible to find a more adequate and easy means\r\nthan the _cordon sanitaire_ of the States named. Truth to tell, it\r\nwould be necessary to invent this alliance if it did not force itself\r\ninto being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have arrived at the end of this study and may now summarise.\r\n\r\nThe question of the organisation of the Lettish people in an\r\nindependent State must be decided quickly and definitely. The\r\nrestoration of anything whatever of the _status quo ante_, whether\r\n_de facto_, temporary or indefinite, would serve no purpose because\r\nit would not give to the Lettish people the juridical basis necessary\r\nto the reconstruction of a ruined life. This question must be solved\r\nindependently of the will of the Russian people, because, in\r\nprinciple, the idea that the destiny of any people whatsoever depends\r\non the will of another people, is inadmissible; because also it is\r\nimpossible to foresee when the Russian people will be in a position\r\nto make its will freely known. In definitely deciding the destiny\r\nof Latvia, it is necessary to reject the project of an All-Russian\r\nFederation.\r\n\r\nSuch a federation is impossible. In accordance with the laws of\r\nhistorical continuity, it is impossible to pass from a centralised\r\nState to one of the most complicated and most delicate forms of State\r\norganisation. Besides, the peoples of Russia have no such community\r\nof intellectual, moral and economic interests as might become the\r\nsolid foundation of a free co-existence in one and the same State. The\r\nAll-Russian Federation will either divide itself into different States\r\nor change itself into a centralised State in which the natural rights\r\nof its different peoples will not be guaranteed. The only just solution\r\nof the question of Latvia is the recognition of that country as an\r\nindependent State.\r\n\r\nThis is not only the natural right of the Lettish people. It has long\r\nbeen the object of its permanent and definite leanings, and these are\r\nin harmony with its well-recognised interests.\r\n\r\nThe interests of Russia will in no way suffer from the separation of\r\nLatvia; neither economically, for Latvia will certainly be a better\r\nintermediary between the West and the East than Russia was or would\r\nbe; nor strategically, for Latvia will be a much more conscientious\r\nsentinel on the Baltic Sea than Russia was or would be.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for Russia to claim to re-enter her former boundaries\r\non the necessity of European balance of power, for, as a factor of\r\nequilibrium, Russia has been found wanting, and one can foresee her\r\nfuture complete submission to the economic and political influence of\r\nGermany, as well as to her civilisation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the interests of a lasting peace demand the creation\r\nof a series of independent national States for the peoples inhabiting\r\nthe shores of the Baltic Sea; and, between them, a defensive alliance\r\nfor which there are sufficient grounds in the shape of common\r\neconomic, political and intellectual interests. Such an alliance would\r\nplay at the same time the rôle of the necessary line of demarcation\r\nbetween Russia and Germany. Moreover, it is the only natural solution\r\nof the problem of the _Dominium maris Baltici_, which has been an\r\napple of discord for centuries and has often been the disturber of the\r\nworld’s peace.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE\r\n  TEMPLE PRESS\r\n  LETCHWORTH\r\n  ENGLAND]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n[1] One of the published works of the Russian Political Conference\r\n(from the pen of Mandelstam), specially devoted to the question of\r\nPoland, has received a well-merited refutation in the brilliant\r\npamphlet of M. H. Grappin (_Memorandum on the Application of the\r\nNationalities Principle to the Russian Question_).\r\n\r\nM. Gaston Gaillard, in his book _The Pan-Russian Movement and the\r\nBorderland Peoples_, Paris, 1919, gives a remarkable summary, with full\r\ndocumentary evidence, of the aspirations of the borderland peoples of\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\n[2] P. J. Sahlit, _Devastation of Latvia by the Russian Armies_,\r\nPetrograd, 1917 (in Russian).\r\n\r\n[3] As fear has big eyes, even among fearless people like M. Savinkoff,\r\nit is believed, for instance, that this latter gentleman has found in\r\nthe Bolshevik lines two divisions of Lettish Rifles, _i.e._, 60,000 men\r\n(_Pages Modernes_, No. 1, page 7). If we take into account that many\r\nLetts have fought from the beginning in the ranks of the Czeko-Slovaks,\r\nin the army of Denikin and in that of the North, and remembering that\r\nthe Lettish regiments have suffered great losses during the war,\r\none can only ask with amazement where this great number of Lettish\r\nyouths comes from. No more than 3,500 Letts can be counted among the\r\nBolsheviki, all the rest are a vision inspired by fear.\r\n\r\n[4] Details on this point will be found in the pamphlet of Count Jean\r\nTarnovsky, _La Menace Allemande et le Péril Russe_, Imprimerie Moderne,\r\n17, rue Duler, Biarritz, 1919.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Latvia & Russia, by Arveds Karlis Kristaps Bergs",
