VIII)\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Introduction_. Late in the year 343 (some time after the acquittal of\r\nAeschines) Philip invaded Epirus, made Alexander, brother of his wife\r\nOlympias, king of the Molossi instead of Arybbas, and so secured, his\r\nown influence in that region. Arybbas was honourably received at\r\nAthens. Philip next threatened Ambracia and Leucas, which were colonies\r\nof Corinth, and promised to restore Naupactus, which was in the hands\r\nof the Achaeans, to the Aetolians. But Athens sent Demosthenes,\r\nHegesippus, Polyeuctus and others to rouse the Corinthians to\r\nresistance, and also dispatched a force of citizens to Acarnania to\r\nhelp in the defence against Philip. Philip thereupon returned, captured\r\nEchinus and Nicaea on the Malian Gulf, and established a tetrarch in\r\neach division of Thessaly (343 B.C., or early in 342). In 342\r\nPhilistides was established, by Philip's influence, as tyrant at Oreus\r\nin Euboea (as Cleitarchus had been at Eretria in the preceding year),\r\nand the democratic leader Euphraeus committed suicide in prison.[1] The\r\ntown of Chalcis, however, under Callias and Taurosthenes, remained\r\nfriendly to Athens, and made a treaty of alliance with her.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time a controversy, begun in the previous year, in\r\nregard to Halonnesus, was renewed. This island had belonged to Athens,\r\nbut had been occupied by pirates. At some time not recorded (but\r\nprobably since the Peace of 346) Philip had expelled the pirates and\r\ntaken possession of the island. He now sent a letter, offering to give\r\nHalonnesus to Athens, but not to _give it back_ (since this would\r\nconcede their right to it); or else to submit the dispute to\r\narbitration. He also offered to discuss a treaty for the settlement of\r\nprivate disputes between Athenians and Macedonians, and to concert\r\nmeasures with Athens for clearing the Aegean of pirates. He was willing\r\nto extend the advantages of the Peace to other Greek States, but not to\r\nagree that he and Athens should respectively possess 'what was their\r\nown', instead of 'what they held'; though he was ready to submit to\r\narbitration in regard to Cardia and other disputed places. He again\r\ndenied having made the promises attributed to him, and asked for the\r\npunishment of those who slandered him. Hegesippus replied in an extant\r\nspeech ('On Halonnesus'), while Demosthenes insisted that no impartial\r\narbitrator could possibly be found. Philip's terms in regard to\r\nHalonnesus were refused, but the Athenian claim to the island was not\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\nPhilip spent the greater part of 342 and 341 in Thrace, mainly in the\r\nvalley of the Hebrus, where he endured very great hardships through the\r\nwinter, and founded colonies of Macedonian soldiers, the chief of these\r\nbeing Philippopolis and Cabyle. He also entered into relations with the\r\nGetae, beyond the Haemus, and garrisoned Apollonia on the Euxine. These\r\noperations were all preparatory to his projected attack upon Byzantium.\r\n(Byzantium and Athens were at this time on unfriendly terms, owing to\r\nthe part taken by the latter in the Social War.)\r\n\r\nBut the immediate subject of the present Speech was the state of\r\naffairs in the Chersonese in 342. The Chersonese (with the exception of\r\nCardia) had been secured for Athens in 357, but had been threatened by\r\nPhilip in 352,[2] when he made alliance with Cardia, and forced the\r\nneighbouring Thracian Prince Cersobleptes to submit. Soon after the\r\nPeace of Philocrates, Athens sent settlers to the Chersonese under\r\nDiopeithes. Cardia alone refused to receive them, and Diopeithes, with\r\na mercenary force, prepared to compel the Cardians to admit them; while\r\nPhilip sent troops to hold the town, and complained to Athens in\r\nthreatening terms of the actions of Diopeithes, and more particularly\r\nof an inroad which Diopeithes had made upon Philip's territory in\r\nThrace. Diopeithes had been ill-supported with money and men by Athens,\r\nand had had recourse to piratical actions, in order to obtain supplies,\r\nthus arousing some indignation at Athens; but the prospect of the heavy\r\nexpenditure which would be necessary, if an expedition were sent to his\r\naid, was also unattractive. Demosthenes, however, proposed that\r\nDiopeithes should be vigorously supported, on the ground that Philip\r\nwas really at war with Athens, and that this was not the time to\r\ninterfere with the general who alone was pushing the Athenian cause.\r\nThe speech was delivered early in the spring of 341. It is a\r\nmasterpiece of oratory, at once statesmanlike and impassioned, and\r\nshows a complete command of every variety of tone. The latter part of\r\nit contains a strong denunciation of the Macedonian party in Athens, a\r\ndefence of the orator's own career, and an urgent demand for the\r\npunishment of disloyalty. At the same time Demosthenes does not embody\r\nthe policy which he advises in any formal motion. For this we have to\r\nwait for the Third Philippic.]\r\n\r\n\r\n{1} It was the duty, men of Athens, of every speaker not to allow\r\neither malice or favour to influence any speech which he might make,\r\nbut simply to declare the policy which he considered to be the best,\r\nparticularly when your deliberations were concerned with public affairs\r\nof great importance. But since there are some who are led on to address\r\nyou, partly out of contentiousness, partly from causes which I need not\r\ndiscuss, it is for you, men of Athens--you, the People--to dismiss all\r\nother considerations, and both in the votes that you give and in the\r\nmeasures that you take to attend solely to what you believe to be for\r\nthe good of the city. {2} Now our present anxiety arises out of affairs\r\nin the Chersonese, and the campaign, now in its eleventh month, which\r\nPhilip is conducting in Thrace. But most of the speeches which we have\r\nheard have been about the acts and intentions of Diopeithes. For my\r\npart, I conceive that all charges made against any one who is amenable\r\nto the laws and can be punished by you when you will are matters which\r\nyou are free to investigate, either immediately or after an interval,\r\nas you think fit; and there is no occasion for me or any one else to\r\nuse strong language about them. {3} But all those advantages which an\r\nactual enemy of the city, with a large force in the Hellespont, is\r\ntrying to snatch from you, and which, if we once fall behind-hand, we\r\nshall no longer be able to recover--these, surely, are matters upon\r\nwhich our interest demands that our plans be formed and our\r\npreparations made with the utmost dispatch; and that no clamour, no\r\naccusations about other matters, be allowed to drive us from this point.\r\n\r\n{4} Often as I am surprised at the assertions which are habitually made\r\nin your presence, nothing, men of Athens, has surprised me more than\r\nthe remark which I heard only lately in the Council--that one who\r\nadvises you ought, forsooth, to advise you plainly either to go to war\r\nor to keep the peace. {5} Very good.[3] If Philip is remaining\r\ninactive, if he is keeping nothing that is ours, in violation of the\r\nPeace, if he is not organizing all mankind against us, there is nothing\r\nmore to be said--we have simply to observe the Peace; and I see that,\r\nfor your part, you are quite ready to do so. But what if the oath that\r\nwe swore, and the terms upon which we made the Peace, stand inscribed\r\nfor our eyes to see? {6} What if it is proved that from the outset,\r\nbefore Diopeithes sailed from Athens with the settlers who are now\r\naccused of having brought about the war, Philip wrongfully seized many\r\nof our possessions--and here, unrepealed, are your resolutions charging\r\nhim with this--and that all along he has been uninterruptedly seizing\r\nthe possessions of the other Hellenic and foreign peoples, and uniting\r\ntheir resources against us? What is _then_ the meaning of the statement\r\nthat we ought either to go to war or to keep the Peace? {7} For we have\r\nno choice in the matter: nothing remains open to us but the most\r\nrighteous and most necessary of all acts--the act that they\r\ndeliberately refuse to consider--I mean the act of retaliation against\r\nthe aggressor: unless indeed, they intend to argue that, so long as\r\nPhilip keeps away from Attica and the Peiraeus, he does the city no\r\nwrong and is not committing acts of war. {8} But if _this_ is their\r\ncriterion of right and wrong, if _this_ is their definition of peace,\r\nthen, although what they say is iniquitous, intolerable, and\r\ninconsistent with your security, as all must see, at the same time\r\nthese very statements are actually contradictory of the charges which\r\nthey are making against Diopeithes. {9} Why, I beg to ask,[n] are we to\r\ngive Philip full leave to act in whatever way he chooses, so long as he\r\ndoes not touch Attica, when Diopeithes is not to be allowed even to\r\nassist the Thracians, without being accused of initiating war? But even\r\nif this inconsistency is brought home to them, still, we are told, the\r\nconduct of the mercenaries in ravaging the Hellespontine country is\r\noutrageous, and Diopeithes has no right to drive the vessels to\r\nshore,[n] and ought to be stopped. {10} I grant it: let it be done: I\r\nhave nothing to say against it. Yet nevertheless, if their advice is\r\ngenuinely based on considerations of right, and right alone, I consider\r\nthat they are bound to prove that, as surely as they are seeking to\r\nbreak up the force on which _Athens_ at present relies, by slandering\r\nits commander to you when he tries to provide funds to support it, so\r\nsurely _Philip's_ force will be disbanded if you accept their advice.\r\nIf they fail to prove this, you must consider that they are simply\r\nsetting the city once more upon the same course which has already\r\nresulted in the utter ruin of her fortunes. {11} For surely you know\r\nthat nothing in the world has contributed so much to Philip's\r\nsuccesses, as his being always first on the scene of action. With a\r\nstanding force always about him, and knowing beforehand what he intends\r\nto do, he suddenly falls upon whomsoever he pleases: while we wait\r\nuntil we learn that something is happening, and only then, in a\r\nturmoil, make our preparations. {12} It follows, of course, that every\r\nposition which he has attacked, he holds in undisturbed possession;\r\nwhile we are all behindhand; all our expenditure proves to have been so\r\nmuch useless waste; we have displayed our hostility and our desire to\r\ncheck him; but we are too late for action, and so we add disgrace to\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\n{13} You must therefore not fail to recognize, men of Athens, that now,\r\nas before, all else that you hear consists of mere words and pretexts;\r\nand that the real aim of all that is being done is to secure that you\r\nmay remain at home, that Athens may have no force outside the city, and\r\nthat thus Philip may give effect to all his desires without let or\r\nhindrance. Consider, in the first place, what is actually occurring at\r\nthe present moment. {14}  He is at present passing the time[n] in\r\nThrace, with a great army under him; and, as we are told by those who\r\nare on the spot,[n] he is sending for a large addition to it from\r\nMacedonia and Thessaly. Now if he waits for the Etesian winds,[n] and\r\nthen goes to Byzantium and besieges it, tell me first whether you think\r\nthat the Byzantines will persist in their present infatuation,[n] and\r\nwill not call upon you and entreat you to go to their aid? {15} I do\r\nnot think so. Why, I believe that they would open their gates to men\r\nwhom they distrust even more than they distrust you (if such exist),\r\nrather than surrender the city to Philip--supposing, that is, that he\r\ndoes not capture them first. And then, if we are unable to set sail\r\nfrom Athens, and if there are no forces there on the spot to help them,\r\nnothing can prevent their destruction. {16} 'Of course,' you say, 'for\r\nthe men are possessed, and their infatuation passes all bounds.' Very\r\ntrue; and yet they must be preserved; for the interests of Athens\r\nrequire it. And besides, we cannot by any means be certain that he will\r\nnot invade the Chersonese. Indeed, if we are to judge by the letter\r\nwhich he has sent to you, he there says that he _will_ punish the\r\nsettlers[n] in the Chersonese. {17} If then the army that is now formed\r\nthere is in existence, it will be able to help the Chersonese, and to\r\ninjure some part of Philip's country. But when once it is dissolved,\r\nwhat shall we do if he marches against the Chersonese? 'We shall of\r\ncourse put Diopeithes on his trial.' And how will that improve our\r\nposition? 'Well, we should go to the rescue from Athens ourselves.'\r\nWhat if the winds make it impossible? {18} 'But, of course, he will not\r\nreally get there.' And who can guarantee that? Do you realize, men of\r\nAthens, or take into account, what the coming season of the year is,\r\nthe season against which some think you ought to evacuate the\r\nHellespont and hand it over to Philip? What if, when he leaves Thrace,\r\nhe does not go near the Chersonese or Byzantium at all--for this, too,\r\nis a possibility which you must consider--but comes to Chalcis[n] or\r\nMegara, just as he lately came to Oreus? Is it better to resist him\r\nhere, and to allow the war to come into Attica, or to provide something\r\nto keep him busy there? The latter course is surely the better.\r\n\r\n{19} Realizing these things, therefore, as you all must, and taking due\r\naccount of them, you must not, Heaven knows, look askance at the force\r\nwhich Diopeithes is trying to provide for Athens, or attempt to disband\r\nit. You must yourselves prepare another force to support it: you must\r\nhelp him freely with money, and give him in all other respects your\r\nloyal co-operation. {20} If Philip were asked to say whether he would\r\nwish these soldiers who are now with Diopeithes--describe them as you\r\nwill, for I in no way dispute your description--to be prosperous and in\r\nhigh favour with the Athenians, and to be augmented in numbers by the\r\nco-operation of the city; or whether he would rather see them broken up\r\nand destroyed in consequence of calumnious charges against them; he\r\nwould prefer, I imagine, the latter alternative. Can it then be, that\r\nthere are men among us here who are trying to bring about the very\r\nthing that Philip would pray Heaven for? And if so, do you need to seek\r\nany further for the cause of the total ruin of the city's fortunes?\r\n\r\n{21} I wish, therefore, to examine without reserve the present crisis\r\nof our affairs, to inquire what we ourselves are now doing, and how we\r\nare dealing with it. We do not wish to contribute funds, nor to serve\r\nwith the forces in person; we cannot keep our hands from the public\r\nrevenues;[n] we do not give the contributions of the allies[n] to\r\nDiopeithes, nor do we approve of such supplies as he raises for\r\nhimself; {22} but we look malignantly at him, we ask whence he gets\r\nthem, what he intends to do, and every possible question of that kind:\r\nand yet we are still not willing to confine ourselves to our own\r\naffairs, in consequence of the attitude which we have adopted; we still\r\npraise with our lips those who uphold the dignity of the city, though\r\nin our acts we are fighting on the side of their opponents. {23} Now\r\nwhenever any one rises to speak, you always put to him the question\r\n'What are we to do?' I wish to put to _you_ the question, 'What are we\r\nto _say_?' For if you will neither contribute, nor serve in person, nor\r\nleave the public funds alone, nor grant him the contributions, nor let\r\nhim get what he can for himself, nor yet confine yourselves to your own\r\naffairs, I do not know what I can say. For when you give such licence\r\nto those who desire to make charges and accusations, that you listen to\r\nthem even when they denounce him by anticipation for his alleged\r\nintentions--well, what _can_ one say?\r\n\r\n{24} The possible effect of this is a matter which some of you require\r\nto understand, and I will speak without reserve; for indeed I could not\r\nspeak otherwise. All the commanders who have ever yet sailed from\r\nAthens--if I am wrong, I consent to any penalty that you\r\nplease[n]--take money from the Chians, from the Erythraeans,[n] from\r\nany people from whom they can severally get it--I mean, any of the\r\nAsiatic settlers who are now in question. {25} Those who have one or\r\ntwo ships take less, those who have a larger force take more. And those\r\nwho give to them do not give either little or much for nothing; they\r\nare not so insane: in fact, with these sums they buy immunity from\r\ninjury for the merchants who sail from their ports, freedom from\r\npiracy, the convoying of their vessels, and so on. They call the gifts\r\n'benevolences',[n] and that is the name given to the sums thus\r\nobtained. {26} And in the present case, when Diopeithes is there with\r\nhis army, it is obvious that all these peoples will give him money.\r\nFrom what other source do you imagine that a general can maintain his\r\ntroops, when he has received nothing from you, and has no resources\r\nfrom which he can pay his men? Will money drop from the sky? Of course\r\nnot. He subsists upon what he can collect or beg or borrow. {27} The\r\nreal effect, therefore, of the accusations made against him here, is\r\nsimply to warn every one that they should refuse to give him anything,\r\nsince he is to pay the penalty for his very intentions, not to speak of\r\nany action that he may have taken or any success that he may have\r\nachieved. That is the only meaning of the cry that 'he is preparing a\r\nblockade', or 'he is surrendering[n] the Hellenes'. Do any of his\r\ncritics care about the Hellenes who live in Asia? {28} Were it so, they\r\nwould be more thoughtful for the rest of mankind than for their own\r\ncountry. And the proposal to send another general to the Hellespont\r\namounts to no more than this. For if Diopeithes is acting outrageously\r\nand is driving the vessels to shore, then, gentlemen, one little\r\nwax-tablet[n] is enough to put an end to it all: and what the laws\r\ncommand is that for these offences we should impeach the\r\nwrong-doers--not that we should keep a watch upon our own forces at\r\nsuch expense and with so many ships.[n] {29} Such insanity really\r\npasses all bounds. No! Against the enemy whom we cannot arrest and\r\nrender amenable to the laws, it is both right and necessary to maintain\r\na force, to send war-ships, and to contribute war-funds: but against\r\none of ourselves, a decree, an impeachment, a dispatch-boat[n] will\r\nanswer our purpose. These are the means which sensible men would use:\r\nthe policy of the other side is the policy of men whose spitefulness[n]\r\nis ruining your fortunes. {30} And that there should be some such men,\r\nbad though it is, is not the worst. No! for you who sit there are\r\nalready in such a frame of mind, that if any one comes forward and says\r\nthat Diopeithes is the cause of all the mischief, or Chares,[n] or\r\nAristophon,[n] or any Athenian citizen that he happens to name, you at\r\nonce agree, and clamorously declare that he is right; {31} but if any\r\none comes forward and tells you the truth, and says, 'Men of Athens,\r\nthis is nonsense. It is Philip that is the cause of all this mischief\r\nand trouble; for if he were quiet, the city would have nothing to\r\ndisturb her,' you cannot, indeed, deny the truth of his words, but you\r\nseem, I think, to be annoyed, as though you were losing something.[n]\r\n{32} And the cause of these things is this--and I beseech you, in\r\nHeaven's name, to let me speak unreservedly, when I am speaking for\r\nyour true good--that some of your politicians have contrived that you\r\nshould be terrifying and severe in your assemblies, but easy-going and\r\ncontemptible in your preparations for war. And accordingly, if any one\r\nnames as the culprit some one whom you know you can arrest in your own\r\nmidst, you agree and you wish to act; but if one is named whom you must\r\nfirst master by force of arms, if you are to punish him at all, you are\r\nat a loss, I fancy, what to do, and you are vexed when this is brought\r\nhome to you. {33} For your politicians, men of Athens, should have\r\ntreated you in exactly the opposite way to this; they should train you\r\nto be kind and sympathetic in your assemblies; for there it is with the\r\nmembers of your own body and your own allies that your case is argued:\r\nbut your terrors and your severity should be displayed in your\r\npreparations for war, where the struggle is with your enemies and your\r\nrivals. {34} As it is, by their popular speeches, and by courting your\r\nfavour to excess, they have brought you into such a condition that,\r\nwhile in your assemblies you give yourselves airs and enjoy their\r\nflattery, listening to nothing but what is meant to please you, in the\r\nworld of facts and events you are in the last extremity of peril.\r\nImagine, in God's name, what would happen, if the Hellenes were to call\r\nyou to account for the opportunities which, in your indolence, you have\r\nnow let pass, and were to put to you the question, {35} 'Is it true,\r\nmen of Athens, that you send envoys to us on every possible occasion,\r\nto tell us of Philip's designs against ourselves and all the Hellenes,\r\nand of the duty of keeping guard against the man, and to warn us in\r\nevery way?' We should have to confess that it was true. We do act thus.\r\n'Then,' they would proceed, 'is it true, you most contemptible of all\r\nmen, that though the man has been away for ten months, {36} and has\r\nbeen cut off from every possibility of returning home, by illness and\r\nby winter and by wars, you have neither liberated Euboea nor recovered\r\nany of your own possessions? Is it true that you have remained at home,\r\nunoccupied and healthy--if such a word can be used of men who behave\r\nthus--and have seen him set up two tyrants in Euboea, one to serve as a\r\nfortress directly menacing Attica, the other to watch Sciathus; {37}\r\nand that you have not even rid yourselves of these dangers--granted\r\nthat you did not want to do anything more--but have let them be?\r\nObviously you have retired in his favour, and have made it evident that\r\nif he dies ten times over, you will not make any move the more. Why\r\ntrouble us then with your embassies and your accusations?' If they\r\nspeak thus to us, what will be our answer? What shall we say,\r\nAthenians? I do not see what we can say.\r\n\r\n{38} Now there are some who imagine that they confute a speaker, as\r\nsoon as they have asked him the question, 'What then are we to do?' I\r\nwill first give them this answer--the most just and true of all--'Do\r\nnot do what you are doing now.' {39} But at the same time I will give\r\nthem a minute and detailed reply; and then let them show that their\r\nwillingness to act upon it is not less than their eagerness to\r\ninterrogate. First, men of Athens, you must thoroughly make up your\r\nminds to the fact that Philip is at war with Athens, and has broken the\r\nPeace--you must cease to lay the blame at one another's doors--and that\r\nhe is evilly-disposed and hostile to the whole city, down to the very\r\nground on which it is built; {40} nay, I will go further--hostile to\r\nevery single man in the city, even to those who are most sure that they\r\nare winning his favour. (If you think otherwise, consider the case of\r\nEuthycrates[n] and Lasthenes of Olynthus, who fancied that they were on\r\nthe most friendly terms with him, but, after they had betrayed their\r\ncity, suffered the most utter ruin of all.) But his hostilities and\r\nintrigues are aimed at nothing so much as at our constitution, whose\r\noverthrow is the very first object in the world to him. {41} And in a\r\nsense it is natural that he should aim at this. For he knows very well\r\nthat even if he becomes master of all the rest of the world, he can\r\nretain nothing securely, so long as you are a democracy; and that if he\r\nchances to stumble anywhere, as may often happen to a man, all the\r\nelements which are now forced into union with him will come and take\r\nrefuge with you. {42} For though you are not yourselves naturally\r\nadapted for aggrandizement or the usurpation of empire, you have the\r\nart of preventing any other from seizing power and of taking it from\r\nhim when he has it; and in every respect you are ready to give trouble\r\nto those who are ambitious of dominion, and to lead all men forth into\r\nliberty. And so he would not have Freedom, from her home in Athens,\r\nwatching for every opportunity he may offer--far from it--and there is\r\nnothing unsound or careless in his reasoning. {43} The first essential\r\npoint, therefore, is this--that you conceive him to be the\r\nirreconcilable foe of your constitution and of democracy: for unless\r\nyou are inwardly convinced of this, you will not be willing to take an\r\nactive interest in the situation. Secondly, you must realize clearly\r\nthat all the plans which he is now so busily contriving are in the\r\nnature of preparations against this country; and wherever any one\r\nresists him, he there resists him on our behalf. {44} For surely no one\r\nis so simple as to imagine that when Philip is covetous of the wretched\r\nhamlets[n] of Thrace--one can give no other name to Drongilum, Cabyle,\r\nMasteira, and the places which he is now seizing--and when to get these\r\nplaces he is enduring heavy labours, hard winters, and the extremity of\r\ndanger;--{45} no one can imagine, I say, that the harbours and the\r\ndockyards, and the ships of the Athenians, the produce of your\r\nsilver-mines, and your huge revenue, have no attraction for him, or\r\nthat he will leave you in possession of these, while he winters in the\r\nvery pit of destruction[n] for the sake of the millet and the spelt in\r\nthe silos[n] of Thrace. No, indeed! It is to get these into his power\r\nthat he pursues both his operations in Thrace and all his other\r\ndesigns. {46} What then, as sensible men, must you do? Knowing and\r\nrealizing your position, as you do, you must lay aside this excessive,\r\nthis irremediable[n] indolence: you must contribute funds, and require\r\nthem from your allies; you must so provide and act, that this force\r\nwhich is now assembled may be held together; in order that, as Philip\r\nhas the force in readiness that is to injure and enslave all the\r\nHellenes, you may have in readiness that which shall preserve and\r\nsuccour them. {47} You cannot effect by isolated expeditions any of the\r\nthings which must be effected. You must organize a force, and provide\r\nmaintenance for it, and paymasters, and a staff of servants; and when\r\nyou have taken such steps as will ensure the strictest possible watch\r\nbeing kept over the funds, you must hold these officials accountable\r\nfor the money, and the general for the actual operations. If you act\r\nthus, and honestly make up your minds to take this course, you will\r\neither compel Philip to observe a righteous peace and remain in his own\r\nland--and no greater blessing could you obtain than that--or you will\r\nfight him on equal terms.\r\n\r\n{48} It may be thought that this policy demands heavy expenditure, and\r\ngreat exertions and trouble. That is true indeed; but let the objector\r\ntake into account what the consequences to the city must be, if he is\r\nunwilling to assent to this policy, and he will find that the ready\r\nperformance of duty brings its reward. {49} If indeed some god is\r\noffering us his guarantee--for no human guarantee would be sufficient\r\nin so great a matter--that if you remain at peace and let everything\r\nslide, Philip will not in the end come and attack yourselves; then,\r\nalthough, before God and every Heavenly Power, it would be unworthy of\r\nyou and of the position that the city holds, and of the deeds of our\r\nforefathers, to abandon all the rest of the Hellenes to slavery for the\r\nsake of our own ease--although, for my part, I would rather have died\r\nthan have suggested such a thing--yet, if another proposes it and\r\nconvinces you, let it be so: do not defend yourselves: let everything\r\ngo. {50} But if no one entertains such a belief, if we all know that\r\nthe very opposite is true, and that the wider the mastery we allow him\r\nto gain, the more difficult and powerful a foe we shall have to deal\r\nwith, what further subterfuge is open to us? Why do we delay? {51} When\r\nshall we ever be willing, men of Athens, to do our duty? 'When we are\r\ncompelled,' you say. But the hour of compulsion, as the word is applied\r\nto free men, is not only here already, but has long passed; and we must\r\nsurely pray that the compulsion which is put upon slaves may not come\r\nupon us. And what is the difference? It is this--that for a free man\r\nthe greatest compelling force is his shame at the course which events\r\nare taking--I do not know what greater we can imagine; but the slave is\r\ncompelled by blows and bodily tortures, which I pray may never fall to\r\nour lot; it is not fit to speak of them.\r\n\r\n{52} I would gladly tell you the whole story, and show how certain\r\npersons are working for your ruin by their policy. I pass over,\r\nhowever, every point but this. Whenever any question of our relations\r\nwith Philip arises, at once some one stands up and talks of the\r\nblessings of peace, of the difficulty of maintaining a large force, and\r\nof designs on the part of certain persons to plunder our funds; with\r\nother tales of the same kind, which enable them to delay your action,\r\nand give Philip time to do what he wishes unopposed. {53} What is the\r\nresult? For you the result is your leisure, and a respite from\r\nimmediate action--advantages which I fear you will some day feel to\r\nhave cost you dear; and for them it is the favour they win, and the\r\nwages for these services. But I am sure that there is no need to\r\npersuade you to keep the Peace--you sit here fully persuaded. It is the\r\nman who is committing acts of war that we need to persuade; for if he\r\nis persuaded, you are ready enough. {54} Nor is it the expenditure\r\nwhich is to ensure our preservation that ought to distress us, but the\r\nfate which is in prospect for us, if we are not willing to take this\r\naction: while the threatened 'plunder of our funds' is to be prevented\r\nby the proposal of some safeguard which will render them secure, not by\r\nthe abandonment of our interests. {55} And even so, men of Athens, I\r\nfeel indignant at the very fact that some of you are so much pained at\r\nthe prospect of the plunder of our funds, when you have it in your\r\npower both to protect them and to punish the culprits, and yet feel no\r\npain when Philip is seizing all Hellas piecemeal for his plunder, and\r\nseizing it to strengthen himself against you. {56} What then is the\r\nreason, men of Athens, that though Philip's campaigns, his aggressions,\r\nhis seizure of cities, are so unconcealed, none of my opponents has\r\never said that _he_ was bringing about war? Why is it those who advise\r\nyou not to allow it, not to make these sacrifices, that they accuse,\r\nand say that _they_ will be the cause of the war? I will inform you.\r\n{57} It is because[n] they wish to divert the anger which you are\r\nlikely to show, if you suffer at all from the war, on to the heads of\r\nthose who are giving you the best advice in your own interests. They\r\nwant you to sit and try such persons, instead of resisting Philip; and\r\nthey themselves are to be the prosecutors, instead of paying the\r\npenalty for their present actions. That is the meaning of their\r\nassertion that there are some here, forsooth, who want to bring about\r\nwar. {58} That is the real point of these allegations of\r\nresponsibility. But this I know beyond all doubt--that without waiting\r\nfor any one in Athens to propose the declaration of war, Philip has not\r\nonly taken many other possessions of ours, but has just now sent an\r\nexpedition to Cardia. If, in spite of this, we wish to pretend that he\r\nis not making war on us, he would be the most senseless man living,\r\nwere he to attempt to convince us of our error. {59} But what shall we\r\nsay, when his attack is made directly upon ourselves? He of course will\r\nsay that he is not at war with us--just as he was not at war with\r\nOreus,[n] when his soldiers were in the land; nor with the\r\nPheraeans,[n] before that, when he was assaulting their walls; nor with\r\nthe Olynthians, first of all, until he and his army were actually\r\nwithin their territory. Or shall we still say that those who urge\r\nresistance are bringing about war? If so, all that is left to us is\r\nslavery. If we may neither offer resistance, nor yet be suffered to\r\nremain at peace, no other compromise[n] is possible. {60} And further,\r\nthe issues at stake are not for you merely what they are for other\r\nstates. What Philip desires is not your subjection, but your utter\r\nannihilation. For he knows full well that you will never consent to be\r\nhis slaves, and that even if you were willing, you would not know the\r\nway, accustomed as you are to govern; and he knows that you will be\r\nable to give him more trouble, if you get the opportunity, than all the\r\nrest of the world. {61} The struggle, then, is a struggle for\r\nexistence; and as such you ought to think of it: and you should show\r\nyour abhorrence of those who have sold themselves to Philip by beating\r\nthem to death. For it is impossible, utterly impossible, to master your\r\nenemies outside the city, before you punish your enemies in the city\r\nitself. {62} Whence comes it, think you, that he is insulting us now\r\n(for his conduct seems to me to be nothing less than this), and that\r\nwhile he at least deceives all other peoples by doing them favours, he\r\nis using threats against you without more ado? For instance, he enticed\r\nthe Thessalians by large gifts into their present servitude; and words\r\ncannot describe how greatly he deceived the Olynthians at first by the\r\ngift of Poteidaea and much beside. {63} At this moment he is alluring\r\nthe Thebans, by delivering up Boeotia to them, and ridding them of a\r\nlong and arduous campaign. Each of these peoples has first reaped some\r\nadvantage, before falling into those calamities which some of them have\r\nalready suffered, as all the world knows, and some are destined to\r\nsuffer whenever their time comes. But as for yourselves, to pass over\r\nall that you have been robbed of at an earlier period,[n] what\r\ndeception, what robbery have been practised upon you in the very act of\r\nmaking the Peace! {64} Have not the Phocians, and Thermopylae, and the\r\nThracian seaboard--Doriscus, Serrhium, Cersobleptes himself--been taken\r\nfrom you? Does not Philip at this moment occupy the city of the\r\nCardians, and avow it openly? Why is it then, that he behaves as he\r\ndoes to all others, and so differently to you? Because yours is the one\r\ncity in the world where men are permitted to speak on behalf of the\r\nenemy without fear; because here a man may take bribes, and still\r\naddress you with impunity, even when you have been robbed of your own.\r\nIn Olynthus it was only safe to take Philip's side when the people of\r\nOlynthus as a whole had shared Philip's favours, and was enjoying the\r\npossession of Poteidaea. {65} In Thessaly it was only safe to take\r\nPhilip's side when the Thessalian commons had shared Philip's favours;\r\nfor he had expelled the tyrants for them, and restored to them their\r\nAmphictyonic position. In Thebes it was not safe, until he had restored\r\nBoeotia to Thebes and annihilated the Phocians. {66} But at\r\nAthens--though Philip has not only robbed you of Amphipolis and the\r\nterritory of the Cardians, but has turned Euboea into a fortress\r\noverlooking your country, and is now on his way to attack Byzantium--at\r\nAthens it _is_ safe to speak in Philip's interest. Aye, and you know\r\nthat, of such speakers, some who were poor are rapidly growing rich;\r\nand some who were without name or fame are becoming famous and\r\ndistinguished, while you, on the other hand, are becoming inglorious\r\ninstead of famous, bankrupt instead of wealthy. For a city's wealth\r\nconsists, I imagine, in allies, confidence, loyalty--and of all these\r\nyou are bankrupt. {67} And because you are indifferent to these\r\nadvantages, and let them drift away from you, he has become prosperous\r\nand powerful, and formidable to all, Hellenes and foreigners alike;\r\nwhile you are deserted and humbled, with a splendid profusion of\r\ncommodities in your market, and a contemptible lack of all those things\r\nwith which you should have been provided. But I observe that certain\r\nspeakers do not follow the same principles in the advice which they\r\ngive you, as they follow for themselves. _You_, they tell you, ought to\r\nremain quiet, even when you are wronged; but _they_ cannot remain quiet\r\nin your presence, even when no one is wronging them.\r\n\r\n{68} But now some one or other comes forward and says, 'Ah, but you\r\nwill not move a motion or take any risk. You are a poor-spirited\r\ncoward.' Bold, offensive, shameless, I am not, and I trust I may never\r\nbe; and yet I think I have more courage than very many of your dashing\r\nstatesmen. {69} For one, men of Athens, who overlooks all that the\r\ncity's interest demands--who prosecutes, confiscates, gives,\r\naccuses--does so not from any bravery, but because in the popular\r\ncharacter of his speeches and public actions he has a guarantee of his\r\npersonal safety, and therefore is bold without risk. But one who in\r\nacting for the best sets himself in many ways against your wishes--who\r\nnever speaks to please, but always to advise what is best; one who\r\nchooses a policy in which more issues must be decided by chance than by\r\ncalculation, and yet makes himself responsible to you for both--that is\r\nthe courageous man, {70} and such is the citizen who is of value to his\r\ncountry, rather than those who, to gain an ephemeral popularity, have\r\nruined the supreme interests of the city. So far am I from envying\r\nthese men, or thinking them worthy citizens of their country, that if\r\nany one were to ask me to say, what good _I_ had really done to the\r\ncity, although, men of Athens, I could tell how often I had been\r\ntrierarch and choregus,[n] how I had contributed funds, ransomed\r\nprisoners, and done other like acts of generosity, I would mention none\r\nof these things; {71} I would say only that my policy is not one of\r\nmeasures like theirs--that although, like others, I could make\r\naccusations and shower favours and confiscate property and do all that\r\nmy opponents do, I have never to this day set myself to do any of these\r\nthings; I have been influenced neither by gain nor by ambition; but I\r\ncontinue to give the advice which sets me below many others in your\r\nestimation, but which must make you greater, if you will listen to it;\r\nfor so much, perhaps, I may say without offence. {72} Nor, I think,\r\nshould I be acting fairly as a citizen, if I devised such political\r\nmeasures as would at once make me the first man in Athens, and you the\r\nlast of all peoples. As the measures of a loyal politician develop, the\r\ngreatness of his country should develop with them; and it is the thing\r\nwhich is best, not the thing which is easiest, that every speaker\r\nshould advocate. Nature will find the way to the easiest course\r\nunaided. To the best, the words and the guidance of the loyal citizen\r\nmust show the way.\r\n\r\n{73} I have heard it remarked before now, that though what I _say_ is\r\nalways what is best, still I never contribute anything but words;\r\nwhereas the city needs work of some practical kind. I will tell you\r\nwithout any concealment my own sentiments on this matter. There _is_ no\r\nwork that can be demanded of any of your public advisers, except that\r\nhe should advise what is best; and I think I can easily show you that\r\nthis is so. {74} No doubt you know how the great Timotheus[n] delivered\r\na speech to the effect that you ought to go to the rescue and save the\r\nEuboeans, when the Thebans were trying to reduce them to servitude; and\r\nhow, in the course of his speech, he spoke somewhat in this\r\nstrain:--'What?' said he, 'when you actually have the Thebans in the\r\nisland, do you debate what you are to do with them, and how you are to\r\nact? Will you not cover the sea with warships, men of Athens? Will you\r\nnot rise from your seats and go instantly to the Peiraeus and launch\r\nyour vessels?' {75} So Timotheus spoke, and you acted as he bade you;\r\nand through his speech and your action the work was done. But if he had\r\ngiven you the best possible advice (as in fact he did), and you had\r\nlapsed into indolence and paid no attention to it, would the city have\r\nachieved any of the results which followed on that occasion?\r\nImpossible! And so it is with all that I say to-day, and with all that\r\nthis or that speaker may say. For the actions you must look to\r\nyourselves; from the speaker you must require that he give you the best\r\ncounsel that he can.[n]\r\n\r\n{76} I desire now to sum up my advice and to leave the platform. I say\r\nthat we must contribute funds, and must keep together the force now in\r\nexistence, correcting anything that may seem amiss in it, but not\r\ndisbanding the whole force because of the possible criticisms against\r\nit. We must send envoys everywhere to instruct, to warn, and to act.\r\nAbove all, we must punish those who take bribes in connexion with\r\npublic affairs, and must everywhere display our abhorrence of them; in\r\norder that reasonable men, who offer their honest services, may find\r\ntheir policy justified in their own eyes and in those of others. {77}\r\nIf you treat the situation thus, and cease to ignore it altogether,\r\nthere is a chance--a chance I say, even now--that it may improve. If,\r\nhowever, you sit idle, with an interest that stops short at applause\r\nand acclamation, and retires into the background when any action is\r\nrequired, I can imagine no oratory, which, without action on your part,\r\nwill be able to save your country.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] See Third Philippic §§ 59 sqq.\r\n\r\n[2] See Introduction to First Philippic.\r\n\r\n[3] [Greek: est_o d_e.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD PHILIPPIC (Or. IX)\r\n\r\n[_Introduction_. The Third Philippic seems to have been delivered in\r\nthe late spring or early summer of 341 B. C., about two months after\r\nthe Speech on the Chersonese, which apparently had little positive\r\nresult, though it probably prevented the recall and prosecution of\r\nDiopeithes. The immediate occasion of the Third Philippic was a request\r\nfrom the forces in the Chersonese for supplies. The general situation\r\nis the same as at the date of the last speech, but the danger to\r\nByzantium is more pressing. Demosthenes now takes the broad ground of\r\nPanhellenic policy, and formally proposes to send envoys throughout\r\nGreece, to unite all the Greek states against Philip, as well as to\r\nsend immediate reinforcements and supplies to the Chersonese.\r\n\r\nMany critics, ancient and modern, have regarded this as the greatest of\r\nall Demosthenes' political orations. The lessons of history (from the\r\nspeaker's point of view) are repeated and enforced by the citation of\r\ninstance after instance. The tone of the speech, while less varied than\r\nthat of the last, is grave and intense. The passage (§§ 36 ff.) in\r\nwhich the orator contrasts the spirit of Athenian political life in the\r\npast with that of his own day is one of the most impressive in all his\r\nworks, and the nobility of his appeal to the traditional ideals of\r\nAthenian policy has been universally recognized even by his most severe\r\ncritics.\r\n\r\nThe speech is found in the MSS. in two forms, of which the shorter\r\nomits a number of passages[1] which the longer includes, though there\r\nare signs of an imperfect blending of the two versions in certain\r\nplaces. It seems probable that both versions are due to Demosthenes,\r\nand the speech may have been more than once revised by him before\r\npublication or republication. In which form it was delivered there is\r\nnot sufficient evidence to show.]\r\n\r\n\r\n{1} Many speeches are made, men of Athens, at almost every meeting of\r\nthe Assembly, with reference to the aggressions which Philip has been\r\ncommitting, ever since he concluded the Peace, not only against\r\nyourselves but against all other peoples; and I am sure that all would\r\nagree, however little they may act on their belief, that our aim, both\r\nin speech and in action, should be to cause him to cease from his\r\ninsolence and to pay the penalty for it. And yet I see that in fact the\r\ntreacherous sacrifice of our interests has gone on, until what seems an\r\nill-omened saying may, I fear, be really true--that if all who came\r\nforward desired to propose, and you desired to carry, the measures\r\nwhich would make your position as pitiful as it could possibly be, it\r\ncould not (so I believe), be made worse than it is now. {2} It may be\r\nthat there are many reasons for this, and that our affairs did not\r\nreach their present condition from any one or two causes. But if you\r\nexamine the matter aright, you will find that the chief responsibility\r\nrests with those whose aim is to win your favour, not to propose what\r\nis best. Some of them, men of Athens, so long as they can maintain the\r\nconditions which bring them reputation and influence, take no thought\r\nfor the future [and therefore think that you also should take none];\r\nwhile others, by accusing and slandering those who are actively at\r\nwork,[n] are simply trying to make the city spend its energies in\r\npunishing the members of its own body, and so leave Philip free to say\r\nand do what he likes. {3} Such political methods as these, familiar to\r\nyou as they are, are the real causes of the evil. And I beg you, men of\r\nAthens, if I tell you certain truths outspokenly, to let no resentment\r\non your part fall upon me on this account. Consider the matter in this\r\nlight. In every other sphere of life, you believe that the right of\r\nfree speech ought to be so universally shared by all who are in the\r\ncity, that you have extended it both to foreigners and to slaves; and\r\none may see many a servant in Athens speaking his mind with greater\r\nliberty than is granted to citizens in some other states: but from the\r\nsphere of political counsel you have utterly banished this liberty. {4}\r\nThe result[n] is that in your meetings you give yourselves airs and\r\nenjoy their flattery, listening to nothing but what is meant to please\r\nyou, while in the world of facts and events, you are in the last\r\nextremity of peril. If then you are still in this mood to-day, I do not\r\nknow what I can say; but if you are willing to listen while I tell you,\r\nwithout flattery, what your interest requires, I am prepared to speak.\r\nFor though our position is very bad indeed, and much has been\r\nsacrificed, it is still possible, even now, if you will do your duty,\r\nto set all right once more. {5} It is a strange thing, perhaps, that I\r\nam about to say, but it is true. The worst feature in the past is that\r\nin which lies our best hope for the future. And what is this? It is\r\nthat you are in your present plight because you do not do any part of\r\nyour duty, small or great; for of course, if you were doing all that\r\nyou should do, and were still in this evil case, you could not even\r\nhope for any improvement. As it is, Philip has conquered your indolence\r\nand your indifference; but he has not conquered Athens. You have not\r\nbeen vanquished--you have never even stirred. {6} [Now if it was\r\nadmitted by us all that Philip was at war with Athens, and was\r\ntransgressing the Peace, a speaker would have to do nothing but to\r\nadvise you as to the safest and easiest method of resistance to him.\r\nBut since there are some who are in so extraordinary a frame of mind\r\nthat, though he is capturing cities, though many of your possessions\r\nare in his hands, and though he is committing aggressions against all\r\nmen, they still tolerate certain speakers, who constantly assert at\r\nyour meetings that it is some of _us_ who are provoking the war, it is\r\nnecessary to be on our guard and come to a right understanding on the\r\nmatter. {7} For there is a danger lest any one who proposes or advises\r\nresistance should find himself accused of having brought about the war.]\r\n\r\n[Well, I say this first of all, and lay it down as a principle, that if\r\nit is open to us to deliberate whether we should remain at peace or\r\nshould go to war ...]\r\n\r\n{8} Now if it is possible for the city to remain at peace--if the\r\ndecision rests with us (that I may make this my starting-point)--then,\r\nI say that we ought to do so, and I call upon any one who says that it\r\nis so to move his motion, and to act and not to defraud us.[n] But if\r\nanother with weapons in his hands and a large force about him holds out\r\nto you the _name_ of peace, while his own acts are acts of war, what\r\ncourse remains open to us but that of resistance? though if you wish to\r\nprofess peace in the same manner as he, I have no quarrel with you. {9}\r\nBut if any man's conception of peace is that it is a state in which\r\nPhilip can master all that intervenes till at last he comes to attack\r\nourselves, such a conception, in the first place, is madness; and, in\r\nthe second place, this peace that he speaks of is a peace which you are\r\nto observe towards Philip, while he does not observe it towards you:\r\nand this it is--this power to carry on war against you, without being\r\nmet by any hostilities on your part--that Philip is purchasing with all\r\nthe money that he is spending.\r\n\r\n{10} Indeed, if we intend to wait till the time comes when he admits\r\nthat he is at war with us, we are surely the most innocent persons in\r\nthe world. Why, even if he comes to Attica itself, to the very\r\nPeiraeus, he will never make such an admission, if we are to judge by\r\nhis dealings with others. {11} For, to take one instance, he told the\r\nOlynthians, when he was five miles from the city, that there were only\r\ntwo alternatives--either they must cease to live in Olynthus, or he to\r\nlive in Macedonia: but during the whole time before that, whenever any\r\none accused him of any such sentiments, he was indignant and sent\r\nenvoys to answer the charge. Again, he marched into the Phocians'\r\ncountry, as though visiting his allies:[n] it was by Phocian envoys\r\nthat he was escorted on the march; and most people in Athens contended\r\nstrongly that his crossing the Pass would bring no good to Thebes. {12}\r\nWorse still, he has lately seized Pherae[n] and still holds it, though\r\nhe went to Thessaly as a friend and an ally. And, latest of all, he\r\ntold those unhappy citizens of Oreus[n] that he had sent his soldiers\r\nto visit them and to make kind inquiries; he had heard that they were\r\nsick, and suffering from faction, and it was right for an ally and a\r\ntrue friend to be present at such a time. {13} Now if, instead of\r\ngiving them warning and using open force, he deliberately chose to\r\ndeceive these men, who could have done him no harm, though they might\r\nhave taken precautions against suffering any themselves, do you imagine\r\nthat he will make a formal declaration of war upon you before he\r\ncommences hostilities, and that, so long as you are content to be\r\ndeceived? {14} Impossible! For so long as you, though you are the\r\ninjured party, make no complaint against him, but accuse some of your\r\nown body, he would be the most fatuous man on earth if _he_ were to\r\ninterrupt your strife and contentions with one another--to bid you turn\r\nupon himself, and so to cut away the ground from the arguments by which\r\nhis hirelings put you off, when they tell you that _he_ is not at war\r\nwith Athens.\r\n\r\n{15} In God's name, is there a man in his senses who would judge by\r\nwords, and not by facts, whether another was at peace or at war with\r\nhim? Of course there is not. Why, from the very first, when the Peace\r\nhad only just been made, before those who are now in the Chersonese had\r\nbeen sent out, Philip was taking Serrhium[n] and Doriscus, and\r\nexpelling the soldiers who were in the castle of Serrhium and the\r\nSacred Mountain, where they had been placed by your general. {16} But\r\nwhat was he doing, in acting thus? For he had sworn to a Peace.[n] And\r\nlet no one ask, 'What do these things amount to? What do they matter to\r\nAthens?' For whether these acts were trifles which could have no\r\ninterest for you is another matter; but the principles of religion[n]\r\nand justice, whether a man transgress them in small things or great,\r\nhave always the same force. What? When he is sending mercenaries into\r\nthe Chersonese, which the king and all the Hellenes have acknowledged\r\nto be yours; when he openly avows that he is going to the rescue, and\r\nstates it in his letter, what is it that he is doing? {17} He tells\r\nyou, indeed, that he is not making war upon you. But so far am I from\r\nadmitting that one who acts in this manner is observing the Peace which\r\nhe made with you, that I hold that in grasping at Megara, in setting up\r\ntyrants in Euboea, in advancing against Thrace at the present moment,\r\nin pursuing his machinations in the Peloponnese, and in carrying out\r\nhis entire policy with the help of his army, he is violating the Peace\r\nand is making war against you;--unless you mean to say that even to\r\nbring up engines to besiege you is no breach of the Peace, until they\r\nare actually planted against your walls. But you will not say this; for\r\nthe man who is taking the steps and contriving the means which will\r\nlead to my capture is at war with me, even though he has not yet thrown\r\na missile or shot an arrow. {18} Now what are the things which would\r\nimperil your safety, if anything should happen?[n] The alienation of\r\nthe Hellespont, the placing of Megara and Euboea in the power of the\r\nenemy, and the attraction of Peloponnesian sympathy to his cause. Can I\r\nthen say that one who is erecting such engines of war as these against\r\nthe city is at peace with you? {19} Far from it! For from the very day\r\nwhen he annihilated the Phocians--from that very day, I say, I date the\r\nbeginning of his hostilities against you. And for your part, I think\r\nthat you will be wise if you resist him at once; but that if you let\r\nhim be, you will find that, when you wish to resist, resistance itself\r\nis impossible. Indeed, so widely do I differ, men of Athens, from all\r\nyour other advisers, that I do not think there is any room for\r\ndiscussion to-day in regard to the Chersonese or Byzantium. {20} We\r\n_must_ go to their defence, and take every care that they do not suffer\r\n[and we must send all that they need to the soldiers who are at present\r\nthere]. But we _have_ to take counsel for the good of all the Hellenes,\r\nin view of the grave peril in which they stand. And I wish to tell you\r\non what grounds I am so alarmed at the situation, in order that if my\r\nreasoning is correct, you may share my conclusions, and exercise some\r\nforethought for yourselves at least, if you are actually unwilling to\r\ndo so for the Hellenes as a whole; but that if you think that I am\r\ntalking nonsense, and am out of my senses, you may both now and\r\nhereafter decline to attend to me as though I were a sane man.\r\n\r\n{21} The rise of Philip to greatness from such small and humble\r\nbeginnings; the mistrustful and quarrelsome attitude of the Hellenes\r\ntowards one another; the fact that his growth out of what he was into\r\nwhat he is was a far more extraordinary thing than would be his\r\nsubjugation of all that remains, when he has already secured so\r\nmuch;--all this and all similar themes, upon which I might speak at\r\nlength, I will pass over. {22} But I see that all men, beginning with\r\nyourselves, have conceded to him the very thing which has been at issue\r\nin every Hellenic war during the whole of the past. And what is this?\r\nIt is the right to act as he pleases --to mutilate and to strip the\r\nHellenic peoples, one by one, to attack and to enslave their cities.\r\n{23} For seventy-three years[n] you were the leading people of Hellas,\r\nand the Spartans for thirty years save one;[n] and in these last times,\r\nafter the battle of Leuctra,[n] the Thebans too acquired some power:\r\nyet neither to you nor to Thebes nor to Sparta was such a right ever\r\nconceded by the Hellenes, as the right to do whatever you pleased. Far\r\nfrom it! {24} First of all it was your own behaviour--or rather that of\r\nthe Athenians of that day--which some thought immoderate; and all, even\r\nthose who had no grievance against Athens, felt bound to join the\r\ninjured parties, and to make war upon you. Then, in their turn, the\r\nSpartans, when they had acquired an empire and succeeded to a supremacy\r\nlike your own, attempted to go beyond all bounds and to disturb the\r\nestablished order[n] to an unjustifiable extent; and once more, all,\r\neven those who had no grievance against them, had recourse to war. {25}\r\nWhy mention the others? For we ourselves and the Spartans, though we\r\ncould originally allege no injury done by the one people to the other,\r\nnevertheless felt bound to go to war on account of the wrongs which we\r\nsaw the rest suffering. And yet all the offences of the Spartans in\r\nthose thirty years of power, and of your ancestors in their seventy\r\nyears, were less, men of Athens, than the wrongs inflicted upon the\r\nGreeks by Philip, in the thirteen years, not yet completed, during\r\nwhich he has been to the fore. Less do I say? {26} They are not a\r\nfraction of them. [A few words will easily prove this.] I say nothing\r\nof Olynthus, and Methone, and Apollonia, and thirty-two cities in the\r\nThracian region,[n] all annihilated by him with such savagery, that a\r\nvisitor to the spot would find it difficult to tell that they had ever\r\nbeen inhabited. I remain silent in regard to the extirpation of the\r\ngreat Phocian race. But what is the condition of Thessaly? Has he not\r\nrobbed their very cities of their governments,[n] and set up\r\ntetrarchies, that they may be enslaved, not merely by whole cities, but\r\nby whole tribes at a time? {27} Are not the cities of Euboea even now\r\nruled by tyrants, and that in an island that is neighbour to Thebes and\r\nAthens? Does he not write expressly in his letters, 'I am at peace with\r\nthose who choose to obey me'? And what he thus writes he does not fail\r\nto act upon; for he is gone to invade the Hellespont; he previously\r\nwent to attack Ambracia;[n] the great city of Elis[n] in the\r\nPeloponnese is his; he has recently intrigued against Megara;[n] and\r\nneither Hellas nor the world beyond it is large enough to contain the\r\nman's ambition. {28} But though all of us, the Hellenes, see and hear\r\nthese things, we send no representatives to one another to discuss the\r\nmatter; we show no indignation; we are in so evil a mood, so deep have\r\nthe lines been dug which sever city from city, that up to this very day\r\nwe are unable to act as either our interest or our duty require. {29}\r\nWe cannot unite; we can form no combination for mutual support or\r\nfriendship; but we look on while the man grows greater, because every\r\none has made up his mind (as it seems to me) to profit by the time\r\nduring which his neighbour is being ruined, and no one cares or acts\r\nfor the safety of the Hellenes. For we all know that Philip is like the\r\nrecurrence or the attack of a fever or other illness, in his descent\r\nupon those who fancy themselves for the present well out of his reach.\r\n{30} And further, you must surely realize that all the wrongs that the\r\nHellenes suffered from the Spartans or ourselves they at least suffered\r\nat the hands of true-born sons of Hellas; and (one might conceive) it\r\nwas as though a lawful son, born to a great estate, managed his affairs\r\nin some wrong or improper way;--his conduct would in itself deserve\r\nblame and denunciation, but at least it could not be said that he was\r\nnot one of the family, or was not the heir to the property. {31} But\r\nhad it been a slave or a supposititious son that was thus ruining and\r\nspoiling an inheritance to which he had no title, why, good Heavens!\r\nhow infinitely more scandalous and reprehensible all would have\r\ndeclared it to be. And yet they show no such feeling in regard to\r\nPhilip, although not only is he no Hellene, not only has he no kinship\r\nwith Hellenes, but he is not even a barbarian from a country that one\r\ncould acknowledge with credit;--he is a pestilent Macedonian, from\r\nwhose country it used not to be possible to buy even a slave of any\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n{32} And in spite of this, is there any degree of insolence to which he\r\ndoes not proceed? Not content with annihilating cities, does he not\r\nmanage the Pythian games,[n] the common meeting of the Hellenes, and\r\nsend his slaves to preside over the competition in his absence? [Is he\r\nnot master of Thermopylae, and of the passes which lead into Hellenic\r\nterritory? Does he not hold that district with garrisons and\r\nmercenaries? Has he not taken the precedence in consulting the oracle,\r\nand thrust aside ourselves and the Thessalians and Dorians and the rest\r\nof the Amphictyons, though the right is not one which is given even to\r\nall of the Hellenes?] {33} Does he not write to the Thessalians to\r\nprescribe the constitution under which they are to live? Does he not\r\nsend one body of mercenaries to Porthmus, to expel the popular party of\r\nEretria, and another to Oreus, to set up Philistides as tyrant? And yet\r\nthe Hellenes see these things and endure them, gazing (it seems to me)\r\nas they would gaze at a hailstorm--each people praying that it may not\r\ncome their way, but no one trying to prevent it. Nor is it only his\r\noutrages upon Hellas that go unresisted. {34} No one resists even the\r\naggressions which are committed against himself. Ambracia and Leucas\r\nbelong to the Corinthians--he has attacked them: Naupactus to the\r\nAchaeans--he has sworn to hand it over to the Aetolians: Echinus[n] to\r\nthe Thebans--he has taken it from them, and is now marching against\r\ntheir allies the Byzantines--is it not so? {35} And of our own\r\npossessions, to pass by all the rest, is not Cardia, the greatest city\r\nin the Chersonese, in his hands? Thus are we treated; and we are all\r\nhesitating and torpid, with our eyes upon our neighbours, distrusting\r\none another, rather than the man whose victims we all are. But if he\r\ntreats us collectively in this outrageous fashion, what do you think he\r\nwill do, when he has become master of each of us separately?\r\n\r\n{36} What then is the cause of these things? For as it was not without\r\nreason and just cause that the Hellenes in old days were so prompt for\r\nfreedom, so it is not without reason or cause that they are now so\r\nprompt to be slaves. There was a spirit, men of Athens, a spirit in the\r\nminds of the people in those days, which is absent to-day--the spirit\r\nwhich vanquished the wealth of Persia, which led Hellas in the path of\r\nfreedom, and never gave way in face of battle by sea or by land; a\r\nspirit whose extinction to-day has brought universal ruin and turned\r\nHellas upside down. What was this spirit? [It was nothing subtle nor\r\nclever.] {37} It meant that men who took money from those who aimed at\r\ndominion or at the ruin of Hellas were execrated by all; that it was\r\nthen a very grave thing to be convicted of bribery; that the punishment\r\nfor the guilty man was the heaviest that could be inflicted; that for\r\nhim there could be no plea for mercy, nor hope of pardon. {38} No\r\norator, no general, would then sell the critical opportunity whenever\r\nit arose--the opportunity so often offered to men by fortune, even when\r\nthey are careless and their foes are on their guard. They did not\r\nbarter away the harmony between people and people, nor their own\r\nmistrust of the tyrant and the foreigner, nor any of these high\r\nsentiments. {39} Where are such sentiments now? They have been sold in\r\nthe market and are gone; and those have been imported in their stead,\r\nthrough which the nation lies ruined and plague-stricken--the envy of\r\nthe man who has received his hire; the amusement which accompanies his\r\navowal; [the pardon granted to those whose guilt is proved;] the hatred\r\nof one who censures the crime; and all the appurtenances of corruption.\r\n{40} For as to ships, numerical strength, unstinting abundance of funds\r\nand all other material of war, and all the things by which the strength\r\nof cities is estimated, every people can command these in greater\r\nplenty and on a larger scale by far than in old days. But all these\r\nresources are rendered unserviceable, ineffectual, unprofitable, by\r\nthose who traffic in them.\r\n\r\n{41} That these things are so to-day, you doubtless see, and need no\r\ntestimony of mine: and that in times gone by the opposite was true, I\r\nwill prove to you, not by any words of my own, but by the record\r\ninscribed by your ancestors on a pillar of bronze, and placed on the\r\nAcropolis [not to be a lesson to themselves--they needed no such record\r\nto put them in a right mind--but to be a reminder and an example to you\r\nof the zeal that you ought to display in such a cause]. {42} What then\r\nis the record? 'Arthmius,[n] son of Pythonax, of Zeleia, is an outlaw,\r\nand is the enemy of the Athenian people and their allies, he and his\r\nhouse.' Then follows the reason for which this step was taken--'because\r\nhe brought the gold from the Medes into the Peloponnese.' {43} Such is\r\nthe record. Consider, in Heaven's name, what must have been the mind of\r\nthe Athenians of that day, when they did this, and their conception of\r\ntheir position. They set up a record, that because a man of Zeleia,\r\nArthmius by name, a slave of the King of Persia (for Zeleia is in\r\nAsia), as part of his service to the king, had brought gold, not to\r\nAthens, but to the Peloponnese, he should be an enemy of Athens and her\r\nallies, he and his house, and that they should be outlaws. {44} And\r\nthis outlawry is no such disfranchisement as we ordinarily mean by the\r\nword. For what would it matter to a man of Zeleia, that he might have\r\nno share in the public life of Athens? But there is a clause in the Law\r\nof Murder, dealing with those in connexion with whose death the law\r\ndoes not allow a prosecution for murder [but the slaying of them is to\r\nbe a holy act]: 'And let him die an outlaw,' it runs. The meaning,\r\naccordingly, is this--that the slayer of such a man is to be pure from\r\nall guilt. {45} They thought, therefore, that the safety of all the\r\nHellenes was a matter which concerned themselves--apart from this\r\nbelief, it could not have mattered to them whether any one bought or\r\ncorrupted men in the Peloponnese; and whenever they detected such\r\noffenders, they carried their punishment and their vengeance so far as\r\nto pillory their names for ever. As the natural consequence, the\r\nHellenes were a terror to the foreigner, not the foreigner to the\r\nHellenes. It is not so now. Such is not your attitude in these or in\r\nother matters. {46} But what is it? [You know it yourselves; for why\r\nshould I accuse you explicitly on every point? And that of the rest of\r\nthe Hellenes is like your own, and no better; and so I say that the\r\npresent situation demands our utmost earnestness and good counsel.[n]]\r\nAnd what counsel? Do you bid me tell you, and will you not be angry if\r\nI do so?\r\n\r\n[_He reads from the document_.]\r\n\r\n{47} Now there is an ingenuous argument, which is used by those who\r\nwould reassure the city, to the effect that, after all, Philip is not\r\nyet in the position once held by the Spartans, who ruled everywhere\r\nover sea and land, with the king for their ally, and nothing to\r\nwithstand them; and that, none the less, Athens defended herself even\r\nagainst them, and was not swept away. Since that time the progress in\r\nevery direction, one may say, has been great, and has made the world\r\nto-day very different from what it was then; but I believe that in no\r\nrespect has there been greater progress or development than in the art\r\nof war. {48} In the first place, I am told that in those days the\r\nSpartans and all our other enemies would invade us for four or five\r\nmonths--during, that is, the actual summer--and would damage Attica\r\nwith infantry and citizen-troops, and then return home again. And so\r\nold-fashioned were the men of that day--nay rather, such true\r\ncitizens--that no one ever purchased any object from another for money,\r\nbut their warfare was of a legitimate and open kind. {49} But now, as I\r\nam sure you see, most of our losses are the result of treachery, and no\r\nissue is decided by open conflict or battle; while you are told that it\r\nis not because he leads a column of heavy infantry[n] that Philip can\r\nmarch wherever he chooses, but because he has attached to himself a\r\nforce of light infantry, cavalry, archers, mercenaries, and similar\r\ntroops. {50} And whenever, with such advantages,[n] he falls upon a\r\nState which is disordered within, and in their distrust of one another\r\nno one goes out in defence of its territory, he brings up his engines\r\nand besieges them. I pass over the fact that summer and winter are\r\nalike to him--that there is no close season during which he suspends\r\noperations. {51} But if you all know these things and take due account\r\nof them, you surely must not let the war pass into Attica, nor be\r\ndashed from your seat through looking back to the simplicity of those\r\nold hostilities with Sparta. You must guard against him, at the\r\ngreatest possible distance, both by political measures and by\r\npreparations; you must prevent his stirring from home, instead of\r\ngrappling with him at close quarters in a struggle to the death. {52}\r\nFor, men of Athens, we have many natural advantages for a war,[n] if we\r\nare willing to do our duty. There is the character of his country, much\r\nof which we can harry and damage, and a thousand other things. But for\r\na pitched battle he is in better training than we.\r\n\r\n{53} Nor have you only to recognize these facts, and to resist him by\r\nactual operations of war. You must also by reasoned judgement and of\r\nset purpose come to execrate those who address you in his interest,\r\nremembering that it is impossible to master the enemies of the city,\r\nuntil you punish those who are serving them in the city itself. {54}\r\nAnd this, before God and every Heavenly Power--this you will not be\r\nable to do; for you have reached such a pitch of folly or distraction\r\nor--I know not what to call it; for often has the fear actually entered\r\nmy mind, that some more than mortal power may be driving our fortunes\r\nto ruin--that to enjoy their abuse, or their malice, or their jests, or\r\nwhatever your motive may chance to be, you call upon men to speak who\r\nare hirelings, and some of whom would not even deny it; and you laugh\r\nto hear their abuse of others. {55} And terrible as this is, there is\r\nyet worse to be told. For you have actually made political life safer\r\nfor these men, than for those who uphold your own cause. And yet\r\nobserve what calamities the willingness to listen to such men lays up\r\nin store. I will mention facts known to you all.\r\n\r\n{56} In Olynthus, among those who were engaged in public affairs, there\r\nwas one party who were on the side of Philip, and served his interests\r\nin everything; and another whose aim was their city's real good, and\r\nthe preservation of their fellow citizens from bondage. Which were the\r\ndestroyers of their country? which betrayed the cavalry, through whose\r\nbetrayal Olynthus perished? Those whose sympathies were with Philip's\r\ncause; those who, while the city still existed brought such dishonest\r\nand slanderous charges against the speakers whose advice was for the\r\nbest, that, in the case of Apollonides at least, the people of Olynthus\r\nwas even induced to banish the accused.\r\n\r\n{57} Nor is this instance of the unmixed evil wrought by these\r\npractices in the case of the Olynthians an exceptional one, or without\r\nparallel elsewhere. For in Eretria,[n] when Plutarchus and the\r\nmercenaries had been got rid of, and the people had control of the city\r\nand of Porthmus, one party wished to entrust the State to you, the\r\nother to entrust it to Philip. And through listening mainly, or rather\r\nentirely, to the latter, these poor luckless Eretrians were at last\r\npersuaded to banish the advocates of their own interests. {58} For, as\r\nyou know, Philip, their ally, sent Hipponicus with a thousand\r\nmercenaries, stripped Porthmus of its walls, and set up three\r\ntyrants--Hipparchus, Automedon, and Cleitarchus; and since then he has\r\nalready twice expelled them from the country when they wished to\r\nrecover their position [sending on the first occasion the mercenaries\r\ncommanded by Eurylochus, on the second, those under Parmenio].\r\n\r\n{59} And why go through the mass of the instances? Enough to mention\r\nhow in Oreus Philip had, as his agents, Philistides, Menippus,\r\nSocrates, Thoas, and Agapaeus--the very men who are now in possession\r\nof the city--and every one knew the fact; while a certain Euphraeus,[n]\r\nwho once lived here in Athens, acted in the interests of freedom, to\r\nsave his country from bondage. {60} To describe the insults and the\r\ncontumely with which he met would require a long story; but a year\r\nbefore the capture of the town he laid an information of treason\r\nagainst Philistides and his party, having perceived the nature of their\r\nplans. A number of men joined forces, with Philip for their paymaster\r\nand director, and haled Euphraeus off to prison as a disturber of the\r\npeace. {61} Seeing this, the democratic party in Oreus, instead of\r\ncoming to the rescue of Euphraeus, and beating the other party to\r\ndeath, displayed no anger at all against them, and agreed with a\r\nmalicious pleasure that Euphraeus deserved his fate. After this the\r\nconspirators worked with all the freedom they desired for the capture\r\nof the city, and made arrangements for the execution of the scheme;\r\nwhile any of the democratic party, who perceived what was going on,\r\nmaintained a panic-stricken silence, remembering the fate of Euphraeus.\r\nSo wretched was their condition, that though this dreadful calamity was\r\nconfronting them, no one dared open his lips, until all was ready and\r\nthe enemy was advancing up to the walls. Then the one party set about\r\nthe defence, the other about the betrayal of the city. {62} And when\r\nthe city had been captured in this base and shameful manner, the\r\nsuccessful party governed despotically: and of those who had been their\r\nown protectors, and had been ready to treat Euphraeus with all possible\r\nharshness, they expelled some and murdered others; while the good\r\nEuphraeus killed himself, thus testifying to the righteousness and\r\npurity of his motives in opposing Philip on behalf of his countrymen.\r\n\r\n{63} Now for what reason, you may be wondering, were the peoples of\r\nOlynthus and Eretria and Oreus more agreeably disposed towards Philip's\r\nadvocates than towards their own? The reason was the same as it is with\r\nyou--that those who speak for your true good can never, even if they\r\nwould, speak to win popularity with you; they are constrained to\r\ninquire how the State may be saved: while their opponents, in the very\r\nact of seeking popularity, are co-operating with Philip. {64} The one\r\nparty said, 'You must pay taxes;' the other, 'There is no need to do\r\nso.' The one said, 'Go to war, and do not trust him;' the other,\r\n'Remain at peace,'--until they were in the toils. And--not to mention\r\neach separately--I believe that the same thing was true of all. The one\r\nside said what would enable them to win favour; the other, what would\r\nsecure the safety of their State. And at last the main body of the\r\npeople accepted much that they proposed--not now from any such desire\r\nfor gratification, nor from ignorance, but as a concession to\r\ncircumstances, thinking that their cause was now wholly lost. {65} It\r\nis this fate, I solemnly assure you, that I dread for you, when the\r\ntime comes that you make your reckoning, and realize that there is no\r\nlonger anything that can be done. May you never find yourselves, men of\r\nAthens, in such a position! Yet in any case, it were better to die ten\r\nthousand deaths, than to do anything out of servility towards Philip\r\n[or to sacrifice any of those who speak for your good]. A noble\r\nrecompense did the people in Oreus receive, for entrusting themselves\r\nto Philip's friends, and thrusting Euphraeus aside! {66} and a noble\r\nrecompense the democracy of Eretria, for driving away your envoys, and\r\nsurrendering to Cleitarchus! They are slaves, scourged and butchered! A\r\nnoble clemency did he show to the Olynthians, who elected Lasthenes to\r\ncommand the cavalry, and banished Apollonides! {67} It is folly, and it\r\nis cowardice, to cherish hopes like these, to give way to evil\r\ncounsels, to refuse to do anything that you should do, to listen to the\r\nadvocates of the enemy's cause, and to fancy that you dwell in so great\r\na city that, whatever happens, you will not suffer any harm. {68} Aye,\r\nand it is shameful to exclaim after the event, 'Why, who would have\r\nexpected this? Of course, we ought to have done, or not to have done,\r\nsuch and such things!' The Olynthians could tell you of many things, to\r\nhave foreseen which in time would have saved them from destruction. So\r\ntoo could the people of Oreus, and the Phocians, and every other people\r\nthat has been destroyed. {69} But how does that help them now? So long\r\nas the vessel is safe, be it great or small, so long must the sailor\r\nand the pilot and every man in his place exert himself and take care\r\nthat no one may capsize it by design or by accident: but when the seas\r\nhave overwhelmed it, all their efforts are in vain. {70} So it is, men\r\nof Athens, with us. While we are still safe, with our great city, our\r\nvast resources, our noble name, what are we to do? Perhaps some one\r\nsitting here has long been wishing to ask this question. Aye, and I\r\nwill answer it, and will move my motion; and you shall carry it, if you\r\nwish. We ourselves, in the first place, must conduct the resistance and\r\nmake preparation for it--with ships, that is, and money, and soldiers.\r\nFor though all but ourselves give way and become slaves, we at least\r\nmust contend for freedom. {71} And when we have made all these\r\npreparations ourselves, and let them be seen, then let us call upon the\r\nother states for aid, and send envoys to carry our message [in all\r\ndirections--to the Peloponnese, to Rhodes, to Chios, to the king; for\r\nit is not unimportant for his interests either that Philip should be\r\nprevented from subjugating the world]; that so, if you persuade them,\r\nyou may have partners to share the danger and the expense, in case of\r\nneed; and if you do not, you may at least delay the march of events.\r\n{72} For since the war is with a single man, and not against the\r\nstrength of a united state, even delay is not without its value, any\r\nmore than were those embassies[n] of protest which last year went round\r\nthe Peloponnese, when I and Polyeuctus, that best of men, and\r\nHegesippus and the other envoys went on our tour, and forced him to\r\nhalt, so that he neither went to attack Acarnania, nor set out for the\r\nPeloponnese. {73} But I do not mean that we should call upon the other\r\nstates, if we are not willing to take any of the necessary steps\r\nourselves. It is folly to sacrifice what is our own, and then pretend\r\nto be anxious for the interests of others--to neglect the present, and\r\nalarm others in regard to the future. I do not propose this. I say that\r\nwe must send money to the forces in the Chersonese, and do all that\r\nthey ask of us; that we must make preparation ourselves, while we\r\nsummon, convene, instruct, and warn the rest of the Hellenes. That is\r\nthe policy for a city with a reputation such as yours. {74} But if you\r\nfancy that the people of Chalcis or of Megara will save Hellas, while\r\nyou run away from the task, you are mistaken. They may well be content\r\nif they can each save themselves. The task is yours. It is the\r\nprerogative that your forefathers won, and through many a great peril\r\nbequeathed to you. {75} But if each of you is to sit and consult his\r\ninclinations, looking for some way by which he may escape any personal\r\naction, the first consequence will be that you will never find any one\r\nwho will act; and the second, I fear, that the day will come when we\r\nshall be forced to do, at one and the same time, all the things we wish\r\nto avoid.\r\n\r\n{76} This then is my proposal, and this I move. If the proposal is\r\ncarried out, I think that even now the state of our affairs may be\r\nremedied. But if any one has a better proposal to make, let him make\r\nit, and give us his advice. And I pray to all the gods that whatever be\r\nthe decision that you are about to make, it may be for your good.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] These are printed in square brackets in the translation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE CROWN (Or. XVIII)\r\n\r\n[_Introduction_. The advice given by Demosthenes in the Third Philippic\r\n(spoken before the middle of 341) was in the main followed. He himself\r\nwas sent almost immediately to Byzantium, where he renewed the alliance\r\nbetween that city and Athens, and at the same time entered into\r\nrelations with Abydos and the Thracian princes. Rhodes, and probably\r\nChios and Cos, were also conciliated, and an embassy was sent to the\r\nKing of Persia to ask for aid against Philip. The king appears to have\r\nsent assistance to Diopeithes, and it is also stated (not on the best\r\nauthority) that he sent large sums of money to Demosthenes and\r\nHypereides. Demosthenes further succeeded, in conjunction with Callias\r\nof Chalcis, in organizing a league against Philip, which included\r\nCorinth, Megara, Corcyra, and the Acarnanians, and which at least\r\nsupplied a considerable number of men and some funds. The cities of\r\nEuboea, most of which had been in the hands of Philip's party, were\r\nalso formed into a confederacy, in alliance with Athens, under the\r\nleadership of Chalcis; Philistides was expelled from Oreus, about July\r\n341, by the allied forces under Cephisophon; and later in the summer,\r\nPhocion drove Cleitarchus from Eretria. On the motion of Aristonicus,\r\nthe Athenians voted Demosthenes a golden crown, which was conferred on\r\nhim in the theatre at the Great Dionysia in March 340. The arrest of\r\nAnaxinus of Oreus, and his condemnation as a spy, acting in Philip's\r\ninterest, must have occurred about the same time. Not long afterwards\r\nDemosthenes succeeded in carrying out a complete reorganization of the\r\ntrierarchic system, by which he made the burden of the expense vary\r\nstrictly according to property, and secured a regular and efficient\r\nsupply of ships, money, and men.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime (in 341 or 340) the island of Peparethus was attacked\r\nby Philip's ships, in revenge for the seizure of the Macedonian\r\ngarrison in Halonnesus by the Peparethians: and the Athenian admirals\r\nwere ordered to retaliate. Philip himself had been pursuing his course\r\nin Thrace; and on the rejection of his request to Byzantium for an\r\nalliance, he laid siege (late in 340) to Perinthus (which lay on his\r\nway to Byzantium), sending part of his forces through the Chersonese.\r\nAided by Byzantine and Persian soldiers, Perinthus held out, till at\r\nlast Philip took off most of his forces and besieged Byzantium itself.\r\nHe had shortly before this sent to Athens an express declaration of\r\nwar, and received a similar declaration from her, the formal excuse for\r\nwhich was found in the recent seizure by his ships of some Athenian\r\nmerchant-vessels. But with help from Athens, Chios, Rhodes, and Cos,\r\nthe Byzantines maintained the defence. Philip's position became\r\nserious; but he managed by a ruse to get his ships away into the open\r\nsea, and even to do some damage to the Athenian settlers in the\r\nChersonese. In the winter he withdrew from Byzantium, and in 339 made\r\nan incursion into Scythia; but, returning through the country of the\r\nTriballi, he sustained some loss, and was severely wounded. Later in\r\nthe year a new Sacred War which had arisen gave him a convenient\r\nopportunity for the invasion of Greece.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the Amphictyonic Council in the autumn of 340,[1]\r\nAeschines was one of the representatives of Athens. The Athenians had\r\nrecently offended Thebes by re-gilding and dedicating in the restored\r\ntemple at Delphi fifty shields, with an inscription stating that they\r\nwere spoil 'taken from the Medes and the Thebans, when they fought\r\nagainst the Hellenes' (probably at Plataeae in 479). The Locrians of\r\nAmphissa intended (according to Aeschines' account) to propose that the\r\nCouncil should fine Athens fifty talents. Aeschines rose to state the\r\ncase for Athens; but a delegate from Amphissa forbade all mention of\r\nthe Athenians, and demanded their exclusion from the temple, on the\r\nground of their alliance with the accursed Phocians. Aeschines retorted\r\nby charging the Amphisseans with cultivating and building upon the\r\nsacred plain of Cirrha--acts forbidden for all time in 586 B.C.--and\r\nroused the Council to such indignation that they gathered a body of men\r\nand destroyed the harbour and the unlawful buildings of Cirrha; but\r\nthey were severely handled by the Amphisseans, and the Council now\r\nvoted that the Amphictyonic states should send representatives, to\r\ndiscuss the question of war against Amphissa, to a meeting to be held\r\nat Thermopylae before the spring meeting of the Council. To this\r\npreliminary meeting, the Athenians (though inclined to view Aeschines'\r\nperformance with favour), on the advice of Demosthenes, sent no\r\nrepresentatives; nor did the Thebans (the allies of Amphissa). War was\r\ndeclared by the Amphictyons against Amphissa; but Cottyphus, the\r\nThessalian, who had been appointed general, made little headway, and\r\n(at the spring or the autumn meeting of the Council) declared that the\r\nAmphictyonic states must either send men and money, or else make Philip\r\ntheir general. Philip was, of course, at once appointed; but instead of\r\nproceeding against Amphissa, marched to Elateia and fortified it. This\r\ncaused the greatest alarm at Athens. Demosthenes was immediately\r\ndispatched to Thebes, where he succeeded, by what appear to have been\r\nliberal and judicious proposals, in making an alliance between Thebes\r\nand Athens, in spite of the attempts of Philip's envoys to counteract\r\nhis influence. Euboea, Megara, Corinth, and other members of the league\r\nalso sent help. Philip himself called upon his own friends in the\r\nPeloponnese for aid, and at last moved towards Amphissa. Demosthenes\r\nseems now to have succeeded in applying the festival-money to purposes\r\nof war, and with the aid of Lycurgus, who became Controller of the\r\nFestival Fund, to have amassed a large sum for the use of the State. At\r\nthe Dionysia of 338 he was again crowned, on the proposal of Demomeles\r\nand Hypereides. The allies at first won some successes and refortified\r\nsome of the Phocian towns, but afterwards unfortunately divided their\r\nforces, and so enabled Philip to defeat the two divisions separately,\r\nand to destroy Amphissa. Philip's proposals of peace found supporters\r\nboth in Thebes and in Athens, but were counteracted by Demosthenes.\r\nLate in the summer of 338, the decisive battle was fought at\r\nChaeroneia, and resulted in the total rout of the allies. Demosthenes\r\nhimself was one of the fugitives. Philip placed a Macedonian garrison\r\nin Thebes, restored his exiled friends to power there, established a\r\nCouncil of Three Hundred, and (through them) put to death or banished\r\nhis enemies. He also gave Orchomenus, Thespiae, and Plataeae their\r\nindependence. After a moment of panic, the Athenians, led by\r\nDemosthenes, Lycurgus, and Hypereides, proceeded to take all possible\r\nmeasures for the defence of the city, while private munificence\r\nsupplied the treasury. Demosthenes himself superintended the repair of\r\nthe fortifications, and went on a mission to secure a supply of corn.\r\nBut Philip, instead of marching upon Athens, sent a message by Demades,\r\nwhom he had taken prisoner at Chaeroneia; and the Assembly, in reply,\r\ninstructed Demades, Aeschines, and Phocion to ask Philip to release his\r\nAthenian prisoners. Philip released them without ransom, and sent\r\nAntipater and Alexander (with the ashes of the Athenian dead) to offer\r\nterms of peace. By the 'Peace of Demades', concluded while Demosthenes\r\nwas still absent, the alliance between Athens and Philip was renewed;\r\nthe independence of Athens was guaranteed; Oropus was taken from Thebes\r\nand restored to Athens; and she was permitted to retain Salamis, Samos,\r\nDelos, and probably Lemnos and Imbros. On the other hand, she lost all\r\nher possessions on the Hellespont and in the Chersonese, and promised\r\nto join the league which Philip intended to form for the invasion of\r\nPersia. Demosthenes was selected by the Assembly to deliver the funeral\r\noration upon those who fell at Chaeroneia; and although the Macedonian\r\nparty attacked him repeatedly in the law-courts, he was always\r\nacquitted. Philip paid a long visit to the Peloponnese, in the course\r\nof which he placed a Macedonian garrison in Corinth, ravaged Laconia,\r\ngiving parts of it to his allies, the Argives and Arcadians, and\r\nannounced his plans for the invasion of Persia at the head of the\r\nGreeks; he then returned to Macedonia.\r\n\r\nIn 337 Demosthenes was again Commissioner of Fortifications, as well as\r\nController of the Festival Fund--the most important office in the\r\nState. He not only performed his work most efficiently, but gave\r\nconsiderable sums for public purposes out of his private fortune; and\r\nearly in 336 Ctesiphon proposed, and the Council resolved, that he\r\nshould once more be crowned at the Dionysia. But before the proposal\r\ncould be brought before the Assembly, Aeschines indicted Ctesiphon for\r\nits alleged illegality. The trial did not take place until late in the\r\nsummer of 330. We do not know the reason for so long a delay, but\r\nprobably the events of the intervening time were such as to render the\r\nstate of public feeling unfavourable to Aeschines. In 336 Philip was\r\nassassinated, and was succeeded by Alexander. In 335 Alexander\r\ndestroyed Thebes, which had revolted, and sold its inhabitants into\r\nslavery. He also demanded from Athens the surrender of Demosthenes and\r\nother anti-Macedonian politicians and generals, but was persuaded to be\r\ncontent with the banishment of Charidemus and Ephialtes, and the\r\npromise of the prosecution of Demosthenes for using subsidies from\r\nPersia to help Thebes--a prosecution which was allowed to drop. From\r\n334 onwards Alexander was pursuing his conquests in the East, and we\r\nknow practically nothing of the history of Athens until the trial of\r\nCtesiphon came on in 330.\r\n\r\nAeschines alleged against Ctesiphon (1) that it was illegal to propose\r\nto crown any one who had not passed his examination before the Board of\r\nAuditors at the end of his term of office; and that Demosthenes, who\r\nhad been Commissioner of Fortifications and Controller of the Festival\r\nFund, was still in this position: (2) that it was illegal to proclaim\r\nthe grant of a crown at the Dionysia, except in the case of crowns\r\nconferred by foreign states: (3) that it was illegal to insert untrue\r\nstatements in the public records, and that the language in which\r\nCtesiphon's decree described the political career of Demosthenes was\r\nuntrue. On the first point Aeschines was almost certainly right:\r\nDemosthenes' defence is sophistical, and all that could really be said\r\nwas that the rule had often been broken before. On the second point,\r\ncertainty is impossible: the most probable view (though it also has its\r\ndifficulties) is that there were two inconsistent laws, and that one of\r\nthem permitted the proclamation in the theatre, if expressly voted by\r\nthe people; but the alleged illegality had certainly been often\r\ncommitted. The third point, which raised the question of the value to\r\nAthens of Demosthenes' whole political life, was that upon which the\r\ncase really turned; and it is to this that Demosthenes devotes the\r\ngreater part of his speech, breaking up his reply into convenient\r\nstages by discussions (of a far less happy description) of the other\r\ncounts of the indictment, and of the character and career of Aeschines.\r\nAs in the Speech on the Embassy, certain facts are misrepresented, and\r\nthere are passages which are in bad taste; but Demosthenes proves\r\nbeyond doubt his unswerving loyalty to the high ideal of policy which\r\nhe had formed for his country, and it is with good reason that parts of\r\nthis speech have always been felt to reach a height of eloquence which\r\nhas never been surpassed.\r\n\r\nThe jury acquitted Ctesiphon: and Aeschines, failing to obtain a fifth\r\npart of the votes, and thus incurring a heavy fine and the loss of some\r\nof the rights of a citizen, left Athens, and lived most of the\r\nremainder of his life at Rhodes.\r\n\r\nThe following is an analysis of the speech in outline:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  I.

And this means, not only that you should\r\nhave formed no prejudice, and should accord equal goodwill to each, but\r\nalso that you should give leave to every man who pleads before you to\r\nadopt that order, and make that defence, upon which he has resolved and\r\nfixed his choice.\r\n\r\n{3} I am in many respects at a disadvantage in the present controversy,\r\nas compared with Aeschines; and particularly, men of Athens, in two\r\npoints of importance. The first is that I am not contending for the\r\nsame stake as he. It is not the same thing for me to lose your goodwill\r\nnow, as it is for him to fail to win his case; since for me--but I\r\nwould say nothing unpleasant [n]* at the opening of my address--I say\r\nonly that Aeschines can well afford to risk this attack upon me. The\r\nsecond disadvantage lies in the natural and universal tendency of\r\nmankind to hear invective and denunciation with pleasure, and to be\r\noffended with those who praise themselves. {4} And of the two courses\r\nin question, that which contributes to men's pleasure has been given to\r\nAeschines, and that which annoys (I may say) every one is left for me.\r\nIf, to avoid giving such annoyance, I say nothing of all that I myself\r\nhave done, it will be thought that I am unable to clear myself of the\r\ncharges against me, or to show the grounds upon which I claim to\r\ndeserve distinction. If, on the other hand, I proceed to speak of my\r\npast acts and my political life, I shall often be compelled to speak of\r\nmyself. I will endeavour, then, to do this as modestly as possible; and\r\nfor all that the necessities of the case compel me to say, the blame\r\nmust in fairness be borne by the prosecutor, who initiated a trial of\r\nsuch a kind as this.\r\n\r\n{5} I think, men of Athens, that you would all admit that this present\r\ntrial equally concerns myself and Ctesiphon, and demands no less\r\nearnest attention from me than from him. For while it is a painful and\r\na grievous thing for a man to be robbed of anything, particularly if it\r\nis at the hands of an enemy that this befalls him, it is especially so,\r\nwhen he is robbed of your goodwill and kindness, just in proportion as\r\nto win these is the greatest possible gain. {6} And because such is the\r\nissue at stake in the present trial, I request and entreat you all\r\nalike to give me, while I make my defence upon the charges that have\r\nbeen brought against me, a fair hearing, as you are commanded to do by\r\nthe laws--those laws to which their original maker, your well-wisher\r\nand the People's friend, Solon, thought fit to give the sanction not of\r\nenactment only, but also of an oath on the part of those who act as\r\njudges: {7} not because he distrusted you (so at least it seems to me),\r\nbut because he saw that a defendant cannot escape from the imputations\r\nand the slanders which fall with special force from the prosecutor,\r\nbecause he is the first to speak, unless each of you who sit in\r\njudgement, keeping his conscience pure in the sight of God, will\r\nreceive the pleadings of the later speaker also with the same favour,\r\nand will thus, because his attention has been given equally and\r\nimpartially to both sides, form his decision upon the case in its\r\nentirety.\r\n\r\n{8} And now, when I am about, as it seems, to render an account of my\r\nwhole private life and public career, I would once more invoke the aid\r\nof the gods; and in the presence of you all I pray, first, that the\r\ngoodwill which I ever feel towards this city and towards all of you,\r\nmay in equal measure be vouchsafed to me by you at this trial; and\r\nsecondly, that whatsoever judgement upon this present suit will conduce\r\nto your public reputation, and the purity of each man's conscience,\r\nthat judgement they may put it into all your minds to give.\r\n\r\n{9} Now if Aeschines had confined his charges to the subject of the\r\nindictment, I too, in making my defence, would have dealt at once with\r\nthe actual resolution of the Council. But since he has devoted no less\r\na portion of his speech to the relation of other matters, and for the\r\nmost part has spoken against me falsely, I think it is necessary, and\r\nat the same time just, that I should deal briefly, men of Athens, with\r\nthese, in order that none of you may be led by irrelevant arguments to\r\nlisten less favourably to my pleas in answer to the indictment itself.\r\n\r\n{10} As for his slanderous vituperation of my private life, mark how\r\nstraightforward and how just is the reply that I make. If you know me\r\nas the man that he charged me with being (for my life has been spent\r\nnowhere but in your own midst), do not even suffer me to speak--no, not\r\nthough my whole public career has been one of transcendent merit--but\r\nrise and condemn me without delay. But if, in your judgement and\r\nbelief, I am a better man than Aeschines, and come of better men; if I\r\nand mine are no worse than any other respectable persons (to use no\r\noffensive expression); then do not trust him even in regard to other\r\npoints, for it is plain that all that he said was equally fictitious;\r\nbut once more accord to me to-day the goodwill which throughout the\r\npast you have so often displayed towards me in previous trials. {11}\r\nKnave as you are,[n] Aeschines, you were assuredly more fool than\r\nknave, when you thought that I should dismiss all that I had to say\r\nwith regard to my past acts and political life, and should turn to meet\r\nthe abuse that fell from you. I shall not do so; I am not so\r\nbrain-sick; but I will review the falsehoods and the calumnies which\r\nyou uttered against my political career; and then, if the court desires\r\nit, I will afterwards refer to the ribald language that has been so\r\nincontinently used.\r\n\r\n{12} The offences charged against me are many; and for some of them the\r\nlaws assign heavy and even the most extreme penalties. But I will tell\r\nyou what is the motive which animates the present suit. It gives play\r\nto the malice of a personal enemy, to his insolence, his abuse, his\r\ncontumelies, and every expression of his hostility: and yet, assuming\r\nthat the charges and the imputations which have been made are true, it\r\ndoes not enable the State[n] to exact a penalty that is adequate, or\r\nnearly adequate, to the offences. {13} For it is not right to seek to\r\ndebar another from coming before the people[n] and receiving a hearing,\r\nnor to do so in a spirit of malice and envy. Heaven knows, it is\r\nneither straightforward, nor citizen-like, nor just, men of Athens! If\r\nthe crimes by which he saw me injuring the city were of such a\r\nmagnitude as he just now so theatrically set forth, he should have had\r\nrecourse to the punishments enjoined by the laws at the time of the\r\ncrimes themselves. If he saw me so acting as to deserve impeachment, he\r\nshould have impeached me, and so brought me to trial before you; if he\r\nsaw me proposing illegal measures, he should have indicted me for their\r\nillegality. For surely, if he can prosecute Ctesiphon on my account, he\r\nwould not have failed to indict me in person, had he thought that he\r\ncould convict me. {14} And further, if he saw me committing any of\r\nthose other crimes against you, which he just now slanderously\r\nenumerated, or any other crimes whatsoever, there are laws which deal\r\nwith each, and punishments, and lawsuits and judgements involving\r\npenalties that are harsh and severe: to all of these he could have had\r\nrecourse; and from the moment when it was seen that he had acted so,\r\nand had conducted his hostilities against me on that plan, his present\r\naccusation of me would have been in line with his past conduct. {15}\r\nBut as it is, he has forsaken the straight path of justice; he has\r\nshrunk from all attempts to convict me at the time; and after all these\r\nyears, with the imputations, the jests, the invectives, that he has\r\naccumulated, he appears to play his part. So it is, that though his\r\naccusations are against me, it is Ctesiphon that he prosecutes; and\r\nthough he sets his quarrel with me in the forefront of the whole suit,\r\nhe has never faced me in person to settle the quarrel, and it is\r\nanother whom we see him trying to deprive of his civil rights. {16} Yet\r\nsurely, besides everything else that may be pleaded on behalf of\r\nCtesiphon, this, I think, may surely be most reasonably urged--that we\r\nought in justice to have brought our own quarrel to the test by\r\nourselves, instead of avoiding all conflict with one another, and\r\nlooking for a third party to whom we could do harm. Such iniquity\r\nreally passes all bounds.\r\n\r\n{17} From this one may see the nature of all his charges alike,\r\nuttered, as they have been, without justice or regard for truth. Yet I\r\ndesire also to examine them severally, and more particularly the false\r\nstatements which he made against me in regard to the Peace and the\r\nEmbassy, when he ascribed to me[n] the things which he himself had done\r\nin conjunction with Philocrates. And here it is necessary, men of\r\nAthens, and perhaps appropriate,[n] that I should remind you of the\r\nstate of affairs subsisting during that period, so that you may view\r\neach group of actions in the light of the circumstances of the time.\r\n\r\n{18} When the Phocian war had broken out[n] (not through any action of\r\nmine, for I had not yet entered public life), your own attitude, in the\r\nfirst place, was such, that you wished for the preservation of the\r\nPhocians, although you saw that their actions were unjustifiable; while\r\nyou would have been delighted at anything that might happen to the\r\nThebans, against whom you felt an indignation that was neither\r\nunreasonable nor unfair; for they had not used their good fortune at\r\nLeuctra with moderation. And, in the second place, the Peloponnese was\r\nall disunited: those who detested the Spartans [n] were not strong\r\nenough to annihilate them, and those who had previously governed with\r\nthe support of Sparta [n] were no longer able to maintain their control\r\nover their cities; but both these and all the other states were in a\r\ncondition of indeterminate strife and confusion. {19} When Philip saw\r\nthis (for it was not hard to see), he tried, by dispensing money to the\r\ntraitors whom each state contained, to throw them all into collision\r\nand stir up one against another; and thus, amid the blunders and\r\nperversity of others, he was making his own preparations, and growing\r\ngreat to the danger of all. And when it became clear to all that the\r\nthen overbearing (but now unhappy) Thebans, distressed by the length of\r\nthe war, would be forced to fly to you for aid,[n] Philip, to prevent\r\nthis--to prevent the formation of any union between the cities--made\r\noffers of peace to you, and of assistance to them. {20} Now what was it\r\nthat helped him, and enabled him to find in you his almost willing\r\ndupes? It was the baseness (if that is the right name to use), or the\r\nignorance, or both, of the rest of the Hellenes, who, though you were\r\nengaged in a long and continuous war, and that on behalf of the\r\ninterests of all, as has been proved by the event, never assisted you\r\neither with money or with men, or in any other way whatsoever. And in\r\nyour just and proper indignation with them, you listened readily to\r\nPhilip. It was for these reasons, therefore, and not through any action\r\nof mine, that the Peace which we then conceded was negotiated; and any\r\none who investigates the matter honestly will find that it is the\r\ncrimes and the corrupt practices of these men, in the course of the\r\nnegotiations, that are responsible for our position to-day. {21} It is\r\nin the interests of truth that I enter into all these events with this\r\nexactitude and thoroughness; for however strong the appearance of\r\ncriminality in these proceedings may be, it has, I imagine, nothing to\r\ndo with me. The first man to suggest or mention the Peace was\r\nAristodemus[n] the actor; and the person who took the matter up and\r\nmoved the motion, and sold his services for the purpose, along with\r\nAeschines, was Philocrates of Hagnus--your partner, Aeschines, not\r\nmine, even if you split your sides with lying; while those who\r\nsupported him, from whatever motive (for of that I say nothing at\r\npresent), were Eubulus and Cephisophon. I had no part in the matter\r\nanywhere. {22} And yet, although the facts are such as with absolute\r\ntruth I am representing them to be, he carried his effrontery so far as\r\nto dare to assert that I was not only responsible for the Peace, but\r\nhad also prevented the city from acting in conjunction with a general\r\nassembly of the Hellenes in making it. What? and you--oh! how can one\r\nfind a name that can be applied to you?--when you saw me (for you were\r\nthere) preventing the city from taking this great step and forming so\r\ngrand an alliance as you just now described, did you once raise a\r\nprotest or come forward to give information and to set forth the crimes\r\nwith which you now charge me? {23} If I had covenanted with Philip for\r\nmoney that I would prevent the coalition of the Hellenes, your only\r\ncourse was to refuse to keep silence--to cry aloud, to protest, to\r\nreveal the fact to your fellow countrymen. On no occasion did you do\r\nthis: no such utterance of yours was ever heard by any one. In fact\r\nthere was no embassy away at the time on a mission to any Hellenic\r\nstate; the Hellenes had all long ago been tried and found wanting;[n]\r\nand in all that he has said upon this matter there is not a single\r\nsound word. {24} And, apart from that, his falsehoods involve the\r\ngreatest calumnies upon this city. For if you were at one and the same\r\ntime convoking the Hellenes with a view to war, and sending ambassadors\r\nyourselves to Philip to discuss peace, it was a deed for a\r\nEurybatus,[n] not a task for a state or for honest men, that you were\r\ncarrying out. But that is not the case; indeed it is not. For what\r\ncould possibly have been your object in summoning them at that moment?\r\nWas it with a view to peace? But they all had peace already. Or with a\r\nview to war? But you were yourselves discussing peace. It is therefore\r\nevident that neither was it I that introduced or was responsible for\r\nthe Peace in its original shape, nor is one of all the other falsehoods\r\nwhich he told of me shown to be true.\r\n\r\n{25} Again, consider the course of action which, when the city had\r\nconcluded the Peace, each of us now chose to adopt. For from this you\r\nwill know who it was that co-operated with Philip throughout, and who\r\nit was that acted in your interest and sought the good of the city. As\r\nfor me, I proposed, as a member of the Council, that the ambassadors\r\nshould sail as quickly as possible to any district in which they should\r\nascertain Philip to be, and receive his oath from him. {26} But even\r\nwhen I had carried this resolution, they would not act upon it. What\r\ndid this mean, men of Athens? I will inform you. Philip's interest\r\nrequired that the interval before he took the oath should be as long as\r\npossible; yours, that it should be as short as possible. And why?\r\nBecause you broke off all your preparations for the war, not merely\r\nfrom the day when he took the oath, but from the day when you first\r\nhoped that Peace would be made; and for his part, this was what he was\r\nall along working for; for he thought (and with truth) that whatever\r\nplaces he could snatch from Athens before he took the oath, would\r\nremain securely his, since no one would break the Peace for their sake.\r\n{27} Foreseeing and calculating upon this, men of Athens, I proposed\r\nthis decree--that we should sail to any district in which Philip might\r\nbe, and receive his oath as soon as possible, in order that the oaths\r\nmight be taken while the Thracians, your allies, were still in\r\npossession of those strongholds[n] of which Aeschines just now spoke\r\nwith contempt--Serrhium, Myrtenum, and Ergiske; and that Philip might\r\nnot snatch from us the keys of the country and make himself master of\r\nThrace, nor obtain an abundant supply of money and of soldiers, and so\r\nproceed without difficulty to the prosecution of his further designs.\r\n{28} And now, instead of citing or reading this decree he slanders me\r\non the ground that I thought fit, as a member of the Council, to\r\nintroduce the envoys. But what should I have done? Was I to propose\r\n_not_ to introduce those who had come for the express purpose of\r\nspeaking with you? or to order the lessee of the theatre not to assign\r\nthem seats? But they would have watched the play from the threepenny\r\nseats,[n] if this decree had not been proposed. Should I have guarded\r\nthe interests of the city in petty details, and sold them wholesale, as\r\nmy opponents did? Surely not. (_To the clerk_.) Now take this decree,\r\nwhich the prosecutor passed over, though he knew it well, and read it.\r\n\r\n{29} [_The decree of Demosthenes is read_.]\r\n\r\n{30} Though I had carried this decree, and was seeking the good not of\r\nPhilip, but of the city, these worthy ambassadors paid little heed to\r\nit, but sat idle in Macedonia for three whole months,[n] until Philip\r\narrived from Thrace, after subduing the whole country; when they might,\r\nwithin ten days, or equally well[n] within three or four, have reached\r\nthe Hellespont, and saved the strongholds, by receiving his oath before\r\nhe could seize them. For he would not have touched them when we were\r\npresent; or else, if he had done so, we should have refused to\r\nadminister the oath to him; and in that case he would have failed to\r\nobtain the Peace: he would not have had both the Peace and the\r\nstrongholds as well.\r\n\r\n{31} Such was Philip's first act of fraud, during the time of the\r\nEmbassy, and the first instance of venality on the part of these wicked\r\nmen; and over this I confess that then and now and always I have been\r\nand am at war and at variance with them. Now observe, immediately after\r\nthis, a second and even greater piece of villainy. {32} As soon as\r\nPhilip had sworn to the Peace, after first gaining possession of Thrace\r\nbecause these men did not obey my decree, he obtained from them--again\r\nby purchase--the postponement of our departure from Macedonia, until\r\nall should be in readiness for his campaign against the Phocians; in\r\norder that, instead of our bringing home a report of his intentions and\r\nhis preparations for the march, which would make you set out and sail\r\nround to Thermopylae with your war-ships as you did before,[n] you\r\nmight only hear our report of the facts when he was already on this\r\nside of Thermopylae, and you could do nothing. {33} And Philip was\r\nbeset with such fear and such a weight of anxiety, lest in spite of his\r\noccupation of these places, his object should slip from his grasp, if,\r\nbefore the Phocians were destroyed, you resolved to assist them, that\r\nhe hired this despicable creature, not now in company with his\r\ncolleagues, but by himself alone, to make to you a statement and a\r\nreport of such a character that owing to them all was lost. {34} But I\r\nrequest and entreat you, men of Athens, to remember throughout this\r\nwhole trial, that, had Aeschines made no accusation that was not\r\nincluded in the indictment, I too would not have said a word that did\r\nnot bear upon it; but since he has had recourse to all kinds of\r\nimputation and slander at once, I am compelled also to give a brief\r\nanswer to each group of charges. {35} What then were the statements\r\nuttered by him that day, in consequence of which all was lost? 'You\r\nmust not be perturbed,' he said, 'at Philip's having crossed to this\r\nside of Thermopylae; for you will get everything that you desire, if\r\nyou remain quiet; and within two or three days you will hear that he\r\nhas become the friend of those whose enemy he was, and the enemy of\r\nthose whose friend he was, when he first came. For,' said he, 'it is\r\nnot phrases that confirm friendships' (a finely sententious\r\nexpression!) 'but identity of interest; and it is to the interest of\r\nPhilip and of the Phocians and of yourselves alike, to be rid of the\r\nheartless and overbearing demeanour of the Thebans.' {36} To these\r\nstatements some gave a ready ear, in consequence of the tacit\r\nill-feeling towards the Thebans at the time. What then followed--and\r\nnot after a long interval, but immediately? The Phocians were\r\noverthrown; their cities were razed to the ground; you, who had\r\nbelieved Aeschines and remained inactive, were soon afterwards bringing\r\nin your effects from the country; while Aeschines received his gold;\r\nand besides all this, the city reaped the ill-will of the Thebans and\r\nThessalians, while their gratitude for what had been done went to\r\nPhilip. {37} To prove that this is so, (_to the clerk_) read me both\r\nthe decree of Callisthenes,[n] and Philip's letter. (_To the jury_.)\r\nThese two documents together will make all the facts plain. (_To the\r\nclerk_.) Read.\r\n\r\n{38} [_The decree of Callisthenes is read_.]\r\n\r\nWere these the hopes, on the strength of which you made the Peace? Was\r\nthis what this hireling promised you? {39} (_To the clerk_.) Now read\r\nthe letter which Philip sent after this.\r\n\r\n[_Philip's letter is read_.]\r\n\r\n{40} You hear how obviously, in this letter sent to you, Philip is\r\naddressing definite information to his own allies. 'I have done these\r\nthings,' he tells them, 'against the will of the Athenians, and to\r\ntheir annoyance; and so, men of Thebes and Thessaly, if you are wise,\r\nyou will regard them as enemies, and will trust me.' He does not write\r\nin those actual terms, but that is what he intends to indicate. By\r\nthese means he so carried them away, that they did not foresee or\r\nrealize any of the consequences, but allowed him to get everything into\r\nhis own power: and that is why, poor men, they have experienced their\r\npresent calamities. {41} But the man who helped him to create this\r\nconfidence, who co-operated with him, who brought home that false\r\nreport and deluded you, he it is who now bewails the sufferings of the\r\nThebans and enlarges upon their piteousness--he, who is himself the\r\ncause both of these and of the misery in Phocis, and of all the other\r\nevils which the Hellenes have endured. Yes, it is evident that you are\r\npained at what has come to pass, Aeschines, and that you are sorry for\r\nthe Thebans, when you have property in Boeotia[n] and are farming the\r\nland that was theirs; and that I rejoice at it--I, whose surrender was\r\nimmediately demanded by the author of the disaster! {42} But I have\r\ndigressed into subjects of which it will perhaps be more convenient to\r\nspeak presently. I will return to the proofs which show that it is the\r\ncrimes of these men that are the cause of our condition to-day.\r\n\r\nFor when you had been deceived by Philip, through the agency of these\r\nmen, who while serving as ambassadors had sold themselves and made a\r\nreport in which there was not a word of truth--when the unhappy\r\nPhocians had been deceived and their cities annihilated--what followed?\r\n{43} The despicable Thessalians and the slow-witted Thebans regarded\r\nPhilip as their friend, their benefactor, their saviour. Philip was\r\ntheir all-in-all. They would not even listen to the voice of any one\r\nwho wished to express a different opinion. You yourselves, though you\r\nviewed what had been done with suspicion and vexation, nevertheless\r\nkept the Peace; for there was nothing else that you could have done.\r\nAnd the other Hellenes, who, like yourselves, had been deluded and\r\ndisappointed of their hopes,[n] also kept the Peace, and gladly;[n]\r\nsince in a sense they also were remotely aimed at by the war. {44} For\r\nwhen Philip was going about and subduing the Illyrians and Triballi and\r\nsome of the Hellenes as well, and bringing many large forces into his\r\nown power, and when some of the members of the several States were\r\ntaking advantage of the Peace to travel to Macedonia, and were being\r\ncorrupted--Aeschines among them--at such a time all of those whom\r\nPhilip had in view in thus making his preparations were really being\r\nattacked by him. {45} Whether they failed to realize it is another\r\nquestion, which does not concern me. For I was continually uttering\r\nwarnings and protests, both in your midst and wherever I was sent. But\r\nthe cities were stricken with disease: those who were engaged in\r\npolitical and practical affairs were taking bribes and being corrupted\r\nby the hope of money; while the mass of private citizens either showed\r\nno foresight, or else were caught by the bait of ease and leisure from\r\nday to day; and all alike had fallen victims to some such delusive\r\nfancy, as that the danger would come upon every one but themselves, and\r\nthat through the perils of others they would be able to secure their\r\nown position as they pleased. {46} And so, I suppose, it has come to\r\npass that the masses have atoned for their great and ill-timed\r\nindifference by the loss of their freedom, while the leaders in\r\naffairs, who fancied that they were selling everything except\r\nthemselves, have realized that they had sold themselves first of all.\r\nFor instead of being called friends and guest-friends, as they were\r\ncalled at the time when they were taking their bribes, they now hear\r\nthemselves called flatterers, and god-forsaken, and all the other names\r\nthat they deserve. {47} For no one, men of Athens, spends his money out\r\nof a desire to benefit the traitor; nor, when once he has secured the\r\nobject for which he bargains, does he employ the traitor to advise him\r\nwith regard to other objects: if it were so, nothing could be happier\r\nthan a traitor. But it is not so, of course. Far from it! When the\r\naspirant after dominion has gained his object, he is also the master of\r\nthose who have sold it to him: and because then he knows their\r\nvillainy, he then hates and mistrusts them, and covers them with\r\ninsults. {48} For observe--for even if the time of the events is past,\r\nthe time for realizing truths like these is ever present to wise men.\r\nLasthenes[n] was called his 'friend'; but only until he had betrayed\r\nOlynthus. And Timolaus;[n] but only until he had destroyed Thebes. And\r\nEudicus and Simus[n] of Larissa; but only until they had put Thessaly\r\nin Philip's power. And now, persecuted as they are, and insulted, and\r\nsubjected to every kind of misery, the whole inhabited world has become\r\nfilled with such men. And what of Aristratus[n] at Sicyon? what of\r\nPerillus[n] at Megara? Are they not outcasts? {49} From these instances\r\none can see very clearly, that it is he who best protects his own\r\ncountry and speaks most constantly against such men, that secures for\r\ntraitors and hirelings like yourselves, Aeschines, the continuance of\r\nyour opportunities for taking bribes. It is the majority of those who\r\nare here, those who resist your will, that you must thank for the fact\r\nthat you live and draw your pay; for, left to yourselves, you would\r\nlong ago have perished.\r\n\r\n{50} There is still much that I might say about the transactions of\r\nthat time, but I think that even what I have said is more than enough.\r\nThe blame rests with Aeschines, who has drenched me with the stale\r\ndregs[n] of his own villainy and crime, from which I was compelled to\r\nclear myself in the eyes of those who are too young to remember the\r\nevents; though perhaps you who knew, even before I said a single word,\r\nof Aeschines' service as a hireling, may have felt some annoyance as\r\nyou listened. {51} He calls it, forsooth, 'friendship' and\r\n'guest-friendship'; and somewhere in his speech just now he used the\r\nexpression, 'the man who casts in my teeth my guest-friendship with\r\nAlexander.' _I_ cast in your teeth your guest-friendship with\r\nAlexander? How did you acquire it? How came you to be thought worthy of\r\nit? Never would I call you the guest-friend of Philip or the friend of\r\nAlexander--I am not so insane--unless you are to call harvesters and\r\nother hired servants the friends and guest-friends of those who have\r\nhired them. [But that is not the case, of course. Far from it!] {52}\r\nNay, I call you the hireling, formerly of Philip, and now of Alexander,\r\nand so do all who are present. If you disbelieve me, ask them--or\r\nrather I will ask them for you. Men of Athens, do you think of\r\nAeschines as the hireling or as the guest-friend of Alexander? You hear\r\nwhat they say.\r\n\r\n{53} I now wish, without more delay, to make my defence upon the\r\nindictment itself, and to go through my past acts, in order that\r\nAeschines may hear (though he knows them well) the grounds on which I\r\nclaim to have a right both to the gifts which the Council have\r\nproposed, and even to far greater than these. (_To the clerk_.) Now\r\ntake the indictment and read it.\r\n\r\n{54, 55} [The indictment is read.]\r\n\r\n{56} These, men of Athens, are the points in the resolution which the\r\nprosecutor assails; and these very points will, I think, afford me my\r\nfirst means of proving to you that the defence which I am about to\r\noffer is an absolutely fair one. For I will take the points of the\r\nindictment in the very same order as the prosecutor: I will speak of\r\neach in succession, and will knowingly pass over nothing. {57} Any\r\ndecision upon the statement that I 'consistently do and say what is\r\nbest for the People, and am eager to do whatever good I can', and upon\r\nthe proposal to vote me thanks for this, depends, I consider, upon my\r\npast political career: for it is by an investigation of my career that\r\neither the truth and the propriety, or else the falsehood, of these\r\nstatements which Ctesiphon has made about me will be discovered. {58}\r\nAgain, the proposal to crown me, without the addition of the clause\r\n'when he has submitted to his examination', and the order to proclaim\r\nthe award of the crown in the theatre, must, I imagine, stand or fall\r\nwith my political career; for the question is whether I deserve the\r\ncrown and the proclamation before my fellow countrymen or not. At the\r\nsame time I consider myself further bound to point out to you the laws\r\nunder which the defendant's proposal could be made. In this honest and\r\nstraightforward manner, men of Athens, I have determined to make my\r\ndefence; and now I will proceed to speak of my past actions themselves.\r\n{59} And let no one imagine that I am detaching my argument from its\r\nconnexion with the indictment, if I break into a discussion of\r\ninternational transactions. For it is the prosecutor who, by assailing\r\nthe clause of the decree which states that I do and say what is best,\r\nand by indicting it as false, has rendered the discussion of my whole\r\npolitical career essentially germane to the indictment; and further,\r\nout of the many careers which public life offers, it was the department\r\nof international affairs that I chose; so that I have a right to derive\r\nmy proofs also from that department.\r\n\r\n{60} I will pass over all that Philip snatched from us and secured, in\r\nthe days before I took part in public life as an orator. None of these\r\nlosses, I imagine, has anything to do with me. But I will recall to\r\nyou, and will render you an account of all that, from the day when I\r\nentered upon this career, he was _prevented_ from taking, when I have\r\nmade one remark. {61} Philip, men of Athens, had a great advantage in\r\nhis favour. For in the midst of the Hellenic peoples--and not of some\r\nonly, but of all alike--there had sprung up a crop of\r\ntraitors--corrupt, god-forsaken men--more numerous than they have ever\r\nbeen within the memory of man. These he took to help and co-operate\r\nwith him; and great as the mutual ill-will and dissensions of the\r\nHellenes already were, he rendered them even worse, by deceiving some,\r\nmaking presents to others, and corrupting others in every way; and at a\r\ntime when all had in reality but one interest--to prevent his becoming\r\npowerful--he divided them into a number of factions. {62} All the\r\nHellenes then being in this condition, still ignorant of the growing\r\nand accumulating evil, you have to ask yourselves, men of Athens, what\r\npolicy and action it was fitting for the city to choose, and to hold me\r\nresponsible for this; for the person who assumed that responsibility in\r\nthe State was myself. {63} Should she, Aeschines, have sacrificed her\r\npride and her own dignity? Should she have joined the ranks of the\r\nThessalians and Dolopes,[n] and helped Philip to acquire the empire of\r\nHellas, cancelling thereby the noble and righteous deeds of our\r\nforefathers? Or, if she should not have done this (for it would have\r\nbeen in very truth an atrocious thing), should she have looked on,\r\nwhile all that she saw would happen, if no one prevented it--all that\r\nshe realized, it seems, at a distance--was actually taking place? {64}\r\nNay, I should be glad to ask to-day the severest critic of my actions,\r\nwhich party he would have desired the city to join--the party which\r\nshares the responsibility for the misery and disgrace which has fallen\r\nupon the Hellenes (the party of the Thessalians and their supporters,\r\none may call it), or the party which looked on while these calamities\r\nwere taking place, in the hope of gaining some advantage for\r\nthemselves--in which we should place the Arcadians and Messenians and\r\nArgives. {65} But even of these, many--nay, all--have in the end fared\r\nworse than we. For if Philip had departed immediately after his\r\nvictory, and gone his way; if afterwards he had remained at peace, and\r\nhad given no trouble whatever to any of his own allies or of the other\r\nHellenes; then there would have been some ground for blaming and\r\naccusing those who had opposed his plans. But if he has stripped them\r\nall alike of their dignity, their paramountcy, and their\r\nindependence--nay, even of their free constitutions,[n] wherever he\r\ncould do so--can it be denied that the policy which you adopted on my\r\nadvice was the most glorious policy possible?\r\n\r\n{66} But I return to my former point. What was it fitting for the city\r\nto do, Aeschines, when she saw Philip establishing for himself a\r\ndespotic sway over the Hellenes? What language should have been used,\r\nwhat measures proposed, by the adviser of the people at Athens (for\r\nthat it was at Athens makes the utmost difference), when I knew that\r\nfrom the very first, up to the day when I myself ascended the platform,\r\nmy country had always contended for pre-eminence, honour, and glory,\r\nand in the cause of honour, and for the interests of all, had\r\nsacrificed more money and lives than any other Hellenic people had\r\nspent for their private ends: {67} when I saw that Philip himself, with\r\nwhom our conflict lay, for the sake of empire and absolute power, had\r\nhad his eye knocked out, his collar-bone broken, his hand and his leg\r\nmaimed, and was ready to resign any part of his body that Fortune chose\r\nto take from him, provided that with what remained he might live in\r\nhonour and glory? {68} And surely no one would dare to say that it was\r\nfitting that in one bred at Pella, a place then inglorious and\r\ninsignificant, there should have grown up so lofty a spirit that he\r\naspired after the empire of Hellas, and conceived such a project in his\r\nmind; but that in you, who are Athenians, and who day by day in all\r\nthat you hear and see behold the memorials of the gallantry of your\r\nforefathers, such baseness should be found, that you would yield up\r\nyour liberty to Philip by your own deliberate offer and deed. {69} No\r\nman would say this. One alternative remained, and that, one which you\r\nwere bound to take--that of a righteous resistance to the whole course\r\nof action by which he was doing you injury. You acted thus from the\r\nfirst, quite rightly and properly; while I helped by my proposals and\r\nadvice during the time of my political activity, and I do not deny it.\r\nBut what ought I to have done? For the time has come to ask you this,\r\nAeschines, and to dismiss everything else. {70} Amphipolis, Pydna,\r\nPoteidaea, Halonnesus--all are blotted from my memory. As for Serrhium,\r\nDoriscus, the sack of Peparethus, and all the other injuries inflicted\r\nupon the city, I renounce all knowledge of their ever having\r\nhappened--though you actually said that _I_ involved my countrymen in\r\nhostility by talking of these things, when the decrees which deal with\r\nthem were the work of Eubulus and Aristophon[n] and Diopeithes,[n] and\r\nnot mine at all--so glibly do you assert anything that suits your\r\npurpose! {71} But of this too I say nothing at present. I only ask you\r\nwhether Philip, who was appropriating Euboea,[n] and establishing it as\r\na stronghold to command Attica; who was making an attempt upon Megara,\r\nseizing Oreus, razing the walls of Porthmus, setting up Philistides as\r\ntyrant at Oreus and Cleitarchus at Eretria, bringing the Hellespont\r\ninto his own power, besieging Byzantium, destroying some of the cities\r\nof Hellas, and restoring his exiled friends to others--whether he, I\r\nsay, in acting thus, was guilty of wrong, violating the truce and\r\nbreaking the Peace, or not? Was it fit that one of the Hellenes should\r\narise to prevent it, or not? {72} If it was not fit--if it was fit that\r\nHellas should become like the Mysian booty[n] in the proverb before\r\nmen's eyes, while the Athenians had life and being, then I have lost my\r\nlabour in speaking upon this theme, and the city has lost its labour in\r\nobeying me: then let everything that has been done be counted for a\r\ncrime and a blunder, and those my own! But if it was right that one\r\nshould arise to prevent it, for whom could the task be more fitting\r\nthan for the people of Athens? That then, was the aim of _my_ policy;\r\nand when I saw Philip reducing all mankind to servitude, I opposed him,\r\nand without ceasing warned and exhorted you to make no surrender.\r\n\r\n{73} But the Peace, Aeschines, was in reality broken by Philip, when he\r\nseized the corn-ships, not by Athens. (_To the clerk_.) Bring the\r\ndecrees themselves, and the letter of Philip, and read them in order.\r\n(_To the jury_.) For they will make it clear who is responsible, and\r\nfor what.\r\n\r\n{74} [_A decree is read_.]\r\n\r\n{75} This decree then was proposed by Eubulus, not by me; and the next\r\nby Aristophon; he is followed first by Hegesippus, and he by Aristophon\r\nagain, and then by Philocrates, then by Cephisophon, and then by all of\r\nthem. But I proposed no decree upon this subject. (_To the clerk_.)\r\nRead.\r\n\r\n[_Decrees are read_.]\r\n\r\n{76} As then I point to these decrees, so, Aeschines, do you point to a\r\ndecree of any kind, proposed by me, which makes me responsible for the\r\nwar. You cannot do so: for had you been able, there is nothing which\r\nyou would sooner have produced. Indeed, even Philip himself makes no\r\ncharge against me as regards the war, though he complains of others.\r\n(_To the clerk_.) Read Philip's letter itself.\r\n\r\n{77, 78} [_Philip's letter is read_.]\r\n\r\n{79} In this letter he has nowhere mentioned the name of Demosthenes,\r\nnor made any charge against me. Why is it then that, though he\r\ncomplains of others, he has not mentioned my own actions? Because, if\r\nhe had written anything about me, he must have mentioned his own acts\r\nof wrong; for it was these acts upon which I kept my grip, and these\r\nwhich I opposed. First of all, when he was trying to steal into the\r\nPeloponnese, I proposed the embassy to the Peloponnese;[n] then, when\r\nhe was grasping at Euboea, the embassy to Euboea;[n] then the\r\nexpedition--not an embassy any more--to Oreus,[n] and that to Eretria,\r\nwhen he had established tyrants in those cities. {80} After that I\r\ndispatched all the naval expeditions, in the course of which the\r\nChersonese and Byzantium and all our allies were saved. In consequence\r\nof this, the noblest rewards at the hands of those who had benefited by\r\nyour action became yours--votes of thanks, glory, honours, crowns,\r\ngratitude; while of the victims of his aggression, those who followed\r\nyour advice at the time secured their own deliverance, and those who\r\nneglected it had the memory of your warnings constantly in their minds,\r\nand regarded you not merely as their well-wishers, but as men of wisdom\r\nand prophetic insight; for all that you foretold has come to pass. {81}\r\nAnd further, that Philistides would have given a large sum to retain\r\nOreus, and Cleitarchus to retain Eretria, and Philip himself, to be\r\nable to count upon the use of these places against you, and to escape\r\nall exposure of his other proceedings and all investigation, by any one\r\nin any place, of his wrongful acts--all this is not unknown to any one,\r\nleast of all to you, Aeschines. {82} For the envoys sent at that time\r\nby Cleitarchus and Philistides lodged at your house, when they came\r\nhere, and you acted as their patron.[n] Though the city rejected them,\r\nas enemies whose proposals were neither just nor expedient, to you they\r\nwere friends. None of their attempts succeeded, slander me though you\r\nmay, when you assert that I say nothing when I receive money, but cry\r\nout when I spend it. That, certainly, is not _your_ way: for you cry\r\nout with money in your hands, and will never cease, unless those\r\npresent cause you to do so by taking away your civil rights[n] to-day.\r\n{83} Now on that occasion, gentlemen, you crowned me for my conduct.\r\nAristonicus proposed a decree whose very syllables were identical with\r\nthose of Ctesiphon's present proposal; the crown was proclaimed in the\r\ntheatre; and this was already the second proclamation[n] in my honour:\r\nand yet Aeschines, though he was there, neither opposed the decree, nor\r\nindicted the mover. (_To the clerk_.) Take this decree also and read it.\r\n\r\n{84} [_The decree of Aristonicus is read_.]\r\n\r\n{85} Now is any of you aware of any discredit that attached itself to\r\nthe city owing to this decree? Did any mockery or ridicule ensue, such\r\nas Aeschines said must follow on the present occasion, if I were\r\ncrowned? But surely when proceedings are recent and well known to all,\r\nthen it is that, if they are satisfactory, they meet with gratitude,\r\nand if they are otherwise, with punishment. It appears, then, that on\r\nthat occasion I met with gratitude, not with blame or punishment.\r\n\r\n{86} Thus the fact that, up to the time when these events took place, I\r\nacted throughout as was best for the city, has been acknowledged by the\r\nvictory of my advice and my proposals in your deliberations, by the\r\nsuccessful execution of the measures which I proposed, and the award of\r\ncrowns in consequence of them to the city and to myself and to all, and\r\nby your celebration of sacrifices to the gods, and processions, in\r\nthankfulness for these blessings.\r\n\r\n{87} When Philip had been expelled from Euboea--and while the arms\r\nwhich expelled him were yours, the statesmanship and the decrees (even\r\nthough some of my opponents may split their sides) were mine--he\r\nproceeded to look for some other stronghold from which he could\r\nthreaten the city. And seeing that we were more dependent than any\r\nother people upon imported corn, and wishing to get our corn-trade into\r\nhis power, he advanced to Thrace. First, he requested the Byzantines,\r\nhis own allies, to join him in the war against you; and when they\r\nrefused and said (with truth) that they had not made their alliance\r\nwith him for such a purpose, he erected a stockade against the city,\r\nbrought up his engines, and proceeded to besiege it. {88} I will not\r\nask again what you ought to have done when this was happening; it is\r\nmanifest to all. But who was it that went to the rescue of the\r\nByzantines, and saved them? Who was it that prevented the Hellespont\r\nfrom falling into other hands at that time? It was you, men of\r\nAthens--and when I say 'you', I mean this city. And who was it that\r\nspoke and moved resolutions and acted for the city, and gave himself up\r\nunsparingly to the business of the State? It was I. {89} But of the\r\nimmense benefit thus conferred upon all, you no longer need words of\r\nmine to tell you, since you have had actual experience of it. For the\r\nwar which then ensued, apart from the glorious reputation that it\r\nbrought you, kept you supplied with the necessaries of life in greater\r\nplenty and at lower prices than the present Peace, which these worthy\r\nmen are guarding to their country's detriment, in their hopes of\r\nsomething yet to be realized. May those hopes be disappointed! May they\r\nshare the fortune which you, who wish for the best, ask of the gods,\r\nrather than cause you to share that upon which their own choice is\r\nfixed! (_To the clerk_.) Read out to the jury the crowns awarded to the\r\ncity in consequence of her action by the Byzantines and by the\r\nPerinthians.\r\n\r\n{90, 91} [_The decree of the Byzantines is read_.]\r\n\r\n{92} Read out also the crowns awarded by the peoples of the Chersonese.\r\n\r\n[_The decree of the peoples of the Chersonese is read_.]\r\n\r\n{93} Thus the policy which I had adopted was not only successful in\r\nsaving the Chersonese and Byzantium, in preventing the Hellespont from\r\nfalling at that time into the power of Philip, and in bringing honours\r\nto the city in consequence, but it revealed to the whole world the\r\nnoble gallantry of Athens and the baseness of Philip. For all saw that\r\nhe, the ally of the Byzantines, was besieging them--what could be more\r\nshameful or revolting? {94} and on the other hand, it was seen that\r\nyou, who might fairly have urged many well-founded complaints against\r\nthem for their inconsiderate conduct[n] towards you at an earlier\r\nperiod, not only refused to remember your grudge and to abandon the\r\nvictims of aggression, but actually delivered them; and in consequence\r\nof this, you won glory and goodwill on all hands. And further, though\r\nevery one knows that you have crowned many public men before now, no\r\none can name any but myself--that is to say, any public counsellor and\r\norator--for whose merits the city has received a crown.\r\n\r\n{95} In order to prove to you, also, that the slanders which he uttered\r\nagainst the Euboeans and Byzantines, as he recalled to you any\r\nill-natured action that they had taken towards you in the past, are\r\ndisingenuous calumnies, not only because they are false (for this, I\r\nthink, you may all be assumed to know), but also because, however true\r\nthey might be, it was still to your advantage to deal with the\r\npolitical situation as I have done, I desire to describe, and that\r\nbriefly, one or two of the noble deeds which this city has done in your\r\nown time. For an individual and a State should strive always, in their\r\nrespective spheres, to fashion their future conduct after the highest\r\nexamples that their past affords. {96} Thus, men of Athens, at a time\r\nwhen the Spartans were masters of land and sea,[n] and were retaining\r\ntheir hold, by means of governors and garrisons, upon the country all\r\nround Attica--Euboea, Tanagra, all Boeotia, Megara, Aegina, Ceos, and\r\nthe other islands--and when Athens possessed neither ships nor walls,\r\nyou marched forth to Haliartus, and again, not many days later, to\r\nCorinth, though the Athenians of that day might have borne a heavy\r\ngrudge against both the Corinthians and the Thebans for the part they\r\nhad played in reference to the Deceleian War.[n] {97} But they bore no\r\nsuch grudge. Far from it! And neither of these actions, Aeschines, was\r\ntaken by them to help benefactors; nor was the prospect before them\r\nfree from danger. Yet they did not on that account sacrifice those who\r\nfled to them for help. For the sake of glory and honour they were\r\nwilling to expose themselves to the danger; and it was a right and a\r\nnoble spirit that inspired their counsels. For the life of all men must\r\nend in death, though a man shut himself in a chamber and keep watch;\r\nbut brave men must ever set themselves to do that which is noble, with\r\ntheir joyful hope for their buckler, and whatsoever God gives, must\r\nbear it gallantly. {98} Thus did your forefathers, and thus did the\r\nelder among yourselves: for, although the Spartans were no friends or\r\nbenefactors of yours, but had done much grievous wrong to the city,\r\nyet, when the Thebans, after their victory at Leuctra, attempted to\r\nannihilate them, you prevented it, not terrified by the strength or the\r\nreputation which the Thebans then enjoyed, nor reckoning up what the\r\nmen had done to you, for whom you were to face this peril. {99} And\r\nthus, as you know, you revealed to all the Hellenes, that whatever\r\noffences may be committed against you, though under all other\r\ncircumstances you show your resentment of them, yet if any danger to\r\nlife or freedom overtakes the transgressors, you will bear no grudge\r\nand make no reckoning. Nor was it in these instances only that you were\r\nthus disposed. For once more, when the Thebans were appropriating\r\nEuboea,[n] you did not look on while it was done; you did not call to\r\nmind the wrong which had been done to you in the matter of Oropus[n] by\r\nThemison and Theodorus: you helped even these; and it was then that the\r\ncity for the first time had voluntary trierarchs, of whom I was one.[n]\r\nBut I will not speak of this yet. {100} And although to save the island\r\nwas itself a noble thing to do, it was a yet nobler thing by far, that\r\nwhen their lives and their cities were absolutely in your power, you\r\ngave them back, as it was right to do, to the very men who had offended\r\nagainst you, and made no reckoning, when such trust had been placed in\r\nyou, of the wrongs which you had suffered. I pass by the innumerable\r\ninstances which I might still give--battles at sea, expeditions [by\r\nland, campaigns] both long ago and now in our day; in all of which the\r\nobject of the city has been to defend the freedom and safety of the\r\nother Hellenic peoples. {101} And so, when in all these striking\r\nexamples I had beheld the city ever ready to strive in defence of the\r\ninterests of others, what was I likely to bid her do, what action was I\r\nlikely to recommend to her, when the debate to some extent concerned\r\nher own interests? 'Why,' you would say, 'to remember her grudge\r\nagainst those who wanted deliverance, and to look for excuses for\r\nsacrificing everything!' And who would not have been justified in\r\nputting me to death, if I had attempted to bring shame upon the city's\r\nhigh traditions, though it were only by word? The deed itself you would\r\nnever have done, I know full well; for had you desired to do it, what\r\nwas there to hinder you? Were you not free so to act? Had you not these\r\nmen here to propose it?\r\n\r\n{102} I wish now to return to the next in succession of my political\r\nacts; and here again you must ask yourselves, what was the best thing\r\nfor the city? For, men of Athens, when I saw that your navy was\r\nbreaking up, and that, while the rich were obtaining exemption on the\r\nstrength of small payments,[n] citizens of moderate or small means were\r\nlosing all that they had; and further, that in consequence of these\r\nthings the city was always missing her opportunities; I enacted a law\r\nin accordance with which I compelled the former--the rich--to do their\r\nduty fairly; I put an end to the injustice done to the poor, and (what\r\nwas the greatest service of all to the State) I caused our preparations\r\nto be made in time. {103} When I was indicted for this, I appeared\r\nbefore you at the ensuing trial, and was acquitted; the prosecutor\r\nfailed to obtain the necessary fraction of the votes. But what sums do\r\nyou think the leaders of the Taxation-Boards, or those who stood second\r\nor third, offered me, to induce me, if possible, not to enact the law,\r\nor at least to let it drop and lie under sworn notice of\r\nprosecution?[n] They offered sums so large, men of Athens, that I\r\nshould hesitate to mention them to you. It was a natural course for\r\nthem to take. {104} For under the former laws it was possible for them\r\nto divide their obligation between sixteen persons, paying little or\r\nnothing themselves, and grinding down their poorer fellow citizens:\r\nwhile by my law each must pay down a sum calculated in proportion to\r\nhis property; and a man came to be charged with two warships, who had\r\npreviously been one of sixteen subscribers to a single one (for they\r\nused now to call themselves no longer captains of their ships, but\r\nsubscribers). Thus there was nothing that they were not willing to\r\ngive, if only the new plan could be brought to nothing, and they could\r\nescape being compelled to do their duty fairly. (_To the clerk_.) {105}\r\nNow read me, first, the decree[n] in accordance with which I had to\r\nmeet the indictment; and then the lists of those liable under the\r\nformer law, and under my own, respectively. Read.\r\n\r\n[_The decree is read_.]\r\n\r\n{106} Now produce that noble list.\r\n\r\n[_A list is read_.]\r\n\r\nNow produce, for comparison with this, the list under my own law.\r\n\r\n[_A list is read_.]\r\n\r\nWas this, think you, but a trifling assistance which I rendered to the\r\npoor among you? {107} Would the wealthy have spent but a trifling sum\r\nto avoid doing their duty fairly? I am proud not only of having refused\r\nall compromise upon the measure, not only of having been acquitted when\r\nI was indicted, but also of having enacted a law which was beneficial,\r\nand of having given proof of it in practice. For throughout the war the\r\narmaments were equipped under my law, and no trierarch ever laid the\r\nsuppliants' branch[n] before you in token of grievance, nor took\r\nsanctuary at Munychia; none was imprisoned by the Admiralty Board; no\r\nwarship was abandoned at sea and lost to the State, or left behind here\r\nas unseaworthy. Under the former laws all these things used to happen;\r\n{108} and the reason was that the obligation rested upon the poor, and\r\nin consequence there were many cases of inability to discharge it. I\r\ntransferred the duties of the trierarchy from the poor to the rich; and\r\ntherefore every duty was properly fulfilled. Aye, and for this very\r\nreason I deserve to receive praise--that I always adopted such\r\npolitical measures as brought with them accessions of glory and honour\r\nand power to the city. No measure of mine is malicious, harsh, or\r\nunprincipled; none is degrading or unworthy of the city. The same\r\nspirit will be seen both in my domestic and my international policy.\r\n{109} For just as in home affairs I did not set the favour of the rich\r\nabove the rights of the many, so in international affairs I did not\r\nembrace the gifts and the friendship of Philip, in preference to the\r\ncommon interests of all the Hellenes.\r\n\r\nIt still remains for me, I suppose, to speak about the proclamation,\r\nand about my examination. {110} The statement that I acted for the\r\nbest, and that I am loyal to you throughout and eager to do you good\r\nservice, I have proved, I think, sufficiently, by what I have said. At\r\nthe same time I am passing over the most important parts of my\r\npolitical life and actions; for I conceive that I ought first to render\r\nto you in their proper order my arguments in regard to the alleged\r\nillegality itself: which done, even if I say nothing about the rest of\r\nmy political acts, I can still rely upon that personal knowledge of\r\nthem which each of you possesses.\r\n\r\n{111} Of the arguments which the prosecutor jumbled together in utter\r\nconfusion with reference to the laws accompanying his indictment,[n] I\r\nam quite certain that you could not follow the greater part, nor could\r\nI understand them myself; but I will simply address you\r\nstraightforwardly upon the question of right. So far am I from claiming\r\n(as he just now slanderously declared) to be free from the liability to\r\nrender an account, that I admit a life-long liability to account for\r\nevery part of my administration and policy. {112} But I do not admit\r\nthat I am liable for one single day--you hear me, Aeschines?--to\r\naccount for what I have given to the People as a free-will offering out\r\nof my private estate; nor is any one else so liable, not even if he is\r\none of the nine archons. What law is so replete with injustice and\r\nchurlishness, that when a man has made a present out of his private\r\nproperty and done an act of generosity and munificence, it deprives him\r\nof the gratitude due to him, hales him before a court of disingenuous\r\ncritics, and sets them to audit accounts of sums which he himself has\r\ngiven? There is no such law. If the prosecutor asserts that there is,\r\nlet him produce it, and I will resign myself and say no more. {113} But\r\nthe law does not exist, men of Athens; this is nothing but an\r\ninformer's trick on the part of Aeschines, who, because I was\r\nController of the Festival Fund when I made this donation, says,\r\n'Ctesiphon proposed a vote of thanks to him when he was still liable to\r\naccount.' The vote of thanks was not for any of the things for which I\r\nwas liable to account; it was for my voluntary gift, and your charge is\r\na misrepresentation. 'Yes,' you say, 'but you were also a Commissioner\r\nof Fortifications.' I was, and thanks were rightly accorded me on the\r\nvery ground that, instead of charging the sums which I spent, I made a\r\npresent of them. A statement of account, it is true, calls for an audit\r\nand scrutineers; but a free gift deserves gratitude and thanks; and\r\nthat is why the defendant proposed this motion in my favour. {114} That\r\nthis principle is not merely laid down in the laws, but rooted in your\r\nnational character, I shall have no difficulty in proving by many\r\ninstances. Nausicles,[n] to begin with, has often been crowned by you,\r\nwhile general, for sacrifices which he had made from his private funds.\r\nAgain, when Diotimus[n] gave the shields, and Charidemus[n] afterwards,\r\nthey were crowned. And again, Neoptolemus here, while still director of\r\nmany public works, has received honours for his voluntary gifts. It\r\nwould really be too bad, if any one who held any office must either be\r\ndebarred thereby from making a present to the State, or else, instead\r\nof receiving due gratitude, must submit accounts of the sums given.\r\n{115} To prove the truth of my statements, (_to the clerk_) take and\r\nread the actual decrees which were passed in honour of these persons.\r\nRead.\r\n\r\n{116} [_Two decrees are read_.]\r\n\r\n{117} Each of these persons, Aeschines, was accountable as regards the\r\noffice which he held, but not as regards the services for which he was\r\ncrowned. Nor am I, therefore; for I presume that I have the same rights\r\nas others with reference to the same matters. I made a voluntary gift.\r\nFor this I receive thanks; for I am not liable to account for what I\r\ngave. I was holding office. True, and I have rendered an account of my\r\nofficial expenditure, but not of what I gave voluntarily. Ah! but I\r\nexercised my office iniquitously! What? and you were there, when the\r\nauditors brought me before them, and did not accuse me?\r\n\r\n{118} Now that the court may see that the prosecutor himself bears me\r\nwitness that I was crowned for services of which I was not liable to\r\nrender an account, (_to the clerk_) take and read the decree which was\r\nproposed in my honour, in its entirety. (_To the jury_.) The points\r\nwhich he has omitted to indict in the Council's resolution will show\r\nthat the charges which he does make are deliberate misrepresentations.\r\n(_To the clerk_.) Read.\r\n\r\n[_The decree is read_.]\r\n\r\n{119} My donations then, were these, of which you have not made one the\r\nsubject of indictment. It is the reward for these, which the Council\r\nstates to be my due, that you attack. You admit that it was legal to\r\naccept the gifts offered, and you indict as illegal the return of\r\ngratitude for them. In Heaven's name, what must the perfect scoundrel,\r\nthe really heaven-detested, malignant being be like? Must he not be a\r\nman like this?\r\n\r\n{120} But as regards the proclamation in the theatre, I pass by the\r\nfact that ten thousand persons have been thus proclaimed on ten\r\nthousand different occasions, and that my own name has often been so\r\nproclaimed before. But, in Heaven's name, Aeschines, are you so\r\nperverse and stupid, that you cannot grasp the fact that the recipient\r\nof the crown feels the same pride wherever the crown is proclaimed, and\r\nthat it is for the benefit of those who confer it that the proclamation\r\nis made in the theatre? For those who hear are stimulated to do good\r\nservice to the State, and commend those who return gratitude for such\r\nservice even more than they commend the recipient of the crown. That is\r\nwhy the city has enacted this law. (_To the clerk_.) Take the law\r\nitself and read it.\r\n\r\n[_The law is read_.]\r\n\r\n{121} Do you hear, Aeschines, the plain words of the law? 'Except such\r\nas the People or the Council shall resolve so to proclaim. But let\r\nthese be proclaimed.' Why, wretched man, do you lay this dishonest\r\ncharge? Why do you invent false arguments? Why do you not take\r\nhellebore[n] to cure you? What? Are you not ashamed to bring a case\r\nfounded upon envy, not upon any crime--to alter some of the laws, and\r\nto leave out parts of others, when they ought surely, in justice, to be\r\nread entire to those who have sworn to give their votes in accordance\r\nwith the laws? {122} And then, while you act in this way, you enumerate\r\nthe qualities which should be found in a friend of the People, as if\r\nyou had contracted for a statue, and discovered on receiving it that it\r\nhad not the features required by the contract; or as if a friend of the\r\nPeople was known by a definition, and not by his works and his\r\npolitical measures! And you shout out expressions, proper and improper,\r\nlike a reveller on a cart[n]--expressions which apply to you and your\r\nhouse, not to me. I will add this also, men of Athens. {123} The\r\ndifference between abuse and accusation is, I imagine, that an\r\naccusation is founded upon crimes, for which the penalties are assigned\r\nby law; abuse, upon such slanders as their own character leads enemies\r\nto utter about one another. And I conceive that our forefathers built\r\nthese courts of law, not that we might assemble you here and revile one\r\nanother with improper expressions suggested by our adversary's private\r\nlife, but that we might convict any one who happens to have committed\r\nsome crime against the State. {124} Aeschines knew this as well as I;\r\nand yet he chose to make a ribald attack instead of an accusation. At\r\nthe same time, it is not fair that he should go off without getting as\r\nmuch as he gives, even in this respect; and when I have asked him one\r\nquestion, I will at once proceed to the attack. Are we to call you,\r\nAeschines, the enemy of the State, or of myself? Of myself, of course.\r\nWhat? And when you might have exacted the penalty from me, on behalf of\r\nyour fellow countrymen, according to the laws--at public examinations,\r\nby indictment, by all other forms of trial--did you always omit to do\r\nso? {125} And yet to-day, when I am unassailable upon every ground--on\r\nthe ground of law, of lapse of time, of the statutable limit,[n] of the\r\nmany previous trials which I have undergone upon every charge, without\r\nhaving once been convicted of any crime against you to this day--and\r\nwhen the city must necessarily share to a greater or smaller degree in\r\nthe glory of acts which were really acts of the people, have you\r\nconfronted me upon such an issue as this? Take care lest, while you\r\nprofess to be _my_ enemy, you prove to be the enemy of your fellow\r\ncountrymen!\r\n\r\n{126} Since then I have shown you all what is the vote which religion\r\nand justice demand of you, I am now obliged, it would seem, by the\r\nslanders which he has uttered (though I am no lover of abuse) to reply\r\nto his many falsehoods by saying just what is absolutely necessary\r\nabout himself, and showing who he is, and whence he is sprung, that he\r\nso lightly begins to use bad language, pulling to pieces certain\r\nexpressions of mine, when he has himself used expressions which any\r\nrespectable man would have shrunk from uttering; {127} for if the\r\naccuser were Aeacus or Rhadamanthus or Minos,[n] instead of a\r\nscandal-monger,[n] an old hand in the marketplace,[n] a pestilent\r\nclerk, I do not believe that he would have spoken thus, or produced\r\nsuch a stock of ponderous phrases, crying aloud, as if he were acting a\r\ntragedy, 'O Earth and Sun and Virtue,'[n] and the like; or again,\r\ninvoking 'Wit and Culture, by which things noble and base are discerned\r\napart'--for, of course, you heard him speaking in this way. {128} Scum\r\nof the earth! What have you or yours to do with virtue? How should\r\n_you_ discern what is noble and what is not? Where and how did you get\r\nyour qualification to do so? What right have _you_ to mention culture\r\nanywhere? A man of genuine culture would not only never have asserted\r\nsuch a thing of himself, but would have blushed to hear another do so:\r\nand those who, like you, fall far short of it, but are tactless enough\r\nto claim it, succeed only in causing distress to their hearers, when\r\nthey speak--not in seeming to be what they profess.\r\n\r\n{129} But though I am not at a loss to know what to say about you and\r\nyours, I am at a loss to know what to mention first. Shall I tell\r\nfirst[n] how your father Tromes was a slave in the house of Elpias, who\r\nkept an elementary school near the temple of Theseus, and how he wore\r\nshackles and a wooden halter? Or how your mother, by celebrating her\r\ndaylight nuptials in her hut near the shrine of the Hero of the\r\nLancet,[n] was enabled to rear you, her beautiful statue, the prince of\r\nthird-rate actors? But these things are known to all without my telling\r\nthem. Shall I tell how Phormio, the ship's piper, the slave of Dion of\r\nPhrearrii, raised her up out of this noble profession? But, before God\r\nand every Heavenly Power, I shudder lest in using expressions which are\r\nfitly applied to you, I may be thought to have chosen a subject upon\r\nwhich it ill befits myself to speak. {130} So I will pass this by, and\r\nwill begin with the acts of his own life; for they were not like any\r\nchance actions,[n] but such as the people curses. For only\r\nlately--lately, do I say? only yesterday or the day before--did he\r\nbecome at once an Athenian and an orator, and by the addition of two\r\nsyllables converted his father from Tromes into Atrometus, and gave his\r\nmother the imposing name of Glaucothea,[n] when every one knows that\r\nshe used to be called Empusa[n]--a name which was obviously given her\r\nbecause there was nothing that she would not do or have done to her;\r\nfor how else should she have acquired it? {131} Yet, in spite of this,\r\nyou are of so ungrateful and villainous a nature, that though, thanks\r\nto your countrymen, you have risen from slavery to freedom, and from\r\npoverty to wealth, far from feeling gratitude to them, you devote your\r\npolitical activity to working against them as a hireling. I will pass\r\nover every case in which there is any room for the contention that he\r\nhas spoken in the interests of the city, and will remind you of the\r\nacts which he was manifestly proved to have done for the good of her\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\n{132} Which of you has not heard of Antiphon,[n] who was struck off the\r\nlist of citizens,[n] and came into the city in pursuance of a promise\r\nto Philip that he would burn the dockyards? I found him concealed in\r\nthe Peiraeus, and brought him before the Assembly; but the malignant\r\nAeschines shouted at the top of his voice, that it was atrocious of me,\r\nin a democratic country, to insult a citizen who had met with\r\nmisfortune, and to go to men's houses without a decree;[n] and he\r\nobtained his release. {133} And unless the Council of Areopagus had\r\ntaken notice of the matter, and, seeing the inopportuneness of the\r\nignorance which you had shown, had made a further search for the man,\r\nand arrested him, and brought him before you again, a man of that\r\ncharacter would have been snatched out of your hands, and would have\r\nevaded punishment, and been sent out of the country by this pompous\r\norator. As it was, you tortured and executed him--and so ought you also\r\nto have treated Aeschines. {134} The Council of Areopagus knew the part\r\nwhich he had played in this affair; and for this reason, when, owing to\r\nthe same ignorance which so often leads you to sacrifice the public\r\ninterests, you elected him[n] to advocate your claims in regard to the\r\nTemple of Delos, the Council (since you had appointed it to assist you\r\nand entrusted it with full authority to act in the matter) immediately\r\nrejected Aeschines as a traitor, and committed the case to Hypereides.\r\nWhen the Council took this step, the members took their votes from the\r\naltar,[n] and not one vote was given for this abominable man. {135} To\r\nprove that what I say is true, (_to the clerk_) call the witnesses who\r\ntestify to it.\r\n\r\n[_The witnesses are called_.]\r\n\r\n{136} Thus when the Council rejected him from the office of advocate,\r\nand committed the case to another, it declared at the same time that he\r\nwas a traitor, who wished you ill.\r\n\r\nSuch was one of the public appearances of this fine fellow, and such\r\nits character--so like the acts with which he charges me, is it not?\r\nNow recall a second. For when Philip sent Python of Byzantium,[n] and\r\nwith him envoys from all his allies, in the hope of putting the city to\r\nshame and showing her to be in the wrong, I would not give way before\r\nthe torrent of insolent rhetoric which Python poured out upon you, but\r\nrose and contradicted him, and would not betray the city's rights, but\r\nproved the iniquity of Philip's actions so manifestly, that even his\r\nown allies rose up and admitted it. But Aeschines supported Python; he\r\ngave testimony in opposition to his country, and that testimony false.\r\n\r\n{137} Nor was this sufficient for him; for again after this he was\r\ndetected going to meet Anaxinus[n] the spy in the house of Thrason. But\r\nsurely one who met the emissary of the enemy alone and conferred with\r\nhim, must himself have been already a born spy and an enemy of his\r\ncountry. To prove the truth of what I say, (_to the clerk_) call the\r\nwitnesses to these facts.\r\n\r\n[_The witnesses are called_.]\r\n\r\n{138} There are still an infinite number of things which I might relate\r\nof him; but I pass them over. For the truth is something like this. I\r\ncould still point to many instances in which he was found to be serving\r\nour enemies during that period, and showing his spite against me. But\r\nyou do not store such things up in careful remembrance, to visit them\r\nwith the indignation which they deserve; but, following a bad custom,\r\nyou have given great freedom to any one who wishes to trip up the\r\nproposer of any advantageous measure by dishonest charges--bartering,\r\nas you do, the advantage of the State for the pleasure and\r\ngratification which you derive from invective; and so it is always\r\neasier and safer to be a hireling in the service of the enemy, than a\r\nstatesman who has chosen to defend your cause.\r\n\r\n{139} To co-operate with Philip before we were openly at war with him\r\nwas --I call Earth and Heaven to witness--atrocious enough. How could\r\nit be otherwise--against his own country? Nevertheless, concede him\r\nthis, if you will, concede him this. But when the corn-ships had been\r\nopenly plundered, and the Chersonese was being ravaged, and the man was\r\non the march against Attica; when the position of affairs was no longer\r\nin doubt, and war had begun; what action did this malignant mouther of\r\nverses ever do for your good? He can point to none. There is not a\r\nsingle decree, small or great, with reference to the interests of the\r\ncity, standing in the name of Aeschines. If he asserts that there is,\r\nlet him produce it in the time allotted to me. But no such decree\r\nexists. In that case, however, only two alternatives are possible:\r\neither he had no fault to find at the time with my policy, and\r\ntherefore made no proposal contrary to it; or else he was seeking the\r\nadvantage of the enemy, and therefore refrained from bringing forward\r\nany better policy than mine.\r\n\r\n{140} Did he then abstain from speaking, as he abstained from proposing\r\nany motion, when any mischief was to be done? On the contrary, no one\r\nelse had a chance of speaking. But though, apparently, the city could\r\nendure everything else, and he could do everything else unobserved,\r\nthere was one final deed which was the culmination of all that he had\r\ndone before. Upon this he expended all that multitude of words, as he\r\nwent through the decrees relating to the Amphisseans, in the hope of\r\ndistorting the truth. But the truth cannot be distorted. It is\r\nimpossible. Never will you wash away the stain of your actions there!\r\nYou will not say enough for that!\r\n\r\n{141} I call upon all the gods and goddesses who protect this land of\r\nAttica, in the presence of you all, men of Athens; and upon Apollo of\r\nPytho, the paternal deity[n] of this city, and I pray to them all, that\r\nif I should speak the truth to you--if I spoke it at that very time\r\nwithout delay, in the presence of the people, when first I saw this\r\nabominable man setting his hand to this business (for I knew it, I knew\r\nit at once),--that then they may give me good fortune and life: but if,\r\nto gratify my hatred or any private quarrel, I am now bringing a false\r\naccusation against this man, then they may take from me the fruition of\r\nevery blessing.\r\n\r\n{142} Why have I uttered this imprecation with such vehemence and\r\nearnestness? Because, although I have documents, lying in the public\r\narchives, by which I will prove the facts clearly; although I know that\r\nyou remember what was done; I have still the fear that he may be\r\nthought too insignificant a man to have done all the evil which he has\r\nwrought--as indeed happened before, when he caused the ruin of the\r\nunhappy Phocians by the false report which he brought home. {143} For\r\nthe war at Amphissa, which was the cause of Philip's coming to Elateia,\r\nand of one being chosen[n] commander of the Amphictyons, who overthrew\r\nthe fortunes of the Hellenes--_he_ it is who helped to get it up; he,\r\nin his sole person, is to blame for disasters to which no equal can be\r\nfound. I protested at the time, and cried out, before the Assembly,\r\n'You are bringing war into Attica, Aeschines--an Amphictyonic War.' But\r\na packed group of his supporters refused to let me speak, while the\r\nrest were amazed, and imagined that I was bringing a baseless charge\r\nagainst him, out of personal animosity. {144} But what the true nature\r\nof these proceedings was, men of Athens--why this plan was contrived,\r\nand how it was executed--you must hear from me to-day, since you were\r\nprevented from doing so at the time. You will behold a business\r\ncunningly organized; you will advance greatly in your knowledge of\r\npublic affairs; and you will see what cleverness there was in Philip.\r\n\r\n{145} Philip had no prospect of seeing the end of the war with you, or\r\nridding himself of it, unless he could make the Thebans and Thessalians\r\nenemies of Athens. For although the war was being wretchedly and\r\ninefficiently conducted by your generals, he was nevertheless suffering\r\ninfinite damage from the war itself and from the freebooters. The\r\nexportation of the produce of his country and the importation of what\r\nhe needed were both impossible. {146} Moreover, he was not at that time\r\nsuperior to you at sea, nor could he reach Attica, if the Thessalians\r\nwould not follow him, or the Thebans give him a passage through their\r\ncountry; and although he was overcoming in the field the generals whom\r\nyou sent out, such as they were (for of this I say nothing), he found\r\nhimself suffering from the geographical conditions themselves, and from\r\nthe nature of the resources[n] which either side possessed. {147} Now\r\nif he tried to encourage either the Thessalians or the Thebans to march\r\nagainst you in order to further his own quarrel, no one, he thought,\r\nwould pay any attention to him; but if he adopted their own common\r\ngrounds of action and were chosen commander, he hoped to find it easier\r\nto deceive or to persuade them, as the case might be. What then does he\r\ndo? He attempts (and observe with what skill) to stir up an\r\nAmphictyonic War, and a disturbance in connexion with the meeting of\r\nthe Council. {148} For he thought that they would at once find that\r\nthey needed his help, to deal with these. Now if one of his own or his\r\nallies' representatives on the Council[n] brought the matter forward,\r\nhe thought that both the Thebans and the Thessalians would regard the\r\nproceeding with suspicion, and that all would be on their guard: but if\r\nit was an Athenian, sent by you, his adversaries, that did so, he would\r\neasily escape detection--as, in fact, happened. {149}* How then did he\r\nmanage this? He hired Aeschines. No one, I suppose, either realized\r\nbeforehand what was going on or guarded against it--that is how such\r\naffairs are usually conducted here; Aeschines was nominated a delegate\r\nto the Council; three or four people held up their hands for him, and\r\nhe was declared elected. But when, bearing with him the prestige of\r\nthis city, he reached the Amphictyons, he dismissed and closed his eyes\r\nto all other considerations, and proceeded to perform the task for\r\nwhich he had been hired. He composed and recited a story, in attractive\r\nlanguage, of the way in which the Cirrhaean territory had come to be\r\ndedicated; {150} and with this he persuaded the members of the Council,\r\nwho were unused to rhetoric and did not foresee what was about to\r\nhappen, that they should resolve to make the circuit of the\r\nterritory,[n] which the Amphisseans said they were cultivating because\r\nit was their own, while he alleged that it was part of the consecrated\r\nland. The Locrians were not bringing any suit against us, or taking any\r\nsuch action as (in order to justify himself) he now falsely alleges.\r\nYou may know this from the following consideration. It was clearly\r\nimpossible[n] for the Locrians to bring a suit against Athens to an\r\nactual issue, without summoning us. Who then served the summons upon\r\nus? Before what authority was it served? Tell us who knows: point to\r\nhim. You cannot do so. It was a hollow and a false pretext of which you\r\nthus made a wrongful use. {151} While the Amphictyons were making the\r\ncircuit of the territory in accordance with Aeschines' suggestion, the\r\nLocrians fell upon them and came near to shooting them all down with\r\ntheir spears; some of the members of the Council they even carried off\r\nwith them. And now that complaints and hostilities had been stirred up\r\nagainst the Amphisseans, in consequence of these proceedings, the\r\ncommand was first held by Cottyphus, and his force was drawn from the\r\nAmphictyonic Powers alone. But since some did not come, and those who\r\ncame did nothing, the men who had been suborned for the\r\npurpose--villains of long standing, chosen from the Thessalians and\r\nfrom the traitors in other States--took steps with a view to entrusting\r\nthe affair to Philip, as commander, at the next meeting of the Council.\r\n{152} They had adopted arguments of a persuasive kind. Either, they\r\nsaid, the Amphictyons must themselves contribute funds, maintain\r\nmercenaries, and fine those who refused to do so; or they must elect\r\nPhilip. To make a long story short, the result was that Philip was\r\nappointed. And immediately afterwards, having collected a force and\r\ncrossed the Pass, ostensibly on his way to the territory of Cirrha, he\r\nbids a long farewell to the Cirrhaeans and Locrians, and seizes\r\nElateia. {153} Now if the Thebans had not changed their policy at once,\r\nupon seeing this, and joined us, the trouble would have descended upon\r\nthe city in full force, like a torrent in winter. As it was, the\r\nThebans checked him for the moment; chiefly, men of Athens, through the\r\ngoodwill of some Heavenly Power towards us; but secondarily, so far as\r\nit lay in one man's power, through me also. (_To the clerk_.) Now give\r\nme the decrees in question, and the dates of each proceeding; (_to the\r\njury_) that you may know what trouble this abominable creature stirred\r\nup, unpunished. (_To the clerk_.) Read me the decrees.\r\n\r\n{154} [_The decrees of the Amphictyons are read_.]\r\n\r\n{155} (_To the clerk_.) Now read the dates of these proceedings. (_To\r\nthe jury_.) They are the dates at which Aeschines was delegate to the\r\nCouncil. (_To the clerk_.) Read.\r\n\r\n[_The dates are read_.]\r\n\r\n{156} Now give me the letter which Philip sent to his allies in the\r\nPeloponnese, when the Thebans failed to obey his summons. For from\r\nthis, too, you may clearly see that he concealed the real reason for\r\nhis action--the fact that he was taking measures against Hellas and the\r\nThebans and yourselves--and pretended to represent the common cause and\r\nthe will of the Amphictyons. And the man who provided him with all\r\nthese occasions and pretexts was Aeschines. (_To the clerk_.) Read.\r\n\r\n{157} [_Philip's letter is read_.]\r\n\r\n{158} You see that he avoids the mention of his own reasons for action,\r\nand takes refuge in those provided by the Amphictyons. Who was it that\r\nhelped him to prepare such a case? Who put such pretexts at his\r\ndisposal? Who is most to blame for the disasters that have taken place?\r\nIs it not Aeschines? And so, men of Athens, you must not go about\r\nsaying that Hellas has suffered such things as these at the hands of\r\none man.[n] I call Earth and Heaven to witness, that it was at the\r\nhands, not of one man, but of many villains in each State. {159} And of\r\nthese Aeschines is one; and, had I to speak the truth without any\r\nreserve, I should not hesitate to describe him as the incarnate curse\r\nof all alike--men, regions or cities--that have been ruined since then.\r\nFor he who supplied the seed is responsible for the crop. I wonder that\r\nyou did not turn away your eyes at the very sight of him: but a cloud\r\nof darkness seems to hang between you and the truth.\r\n\r\n{160} I find that in dealing with the measures taken by Aeschines for\r\nthe injury of his country, I have reached the time when I must speak of\r\nmy own statesmanship in opposition to these measures; and it is fair\r\nthat you should listen to this, for many reasons, but above all because\r\nit will be a shameful thing, if, when I have faced the actual realities\r\nof hard work for you, you will not even suffer the story of them to be\r\ntold. {161} For when I saw the Thebans, and (I may almost say)\r\nyourselves as well, being led by the corrupt partisans of Philip in\r\neither State to overlook, without taking a single precaution against\r\nit, the thing which was really dangerous to both peoples and needed\r\ntheir utmost watchfulness--the unhindered growth of Philip's power;\r\nwhile, on the contrary, you were quite ready to entertain ill-feeling\r\nand to quarrel with one another; I kept unceasing watch to prevent\r\nthis. Nor did I rely only on my own judgement in thinking that this was\r\nwhat your interest required. {162} I knew that Aristophon, and\r\nafterwards Eubulus, always wished to bring about this friendly union,\r\nand that, often as they opposed one another in other matters, they\r\nalways agreed in this. Cunning fox! While they lived, you hung about\r\nthem and flattered them; yet now that they are dead, you do not see\r\nthat you are attacking them. For your censure of my policy in regard to\r\nThebes is far more a denunciation of them than of me, since they were\r\nbefore me in approving of that alliance. {163} But I return to my\r\nprevious point--that it was when Aeschines had brought about the war at\r\nAmphissa, and the others, his accomplices, had effectually helped him\r\nto create the ill-feeling against the Thebans, that Philip marched\r\nagainst us. For it was to render this possible that their attempt to\r\nthrow the two cities into collision was made; and had we not roused\r\nourselves a little before it was too late, we should never have been\r\nable to regain the lost ground; to such a length had these men carried\r\nmatters. What the relations between the two peoples already were, you\r\nwill know when you have heard these decrees and replies. (_To the\r\nclerk_.) Take these and read them.\r\n\r\n{164, 165} [_The decrees are read_.]\r\n\r\n{166} (_To the clerk_.) Now read the replies.\r\n\r\n{167} [_The replies are read_.]\r\n\r\n{168} Having established such relations between the cities, through the\r\nagency of these men, and being elated by these decrees and replies,\r\nPhilip came with his army and seized Elateia, thinking that under no\r\ncircumstances whatever should we and the Thebans join in unison after\r\nthis. And though the commotion which followed in the city is known to\r\nyou all, let me relate to you briefly just the bare facts.\r\n\r\n{169} It was evening, and one had come to the Prytanes[n] with the news\r\nthat Elateia had been taken. Upon this they rose up from supper without\r\ndelay; some of them drove the occupants out of the booths in the\r\nmarket-place and set fire to the wicker-work;[n] others sent for the\r\ngenerals and summoned the trumpeter; and the city was full of\r\ncommotion. On the morrow, at break of day, the Prytanes summoned the\r\nCouncil to the Council-Chamber, while you made your way to the\r\nAssembly; and before the Council had transacted its business and passed\r\nits draft-resolution,[n] the whole people was seated on the\r\nhill-side.[n] {170} And now, when the Council had arrived, and the\r\nPrytanes had reported the intelligence which they had received, and had\r\nbrought forward the messenger, and he had made his statement, the\r\nherald proceeded to ask, 'Who wishes to speak?' But no one came\r\nforward; and though the herald repeated the question many times, still\r\nno one rose, though all the generals were present, and all the orators,\r\nand the voice of their country was calling for some one to speak for\r\nher deliverance. For the voice of the herald, uttered in accordance\r\nwith the laws, is rightly to be regarded as the common voice of our\r\ncountry. {171} And yet, if it was for those to come forward who wished\r\nfor the deliverance of the city, all of you and all the other Athenians\r\nwould have risen, and proceeded to the platform, for I am certain that\r\nyou all wished for her deliverance. If it was for the wealthiest, the\r\nThree Hundred[n] would have risen; and if it was for those who had both\r\nthese qualifications--loyalty to the city and wealth--then those would\r\nhave risen, who subsequently made those large donations; for it was\r\nloyalty and wealth that led them so to do. {172} But that crisis and\r\nthat day called, it seems, not merely for a man of loyalty and wealth,\r\nbut for one who had also followed the course of events closely from the\r\nfirst, and had come to a true conclusion as to the motive and the aim\r\nwith which Philip was acting as he was. For no one who was unacquainted\r\nwith these, and had not scrutinized them from an early period, was any\r\nthe more likely, for all his loyalty and wealth, to know what should be\r\ndone, or to be able to advise you. {173} The man who was needed was\r\nfound that day in me. I came forward and addressed you in words which I\r\nask you to listen to with attention, for two reasons--first, because I\r\nwould have you realize that I was the only orator or politician who did\r\nnot desert his post as a loyal citizen in the hour of danger, but was\r\nfound there, speaking and proposing what your need required, in the\r\nmidst of the terror; and secondly, because by the expenditure of a\r\nsmall amount of time, you will be far better qualified for the future\r\nin the whole art of political administration. {174} My words then were\r\nthese: 'Those who are unduly disturbed by the idea that Philip can\r\ncount upon the support of Thebes do not, I think, understand the\r\npresent situation. For I am quite sure that, if this were so, we should\r\nhave heard of his being, not at Elateia, but on our own borders. At the\r\nsame time, I understand quite well, that he has come to prepare the way\r\nfor himself at Thebes. {175} Listen,' I said, 'while I tell you the\r\ntrue state of affairs. Philip already has at his disposal all the\r\nThebans whom he could win over either by bribery or by deception; and\r\nthose who have resisted him from the first and are opposing him now, he\r\nhas no chance of winning. What then is his design and object in seizing\r\nElateia? He wishes, by making a display of force in their neighbourhood\r\nand bringing up his army, to encourage and embolden his own friends,\r\nand to strike terror into his enemies, that so they may either concede\r\nout of terror what they now refuse, or may be compelled. {176} Now,' I\r\nsaid, 'if we make up our minds at the present moment to remember any\r\nill-natured action which the Thebans may have done us, and to distrust\r\nthem on the assumption that they are on the side of our enemies, we\r\nshall be doing, in the first place, just what Philip would pray for:\r\nand further, I am afraid that his present opponents may then welcome\r\nhim, that all may philippize[n] with one consent, and that he and they\r\nmay march to Attica together. If, however, you follow my advice, and\r\ngive your minds to the problem before us, instead of to contentious\r\ncriticism of anything that I may say, I believe that I shall be able to\r\nwin your approval for my proposals, and to dispel the danger which\r\nthreatens the city. {177} What then must you do? You must first\r\nmoderate your present alarm, and then change your attitude, and be\r\nalarmed, all of you, for the Thebans. They are far more within the\r\nreach of disaster than we: it is they whom the danger threatens first.\r\nSecondly, those who are of military age, with the cavalry, must march\r\nto Eleusis,[n] and let every one see that you yourselves are in arms;\r\nin order that those who sympathize with you in Thebes may be enabled to\r\nspeak in defence of the right, with the same freedom that their\r\nopponents enjoy, when they see that, just as those who are trying to\r\nsell their country to Philip have a force ready to help them at\r\nElateia, so those who would struggle for freedom have you ready at hand\r\nto help them, and to go to their aid, if any one attacks them. {178}\r\nNext I bid you elect ten envoys, and give them full authority, with the\r\ngenerals, to decide the time of their own journey to Thebes, and to\r\norder the march of the troops. But when the envoys arrive in Thebes,\r\nhow do I advise that they should handle the matter? I ask your special\r\nattention to this. They must require nothing of the Thebans--to do so\r\nat such a moment would be shameful; but they must undertake that we\r\nwill go to their aid, if they bid us do so, on the ground that they are\r\nin extreme peril, and that we foresee the future better than they; in\r\norder that, if they accept our offer and take our advice, we may have\r\nsecured our object, and our action may wear an aspect worthy of this\r\ncity; or, if after all we are unsuccessful, the Thebans may have\r\nthemselves to blame for any mistakes which they now make, while we\r\nshall have done nothing disgraceful or ignoble.' {179} When I had\r\nspoken these words, and others in the same strain, I left the platform.\r\nAll joined in commending these proposals; no one said a word in\r\nopposition; and I did not speak thus, and then fail to move a motion;\r\nnor move a motion, and then fail to serve as envoy; nor serve as envoy,\r\nand then fail to persuade the Thebans. I carried the matter through in\r\nperson from beginning to end, and gave myself up unreservedly to meet\r\nthe dangers which encompassed the city. (_To the clerk_.) Bring me the\r\nresolution which was then passed.\r\n\r\n{180} But now, Aeschines, how would you have me describe your part, and\r\nhow mine, that day? Shall I call myself, as you would call me by way of\r\nabuse and disparagement, _Battalus_?[n] and you, no ordinary hero even,\r\nbut a real stage-hero, _Cresphontes_ or _Creon_,[n] or--the character\r\nwhich you cruelly murdered at Collytus[n]--_Oenomaus_? Then I, Battalus\r\nof Paeania, proved myself of more value to my country in that crisis\r\nthan Oenomaus of Cothocidae. In fact you were of no service on any\r\noccasion, while I played the part which became a good citizen\r\nthroughout. (_To the clerk_.) Read this decree.\r\n\r\n{181-7} [_The decree of Demosthenes is read_.]\r\n\r\n{188} This was the first step towards our new relations with Thebes,\r\nand the beginning of a settlement. Up to this time the cities had been\r\ninveigled into mutual hostility, hatred, and mistrust by these men. But\r\nthis decree caused the peril that encompassed the city to pass away\r\nlike a cloud. It was for an honest citizen, if he had any better plan\r\nthan mine, to make it public at the time, instead of attacking me now.\r\n{189} The true counsellor and the dishonest accuser, unlike as they are\r\nin everything, differ most of all in this: the one declares his opinion\r\nbefore the event, and freely surrenders himself as responsible, to\r\nthose who follow his advice, to Fortune, to circumstances, to any\r\none.[n] The other is silent when he ought to speak, and then carps at\r\nanything untoward that may happen. {190} That crisis, as I have said,\r\nwas the opportunity for a man who cared for his country, the\r\nopportunity for honest speaking. But so much further than I need will I\r\ngo, that if any one can _now_ point to any better course--or any course\r\nat all except that which I chose--I admit my guilt. If any one has\r\ndiscovered any course to-day, which would have been for our advantage,\r\nhad we followed it at the time, I admit that it ought not to have\r\nescaped me. But if there neither is nor was such a possibility; if even\r\nnow, even to-day, no one can mention any such course, what was the\r\ncounsellor of the people to do? Had he not to choose the best of the\r\nplans which suggested themselves and were feasible? {191} This I did.\r\nFor the herald asked the question, Aeschines, 'Who wishes to speak?'\r\nnot 'Who wishes to bring accusations about the past?' nor 'Who wishes\r\nto guarantee the future?' And while you sat speechless in the Assembly\r\nthroughout that period, I came forward and spoke. Since, however, you\r\ndid not do so then, at least inform us now, and tell us what words,\r\nwhich should have been upon my lips, were left unspoken, what precious\r\nopportunity, offered to the city, was left unused, by me? What alliance\r\nwas there, what course of action, to which I ought, by preference, to\r\nhave guided my countrymen?\r\n\r\n{192} But with all mankind the past is always dismissed from\r\nconsideration, and no one under any circumstances proposes to\r\ndeliberate about it. It is the future or the present that make their\r\ncall upon a statesman's duty. Now at that time the danger was partly in\r\nthe future, and partly already present; and instead of cavilling\r\ndisingenuously at the results, consider the principle of my policy\r\nunder such circumstances. For in everything the final issue falls out\r\nas Heaven wills; but the principle which he follows itself reveals the\r\nmind of the statesman. {193} Do not, therefore, count it a crime on my\r\npart, that Philip proved victorious in the battle. The issue of that\r\nevent lay with God, not with me. But show me that I did not adopt every\r\nexpedient that was possible, so far as human reason could calculate;\r\nthat I did not carry out my plan honestly and diligently, with\r\nexertions greater than my strength could bear; or that the policy which\r\nI initiated was not honourable, and worthy of Athens, and indeed\r\nnecessary: and then denounce me, but not before. {194} But if the\r\nthunderbolt [or the storm] which fell has proved too mighty, not only\r\nfor us, but for all the other Hellenes, what are we to do? It is as\r\nthough a ship-owner, who had done all that he could to ensure safety,\r\nand had equipped the ship with all that he thought would enable her to\r\nescape destruction, and had then met with a tempest in which the\r\ntackling had been strained or even broken to pieces, were to be held\r\nresponsible for the wreck of the vessel. 'Why,' he would say, 'I was\r\nnot steering the ship'--just as I was not the general[n]--'I had no\r\npower over Fortune: she had power over everything.' But consider and\r\nobserve this point. {195} If it was fated that we should fare as we\r\ndid, even when we had the Thebans to help us in the struggle, what must\r\nwe have expected, if we had not had even them for our allies, but they\r\nhad joined Philip?--and this was the object for which Philip\r\nemployed[n] every tone that he could command. And if, when the battle\r\ntook place, as it did, three days' march from Attica, the city was\r\nencompassed by such peril and terror, what should we have had to\r\nexpect, if this same disaster had occurred anywhere within the borders\r\nof our own country? Do you realize that, as it was, a single day, and a\r\nsecond, and a third gave us the power to rally, to collect our forces,\r\nto take breath, to do much that made for the deliverance of the city:\r\nbut that had it been otherwise--it is not well, however, to speak of\r\nthings which we have not had to experience, thanks to the goodwill of\r\none of the gods, and to the protection which the city obtained for\r\nherself in this alliance, which you denounce.\r\n\r\n{196} The whole of this long argument, gentlemen of the jury, is\r\naddressed to yourselves and to the circle of listeners outside the bar;\r\nfor to this despicable man it would have been enough to address a\r\nshort, plain sentence. If to you alone, Aeschines, the future was\r\nclear, before it came, you should have given warning, when the city was\r\ndeliberating upon the subject; but if you had no such foreknowledge,\r\nyou have the same ignorance to answer for as others. Why then should\r\nyou make these charges against me, any more than I against you? {197}\r\nFor I have been a better citizen than you with regard to this very\r\nmatter of which I am speaking--I am not as yet talking of anything\r\nelse--just in so far as I gave myself up to the policy which all\r\nthought expedient, neither shrinking from nor regarding any personal\r\nrisk; while you neither offered any better proposals than mine (for\r\nthen they would not have followed mine), nor yet made yourself useful\r\nin advancing mine in any way. What the most worthless of men, the\r\nbitterest enemy of the city, would do, you are found to have done, when\r\nall was over; and at the same time as the irreconcilable enemies of the\r\ncity, Aristratus in Naxos, and Aristoleos in Thasos, are bringing the\r\nfriends of Athens to trial, Aeschines, in Athens itself, is accusing\r\nDemosthenes. {198} But surely one who treasured up[n] the misfortunes\r\nof the Hellenes, that he might win glory from them for himself,\r\ndeserved to perish rather than to stand as the accuser of another; and\r\none who has profited by the very same crisis as the enemies of the city\r\ncannot possibly be loyal to his country. You prove it, moreover, by the\r\nlife you live, the actions you do, the measures you take --and the\r\nmeasures, too, that you do not take. Is anything being done which seems\r\nadvantageous to the city? Aeschines is speechless. Has any obstruction,\r\nany untoward event occurred? There you find Aeschines, like a rupture\r\nor a sprain, which wakes into life, so soon as any trouble overtakes\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\n{199} But since he bears so hardly upon the results, I desire to say\r\nwhat may even be a paradox; and let no one, in the name of Heaven, be\r\namazed at the length to which I go, but give a kindly consideration to\r\nwhat I say. Even if what was to come was plain to all beforehand; even\r\nif all foreknew it; even if you, Aeschines, had been crying with a loud\r\nvoice in warning and protestation--you who uttered not so much as a\r\nsound; even then, I say, it was not right for the city to abandon her\r\ncourse, if she had any regard for her fame, or for our forefathers, or\r\nfor the ages to come. {200} As it is, she is thought, no doubt, to have\r\nfailed to secure her object--as happens to all alike, whenever God\r\nwills it: but then, by abandoning in favour of Philip her claim to take\r\nthe lead of others, she must have incurred the blame of having betrayed\r\nthem all. Had she surrendered without a struggle those claims in\r\ndefence of which our forefathers faced every imaginable peril, who\r\nwould not have cast scorn upon you, Aeschines--upon you, I say; not, I\r\ntrust, upon Athens nor upon me? {201} In God's name, with what faces\r\nshould we have looked upon those who came to visit the city, if events\r\nhad come round to the same conclusion as they now have--if Philip had\r\nbeen chosen as commander and lord of all, and we had stood apart, while\r\nothers carried on the struggle to prevent these things; and that,\r\nalthough the city had never yet in time past preferred an inglorious\r\nsecurity to the hazardous vindication of a noble cause? {202} What\r\nHellene, what foreigner, does not know, that the Thebans, and the\r\nSpartans, who were powerful still earlier, and the Persian king would\r\nall gratefully and gladly have allowed Athens to take what she liked\r\nand keep all that was her own, if she would do the bidding of another,\r\nand let another take the first place in Hellas? {203} But this was not,\r\nit appears, the tradition of the Athenians; it was not tolerable; it\r\nwas not in their nature. From the beginning of time no one had ever yet\r\nsucceeded in persuading the city to throw in her lot with those who\r\nwere strong, but unrighteous in their dealings, and to enjoy the\r\nsecurity of servitude. Throughout all time she has maintained her\r\nperilous struggle for pre-eminence, honour, and glory. {204} And this\r\npolicy you look upon as so lofty, so proper to your own national\r\ncharacter, that, of your forefathers also, it is those who have acted\r\nthus that you praise most highly. And naturally. For who would not\r\nadmire the courage of those men, who did not fear to leave their\r\nland[n] and their city, and to embark upon their ships, that they might\r\nnot do the bidding of another; who chose for their general Themistocles\r\n(who had counselled them thus), and stoned Cyrsilus to death, when he\r\ngave his voice for submission to a master's orders--and not him alone,\r\nfor your wives stoned his wife also to death. {205} For the Athenians\r\nof that day did not look for an orator or a general who would enable\r\nthem to live in happy servitude; they cared not to live at all, unless\r\nthey might live in freedom. For every one of them felt that he had come\r\ninto being, not for his father and his mother alone, but also for his\r\ncountry. And wherein lies the difference? He who thinks he was born for\r\nhis parents alone awaits the death which destiny assigns him in the\r\ncourse of nature: but he who thinks he was born for his country also\r\nwill be willing to die, that he may not see her in bondage, and will\r\nlook upon the outrages and the indignities that he must needs bear in a\r\ncity that is in bondage as more to be dreaded than death.\r\n\r\n{206} Now were I attempting to argue that _I_ had induced you to show a\r\nspirit worthy of your forefathers, there is not a man who might not\r\nrebuke me with good reason. But in fact, I am declaring that such\r\nprinciples as these are your own; I am showing that _before_ my time\r\nthe city displayed this spirit, though I claim that I, too, have had\r\nsome share, as your servant, in carrying out your policy in detail.\r\n{207} But in denouncing the policy as a whole, in bidding you be harsh\r\nwith me, as one who has brought terrors and dangers upon the city, the\r\nprosecutor, in his eagerness to deprive me of my distinction at the\r\npresent moment, is trying to rob you of praises that will last\r\nthroughout all time. For if you condemn the defendant on the ground\r\nthat my policy was not for the best, men will think that your own\r\njudgement has been wrong, and that it was not through the unkindness of\r\nfortune that you suffered what befell you. {208} But it cannot,[n] it\r\ncannot be that you were wrong, men of Athens, when you took upon you\r\nthe struggle for freedom and deliverance. No! by those who at Marathon\r\nbore the brunt of the peril--our forefathers. No! by those who at\r\nPlataeae drew up their battle-line, by those who at Salamis, by those\r\nwho off Artemisium fought the fight at sea, by the many who lie in the\r\nsepulchres where the People laid them, brave men, all alike deemed\r\nworthy by their country, Aeschines, of the same honour and the same\r\nobsequies--not the successful or the victorious alone! And she acted\r\njustly. For all these have done that which it was the duty of brave men\r\nto do; but their fortune has been that which Heaven assigned to each.\r\n{209} Accursed, poring pedant![n] if you, in your anxiety to deprive me\r\nof the honour and the kindness shown to me by my countrymen, recounted\r\ntrophies and battles and deeds of long ago--and of which of them did\r\nthis present trial demand the mention?--what spirit was I to take upon\r\nme, when I mounted the platform, I who came forward to advise the city\r\nhow she should maintain her pre-eminence? Tell me, third-rate actor!\r\nThe spirit of one who would propose things unworthy of this people?\r\n{210} I should indeed have deserved to die! For you too, men of Athens,\r\nought not to judge private suits and public in the same spirit. The\r\nbusiness transactions of everyday life must be viewed in the light of\r\nthe special law and practice associated with each; but the public\r\npolicy of statesmen must be judged by the principles that your\r\nforefathers set before them. And if you believe that you should act\r\nworthily of them, then, whenever you come into court to try a public\r\nsuit, each of you must imagine that with his staff[n] and his ticket\r\nthere is entrusted to him also the spirit of his country.\r\n\r\n{211} But I have entered upon the subject of your forefathers'\r\nachievements, and have passed over certain decrees and transactions. I\r\ndesire, therefore, to return to the point from which I digressed.\r\n\r\nWhen we came to Thebes, we found envoys there from Philip, and from the\r\nThessalians and his other allies--our friends in terror, his full of\r\nconfidence. And to show you that I am not saying this now to suit my\r\nown purpose, read the letter which we, your envoys, dispatched without\r\ndelay. {212} The prosecutor, however, has exercised the art of\r\nmisrepresentation to so extravagant a degree, that he attributes to\r\ncircumstances, not to me, any satisfactory result that was achieved;\r\nbut for everything that fell out otherwise, he lays the blame upon me\r\nand the fortune that attends me. In his eyes, apparently, I, the\r\ncounsellor and orator, have no share in the credit for what was\r\naccomplished as the result of oratory and debate; while I must bear the\r\nblame alone for the misfortunes which we suffered in arms, and as a\r\nresult of generalship. What more brutal, more damnable\r\nmisrepresentation can be conceived? (_To the clerk_.) Read the letter.\r\n\r\n[_The letter is read_.]\r\n\r\n{213} When they had convened the Assembly, they gave audience to the\r\nother side first, on the ground that they occupied the position of\r\nallies; and these came forward and delivered harangues full of the\r\npraises of Philip and of accusations against yourselves, recalling\r\neverything that you had ever done in opposition to the Thebans. The sum\r\nof it all was that they required the Thebans to show their gratitude\r\nfor the benefits which they had received from Philip, and to exact the\r\npenalty for the injuries they had received from you, in whichever way\r\nthey preferred--either by letting them march through their country\r\nagainst you, or by joining them in the invasion of Attica; and they\r\nshowed (as they thought) that the result of the course which they\r\nadvised would be that the herds and slaves and other valuables of\r\nAttica would find their way into Boeotia; while the result of what (as\r\nthey alleged) you were about to propose would be that those of Boeotia\r\nwould be plundered in consequence of the war. {214} They said much\r\nmore, but all tending to the same effect. As for our reply, I would\r\ngive my whole life to tell it you in detail; but I fear lest, now that\r\nthose times have gone by, you may feel as if a very deluge[n] had\r\noverwhelmed all, and may regard anything that is said on the subject as\r\nvanity and vexation. But hear at least what we persuaded them to do,\r\nand their answer to us. (_To the clerk_.) Take this and read it.\r\n\r\n[_The answer of the Thebans is read_.]\r\n\r\n{215} After this they invited and summoned you; you marched; you went\r\nto their aid; and (to pass over the events which intervened) they\r\nreceived you in so friendly a spirit that while their infantry and\r\ncavalry were encamped outside the walls,[n] they welcomed your troops\r\ninto their houses, within the city, among their children and wives, and\r\nall that was most precious to them. Three eulogies did the Thebans\r\npronounce upon you before the world that day, and those of the most\r\nhonourable kind--the first upon your courage, the second upon your\r\nrighteousness, the third upon your self-control. For when they chose to\r\nside with you in the struggle, rather than against you, they judged\r\nthat your courage was greater, and your requests more righteous, than\r\nPhilip's; and when they placed in your power what they and all men\r\nguard most jealously, their children and wives, they showed their\r\nconfidence in your self-control. {216} In all these points, men of\r\nAthens, your conduct proved that their judgement had been correct. For\r\nthe force came into the city; but no one made a single complaint--not\r\neven an unfounded complaint--against you; so virtuously did you conduct\r\nyourselves. And twice you fought by their side, in the earliest\r\nbattles-the battle by the river[n] and the winter-battle[n]--and showed\r\nyourselves, not only irreproachable, but even admirable, in your\r\ndiscipline, your equipment, and your enthusiasm. These things called\r\nforth expressions of thanks to you from other states, and sacrifices\r\nand processions to the gods from yourselves. {217} And I should like to\r\nask Aeschines whether, when all this was happening, and the city was\r\nfull of pride and joy and thanksgiving, he joined in the sacrifices and\r\nthe rejoicing of the multitude, or whether he sat at home grieving and\r\ngroaning and angry at the good fortune of his country. If he was\r\npresent, and was seen in his place with the rest, surely his present\r\naction is atrocious--nay, even impious--when he asks you, who have\r\ntaken an oath by the gods, to vote to-day that those very things were\r\nnot excellent, of whose excellence he himself on that day made the gods\r\nhis witnesses. If he was not present, then surely he deserves to die\r\nmany times, for grieving at the sight of the things which brought\r\nrejoicing to others. (_To the clerk_.) Now read these decrees also.\r\n\r\n[_The decrees ordering sacrifices are read_.]\r\n\r\n{218} Thus we were occupied at that time with sacrifices, while the\r\nThebans were reflecting how they had been saved by our help; and those\r\nwho, in consequence of my opponents' proceedings, had expected that\r\nthey would themselves stand in need of help, found themselves, after\r\nall, helping others, in consequence of the action they took upon my\r\nadvice. But what the tone of Philip's utterance was, and how greatly he\r\nwas confounded by what had happened, you can learn from his letter,\r\nwhich he sent to the Peloponnese. (_To the clerk_.) Take these and read\r\nthem: (_to the jury_) that you may know what was effected by my\r\nperseverance, by my travels, by the hardships I endured, by all those\r\ndecrees of which Aeschines spoke so disparagingly just now.\r\n\r\n{219} You have had, as you know, many great and famous orators, men of\r\nAthens, before my time--Callistratus himself, Aristophon, Cephalus,\r\nThrasybulus, and a vast number of others. Yet not one of these ever\r\ngave himself up entirely to the State for any purpose: the mover of a\r\ndecree would not serve as ambassador, the ambassador would not move the\r\ndecree. Each left himself, at one and the same time, some respite from\r\nwork, and somewhere to lay the blame,[n] in case of accidents. {220}\r\n'Well,' some one may say, 'did _you_ so excel them in force and\r\nboldness, as to do everything yourself?' I do not say that. But so\r\nstrong was my conviction of the seriousness of the danger that had\r\novertaken the city, that I felt that I ought not to give my personal\r\nsafety any place whatever in my thoughts; it was enough for a man to do\r\nhis duty and to leave nothing undone. {221} And I was convinced with\r\nregard to myself--foolishly perhaps, but still convinced--that no mover\r\nwould make a better proposal, no agent would execute it better, no\r\nambassador would be more eager or more honest in his mission, than I.\r\nFor these reasons, I assigned every one of these offices to myself.\r\n(_To the clerk_.) Read Philip's letters.\r\n\r\n[_Philip's letters are read_.]\r\n\r\n{222} To this condition, Aeschines, was Philip reduced by my\r\nstatesmanship. This was the tone of his utterances, though before this\r\nhe used to threaten the city with many a bold word. For this I was\r\ndeservedly crowned by those here assembled, and though you were\r\npresent, you offered no opposition; while Diondas, who indicted the\r\nproposer, did not obtain the necessary fraction of the votes. (_To the\r\nclerk_.) Read me these decrees, (_to the jury)_ which escaped\r\ncondemnation, and which Aeschines did not even indict.\r\n\r\n[_The decrees are read_.]\r\n\r\n{223} These decrees, men of Athens, contain the very same syllables,\r\nthe very same words, as those which Aristonicus previously employed in\r\nhis proposal, and which Ctesiphon, the defendant, has employed now; and\r\nAeschines neither prosecuted the proposer of them himself, nor\r\nsupported the person who indicted him. Yet surely, if the charges which\r\nhe is bringing against me to-day are true, he would have had better\r\nreason then for prosecuting Demomeles (the proposer of the decree) and\r\nHypereides, than he has for prosecuting Ctesiphon. And why? {224}\r\nBecause Ctesiphon can refer you to them--to the decision of the courts,\r\nto the fact that Aeschines himself did not accuse them, though they had\r\nmoved exactly what he has moved now, to the prohibition by law of\r\nfurther prosecution in such cases, and to many other facts: whereas\r\nthen the case would have been tried on its merits, before the defendant\r\nhad got the advantage of any such precedent. {225} But of course it was\r\nimpossible then for Aeschines to act as he has acted now--to select out\r\nof many periods of time long past, and many decrees, matters which no\r\none either knew or thought would be mentioned to-day; to misrepresent\r\nthem, to change the dates, to put false reasons for the actions taken\r\nin place of the true, and so appear to have a case. {226} At the time\r\nthis was impossible. Every word spoken then must have been spoken with\r\nthe truth in view, at no distance of time from the events, while you\r\nstill remembered all the facts and had them practically at your\r\nfingers' ends. For that reason he evaded all investigation at the time;\r\nand he has come before you now, in the belief (I fancy) that you will\r\nmake this a contest of oratory, instead of an inquiry into our\r\npolitical careers, and that it is upon our eloquence, not upon the\r\ninterests of the city, that you will decide.\r\n\r\n{227} Yes, and he ingeniously suggests that you ought to disregard the\r\nopinion which you had of each of us when you left your homes and came\r\ninto court; and that just as, when you draw up an account in the belief\r\nthat some one has a balance, you nevertheless give way when you find\r\nthat the counters all disappear[n] and leave nothing over, so now you\r\nshould give your adhesion to the conclusion which emerges from the\r\nargument. Now observe how inherently rotten everything that springs\r\nfrom dishonesty seems to be. {228} By his very use of this ingenious\r\nillustration he has confessed that to-day, at all events, our\r\nrespective characters are well established--that I am known to speak\r\nfor my country's good, and he to speak for Philip. For unless that were\r\nyour present conception of each of us, he would not have sought to\r\nchange your view. {229} And further, I shall easily show you that it is\r\nnot fair of him to ask you to alter this opinion--not by the use of\r\ncounters--that is not how a political reckoning is made--but by briefly\r\nrecalling each point to you, and treating you who hear me both as\r\nauditors of my account and witnesses to the facts. For that policy of\r\nmine which he denounces caused the Thebans, instead of joining Philip,\r\nas all expected them to do, in the invasion of our country, to range\r\nthemselves by our side and stay his progress. {230} It caused the war\r\nto take place not in Attica, but on the confines of Boeotia, eighty\r\nmiles from the city. Instead of our being harried and plundered by\r\nfreebooters from Euboea, it gave peace to Attica from the side of the\r\nsea throughout the war. Instead of Philip's taking Byzantium and\r\nbecoming master of the Hellespont, it caused the Byzantines to join us\r\nin the war against him. {231} Can such achievements, think you, be\r\nreckoned up like counters? Are we to cancel them out,[n] rather than\r\nprovide that they shall be remembered for all time? I need not now add\r\nthat it fell to others to taste the barbarity which is to be seen in\r\nevery case in which Philip got any one finally into his power; while\r\nyou reaped (and quite rightly) the fruits of the generosity which he\r\nfeigned while he was bringing within his grasp all that remained. But I\r\npass this over.\r\n\r\n{232} Nay, I will not even hesitate to say, that one who wished to\r\nreview an orator's career straightforwardly and without\r\nmisrepresentation, would not have included in his charges such matters\r\nas you just now spoke of--making up illustrations, and mimicking words\r\nand gestures. Of course the fortune which befell the Hellenes--surely\r\nyou see this?--was entirely due to my using this word instead of that,\r\nor waving my hand in one direction rather than the other! {233} He\r\nwould have inquired, by reference to the actual facts, what resources\r\nand what forces the city had at her command when I entered political\r\nlife; what I subsequently collected for her when I took control; and\r\nwhat was the condition of our adversaries. Then if I had diminished our\r\nforces, he would have proved that the fault lay at my door; but if I\r\nhad greatly increased them, he would have abstained from deliberate\r\nmisrepresentation. But since you have avoided such an inquiry, I will\r\nundertake it; and do you, gentlemen, observe whether my argument is\r\njust.\r\n\r\n{234} The military resources of the city included the islanders--and\r\nnot all, but only the weakest. For neither Chios nor Rhodes nor Corcyra\r\nwas with us. Their contribution in money came to 45 talents, and these\r\nhad been collected in advance.[n] Infantry and cavalry, besides our\r\nown, we had none. But the circumstance which was most alarming to us\r\nand most favourable to our enemies was that these men had contrived\r\nthat all our neighbours should be more inclined to enmity than to\r\nfriendship--the Megareans, the Thebans, and the Euboeans. {235} Such\r\nwas the position of the city at the time; and what I say admits of no\r\ncontradiction. Now consider the position of Philip, with whom our\r\nconflict lay. In the first place, he held absolute sway over his\r\nfollowers--and this for purposes of war is the greatest of all\r\nadvantages. Next, his followers had their weapons in their hands\r\nalways. Then he was well off for money, and did whatever he resolved to\r\ndo, without giving warning of it by decrees, or debating about it in\r\npublic, or being put on trial by dishonest accusers, or defending\r\nhimself against indictments for illegality, or being bound to render an\r\naccount to any one. He was himself absolute master, commander, and lord\r\nof all. {236} But I who was set to oppose him--for this inquiry too it\r\nis just to make--what had I under my control? Nothing! For, to begin\r\nwith, the very right to address you--the only right I had--you extended\r\nto Philip's hirelings in the same measure as to me; and as often as\r\nthey defeated me--and this frequently happened, whatever the reason on\r\neach occasion--so often you went away leaving a resolution recorded in\r\nfavour of the enemy. {237} But in spite of all these disadvantages, I\r\nwon for you the alliance of the Euboeans, Achaeans, Corinthians,\r\nThebans, Megareans, Leucadians, and Corcyreans, from whom were\r\ncollected--apart from their citizen-troops--15,000 mercenaries and\r\n2,000 cavalry. {238} And I instituted a money-contribution, on as large\r\na scale as I could. But if you refer,[n] Aeschines, to what was fair as\r\nbetween ourselves and the Thebans or the Byzantines or the Euboeans--if\r\nat this time you talk to us of equal shares--you must be ignorant, in\r\nthe first place, of the fact that in former days also, out of those\r\nships of war, three hundred [n] in all, which fought for the Hellenes,\r\nAthens provided two hundred, and did not think herself unfairly used,\r\nor let herself be seen arraigning those who had counselled her action,\r\nor taking offence at the arrangement. It would have been shameful. No!\r\nmen saw her rendering thanks to Heaven, because when a common peril\r\nbeset the Hellenes, she had provided double as much as all the rest to\r\nsecure the deliverance of all. {239} Moreover, it is but a hollow\r\nbenefit that you are conferring upon your countrymen by your dishonest\r\ncharges against me. Why do you tell them _now_, what course they ought\r\nto have taken? Why did you not propose such a course at the time (for\r\nyou were in Athens, and were present) if it was possible in the midst\r\nof those critical times, when we had to accept, not what we chose, but\r\nwhat circumstances allowed; since there was one at hand, bidding\r\nagainst us, and ready to welcome those whom we rejected, and to pay\r\nthem into the bargain.\r\n\r\n{240} But if I am accused to-day, for what I have actually done, what\r\nif at the time I had haggled over these details, and the other states\r\nhad gone off and joined Philip, and he had become master at once of\r\nEuboea and Thebes and Byzantium? What do you think these impious men\r\nwould then have done? {241} What would they have said? Would they not\r\nhave declared that the states had been surrendered? that they had been\r\ndriven away, when they wished to be on your side? 'See,' they would\r\nhave said (would they not?), 'he has obtained through the Byzantines\r\nthe command of the Hellespont and the control of the corn trade of\r\nHellas; and through the Thebans a trying border war has been brought\r\ninto Attica; and owing to the pirates who sail from Euboea, the sea has\r\nbecome unnavigable,' and much more in addition. {242} A villainous\r\nthing, men of Athens, is the dishonest accuser always--villainous, and\r\nin every way malignant and fault-finding! Aye, and this miserable\r\ncreature is a fox by nature, that has never done anything honest or\r\ngentlemanly--a very tragical ape, a clodhopping Oenomaus, a counterfeit\r\norator! {243} Where is the profit to your country from your cleverness?\r\nDo you instruct us now about things that are past? It is as though a\r\ndoctor, when he was paying his visits to the sick, were to give them no\r\nadvice or instructions to enable them to become free from their\r\nillness, but, when one of his patients died and the customary\r\nofferings[n] were being paid him, were to explain, as he followed to\r\nthe tomb, 'if this man had done such and such things, he would not have\r\ndied.' Crazy fool! Do you tell us this _now_?\r\n\r\n{244} Nor again will you find that the defeat--if you exult at it, when\r\nyou ought to groan, accursed man!--was determined by anything that was\r\nwithin my control. Consider the question thus. In no place to which I\r\nwas sent by you as ambassador, did I ever come away defeated by the\r\nambassadors of Philip--not from Thessaly nor from Ambracia, not from\r\nthe Illyrians nor from the Thracian princes, not from Byzantium nor\r\nfrom any other place, nor yet, on the last occasion, from Thebes. But\r\nevery place in which his ambassadors were defeated in argument, he\r\nproceeded to attack and subdue by force of arms. {245} Do you then\r\nrequire those places at _my_ hands? Are you not ashamed to jeer at a\r\nman as a coward, and in the same breath to require him to prove\r\nsuperior, by his own unaided efforts, to the army of Philip--and that\r\nwith no weapons to use but words? For what else was at my disposal? I\r\ncould not control the spirit of each soldier, or the fortune of the\r\ncombatants, or the generalship displayed, of which, in your perversity,\r\nyou demand an account from me. {246} No; but every investigation that\r\ncan be made as regards those duties for which an orator should be held\r\nresponsible, I bid you make. I crave no mercy. And what are those\r\nduties? To discern events in their beginnings, to foresee what is\r\ncoming, and to forewarn others. These things I have done. Again, it is\r\nhis duty to reduce to the smallest possible compass, wherever he finds\r\nthem, the slowness, the hesitation, the ignorance, the contentiousness,\r\nwhich are the errors inseparably connected with the constitution of all\r\ncity-states; while, on the other hand, he must stimulate men to unity,\r\nfriendship, and eagerness to perform their duty. All these things I\r\nhave done, and no one can discover any dereliction of duty on my part\r\nat any time. {247} If one were to ask any person whatever, by what\r\nmeans Philip had accomplished the majority of his successes, every one\r\nwould reply that it was by means of his army, and by giving presents\r\nand corrupting those in charge of affairs. Now I had no control or\r\ncommand of the forces: neither, then, does the responsibility for\r\nanything that was done in that sphere concern me. And further, in the\r\nmatter of being or not being corrupted by bribes, I have defeated\r\nPhilip. For just as the bidder has conquered one who accepts his money,\r\nif he effects his purchase, so one who refuses to accept it [and is not\r\ncorrupted] has conquered the bidder. In all, therefore, in which I am\r\nconcerned, the city has suffered no defeat.\r\n\r\n{248} The justification, then, with which I furnished the defendant for\r\nsuch a motion as he proposed with regard to me, consisted (along with\r\nmany other points) of the facts which I have described, and others like\r\nthem. I will now proceed to that justification which all of you\r\nsupplied. For immediately after the battle, the People, who knew and\r\nhad seen all that I did, and now stood in the very midst of the peril\r\nand terror, at a moment when it would not have been surprising if the\r\nmajority had shown some harshness towards me--the People, I say, in the\r\nfirst place carried my proposals for ensuring the safety of the city;\r\nand all the measures undertaken for its protection--the disposition of\r\nthe garrisons, the entrenchments, the funds for the\r\nfortifications--were all provided for by decrees which I proposed. And,\r\nin the second place, when the People chose a corn-commissioner, out of\r\nall Athens they elected me. {249} Subsequently all those who were\r\ninterested in injuring me combined, and assailed me with indictments,\r\nprosecutions after audit, impeachments, and all such proceedings--not\r\nin their own names at first, but through the agency of men behind whom,\r\nthey thought, they would best be screened against recognition. For you\r\ndoubtless know and remember that during the early part of that period I\r\nwas brought to trial every day; and neither the desperation of\r\nSosicles, nor the dishonest misrepresentations of Philocrates,[n] nor\r\nthe frenzy of Diondas and Melantus, nor any other expedient, was left\r\nuntried by them against me. And in all these trials, thanks to the gods\r\nabove all, but secondarily to you and the rest of the Athenians, I was\r\nacquitted--and justly; for such a decision is in accordance both with\r\ntruth and with the credit of jurors who have taken their oath, and\r\ngiven a verdict in conformity with it. {250} So whenever I was\r\nimpeached, and you absolved me and did not give the prosecutor the\r\nnecessary fraction of the votes, you were voting that my policy was the\r\nbest. Whenever I was acquitted upon an indictment, it was a proof that\r\nmy motion and proposals were according to law. Whenever you set your\r\nseal to my accounts at an audit, you confessed in addition that I had\r\nacted throughout with uprightness and integrity. And this being so,\r\nwhat epithet was it fitting or just that Ctesiphon should apply to my\r\nactions? Was it not that which he saw applied by the People, and by\r\njuries on their oath, and ratified by Truth in the judgement of all men?\r\n\r\n{251} 'Yes,' he replies, 'but Cephalus'[n] boast was a noble one--that\r\nhe had never been indicted at all.' True, and a happy thing also it was\r\nfor him. But why should one who has often been tried, but has never\r\nbeen convicted of crime, deserve to incur criticism any the more on\r\nthat account? Yet in truth, men of Athens, so far as Aeschines is\r\nconcerned, I too can make this noble boast that Cephalus made. For he\r\nhas never yet preferred or prosecuted any indictment against me; so\r\nthat by you at least, Aeschines, I am admitted to be no worse a citizen\r\nthan Cephalus.\r\n\r\n{252} His want of feeling and his malignity may be seen in many ways,\r\nand not least in the remarks which he made about fortune. For my part,\r\nI think that, as a rule, when one human being reproaches another with\r\nhis fortune, he is a fool. For when he who thinks himself most\r\nprosperous and fancies his fortune most excellent, does not know\r\nwhether it will remain so until the evening, how can it be right to\r\nspeak of one's fortune, or to taunt another with his? But since\r\nAeschines adopts a tone of lofty superiority upon this as upon many\r\nother subjects, observe, men of Athens, how much more truthful and more\r\nbecoming in a human being my own remarks upon Aeschines' fortune will\r\nbe. {253} I believe that the fortune of this city is good; and I see\r\nthat the God of Dodona also declares this to you through his oracle.\r\nBut I think that the prevailing fortune of mankind as a whole to-day is\r\ngrievous and terrible. For what man, Hellene or foreigner, has not\r\ntasted abundance of evil at this present time? {254} Now the fact that\r\nwe chose the noblest course, and that we are actually better off than\r\nthose Hellenes who expected to live in prosperity if they sacrificed\r\nus, I ascribe to the good fortune of the city. But in so far as we\r\nfailed, in so far as everything did not fall out in accordance with our\r\nwishes, I consider that the city has received the share which was due\r\nto us of the fortune of mankind in general. {255} But my personal\r\nfortune, and that of every individual among us, ought, I think, in\r\nfairness to be examined with reference to our personal circumstances.\r\nThat is my judgement with regard to fortune, and I believe (as I think\r\nyou also do) that my judgement is correct and just. But Aeschines\r\nasserts that my personal fortune has more influence than the fortune of\r\nthe city as a community--the insignificant and evil more than the good\r\nand important! How can this be?\r\n\r\n{256} If, however, you determine at all costs to scrutinize my fortune,\r\nAeschines, then compare it with your own; and if you find that mine is\r\nbetter than yours, then cease to revile it. Examine it, then, from the\r\nvery beginning. And, in Heaven's name, let no one condemn me for any\r\nwant of good taste. For I neither regard one who speaks insultingly of\r\npoverty, nor one who prides himself on having been brought up in\r\naffluence, as a man of sense. But the slanders and misrepresentations\r\nof this unfeeling man oblige me to enter upon a discussion of this\r\nsort; and I will conduct it with as much moderation as the facts allow.\r\n\r\n{257} I then, Aeschines, had the advantage as a boy of attending the\r\nschools which became my position, and of possessing as much as one who\r\nis to do nothing ignoble owing to poverty must possess. When I passed\r\nout of boyhood, my life corresponded with my upbringing--I provided\r\nchoruses and equipped warships; I paid the war-tax; I neglected none of\r\nthe paths to distinction in public or private life, but gave my\r\nservices both to my country and my friends; and when I thought fit to\r\nenter public life, the measures which I decided to adopt were of such a\r\ncharacter that I have been crowned many times both by my country and by\r\nmany other Hellenic peoples, while not even you, my enemies, attempt to\r\nsay that my choice was not at least an honourable one. {258} Such is\r\nthe fortune which has accompanied my life, and though I might say much\r\nmore about it, I refrain from doing so, in my anxiety not to annoy any\r\none by the expression of my pride. And you--the lofty personage, the\r\ndespiser of others--what has been your fortune when compared with\r\nthis?--the fortune, thanks to which you were brought up as a boy in the\r\ndepths of indigence, in close attendance upon the school along with\r\nyour father, pounding up the ink, sponging down the forms, sweeping the\r\nattendants' room,[n] occupying the position of a menial, not of a\r\nfree-born boy! {259} Then, when you became a man, you used to read out\r\nthe books[n] to your mother at her initiations, and help her in the\r\nrest of the hocus-pocus, by night dressing the initiated[n] in\r\nfawnskins, drenching them from the bowl, purifying them and wiping them\r\ndown with the clay and the bran, and (when they were purified) bidding\r\nthem stand up and say, 'The ill is done, the good begun,' priding\r\nyourself upon raising the shout of joy more loudly than any one had\r\never done before--and I can believe it, for, when his voice is so loud,\r\nyou dare not imagine that his shout is anything but superlatively fine.\r\n{260} But by day you used to lead those noble companies through the\r\nstreets, men crowned with fennel and white poplar,[n] throttling the\r\npuff-adders and waving them over your head, crying out 'Euoe,\r\nSaboe,'[n] and dancing to the tune of 'Hyes Attes, Attes\r\nHyes'--addressed by the old hags as leader, captain, ivy-bearer,\r\nfan-bearer, and so on; and as the reward of your services getting sops\r\nand twists and barley-bannocks! Who would not congratulate himself with\r\ngood reason on such things, and bless his own fortune? {261} But when\r\nyou were enrolled among your fellow parishioners,[n] by whatever means\r\n(for of that I say nothing)--when, I say, you _were_ enrolled, you at\r\nonce selected the noblest of occupations, that of a clerk and servant\r\nto petty magistrates. {262} And when at length you escaped from this\r\ncondition also, after yourself doing all that you impute to others, you\r\nin no way--Heaven knows!--disgraced your previous record by the life\r\nwhich you subsequently lived; for you hired yourself out to the actors\r\nSimylus and Socrates--the Roarers, they were nicknamed --and played as\r\na third-rate actor, collecting figs[n] and bunches of grapes and\r\nolives, like a fruiterer gathering from other peoples' farms, and\r\ngetting more out of this than out of the dramatic competitions in which\r\nyou were competing for your lives; for there was war without truce or\r\nherald between yourselves and the spectators; and the many wounds you\r\nreceived from them make it natural for you to jeer at the cowardice of\r\nthose who have had no such experiences. {263} But I will pass over all\r\nthat might be accounted for by your poverty, and proceed to my charges\r\nagainst your character itself. For you chose a line of political action\r\n(when at length it occurred to you to take up politics too), in\r\npursuance of which, when your country's fortune was good, you lived the\r\nlife of a hare, in fear and trembling, always expecting a thrashing for\r\nthe crimes which lay on your conscience; whereas all have seen your\r\nboldness amid the misfortunes of others. {264} But when a man plucks up\r\ncourage at the death of a thousand of his fellow citizens, what does he\r\ndeserve to suffer at the hands of the living? I have much more to say\r\nabout him, but I will leave it unsaid. It is not for me, I think, to\r\nmention lightly all the infamy and disgrace which I could prove to be\r\nconnected with him, but only so much as it is not discreditable to\r\nmyself to speak of.\r\n\r\n{265} And now review the history of your life and of mine, side by\r\nside--good temperedly, Aeschines, not unkindly: and then ask these\r\ngentlemen which fortune, of the two, each of them would choose. You\r\ntaught letters; I attended school. You conducted initiations; I was\r\ninitiated. You were a clerk; I a member of the Assembly: you, a\r\nthird-rate actor, I a spectator of the play. You used to be driven from\r\nthe stage, while I hissed. Your political life has all been lived for\r\nthe good of our enemies, mine for the good of my country. {266} To pass\r\nover all besides, even on this very day, I am being examined with\r\nregard to my qualification for a crown--it is already admitted that I\r\nam clear of all crimes; while you have already the reputation of a\r\ndishonest informer, and for you the issue at stake is whether you are\r\nto continue such practices, or to be stopped once for all, through\r\nfailing to obtain a fifth part of the votes. A good fortune indeed--can\r\nyou not see?--is that which has accompanied your life, that you should\r\ndenounce mine!\r\n\r\n{267} And now let me read to you the evidence of the public burdens\r\nwhich I have undertaken; and side by side with them, do you, Aeschines,\r\nread the speeches which you used to murder--\r\n\r\n  'I leave the abysm of death and gates of gloom,'[n]\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n  'Know that I am not fain ill-news to bring';\r\n\r\nand 'evil in evil wise',[n] may you be brought to perdition, by the\r\ngods above all, and then by all those here present, villainous citizen,\r\nvillainous third-rate actor that you are. (_To the clerk_.) Read the\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n[_The evidence is read_.]\r\n\r\n{268} Such was I in my relation to the State. And as to my private\r\nlife, unless you all know that I was open-hearted and generous and at\r\nthe disposal of all who had need of me, I am silent; I prefer to tell\r\nyou nothing, and to produce no evidence whatever, to show whether I\r\nransomed some from the enemy, or helped others to give their daughters\r\nin marriage, or rendered any such services. {269} For my principle may\r\nperhaps be expressed thus. I think that one who has received a kindness\r\nought to remember it all his life; but that the doer of the kindness\r\nshould forget it once for all; if the former is to behave like a good\r\nman, the latter like one free from all meanness. To be always recalling\r\nand speaking of one's own benefactions is almost like upbraiding the\r\nrecipients of them. I will do nothing of the kind, and will not be led\r\ninto doing so. Whatever be the opinion that has been formed of me in\r\nthese respects, with that I am content.\r\n\r\n{270} But I desire to be rid of personal topics, and to say a little\r\nmore to you about public affairs. For if, Aeschines, you can mention\r\none of all those who dwell beneath the sun above us, Hellene or\r\nforeigner, who has not suffered under the absolute sway, first of\r\nPhilip, and now of Alexander, so be it! I concede that it is my fortune\r\nor misfortune, whichever you are pleased to call it, that has been to\r\nblame for everything. {271} But if many of those who have never once\r\neven seen me or heard my voice have suffered much and terribly--and not\r\nindividuals alone, but whole cities and nations--how much more just and\r\ntruthful it is to regard the common fortune (as it seems to be) of all\r\nmankind, and a certain stubborn drift of events in the wrong direction,\r\nas the cause of these sufferings. {272} Such considerations, however,\r\nyou discard. You impute the blame to me, whose political life has been\r\nlived among my own fellow countrymen--and that, though you know that\r\nyour slander falls in part (if not entirely) upon all of them, and\r\nabove all upon yourself. For if, when I took part in the discussion of\r\npublic affairs, I had had absolute power, it would have been possible\r\nfor all of you, the other orators, to lay the blame on me. {273} But if\r\nyou were present at every meeting of the Assembly; if the city always\r\nbrought forward questions of policy for public consideration; if at the\r\ntime my policy appeared the best to every one, and above all to you\r\n(for it was certainly from no goodwill that you relinquished to me the\r\nhopes, the admiration, the honours, which all attached themselves to my\r\npolicy at that time, but obviously because the truth was too strong for\r\nyou, and you had nothing better to propose); then surely you are guilty\r\nof monstrous iniquity, in finding fault to-day with a policy, than\r\nwhich, at the time, you could propose nothing better. {274} Among all\r\nthe rest of mankind, I observe that some such principles as the\r\nfollowing have been, as it were, determined and ordained. If a man\r\ncommits a deliberate crime, indignation and punishment are ordained\r\nagainst him. If he commits an involuntary mistake, instead of\r\npunishment, he is to receive pardon. If, without crime or mistake, one\r\nwho has given himself up wholly to that which seems to be for the\r\nadvantage of all has, in company with all, failed to achieve success,\r\nthen it is just, not to reproach or revile such a man, but to\r\nsympathize with him. {275} Moreover, it will be seen that all these\r\nprinciples are not so ordained in the laws alone. Nature herself has\r\nlaid them down in her unwritten law, and in the moral consciousness of\r\nmankind. Aeschines, then, has so far surpassed all mankind in brutality\r\nand in the art of misrepresentation, that he actually denounces me for\r\nthings which he himself mentioned under the name of misfortunes.\r\n\r\n{276} In addition to everything else, as though he had himself always\r\nspoken straightforwardly and in loyalty, he bade you keep your eyes on\r\nme carefully, and make sure that I did not mislead or deceive you. He\r\ncalled me 'a clever speaker', 'a wizard', 'a sophist', and so on: just\r\nas if it followed that when a man had the first word and attributed his\r\nown qualities to another, the truth was really as he stated, and his\r\nhearers would not inquire further who he himself was, that said such\r\nthings. But I am sure that you all know this man, and are aware that\r\nthese qualities belong to him far more than to me. And again, {277} I\r\nam quite sure that my cleverness--yes, let the word pass; though I\r\nobserve that the influence of a speaker depends for the most part on\r\nhis audience; for in proportion to the welcome and the goodwill which\r\nyou accord to each speaker is the credit which he obtains for\r\nwisdom;--I am sure, I say, that if I too possess any such skill, you\r\nwill all find it constantly fighting on your behalf in affairs of\r\nState, never in opposition to you, never for private ends; while the\r\nskill of Aeschines, on the contrary, is employed, not only in upholding\r\nthe cause of the enemy, but in attacking any one who has annoyed him or\r\ncome into collision with him anywhere. He neither employs it uprightly,\r\nnor to promote the interests of the city. {278} For a good and\r\nhonourable citizen ought not to require from a jury, who have come into\r\ncourt to represent the interests of the community, that they shall give\r\ntheir sanction to his anger, or his enmity, or any other such passion;\r\nnor ought he to come before you to gratify such feelings. It were best\r\nthat he had no such passions in his nature at all; but if they are\r\nreally inevitable, then he should keep them tame and subdued. Under\r\nwhat circumstances, then, should a politician and an orator show\r\npassion? {279} When any of the vital interests of his country are at\r\nstake; when it is with its enemies that the People has to deal: those\r\nare the circumstances. For then is the opportunity of a loyal and\r\ngallant citizen. But that when he has never to this day demanded my\r\npunishment, either in the name of the city or in his own, for any\r\npublic--nor, I will add, for any private--crime, he should have come\r\nhere with a trumped-up charge against the grant of a crown and a vote\r\nof thanks, and should have spent so many words upon it--that is a sign\r\nof personal enmity and jealousy and meanness, not of any good quality.\r\n{280} And that he should further have discarded every form of lawsuit\r\nagainst myself, and should have come here to-day to attack the\r\ndefendant, is the very extremity of baseness. It shows, I think,\r\nAeschines, that your motive in undertaking this suit was your desire,\r\nnot to exact vengeance for any crime, but to give a display of rhetoric\r\nand elocution. Yet it is not his language, Aeschines, that deserves our\r\nesteem in an orator, nor the pitch of his voice, but his choice of the\r\naims which the people chooses, his hatred or love of those whom his\r\ncountry loves or hates. {281} He whose heart is so disposed will always\r\nspeak with loyal intent; but he who serves those from whom the city\r\nforesees danger to herself, does not ride at the same anchor as the\r\nPeople, and therefore does not look for safety to the same quarter. But\r\nI do, mark you! For I have made the interests of my countrymen my own,\r\nand have counted nothing as reserved for my own private advantage.\r\nWhat? {282} You have not done so either? How can that be, when\r\nimmediately after the battle you went your way as an ambassador to\r\nPhilip, the author of the calamities which befell your country at that\r\ntime; and that, despite the fact that until then you always denied this\r\nintimacy[n] with him, as every one knows? But what is meant by a\r\ndeceiver of the city? Is it not one who does not say what he thinks?\r\nUpon whom does the herald justly pronounce the curse? Is it not upon\r\nsuch a man as this? With what greater crime can one charge a man who is\r\nan orator, than that of saying one thing and thinking another? Such a\r\nman you have been found to be. {283} And after this do you open your\r\nmouth, or dare to look this audience in the face? Do you imagine that\r\nthey do not know who you are? or that the slumber of forgetfulness has\r\ntaken such hold upon them all, that they do not remember the speeches\r\nwhich you used to deliver during the war, when you declared with\r\nimprecations and oaths that you had nothing to do with Philip, and that\r\nI was bringing this accusation against you, when it was not true, to\r\nsatisfy my personal enmity? {284} But so soon as the news of the battle\r\nhad come, you thought no more of all this, but at once avowed and\r\nprofessed that you stood on a footing of friendship and\r\nguest-friendship with him; though these were nothing but your\r\nhireling-service under other names; for upon what honest or equal basis\r\ncould Aeschines, the son of Glaucothea the tambourine--player,[n] enjoy\r\nthe guest-friendship, or the friendship, or the acquaintance of Philip?\r\nI cannot see. In fact, you had been hired by him to ruin the interests\r\nof these your countrymen. And yet, though your own treason has been so\r\nplainly detected--though you have been an informer against yourself\r\nafter the event--you still revile me, and reproach me with crimes of\r\nwhich, you will find, any one is more guilty than I.\r\n\r\n{285} Many a great and noble enterprise, Aeschines, did this city\r\nundertake and succeed in, inspired by me; and she did not forget them.\r\nIt is a proof of this, that when, immediately after the event, the\r\nPeople had to elect one who should pronounce the oration over the dead,\r\nand you were nominated, they did not elect you, for all your fine\r\nvoice, nor Demades, who had just negotiated the Peace, nor Hegemon,[n]\r\nnor any other member of your party: they elected me. And when you and\r\nPythocles[n] came forward in a brutal and shameless fashion, God knows!\r\nand made the same charges against me as you are making again to-day,\r\nand abused me, the People elected me even more decidedly. {286} And the\r\nreason you know well; but I will tell it you nevertheless. They knew\r\nfor themselves both the loyalty and zeal which inspired my conduct of\r\naffairs, and the iniquity of yourself and your friends. For what you\r\ndenied with oaths when our cause was prosperous, you admitted in the\r\nhour of the city's failure; and those, accordingly, who were only\r\nenabled by the misfortunes of their country to express their views\r\nwithout fear, they decided to have been enemies of their own for a long\r\nwhile, though only then did they stand revealed.{287} And further, they\r\nthought that one who was to pronounce an oration over the dead, and to\r\nadorn their valour, should not have come beneath the same roof, nor\r\nshared the same libation,[n] as those who were arrayed against them;\r\nthat he should not there join with those who with their own hands had\r\nslain them, in the revel[n] and the triumph-song over the calamities of\r\nthe Hellenes, and then come home and receive honour--that he should not\r\nplay the mourner over their fate with his voice, but should grieve for\r\nthem in his heart. What they required they saw in themselves and in me,\r\nbut not in you; and this was why they appointed me, and not any of you.\r\n{288} Nor, when the people acted thus, did the fathers and brothers of\r\nthe slain, who were then publicly appointed to conduct the funeral, act\r\notherwise. For since (in accordance with the ordinary custom) they had\r\nto hold the funeral-feast in the house of the nearest of kin, as it\r\nwere, to the slain, they held it at my house, and with reason; for\r\nthough by birth each was more nearly akin to his dead than I, yet none\r\nstood nearer to them all in common. For he who had their life and their\r\nsuccess most at heart, had also, when they had suffered what I would\r\nthey had not, the greatest share of sorrow for them all.\r\n\r\n(_To the clerk _) {289} Read him the epitaph which the city resolved to\r\ninscribe above them at the public cost; (_to Aeschines_) that even by\r\nthese very lines, Aeschines, you may know that you are a man destitute\r\nof feeling, a dishonest accuser, an abominable wretch!\r\n\r\n\r\n  _The Inscription_.[n]\r\n\r\n  These for their country, fighting side by side,\r\n  By deeds of arms dispelled the foemen's pride.\r\n  heir lives they saved not, bidding Death make clear--\r\n  Impartial Judge!--their courage or their fear.\r\n  For Greece they fought, lest, 'neath the yoke brought low,\r\n  In thraldom she th' oppressor's scorn should know.\r\n  Now in the bosom of their fatherland\r\n  After their toil they rest--'tis God's command.\r\n  'Tis God's alone from failure free to live;[n]\r\n  Escape from Fate to no man doth He give.\r\n\r\n{290} Do you hear, Aeschines [in these very lines], 'Tis God's alone\r\nfrom failure free to live'? Not to the statesman has he ascribed the\r\npower to secure success for those who strive, but to the gods. Why\r\nthen, accursed man, do you revile _me_, for our failure, in words which\r\nI pray the gods to turn upon the heads of you and yours?\r\n\r\n{291} But, even after all the other lying accusations which he has\r\nbrought against me, the thing which amazed me most of all, men of\r\nAthens, was that when he mentioned what had befallen the city, he did\r\nnot think of it as a loyal and upright citizen would have thought. He\r\nshed no tears; he felt no emotion of sorrow in his heart: he lifted up\r\nhis voice, he exulted, he strained his throat, evidently in the belief\r\nthat he was accusing me, though in truth he was giving us an\r\nillustration, to his own discredit, of the utter difference between his\r\nfeelings and those of others, at the painful events which had taken\r\nplace. {292} But surely one who professes, as Aeschines professes now,\r\nto care for the laws and the constitution, ought to show, if nothing\r\nelse, at least that he feels the same griefs and the same joys as the\r\nPeople, and has not, by his political profession, ranged himself on the\r\nside of their opponents. That you have done the latter is manifest\r\ntoday, when you pretend that the blame for everything is mine, and that\r\nit is through me that the city was plunged in trouble: though it was\r\nnot through my statesmanship or my policy, gentlemen, {293} that you\r\nbegan to help the Hellenes: for were you to grant me this--that it was\r\nthrough me that you had resisted the dominion which was being\r\nestablished over the Hellenes--you would have granted me a testimonial\r\nwhich all those that you have given to others together could not equal.\r\nBut neither would I make such an assertion; for it would be unjust to\r\nyou; nor, I am sure, would you concede its truth: and if Aeschines were\r\nacting honestly, he would not have been trying to deface and\r\nmisrepresent the greatest of your glories, in order to satisfy his\r\nhatred towards me.\r\n\r\n{294} But why do I rebuke him for this, when he has made other lying\r\ncharges against me, which are more outrageous by far? For when a man\r\ncharges me--I call Heaven and Earth to witness!--with philippizing,\r\nwhat will he not say? By Heracles and all the gods, if one had to\r\ninquire truthfully, setting aside all calumny and all expression of\r\nanimosity, who are in reality the men upon whose heads all would\r\nnaturally and justly lay the blame for what has taken place, you would\r\nfind that it was those in each city who resemble Aeschines, not those\r\nwho resemble me. {295} For they, when Philip's power was weak and quite\r\ninsignificant--when we repeatedly warned and exhorted you and showed\r\nyou what was best--they, to satisfy their own avarice, sacrificed the\r\ninterests of the community, each group deceiving and corrupting their\r\nown fellow citizens, until they brought them into bondage. Thus the\r\nThessalians were treated by Daochus, Cineas, and Thrasydaeus; the\r\nArcadians by Cercidas, Hieronymus and Eucampidas; the Argives by\r\nMyrtis, Teledamus, and Mnaseas; the Eleans by Euxitheus, Cleotimus and\r\nAristaechmus; the Messenians by the sons of the godforsaken\r\nPhiliadas--Neon and Thrasylochus; the Sicymians by Aristratus and\r\nEpichares; the Corinthians by Deinarchus and Demaretus; the Megareans\r\nby Ptoeodorus, Helixus and Perillus; the Thebans by Timolaus,\r\nTheogeiton, and Anemoetas; the Euboeans by Hipparchus and Sosistratus.\r\n{296} Daylight will fail me before the list of the traitors is\r\ncomplete. All these, men of Athens, are men who pursue the same designs\r\nin their own cities, as my opponents pursue among you--abominable men,\r\nflatterers, evil spirits, who have hacked the limbs each of his own\r\nfatherland, and like boon companions have pledged away their freedom,\r\nfirst to Philip and now to Alexander; men whose measure of happiness is\r\ntheir belly, and their lowest instincts; while as for freedom, and the\r\nrefusal to acknowledge any man as lord--the standard and rule of good\r\nto the Hellenes of old--they have flung it to the ground.\r\n\r\n{297} Of this shameful and notorious conspiracy and wickedness--or\r\nrather (to speak with all earnestness, men of Athens), of this treason\r\nagainst the freedom of the Hellenes--Athens has been guiltless in the\r\neyes of all men, in consequence of my statesmanship, as I have been\r\nguiltless in your eyes. And do you then ask me for what merits I count\r\nmyself worthy to receive honour? I tell you that at a time when every\r\npolitician in Hellas had been corrupted--beginning with\r\nyourself--[firstly by Philip, and now by Alexander], {298} no\r\nopportunity that offered, no generous language, no grand promises, no\r\nhopes, no fears, nor any other motive, tempted or induced me to betray\r\none jot of what I believed to be the rights and interests of the city;\r\nnor, of all the counsel that I have given to my fellow countrymen, up\r\nto this day, has any ever been given (as it has by you) with the scales\r\nof the mind inclining to the side of gain, but all out of an upright,\r\nhonest, uncorrupted soul. I have taken the lead in greater affairs than\r\nany man of my own time, and my administration has been sound and honest\r\nthroughout all. {299} That is why I count myself worthy of honour. But\r\nas for the fortifications and entrenchments, for which you ridiculed\r\nme, I judge them to be deserving, indeed, of gratitude and\r\ncommendation--assuredly they are so--but I set them far below my own\r\npolitical services. Not with stones, nor with bricks, did I fortify\r\nthis city. Not such are the works upon which I pride myself most. But\r\nwould you inquire honestly wherein my fortifications consist? You will\r\nfind them in munitions of war, in cities, in countries, in harbours, in\r\nships, in horses, and in men ready to defend my fellow countrymen.\r\n{300} These are the defences I have set to protect Attica, so far as by\r\nhuman calculation it could be done; and with these I have fortified our\r\nwhole territory--not the circuit of the Peiraeus or of the city alone.\r\nNor in fact, did _I _prove inferior to Philip in calculations--far from\r\nit!--or in preparations for war; but the generals of the\r\nconfederacy,[n] and their forces, proved inferior to him in fortune.\r\nWhere are the proofs of these things? They are clear and manifest. I\r\nbid you consider them.\r\n\r\n{301} What was the duty of a loyal citizen--one who was acting  with\r\nall forethought and zeal and uprightness for his country's good? Was it\r\nnot to make Euboea the bulwark of Attica on the side of the sea, and\r\nBoeotia on that of the mainland, and on that of the regions towards the\r\nPeloponnese, our neighbours[n] in that direction? Was it not to provide\r\nfor the corn-trade, and to ensure that it should pass along a\r\ncontinuously friendly coast all the way to the Peiraeus? {302} Was it\r\nnot to preserve the places which were ours--Proconnesus, the\r\nChersonese, Tenedos--by dispatching expeditions to aid them, and\r\nproposing and moving resolutions accordingly; and to secure the\r\nfriendship and alliance of the rest--Byzantium, Tenedos, Euboea? Was it\r\nnot to take away the greatest of the resources which the enemy\r\npossessed, and to add what was lacking to those of the city? {303} All\r\nthis has been accomplished by my decrees and by the measures which I\r\nhave taken; and all these measures, men of Athens, will be found by any\r\none who will examine them without jealousy, to have been correctly\r\nplanned, and executed with entire honesty: the opportunity for each\r\nstep was not, you will find, neglected or left unrecognized or thrown\r\naway by me, and nothing was left undone, which it was within the power\r\nand the reasoning capacity of a single man to effect. But if the might\r\nof some Divine Power, or the inferiority of our generals, or the\r\nwickedness of those who were betraying your cities, or all these things\r\ntogether, continuously injured our whole cause, until they effected its\r\noverthrow, how is Demosthenes at fault? {304} Had there been in each of\r\nthe cities of Hellas one man, such as I was, as I stood at my own post\r\nin your midst--nay, if all Thessaly and all Arcadia had each had but\r\none man animated by the same spirit as myself--not one Hellenic people,\r\neither beyond or on this side of Thermopylae, would have experienced\r\nthe evils which they now suffer. {305} All would have been dwelling in\r\nliberty and independence, free from all fears, secure and prosperous,\r\neach in their own land, rendering thanks for all these great blessings\r\nto you and the rest of the Athenian people, through me. But that you\r\nmay know that in my anxiety to avoid jealousy, I am using language\r\nwhich is far from adequate to the actual facts, (_to the clerk_) read\r\nme this; and take and recite the list of the expeditions sent out in\r\naccordance with my decrees.\r\n\r\n[_The list of expeditions is read]_\r\n\r\n{306} These measures, and others like them, Aeschines, were the\r\nmeasures which it was the duty of a loyal and gallant citizen to take.\r\nIf they were successful, it was certain that we should be indisputably\r\nthe strongest power, and that with justice as well as in fact: and now\r\nthat they have resulted otherwise, we are left with at least an\r\nhonourable name. No man casts reproach either upon the city, or upon\r\nthe choice which she made: they do but upbraid Fortune, who decided the\r\nissue thus. {307} It was not, God knows, a citizen's duty to abandon\r\nhis country's interests, to sell his services to her opponents, and\r\ncherish the opportunities of the enemy instead of those of his country.\r\nNor was it, on the one hand, to show his malice against the man who had\r\nfaced the task of proposing and moving measures worthy of the city, and\r\npersisting in that intention; while, on the other hand, he remembered\r\nand kept his eyes fixed upon any private annoyance which another had\r\ncaused him: nor was it to maintain a wicked and festering inactivity,\r\nas you so often do. {308} Assuredly there is an inactivity that is\r\nhonest and brings good to the State--the inactivity which you,[n] the\r\nmajority of the citizens, observe in all sincerity. But that is not the\r\ninactivity of Aeschines. Far from it! He, on the contrary, retires just\r\nwhen he chooses, from public life (and he often chooses to do so), that\r\nhe may watch for the moment when you will be sated with the continual\r\nspeeches of the same adviser, or when fortune has thrown some obstacle\r\nin your path, or some other disagreeable event has happened (for in the\r\nlife of man many things are possible); and then, when such an\r\nopportunity comes, suddenly, like a gale of wind, out of his retirement\r\nhe comes forth an orator, with his voice in training, and his phrases\r\nand his sentences collected; and these he strings together lucidly,\r\nwithout pausing for breath, though they bring with them no profit, no\r\naccession of anything good, but only calamity to one or another of his\r\nfellow citizens, and shame to all alike. {309} Surely, Aeschines, if\r\nall this practice and study sprang from an honest heart, resolved to\r\npursue the interests of your country, the fruits of it should have been\r\nnoble and honourable and profitable to all--alliances of cities,\r\nsupplies of funds, opening of ports,[n] enactment of beneficial laws,\r\nacts of opposition to our proved enemies. {310} It was for all such\r\nservices that men looked in bygone days; and the past has offered, to\r\nany loyal and gallant citizen, abundant opportunities of displaying\r\nthem: but nowhere in the ranks of such men will you ever be found to\r\nhave stood--not first, nor second, nor third, nor fourth, nor fifth,\r\nnor sixth, nor in any position whatsoever; at least, not in any matters\r\nwhereby your country stood to gain. {311} For what alliance has the\r\ncity gained by negotiations of yours? What assistance, what fresh\r\naccess of goodwill or fame? What diplomatic or administrative action of\r\nyours has brought new dignity to the city? What department of our home\r\naffairs, or our relations with Hellenic and foreign states, over which\r\nyou have presided, has shown any improvement? Where are your ships?\r\nWhere are your munitions of war? Where are your dockyards? Where are\r\nthe walls that you have repaired? Where are your cavalry? Where in the\r\nworld _is_ your sphere of usefulness? What pecuniary assistance have\r\nyou ever given, as a good and generous fellow citizen,[n] either to\r\nrich or poor? {312} 'But, my good sir, 'you say, 'if I have done none\r\nof these things, I have at least given my loyalty and goodwill.' Where?\r\nWhen? Why, even at a time when all who ever opened their lips upon the\r\nplatform contributed voluntarily to save the city, till, last of all,\r\nAristonicus gave what he had collected to enable him to regain his\r\ncivil rights--even then, most iniquitous of men! you never came forward\r\nor made any contribution whatever: and assuredly it was not from\r\npoverty, when you had inherited more than five talents out of the\r\nestate of your father-in-law Philo, and had received two talents\r\nsubscribed by the leaders of the Naval Boards,[n] for your damaging\r\nattack upon my Naval Law.[n] {313} But I will say no more about this,\r\nlest by passing from subject to subject I should break away from the\r\nmatter in hand. It is at least plain that your failure to contribute\r\nwas not due to your poverty, but to your anxiety to do nothing in\r\nopposition to those whose interest is the guide of your whole public\r\nlife. On what occasions, then, do your spirit and your brilliancy show\r\nthemselves? When something must be done to injure your fellow\r\ncountrymen--then your voice is most glorious, your memory most perfect;\r\nthen you are a prince of actors, a Theocrines[n] on the tragic stage!\r\n\r\n{314} Again, you have recalled the gallant men of old, and you do well\r\nto do so. Yet it is not just, men of Athens, to take advantage of the\r\ngood feeling which you may be relied upon to entertain towards the\r\ndead, in order to examine me before you by their standard, and compare\r\nme, who am still living amongst you, with them. {315} Who in all the\r\nworld does not know that against the living there is always more or\r\nless of secret jealousy, while none, not even their enemies, hate the\r\ndead any more? And am I, in spite of this law of nature, to be judged\r\nand examined to-day by the standard of those who were before me? By no\r\nmeans! It would be neither just nor fair, Aeschines. But let me be\r\ncompared with yourself, or with any of those who have adopted the same\r\npolicy as yourself, and are still alive. {316} And consider this also.\r\nWhich of these alternatives is the more honourable? Which is better for\r\nthe city?--that the good services done by men of former\r\ntimes--tremendous, nay even beyond all description though they may\r\nbe--should be made an excuse for exposing to ingratitude and contumely\r\nthose that are rendered to the present generation? or that all who act\r\nin loyalty should have a share in the honours and the kindness which\r\nour fellow citizens dispense? {317} Aye, and (if I must say this after\r\nall) the policy and the principles which I have adopted will be found,\r\nif rightly viewed, to resemble and to have the same aims as those of\r\nthe men who in that age received praise; while yours resemble those of\r\nthe dishonest assailants of such persons in those days. For in their\r\ntime also there were obviously persons who disparaged the living and\r\npraised the men of old, acting in the same malicious way as yourself.\r\n{318} Do you say then, that I am in no way like them? But are you like\r\nthem, Aeschines? or your brother? or any other orator of the present\r\nday? For my part, I should say, 'None.' Nay, my good sir--to use no\r\nother epithet--compare the living with the living, their\r\ncontemporaries, as men do in every other matter, whether they are\r\ncomparing poets or choruses or competitors in the games. {319} Because\r\nPhilammon was not so powerful as Glaucus of Carystus[n] and some other\r\nathletes of former times, he did not leave Olympia uncrowned: but\r\nbecause he fought better than all who entered against him, he was\r\ncrowned and proclaimed victor. Do you likewise examine me beside the\r\norators of the day--beside yourself, beside any one in the world that\r\nyou choose. {320} I fear no man's rivalry. For, while the city was\r\nstill free to choose the best course, and all alike could compete with\r\none another in loyalty to their country, I was found the best adviser\r\nof them all. It was by my laws, by my decrees, by my diplomacy, that\r\nall was effected. Not one of your party appeared anywhere, unless some\r\ninsult was to be offered to your fellow countrymen. But when there\r\nhappened, what I would had never happened--when it was not statesmen\r\nthat were called to the front, but those who would do the bidding of a\r\nmaster, those who were anxious to earn wages by injuring their country,\r\nand to flatter a stranger--then, along with every member of your party,\r\nyou were found at your post, the grand and resplendent owner of a\r\nstud;[n] while I was weak, I confess, yet more loyal to my fellow\r\ncountrymen than you. {321} Two characteristics, men of Athens, a\r\ncitizen of a respectable character (for this is perhaps the least\r\ninvidious phrase that I can apply to myself) must be able to show: when\r\nhe enjoys authority, he must maintain to the end the policy whose aims\r\nare noble action and the pre-eminence of his country: and at all times\r\nand in every phase of fortune he must remain loyal. For this depends\r\nupon his own nature; while his power and his influence are determined\r\nby external causes. And in me, you will find, this loyalty has\r\npersisted unalloyed. For mark this. {322} Not when my surrender was\r\ndemanded, not when I was called to account before the Amphictyons, not\r\nin face either of threats or of promises, not when these accursed men\r\nwere hounded on against me like wild beasts, have I ever been false to\r\nmy loyalty towards you. For from the very first, I chose the straight\r\nand honest path in public life: I chose to foster the honour, the\r\nsupremacy, the good name of my country, to seek to enhance them, and to\r\nstand or fall with them. {323} I do not walk through the market,\r\ncheerful and exultant over the success of strangers, holding out my\r\nhand and giving the good tidings to any whom I expect to report my\r\nconduct yonder, but shuddering, groaning, bowing myself to the earth,\r\nwhen I hear of the city's good fortune, as do these impious men, who\r\nmake a mock of the city --not remembering that in so doing they are\r\nmocking themselves--while they direct their gaze abroad, and, whenever\r\nanother has gained success through the failure of the Hellenes, belaud\r\nthat state of things, and declare that we must see that it endures for\r\nall time.\r\n\r\n{324} Never, O all ye gods, may any of you consent to their desire! If\r\nit can be, may you implant even in these men a better mind and heart.\r\nBut if they are verily beyond all cure, then bring them and them alone\r\nto utter and early destruction, by land and sea. And to us who remain,\r\ngrant the speediest release from the fears that hang over us, and\r\nsafety that naught can shake!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] Some writers suppose that it was at the meeting in the spring of\r\n339. The evidence is not conclusive, but appears to point to the date\r\ngiven here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE NAVAL BOARDS\r\n\r\n§ 1. _who praise your forefathers_. The advocates of war with Persia\r\nhad doubtless appealed to the memory of Marathon and Salamis, and the\r\nold position of Athens as the champion of Greece against Persia.\r\n\r\n§ 10, 11. The argument is this: 'If a war with Persia needed a special\r\nkind of force, we could not prepare for it without being detected: but\r\nas all wars need the same kind of force, our preparations need rouse no\r\nsuspicion in Persia particularly.'\r\n\r\n_acknowledged foes_: i.e. probably Thebes, or the revolted allies of\r\nAthens, with whom a disadvantageous peace had, perhaps, just been made.\r\nIt is not, however, impossible that Philip also is in the orator's\r\nmind; for though at the time he was probably engaged in war with the\r\nIllyrians and Paeonians, his quarrel with Athens in regard to\r\nAmphipolis had not been settled. The Olynthians may also be thought of.\r\n(See Introd. to Phil. I and Olynthiacs.)\r\n\r\n§ 12. _rhapsodies_. The rhapsodes who went about Greece reciting Homer\r\nand other poets had lost the distinction they once enjoyed, and\r\n'rhapsody' became a synonym for idle declamation.\r\n\r\n§ 14. _a bold speech_: i.e. a demand for instant war, helped out by\r\nrhetorical praises of the men of old.\r\n\r\n§ 16. _unmarried heiresses and orphans_. These would be incapable of\r\ndischarging the duties of the trierarchy, though their estates were\r\nliable for the war-tax. Partners were probably exempted, when none of\r\nthem possessed so large a share in the common property as would render\r\nhim liable for trierarchy.\r\n\r\n_property outside Attica_. According to the terms made by Athens with\r\nher allies when the 'Second Delian League' was formed in 378, Athens\r\nundertook that no Athenian should hold property in an allied State. But\r\nthis condition had been broken, and the multiplication of Athenian\r\nestates [Greek: _kl_erhouchiai_] in allied territories had been one of\r\nthe causes of the war with the allies.\r\n\r\n_unable to contribute_: e. g. owing to no longer possessing the estate\r\nwhich he had when the assessment was made.\r\n\r\n§ 17. _to associate, &c_. The sections which contained a very rich man\r\nwere to have poor men included in it, so that the total wealth of every\r\nsection might be the same, and the distribution of the burden between\r\nthe sections fair.\r\n\r\n§ 18. _the first hundred, &c_. Demosthenes thinks of the fleet as\r\ncomposed, according to need, of 100, 200, or 300 vessels, and treats\r\neach hundred as a separate squadron, to be separately divided among the\r\nBoards.\r\n\r\n_by lot_. In this and other clauses of his proposal, Demosthenes\r\nstipulates for the use of the lot ([Greek: _sunkl_er_osai_], [Greek:\r\nepikl_erosai]) to avoid all unfair selection. It is only in the\r\ndistribution of duties among the smaller sections within each Board\r\nthat assignment by arrangement ([Greek: _apodounai_], a word suggesting\r\ndistribution according to fitness or convenience) is to be allowed.\r\n\r\n§ 19. _taxable capital_ ([Greek: _tim_ema_]). The war-tax and the\r\ntrierarchic burdens were assessed on a valuation of the contributor's\r\nproperty. Upon this valuation of his taxable capital he paid the\r\npercentage required. (The old view that he was taxed not upon his\r\ncapital, as valued, but upon a fraction of it varying with his wealth,\r\nrests upon an interpretation of passages in the Speeches against\r\nAphobus, which is open to grave question.) The total amount of the\r\nsingle valuations was the 'estimated taxable capital of the country'\r\n([Greek: _tim_ema t_es ch_oras_]). This, in the case of the trierarchy,\r\nwould be the aggregate amount of the valuations of the 1,200 wealthiest\r\nmen, viz. 6,000 talents. (Of course the capital taxable for the war-tax\r\nwould be considerably larger. Even at a time when the prosperity of\r\nAttica was much lower, in 378-377 B.C., it was nearly 6,000 talents,\r\naccording to Polybius, ii. 62. 6.)\r\n\r\n§ 20. A tabular statement will make this plain:--\r\n\r\n                   _Persons         _Total capital taxable\r\n  _Ships_.       responsible_.          for each ship_.\r\n\r\n    100              12                     60 tal.\r\n    200               6                     30  \"\r\n    300               4                     20  \"\r\n\r\nThe percentage payable on the taxable capital was of course higher, the\r\nlarger the number of ships required. Each ship appears to have cost on\r\nthe average a talent to equip. The percentages in the three cases\r\ncontained in the table would therefore be 1-2/3, 3-1/3, and 5,\r\nrespectively. (Compare § 27.)\r\n\r\n§ 21. _fittings ... in arrear_. Apparently former trierarchs had not\r\nalways given back the fittings of their vessels, which had either been\r\nprovided at the expense of the State, or lent to the trierarchs by the\r\nState.\r\n\r\n§ 23. _wards_ ([Greek: _trittyes_]). The trittys or ward was one-third\r\nof a tribe.\r\n\r\n§ 25. _you see ... city_. The Assembly met on the Pnyx, whence there\r\nwas a view of the Acropolis and of the greater part of the ancient city.\r\n\r\n_prophets_. The Athenian populace seems always to have been liable to\r\nthe influence of soothsayers, who professed to utter oracles from the\r\ngods, particularly when war was threatening. This was so (e. g.) at the\r\ntime of the Peloponnesian War (Thucyd. ii. 8, v. 26), and the\r\nsoothsayer is delightfully caricatured by Aristophanes in the _Birds_\r\nand elsewhere.\r\n\r\n§ 29. _two hundred ships ... one hundred were Athenian_. In the Speech\r\non the Crown, § 238, Demosthenes gives the numbers as 300 and 200.\r\nPerhaps a transcriber at an early stage in the history of the text\r\naccidentally wrote HH (the symbol for 200) instead of HHH, in the case\r\nof the first number, and a later scribe then 'corrected' the second\r\nnumber into H instead of HH. The numbers given by Herodotus are 378 and\r\n180, and, for the Persian ships, 1,207.\r\n\r\n§ 31. _against Egypt_, which was now in rebellion against Artaxerxes.\r\nOrontas, Satrap of Mysia, was more or less constantly in revolt during\r\nthis period.\r\n\r\n§ 32. _even more certainly_ [Greek: _palai_]: lit. 'long ago'. The\r\ntransition from temporal to logical priority is paralleled in certain\r\nuses of other temporal adverbs, e.g. [Greek: _euthys_] (Aristotle,\r\n_Poet_. v), and [Greek: _schol_e_] (of which, as Weil notes, [Greek:\r\n_palai_] is the exact opposite).\r\n\r\n§ 34. _sins against Hellas_. This refers to the support given to the\r\nPersian invaders by Thebes in the Persian Wars (Herod. viii. 34).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE MEGALOPOLITANS\r\n\r\n§ 4. _Plataeae_ (which had been overthrown by the enemies of Athens in\r\nthe course of the Peloponnesian War, but rebuilt, with the aid of\r\nSparta, in 378) was destroyed by Thebes in 373-372. About the same time\r\nThebes destroyed Thespiae, which, like Plataeae, was well-disposed\r\ntowards Athens; and in 370 the Thebans massacred the male population of\r\nOrchomenus, and sold the women and children into slavery.\r\n\r\n§ 11. _Oropus_ had sometimes belonged to Thebes and sometimes to\r\nAthens. In 366 it was taken from Athens by Themison, tyrant of Eretria\r\n(exactly opposite Oropus, on the coast of Euboea), and placed in the\r\nhands of Thebes until the ownership should be decided. Thebes retained\r\nit until it was restored to Athens by Philip in 338.\r\n\r\n§ 12. _when all the Peloponnesians, &c_. The reference seems to be to\r\nthe year 370, shortly after the battle of Leuctra, when the\r\nPeloponnesian States sought the protection of Athens against Sparta,\r\nand, being refused, became allies of Thebes (Diodorus xv. 62). In 369\r\nAthens made an alliance with Sparta.\r\n\r\n§ 14. _saved the Spartans_. See last note. Athens also assisted the\r\nSpartans at Mantineia in 362.\r\n\r\n_the Thebans_. In 378 and the following years Athens assisted Thebes\r\nagainst the Spartans under Agesilaus and Cleombrotus.\r\n\r\n_the Euboeans_. In 358 or 357 Euboea succeeded in obtaining freedom\r\nfrom the domination of Thebes by the aid of Athenian troops under\r\nTimotheus.\r\n\r\n§ 16. _Triphylia_, a district between Elis and Messenia, was the\r\nsubject of a long-standing dispute between the Eleans and the\r\nArcadians, and seems to have been in the hands of the latter since\r\n(about) 368.\r\n\r\n_Tricaranum_, a fortress in the territory of Phlius, had been seized by\r\nthe Argives in 369, and used as a centre from which incursions were\r\nmade into Phliasian territory.\r\n\r\n§ 20. _allies of Thebes_: in order to preserve the balance of power\r\nbetween Thebes and Sparta.\r\n\r\n§ 21. _the Theban confederacy_. The reference is particularly to the\r\nArcadian allies of Thebes, but the wider expression perhaps suggests a\r\ngeneral policy of a more ambitious kind.\r\n\r\n§ 22. _you, I think, know_. He refers to the older members of the\r\nAssembly, who would remember the tyrannical conduct of Sparta during\r\nthe period of her supremacy (the first quarter of the fourth century\r\nB.C.).\r\n\r\n§ 27. _pillars_. The terms of an alliance were usually recorded upon\r\npillars erected by each State on some site fixed by agreement or custom.\r\n\r\n§ 28. _in the war_: i.e. the 'Sacred War', against the Phocians.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE FREEDOM OF THE RHODIANS\r\n\r\n§ 3. _now it will be seen_: i.e. if you come to a right decision, and\r\nhelp the Rhodians.\r\n\r\n§ 5. _the Egyptians_. See Speech on Naval Boards, § 31 n.\r\n\r\n§ 6. _to advise you_: i.e. in the Speech on the Naval Boards (see\r\nespecially §§ 10, 11 of that Speech).\r\n\r\n§ 9. _Ariobarzanes_, Satrap of the Hellespont, joined in the general\r\nrevolt of the princes of Asia Minor against Persia in 362, at first\r\nsecretly (as though making war against other satraps) but afterwards\r\nopenly. Timotheus was sent to help him, on the understanding that he\r\nmust not break the Peace of Antalcidas (378 B.C.), according to which\r\nthe Greek cities in Asia were to belong to the king, but the rest were\r\nto be independent (except that Athens was to retain Lemnos, Imbros, and\r\nScyros). When Ariobarzanes broke out in open revolt, Timotheus could\r\nnot help him without breaking the first provision; but the Persian\r\noccupation tion of Samos was itself a violation of the second, and he\r\nwas therefore justified in relieving the town.\r\n\r\n§ 11. _while he is in her neighbourhood_. Artaxerxes almost certainly\r\nwent in person to Egypt about this time. (That he went before 346 is\r\nproved by Isocrates, _Philippus_, § 101; and he was no doubt expected\r\nto go, even before he went.) The alternative rendering, 'since he is\r\nstill to be a neighbouring power to herself,' is less good, since he\r\nwould be this, whether he conquered Egypt or not.\r\n\r\n§ 14. _Rhodians who are now in possession_: i.e. the oligarchs, who\r\nheld the town with the help of Caria.\r\n\r\n_some of their fellow-citizens_: i.e. some of the democratic party.\r\n\r\n§ 15. _official patron_ ([Greek: _proxenos_]). The 'official patron' of\r\nanother State in Athens was necessarily an Athenian, and so differed\r\nfrom the modern consul, whom he otherwise resembled in many ways (cf.\r\nPhillipson, _International Law and Custom of Ancient Greece and Rome_,\r\nvol. i, pp. 147-56).\r\n\r\n§ 17. _publicly provided_: i.e. in treaties between the States.\r\n\r\n§ 22. _when our democracy_, &c.: i.e. in 404, when, at the conclusion\r\nof the Peloponnesian War, the tyranny of the Thirty was established,\r\nand a very large number of democratic citizens were driven into exile.\r\nThe Argives refused the Spartan demand for the surrender of some of\r\nthese to the Thirty (Diodorus xiv. 6).\r\n\r\n§ 23. _one who is a barbarian-aye, and a woman_ ([Greek: _barbaron\r\nanthr_opon kai tauta gynaika_]). This has been taken to refer (1) to\r\nArtaxerxes and Artemisia. But [Greek: _kai tauta_] cannot be simply\r\n[Greek: _pros tont_o_], and [Greek: _kai tauta gynaika_] must refer to\r\nthe same person as [Greek: _barbaron anthr_opon_]; (2) to Artaxerxes\r\nalone, the words [Greek: _kai tauta gynaika_] being a gratuitous insult\r\nsuch as it was customary for Athenians to level at any Persian; (3) to\r\nArtemisia alone, [Greek: anthr_opos] being feminine here as often. It\r\nis not possible to decide certainly between (2) and (3). Artemisia is\r\nmore prominent in the speech than the king, but it is the king who is\r\nreferred to in the next sentence.\r\n\r\n§ 24. _rendered Athens weak_. The success of Sparta in the\r\nPeloponnesian War was rendered possible, to a great extent, by the\r\nsupply of funds from Persia. In 401 Cyrus made his famous expedition\r\nagainst Artaxerxes II, and Clearchus (with other generals) commanded\r\nthe Greek troops which assisted him. The death of Cyrus in the battle\r\nof Cunaxa in 401 put an end to his rebellion.\r\n\r\n§ 25. _rights of the rest of the world_. Weil suggests that it may have\r\nbeen argued that to intervene in Rhodian affairs would be to break the\r\ntreaty made with the allies in 355 (about), at the end of the Social\r\nWar, whereby their independence was guaranteed.\r\n\r\n§ 26. _Chalcedon_ was on the Asiatic shore of the Bosporus, and\r\ntherefore by the Peace of Antalcidas belonged to the king (see n. on §\r\n9). By the same treaty, Selymbria, on the north coast of the Propontis,\r\nought to have been independent. The Byzantines, who had obtained their\r\nindependence of Athens in the Social War, were extending their\r\ninfluence greatly at this time.\r\n\r\n§ 27. _the treaty_: again the Peace of Antalcidas.\r\n\r\n_even if there actually are such advisers_: or, 'even if any one\r\nactually asserts the existence of such persons.'\r\n\r\n§ 29. _two treaties_. The first must be the Peace of Callias (444\r\nB.C.), the terms of which are given in the Speech on the Embassy, §\r\n273. The second was the Peace of Antalcidas.\r\n\r\n§ 30. _the knowledge of what is right_. The parallel passage in § 1\r\nseems to confirm this rendering, rather than the alternative, 'the\r\nintention to do what is right.'\r\n\r\n§ 33. _oligarchical_. This expression is partly directed at those who,\r\nin opposing the exiled democrats, supported the oligarchs of Rhodes;\r\nand it may be partly explained by the fact that the policy of Eubulus,\r\nwho wished to avoid all interferences which might lead to war, was\r\nparticularly satisfactory to the wealthier classes in Athens. But it\r\nwas a common practice to accuse an opponent of anti-democratic\r\nsentiments, and of trying to get the better of the people by\r\nillegitimate means (cf. Speech on Embassy, § 314, &c.).\r\n\r\n§ 35. Cf. Speech on Naval Boards, § 41.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST PHILIPPIC\r\n\r\n§ 3. _the war with Sparta_. Probably the Boeotian War (378-371 B.C.),\r\nwhen Athens supported Thebes against Sparta.\r\n\r\n_in defence of the right_. The attempt of the Spartans to conquer\r\nBoeotia was a violation of the Peace of Antalcidas (see n. on Speech\r\nfor Rhodians, § 6). But Demosthenes' expression may be quite general in\r\nits meaning.\r\n\r\n§ 4. _tribes_. Probably refers especially to the Thracians (see Introd.\r\nto the Speech). The Paeonian and Illyrian chieftains also made alliance\r\nwith Athens in 356.\r\n\r\n§ 17. _to Euboea_. See Speech for Megalopolitans, § 14 n.\r\n\r\n_to Haliartus_: in 395, when Athens sent a force to aid the Thebans\r\nagainst the Spartans under Lysander. (For other allusions see Introd.\r\nto the Speech.)\r\n\r\n§ 19. _paper-armies_ ([Greek: epistolimaious ... dynameis]): lit.\r\n'armies existing in dispatches.'\r\n\r\n§ 24. _Athens once maintained_, &c. The reference is to the Corinthian\r\nwar of 394-387 B.C. The Athenian general Iphicrates organized a\r\nmercenary force of peltasts in support of Corinth, and did great damage\r\nto Sparta; he was succeeded in the command by Chabrias. Nothing more is\r\ncertainly known of Polystratus than is told us here, though he may be\r\nreferred to in the Speech against Leptines, § 84, as receiving honours\r\nfrom Athens.\r\n\r\n_to Artabazus_. In 356 Chares was sent to oppose the revolted allies of\r\nAthens, but being short of funds, assisted Artabazus in his rebellion\r\nagainst Persia, and was richly rewarded. (See Introd. to Speech on\r\nNaval Boards.)\r\n\r\n§ 25. _spectators of these mysteries of generalship_ ([Greek: epoptai\r\nt_on ] [Greek: *_strat_egoumen_on_]). The word [Greek: _epopt_es_] is\r\nchiefly used of spectators of the mysteries, and is here applied\r\nsarcastically to the citizens whom Demosthenes desires to see what has\r\nhitherto been a hidden thing from them--the conduct of their generals.\r\n\r\n§ 26. _ten captains and generals, &c_. There was one general ([Greek:\r\n_strat_egos_]) and one captain ([Greek: _taxiarchos_]) of infantry, and\r\none general of cavalry ([Greek: _phylarchos_]), for each of the ten\r\ntribes. There were two regular masters of the horse ([Greek:\r\n_hipparchoi_]), and a third appointed for the special command of the\r\nAthenian troops in Lemnos. The generals ([Greek: _strat_egoi_]) had\r\nvarious civil duties, among them the organization of the military\r\nprocessions at the Panathenaea and other great festivals.\r\n\r\n§ 27. _Menelaus_. Either a Macedonian chieftain, who had assisted the\r\nAthenian commander Timotheus against Poteidaea in 364, and probably\r\nreceived Athenian citizenship; or else Philip's half-brother Menelaus.\r\nBut there is no evidence that the latter ever served in the Athenian\r\nforces, and probably the former is meant.\r\n\r\n§ 31. _Etesian winds_. These blow strongly from the north over the\r\nAegean from July to September.\r\n\r\n§ 33. _the whole force in its entirety_. So with Butcher's punctuation.\r\nBut it is perhaps better to place a comma after [Greek: _dynamin_], and\r\ntranslate, 'after making ready ... soldiers, ships, cavalry--the entire\r\nforce complete--you bind them,' &c.\r\n\r\n§ 34. See Introd. to the Speech. Geraestus was the southernmost most\r\npoint of Euboea. The 'sacred trireme', the Paralus, when conveying the\r\nAthenian deputation to the Festival of Delos, put in on its way at\r\nMarathon, where there was an altar of the Delian Apollo, to offer\r\nsacrifice.\r\n\r\n§ 35. The festival of the Panathenaea was managed by the Athlothetae,\r\nwho were appointed by lot, and consequently could not be specially\r\nqualified; whereas the stewards ([Greek: _epimel_etai_]) who assisted\r\nthe Archon in the management of the Dionysia, were at this time\r\nelected, presumably on the ground of their fitness.\r\n\r\n_an amount of trouble_ ([Greek: _ochlon_]). Possibly 'a larger crowd'.\r\nBut there is no point in mentioning the crowd; the point lies in the\r\npains taken; and Thucyd. vi. 24 ([Greek: _upo tou ochl_odous t_es\r\nparhaskeu_es_]) confirms the rendering given.\r\n\r\n§ 36. The choregus paid the expenses of a chorus at the Dionysiac (and\r\ncertain other) festivals. The gymnasiarchs, or stewards of the games,\r\nmanaged the games and torch-races which formed part of the Panathenaea\r\nand many other festivals. The offices were imposed by law upon men who\r\npossessed a certain estate, but any one who felt that another could\r\nbear the burden better might challenge him either to perform the duty\r\nor to exchange property with him. (See Appendix to Goodwin's edition of\r\nDemosthenes' Speech against Meidias.)\r\n\r\n_independent freedmen_: lit. 'dwellers apart,' i.e. freedmen who no\r\nlonger lived with the master whose slaves they had been.\r\n\r\n§ 43. _empty ships_. If these are the ships referred to in Olynth. III,\r\nSection 4, the date of the First Philippic must be later than October\r\n351 B.C.\r\n\r\n§ 46. _promises_. The 'promises of Chares' became almost proverbial.\r\n\r\n§ 47. _examination_, or 'audit'. A general, like every other\r\nresponsible official, had to report his proceedings, at the end of his\r\nterm of office, to a Board of Auditors, and might be prosecuted before\r\na jury by any one who was dissatisfied with his report.\r\n\r\n§ 48. _negotiating with Sparta, &c_. As a matter of fact, Philip had\r\nevidently come to an understanding with Thebes by this time; but he may\r\nhave caused some such rumours to be spread, in order to get rid of any\r\npossible opposition from Sparta. The 'breaking-up of the free states'\r\nprobably refers to the desire of Sparta to destroy Megalopolis, which\r\nwas in alliance with Thebes.\r\n\r\n_sent ambassadors to the king_. Arrian, ii. 14, mentions a letter of\r\nDarius to Alexander, recalling how Philip had been in friendship and\r\nalliance with Artaxerxes Ochus. It is possible, therefore, that the\r\nrumour to which Demosthenes alludes had some foundation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST OLYNTHIAC\r\n\r\n(_Note_.--Most of the allusions in the Olynthiacs are explained by the\r\nIntroduction to the First Philippic.)\r\n\r\n§ 4. _power over everything, open or secret_. The translation generally\r\napproved, 'power to publish or conceal his designs,' is hardly\r\npossible. The [Greek: kai] in the phrase [Greek: rh_eta kai aporr_eta]\r\n(or [Greek: arr_eta]) cannot be taken disjunctively here, when it is\r\nalways conjunctive in this phrase elsewhere, the whole phrase being\r\nvirtually equivalent to 'everything whatever'.\r\n\r\n§ 5. _how he treated_, &c. The scholiast says that Philip killed the\r\ntraitors at Amphipolis first, saying that if they had not been faithful\r\nto their own countrymen, they were not likely to be faithful to\r\nhimself; and that the traitors at Pydna, finding that they were not\r\nlikely to be spared, took sanctuary, and having been persuaded to\r\nsurrender themselves on promise of their lives, were executed\r\nnevertheless. Neither story is confirmed by other evidence.\r\n\r\n§ 8. _in aid of the Euboeans_: in 358 or 357. See Speech for\r\nMegalopolitans, § 14 n.\r\n\r\n§ 13. _Magnesia_. There seems to have been a town of the same name as\r\nthe district.\r\n\r\n_attacked the Olynthians_. This refers to the short invasion of 351\r\n(see vol. i, p. 70), not to that which is the subject of the Olynthiacs.\r\n\r\n_Arybbas_ was King of the Molossi, and uncle of Philip's wife,\r\nOlympias. Nothing is known of this expedition against him. He was\r\ndeposed by Philip in 343. (See vol. ii, p. 3.)\r\n\r\n§ 17. _these towns_: the towns of the Chalcidic peninsula, over which\r\nOlynthus had acquired influence. This sentence shows that Olynthus\r\nitself had not yet been attacked.\r\n\r\n§ 26. _But, my good Sir_, &c. This must be the objection of an\r\nimaginary opponent. It can hardly be taken (as seems to be intended by\r\nButcher) as Demosthenes' reply to the question, 'Or some other power?'\r\n('But, my good Sir, the other power will not want to help him.') There\r\nis, however, much to be said for Sandys's punctuation, [Greek: _ean m_e\r\nbo_eth_es_eth umeis _e allos tis_], 'unless you or some other power go\r\nto their aid.' After the death of Onomarchus in 352, the Phocians were\r\nincapable of withstanding invasion without help.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND OLYNTHIAC\r\n\r\n§ 14. _Timotheus, &c_. In 364 an Athenian force under Timotheus invaded\r\nthe territory of the Olynthian League, and took Torone, Poteidaea, and\r\nother towns, with the help of Perdiccas, King of Macedonia.\r\n\r\n_ruling dynasty_: i.e. the dynasty of Lycophron and Peitholaus at\r\nPherae. (See Introd. to First Philippic.)\r\n\r\n§ 28. _this war_: i.e. the war with Philip generally. The reference is\r\nsupposed to be to the conduct of Chares in 356 (cf. Phil. I, Section 24\r\nii.), though in fact it was against the revolted allies, not against\r\nPhilip, that he had been sent. Sigeum was a favourite resort of Chares,\r\nand it is conjectured that he may have obtained possession of Lampsacus\r\nand Sigeum (both on the Asiatic shore of the Hellespont) in 356. The\r\nexplanation of the conduct of the generals is to be found in the fact\r\nthat in Asia Minor they could freely appropriate prizes of war and\r\nplunder, since under the terms of the Peace of Antalcidas, Athens could\r\nclaim nothing in Asia for her own.\r\n\r\n§ 29. _taxes by Boards_. Each of the Boards constituted in 378-377 for\r\nthe collection of the war-tax (see vol. i, p. 31) had a leader or\r\nchairman ([Greek: __hegem_on_]), one of the 300 richest men in Athens,\r\nwhose duty it was to advance the sums required by the State, recovering\r\nthem afterwards from the other members of the Boards. Probably the\r\nThree Hundred were divided equally among the 100 Boards, a leader, a\r\n'second', and a 'third' (Speech on Crown, § 103) being assigned to\r\neach. The 'general' here perhaps corresponds to the 'second'.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD OLYNTHIAC\r\n\r\n§ 4. _two or three years ago_ (lit. 'this is the third or fourth year\r\nsince). It was in November 352 B.C. If the present Speech was delivered\r\nbefore November 349, not quite three years would have elapsed. (The\r\nGreek words, [Greek: triton _he tetarton etos touti], must, on the\r\nanalogy of the Speech against Meidias, § 13, against Stephanus, II. §\r\n13, and against Aphobus, I. § 24, &c., mean 'two or three', not 'three\r\nor four years ago'). The vagueness of the expression is more likely to\r\nbe due to the date of the Third Olynthiac being not far short of three\r\nyears from that of the siege of Heraeon Teichos, than to the\r\ndouble-dating (on the one hand by actual lapse of time, and on the\r\nother by archon-years--from July to July--or by military campaigning\r\nseasons) which most commentators assume to be intended here, but which\r\nseems to me over-subtle and unlike Demosthenes.\r\n\r\n_that year_: i.e. the archonship of Aristodemus, which ran from July\r\n352 B.C. to July 351.\r\n\r\n§ 5. _the mysteries_. These were celebrated from the 14th to the 27th\r\nof Boedromion (late in September).\r\n\r\n_Charidemus_, of Oreus in Euboea, was a mercenary leader who had served\r\nmany masters at different times--Athens, Olynthus, Cotys, and\r\nCersobleptes--and had played most of them false at some time or other.\r\nBut he was given the citizenship in 357 for the part which he had taken\r\nin effecting the cession of the Chersonese to Athens, and was a\r\nfavourite with the people. He was sent on the occasion here referred to\r\nwith ten ships, for which he was to find mercenary soldiers.\r\n\r\n§ 6. _with might ... power_. A quotation, probably from the text of the\r\ntreaty of alliance between Athens and Olynthus.\r\n\r\n§ 8. _funds of the Phocians are exhausted_. The Phocian leader\r\nPhalaecus had been using the temple-treasures of Delphi, but they were\r\nnow exhausted.\r\n\r\n§ 10. _a Legislative Commission_: i.e. a Special Commission on the\r\nmodel of the regular Commission which was appointed annually from the\r\njurors for the year (if the Assembly so decreed), and before which\r\nthose who wished to make or to oppose changes in the laws appeared, the\r\nproceedings taking the form of a prosecution and defence of the laws in\r\nquestion. The Assembly itself did not legislate, though it passed\r\ndecrees, which had to be consistent with the existing laws. As regards\r\nlegislation, it merely decided whether in any given year alterations in\r\nthe laws should or should not be allowed.\r\n\r\n§ 11. _malingerers_. The scholiast says that the choregi were persuaded\r\nto choose persons as members of their choruses, in order to enable them\r\nto escape military service, choreutae being legally exempted. Other\r\nexemptions also existed.\r\n\r\n§ 12. _persons who proposed them_. This can only refer to Eubulus and\r\nhis party.\r\n\r\n§ 20. _Corinthians and Megareans_. From the pseudo-Demosthenic Speech\r\non the Constitution ([Greek: _pe_ri suntaxe_os_]) and from Philochorus\r\n(quoted in the Scholia of Didymus upon that Speech) it appears that the\r\nAthenians had in 350 invaded Megara, under the general Ephialtes, and\r\nforced the Megareans to agree to a delimitation of certain land sacred\r\nto the two goddesses of Eleusis, which the Megareans had violated,\r\nperhaps for some years past (see Speech against Aristocrates, § 212). A\r\nscholiast also refers to the omission by Corinth to invite the\r\nAthenians to the Isthmian games, in consequence of which the Athenians\r\nsent an armed force to attend the games. Probably this was also a\r\nrecent occurrence, and due to an understanding between Corinth and\r\nMegara.\r\n\r\n§ 21. _my own namesake_: i.e. Demosthenes, who was a distinguished\r\ngeneral during the Peloponnesian War, and perished in the Sicilian\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\n§ 24. _for forty-five years_: i.e. between the Persian and\r\nPeloponnesian Wars, 476-431 B.C.\r\n\r\n_the king_: i.e. Perdiccas II, who, however, took the side of Sparta\r\nshortly after the beginning of the Peloponnesian War. He died in 413.\r\n(The date of the beginning of his reign is unknown, but he did not\r\nbecome sole king of the whole of Macedonia until 436.)\r\n\r\n§ 27. _Spartans had been ruined_: sc. by the battles of Leuctra (in\r\n371) and Mantineia (in 362).\r\n\r\n_Thebans had their hands full_, owing to the war with the Phocians,\r\nfrom 356 onwards.\r\n\r\n§ 28. _in the war_, when Athens joined Thebes against Sparta (in 378).\r\n'The allies' are those members of the Second Delian League (formed in\r\n378) who had been lost in the Social War which ended in or about 355,\r\nwhen Athens was at peace with Thebes and Sparta. (See Introduction,\r\nvol. i, p. 9.)\r\n\r\n§ 31. _procession at the Boedromia_. The Boedromia was a festival held\r\nin September in honour of Apollo and Artemis Agrotera, Probably a\r\nprocession was not a regular part of the festival at this time. The\r\nimportance which the populace attached to such processions is\r\nillustrated by the Speech against Timocrates, § 161.\r\n\r\n§ 34. _is it then paid service, &c_.: almost, 'do you then suggest that\r\nwe should _earn_ our money?'\r\n\r\n§ 35. _adding or subtracting_: sc. from the sums dispensed by the State\r\nto the citizens.\r\n\r\n_somebody's mercenaries_. The reference is probably to the successes of\r\nCharidemus when first sent (see Introd. to Olynthiacs).\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE PEACE\r\n\r\n§ 5. _disturbances in Euboea_. Plutarchus of Eretria applied for\r\nAthenian aid against Callias of Chalcis, who was attacking him with the\r\naid of Macedonian troops. Demosthenes was strongly opposed to granting\r\nthe request, but it was supported by Eubulus and Meidias, and a force\r\nwas sent under Phocion, probably early in 348 (though the chronology\r\nhas been much debated, and some place the expedition in 350 or 349).\r\nOwing to the premature action or the treachery of Plutarchus at Tamynae\r\n(where the Athenian army was attacked), Phocion had some difficulty in\r\nwinning a victory. Plutarchus afterwards seized a number of Athenian\r\nsoldiers, and Athens had actually to ransom them. Phocion's successor,\r\nMolossus, was unsuccessful. When peace was made in the summer of 348,\r\nthe Euboeans became for the most part independent of Athens, and were\r\nregarded with ill-feeling by Athens for some years. There is no proof\r\nthat the proposers of the expedition were bribed, as Demosthenes\r\nalleges.\r\n\r\n§ 6. _Neoptolemus_. See Speech on Embassy, §§ 12, 315.\r\n\r\n§ 8. _public service_: i.e. as trierarch or choregus or gymnasiarch,\r\n&c. See n. on Phil. I. § 36.\r\n\r\n§ 10. _there were some_ : i.e. Aeschines and his colleagues. (See\r\nIntrod.)\r\n\r\n_Thespiae and Plataeae_. See Speech for Megalopolitans, Section 4 n.\r\n\r\n§ 14. _self-styled Amphictyons_. The Amphictyonic Council represented\r\nthe ancient Amphictyonic League of Hellenic tribes (now differing\r\nwidely in importance, but equally represented on the Council), and was\r\nsupreme in all matters affecting the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. (See\r\nn. on Speech on Crown, § 148.) The Council summoned by Philip was open\r\nto criticism (1) because only certain members of it were present, of\r\nwhom the Thebans and Thessalians were the chief, (2) because Philip had\r\nbeen given the vote of the dispossessed Phocians.\r\n\r\n§ 15. _however stupid, &c_. It had been conventional for over a century\r\nto apply this adjective to the Boeotians, and therefore to the Thebans.\r\nFor a more favourable view, see W. Rhys Roberts, _Ancient Boeotians_,\r\nchap. i.\r\n\r\n§ 16. _Oropus_. See Speech for Megalopolitans, § ii n.\r\n\r\n§ 18. _Argives, &c_. See Speech for Megalopolitans throughout (with\r\nIntrod.).\r\n\r\n_those whom they have exiled_: especially the refugees from Orchomenus\r\nand Coroneia. See vol. i, p. 124.\r\n\r\n_Phocian fugitives_. The Amphictyonic Council had recently declared\r\nthat these had been guilty of sacrilege, and might be seized wherever\r\nthey might be.\r\n\r\n§ 20. _all that they themselves had toiled for_: i.e. the conquest of\r\nthe Phocians in the Sacred War.\r\n\r\n§ 22. _some persons_: i.e. Aeschines and others who tried to excuse\r\nPhilip's treatment of the Phocians to the Athenian people.\r\n\r\n§ 23. _admission ... Delphi_. The Phocians had formerly contrived their\r\nexclusion from the Amphictyonic meeting and from the temple and oracle\r\nof Delphi. The Council now restored them, and excluded the Phocians.\r\n\r\n§ 24. _refuse to submit_: reading [Greek: (_oud) otioun upomeinai_.]\r\nThe insertion of [Greek: _oude_] (after Cobet) seems necessary, [Greek:\r\n_otioun upomeinai_] alone would mean 'face any risk', but this would be\r\ncontradicted by the next clause. To translate, 'who think that we\r\nshould face any risk, but do not see that the risk would be one of\r\nwar,' is to narrow the meaning of [Greek: _otioun_] unduly.\r\n\r\n§ 25. _Treaty of Peace_: i.e. the Peace of Philocrates.\r\n\r\n_Cardians_. The Athenians claimed Cardia (the key of the Chersonese on\r\nthe Thracian side) as an ally, though in fact it was expressly excluded\r\nfrom the towns ceded to Athens by Cersobleptes in 357, and had made\r\nalliance with Philip in 352.\r\n\r\n_prince of Caria_. See Speech for Rhodians (with Introd.).\r\n\r\n_drive our vessels to shore_: a regular form of ancient piracy (see\r\nSpeech on Chersonese, § 28). The Byzantines drove the Athenian\r\ncorn-ships into their own harbour. The victims were relieved of their\r\nmoney or their corn.\r\n\r\n_shadow at Delphi_: i.e. the empty privilege (as Demosthenes here\r\nchooses to represent it) of membership of the Amphictyonic League and\r\nCouncil, now claimed by Philip.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND PHILIPPIC\r\n\r\n§ 1. _sympathetic_: i.e. towards other Greek states, desirous of\r\nsecuring independence.\r\n\r\n§ 2. _Alexander_, &c. Alexander of Macedon was sent by Mardonius, the\r\nPersian commander, to offer Athens alliance with Persia on favourable\r\nterms. Demosthenes has confused the order of events, and speaks as if\r\nthis message was brought before the battle of Salamis. The Athenians\r\nleft the city twice, before the battle of Salamis and before that of\r\nPlataeae; it was after Salamis that Alexander was sent (Herod. viii.\r\n140, &c.).\r\n\r\n§ 14. _fortify Elateia_. This would be a menace to Thebes (cf. Speech\r\non the Crown, §§ 174, 175). Elateia commands the road from Thermopylae\r\nto Thebes.\r\n\r\n§ 19. _well-balanced_ ([Greek: _s_ophronousi_]), or 'free from\r\npassion', i.e. not liable to be carried away by ambition or cupidity as\r\nthe Thebans were. This is different from mere 'good sense' ([Greek:\r\n_syphronein, noun echea_]). For Theban 'stupidity', see Speech on\r\nPeace, § 15 (and n.).\r\n\r\n§ 22. _Council of Ten_ ([Greek: _dekadarchian_]). It is clear that some\r\nsort of oligarchical government, nominated by Philip, is referred to;\r\nbut the relation of this to the tetrarchies mentioned in the Speech on\r\nthe Chersonese, § 26, as established by Philip, is uncertain. These\r\ncorresponded to the four tribes or divisions of Thessaly (Thessaliotis,\r\nPhthiotis, Pelasgiotis, Histiaeotis); and this is confirmed by a\r\nstatement in Theopompus' forty-fourth book, to which Harpocration (s.v.\r\n[Greek: _dekadarchia_]) refers. Harpocration states that Philip did not\r\nestablish a decadarchy in Thessaly; and if he is right, then either (a)\r\nDemosthenes purposely used an inaccurate word, in order to suggest to\r\nthe Messenians the idea of a government like that of the Councils of\r\nTen established some sixty years before by Sparta in the towns subject\r\nto her; or (b) the text is wrong, and [Greek: _dekadarchian_] is a\r\nmisreading of [Greek: DARCHIAN], in which [Greek: D] was the numeral (=\r\n4), and the whole stood for [Greek: _tetrarchian_]. As to (a), it is\r\ndifficult to suppose that the Messenians would not know what had\r\nhappened in Thessaly so well that the innuendo would fall flat. There\r\nis no evidence that 'decadarchy' could be used simply as a synonym for\r\n'oligarchy'. As to (b), the supposed corruption is possible; but then\r\nwe are left with [Greek: _tetrarchian_] where we should expect [Greek:\r\n_tetrarchias_]: for there is no parallel to [Greek: _tetrarchia_]\r\n(sing.) in the sense of 'a system of tetrarchies'. It is, however,\r\nquite possible that Demosthenes was thinking especially of the\r\nThessalians of Pherae, and of the particular tetrarchy established over\r\nthem: and this seems on the whole the best solution. If, on the other\r\nhand, Harpocration is wrong, the reference here may be to a Council of\r\nTen, either established previously to the tetrarchies, and superseded\r\nby them, or else coexistent with and superior to them; in either case,\r\nsince the singular is used, this decadarchy must have been a single\r\ngovernment over the whole of Thessaly (or perhaps of the district about\r\nPherae only), not a number of Councils, one in each city or division of\r\nThessaly. (Theopompus' forty-fourth book probably dealt with 342 B.C.,\r\ntwo years after the present speech, though before the Speech on the\r\nChersonese; but we are not told that he assigned the establishment of\r\nthe tetrarchies to that year.)\r\n\r\n§ 25. _find yourselves slaves_: lit. 'find your master.'\r\n\r\n§ 28. _by yourselves_: i.e. in the absence of the ambassadors from\r\nPhilip and other States.\r\n\r\n_who conveyed the promises_: i.e. Ctesiphon, Aristodemus, and\r\nNeoptolemus (see Speech on Embassy, §§ 12, 94, 315, &c.): but\r\nDemosthenes has probably Aeschines also in view.\r\n\r\n§ 30. _water-drinker_. See Speech on Embassy, § 46.\r\n\r\n§ 32. _secure myself as good a hearing_. Most editions accept this\r\nrendering of [Greek: _emaut_o logon poi_es-o_]. But though [Greek:\r\n_logon didonai_] = 'grant a hearing,' and [Greek: _logon tychein_] =\r\n'get a hearing,' [Greek: _logon eaut_o poiein_] is strange for 'secure\r\noneself a hearing', and the passage regularly quoted from the Speech\r\nagainst Aristocrates, § 81, is not parallel, since [Greek: _tout_o_] in\r\nthat passage is not a reflexive pronoun, and [Greek: _logon pepoi_eke_]\r\nalmost = [Greek: _logon ded_oki_]. Possibly the text is corrupt, and we\r\nshould either read [Greek: _psogon_] (with H. Richards) or [Greek:\r\n_emautou_] ('make you take as much account of me as of my opponents').\r\n\r\n_further claim_: since an attack on the part of Demosthenes would\r\nincite them to make out a plausible case for Philip once more, and so\r\nearn his gratitude.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE EMBASSY\r\n\r\n[The literal translation of the title is 'On the misconduct as\r\nambassador'.]\r\n\r\n§ 1. _drawing your lots_. The jurors who were to serve in each trial\r\nwere selected by lot out of the total number of jurors for the year.\r\n\r\n§ 2. _one of those_: i.e. Timarchus (see Introd.).\r\n\r\n_supremacy_. The sovereignty of the people was exercised to a great\r\nextent through the law-courts, the jury being always large enough to be\r\nfairly representative of popular opinion, though probably there was\r\ngenerally a rather disproportionate preponderance of poorer men among\r\nthe jurors, the payment being insufficient to attract others. (See\r\nIntroduction, vol. i, pp. 18, 19, 23.)\r\n\r\n§ 11. _the Ten Thousand_: the General Assembly of the Arcadians at\r\nMegalopolis.\r\n\r\n§ 13. _he came to me_, &c. Aeschines denies this, saying that it would\r\nhave been absurd, when he knew that Demosthenes and Philocrates had\r\nacted together throughout (see Introd.).\r\n\r\n§ 16. _in the very presence_, &c.: contrast Speech on the Crown,\r\n\r\n§ 23 (and see n. there). Aeschines states that he was in fact replying\r\nto inflammatory speeches made by orators who pointed to the Propylaea,\r\nand appealed to the memory of ancestral exploits; and that he simply\r\nurged that it was possible for the Athenians to copy the wisdom of\r\ntheir forefathers without giving way to an unseasonable passion for\r\nstrife.\r\n\r\n§ 17. _had again acted_: i.e. as on the First Embassy, if the reading\r\nis correct (or perhaps, 'had committed a fresh series of wrongful\r\nacts'). But possibly [Greek: _peprhakot_on_] is right, 'had sold fresh\r\nconcessions' to Philip.\r\n\r\n§ 20. Aeschines replies that every one expected Philip to turn against\r\nThebes; and that for the rest, he was only reporting the gossip of the\r\nMacedonian camp, where the representatives of many states were gathered\r\ntogether, and not making promises at all. It is noteworthy, however,\r\nthat in the Speech on the Peace, § 10, shortly after the events in\r\nquestion, when the speeches made would be fresh in every one's memory,\r\nDemosthenes gives the same account of his opponent's assertions; and\r\nAeschines probably said something very like what is attributed to him.\r\n\r\n§ 21. _debt due to the god_: i.e. the value of the Temple-treasure of\r\nDelphi, which the Phocians had plundered.\r\n\r\n§ 30. _for however contemptible_, &c. The argument seems to be this.\r\n'You must not say that a man like Aeschines could not have brought\r\nabout such vast results. Athens may employ inferior men, but any one\r\nwho represents Athens has to deal with great affairs, and so his acts\r\nmay have great consequences. And again, although it may have been\r\nPhilip who actually ruined the Phocians, and although Aeschines could\r\nnever have done it alone, still he did his best to help.'\r\n\r\n§ 31. _the Town Hall_, or Prytaneum, where the Prytanes (the acting\r\nCommittee of the Council) met, and other magistrates had their offices.\r\n\r\n_Timagoras_ was accused (according to Xenophon) by his colleague Leon\r\nof having conspired with Pelopidas of Thebes against the interests of\r\nAthens, when on a mission to the court of Artaxerxes in 357. In § 137\r\nDemosthenes also states that he received large sums of money from\r\nArtaxerxes.\r\n\r\n§ 36. Aeschines denies that he wrote the letter for Philip, and his\r\ndenial is fairly convincing.\r\n\r\n§ 40. _a talent_. According to Aristotle (_Eth. Nic_. v. 7) the\r\nconventional amount payable as ransom was one mina per head. But from §\r\n169 it appears that the Macedonians sometimes asked for more than this.\r\n\r\n_laudable ambition_: i.e. to get credit for having thought of the\r\nransom of the prisoners.\r\n\r\n§ 47. _handed in_: either to the Clerk or to the Proedroi (the\r\ncommittee of Chairmen of the Assembly).\r\n\r\n§ 51. Aeschines states that Philip's invitation was declined because it\r\nwas suggested that Philip would keep the soldiers sent as hostages.\r\n\r\n§ 65. _on our way to Delphi_. Demosthenes had been one of the Athenian\r\nrepresentatives at the meeting of the Amphictyonic Council at Delphi\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\n_gave its vote_, &c. After the battle of Aegospotami at the end of the\r\nPeloponnesian War, the representative of Thebes proposed to the\r\nSpartans and their allies that Athens should be destroyed and its\r\ninhabitants sold into slavery.\r\n\r\n§ 70. _read this law over_: i.e. that the herald might proclaim it\r\nafter him.\r\n\r\n§ 72. For the Spartans see § 76. The Phocians had treated the Athenians\r\nbadly when Proxenus was sent to Thermopylae (see Introd. to Speech on\r\nPeace). Hegesippus may have opposed the acceptance of Philip's\r\ninvitation to the Athenians to join him. Aeschines (on the Embassy, §§\r\n137, 138) mentions no names in connexion with the refusal, but\r\nrepresents it as the sacrifice of a unique opportunity of saving the\r\nPhocians (cf. § 51 n.).\r\n\r\n§ 76. _deceit and cunning, and of nothing else_ ([Greek: _pasa\r\napat_e_]). The argument is, 'Aeschines will try to allege wrongful acts\r\non the part of the Phocians; but there was no time for such acts in the\r\nfive days; and this proves that there were no such acts to justify\r\ntheir ruin, and that their overthrow was due to nothing but trickery.'\r\nThis is better than to translate '_every kind of_ deceit and trickery\r\nwas concocted for the ruin of the Phocians'; for this is not the point,\r\nnor is it what would be inferred from the fact that there was only a\r\nfive-days' interval between the speech of Aeschines and the\r\ncapitulation of the Phocians. There is no need to emend to [Greek: _h_e\r\npasa apat_e_].\r\n\r\n_on account of the Peace_: i.e. of the negotiations for the Peace,\r\nbefore it was finally arranged.\r\n\r\n_all that they wished_: viz. the restoration of the Temple of Delphi to\r\ntheir kinsmen, the Dorians of Mount Parnassus.\r\n\r\n§ 78. _four whole months_: in reality, three months and a few days.\r\n\r\n§ 81. _Phocian people_: i.e. those who were left in Phocis, as distinct\r\nfrom the exiles just referred to.\r\n\r\n§ 86. _of Diophantus_. In 352, when Philip had been repulsed by\r\nOnomarchus, Diophantus proposed that public thanksgivings should be\r\nheld (see Introd. to First Philippic).\r\n\r\n_of Callisthenes_: in 346, after the Phocians had surrendered to Philip.\r\n\r\n_the sacrifice to Heracles_: perhaps one of the two festivals which\r\nwere respectively held at Marathon and at Cynosarges.\r\n\r\n§ 99. _constitutional_: lit. 'an excuse for a citizen,' under a\r\nconstitution by which no one was compelled to enter public life, and\r\nany one who did so without the requisite capacity had to take the\r\nresponsibility for his errors.\r\n\r\n§ 103. _impeached_. An impeachment was brought before the Council (or,\r\nmore rarely, the Assembly). The procedure was only applied to cases of\r\nextraordinary gravity, and particularly to what would now be called\r\ncases of treason.\r\n\r\n§ 114. _by torture_. The evidence of slaves might be given under\r\ntorture, in response to a challenge from one or other of the parties to\r\na suit. The most diverse opinions as to the value of such evidence are\r\nexpressed by the orators, according to the requirements of their case.\r\nThe consent of both sides was necessary; and in a very large number of\r\ncases, one side or the other appears to have refused to allow evidence\r\nto be taken in this way.\r\n\r\n_was going_: i.e. to Philip.\r\n\r\n§ 118. _accept his discharge_. There seems to be a play on two senses\r\nof the verb [Greek: aphienai], viz. 'to discharge from the obligations\r\nof a contract', and 'to acquit'.\r\n\r\n§ 120. _Why, this is the finest_, &c. The expression ([Greek: touto gar\r\nesti to lamprhon]) recurs in § 279, a closely parallel passage, and\r\nneed not be regarded as an interpolation in either case. The\r\ninterpretation given seems slightly preferable, and is approved by\r\nWeil. It is almost equally possible to translate the Greek by 'such is\r\nthe brilliant defence which he offers'; but perhaps this does not suit\r\n§ 279 so well.\r\n\r\n_stand up_. Apparently Aeschines declined the invitation, which was\r\nquite within the custom of the Athenian courts. Either of the principal\r\nparties could ask the other questions, and have the answers taken down\r\nas evidence.\r\n\r\n_cases that have all_, &c. The reference is to the prosecution of\r\nTimarchus, when advanced in age, for offences committed in early youth.\r\nThere may also be an allusion to Aeschines' early career as an actor.\r\n\r\n§ 122. _declined on oath_. An elected official could refuse to serve,\r\nif he took an oath that there was some good reason (such as illness)\r\nfor excusing him.\r\n\r\n§ 126. _though not elected_. Aeschines (on the Embassy, § 94) replies\r\nthat in fact the commission was renewed at a second meeting of the\r\nAssembly, and that he was then well enough to go and was elected. (That\r\nthere was a second election of ambassadors is confirmed by Demosthenes'\r\nown statement in § 172 of the present speech, that he himself was twice\r\nelected and twice refused to serve.)\r\n\r\n§ 128. _Thesmothetae_: the six archons who did not hold the special\r\noffices of archon eponymus, polemarch, or king archon.\r\n\r\n_Aeschines went_, &c. To have refused to be present would really have\r\nbeen to make a political demonstration against Thebes, which would have\r\nhad perilous results. Aeschines defends himself on the ground that in\r\nhis view the Peace was no disadvantage to Athens, so that he might well\r\njoin in the honours paid to the Gods.\r\n\r\n§ 129. _Metroon_. The temple of the Great Mother (Cybele), which was\r\nthe Athenian record-office.\r\n\r\n_the name of Aeschines_: i.e. its removal from the list of ambassadors.\r\n\r\n§ 131. _in their interest_. If the words are not corrupt, the meaning\r\nis probably 'in the interest of Philip and the Thebans'; or possibly,\r\n'in reference to these matters.'\r\n\r\n§ 136. _as his informant_. The text is possibly corrupt, though as it\r\nstands it might perhaps bear the meaning given, if [Greek: hyparchei]\r\nwere understood with [Greek: autos]. Others (with or without\r\nemendation) take the sense to be 'to manage his business ... just as he\r\nwould manage it in person '.\r\n\r\n§ 137. For Timagoras see § 31 n.\r\n\r\n§ 144. _summon Philip's envoys_: i.e. in order to report the decision\r\nof the Assembly, and so close the matter.\r\n\r\n§ 147. _ask him whether_, &c. The argument seems to be this 'if\r\nAeschines was the ambassador of a city which had been victorious\r\nagainst Philip, the latter would naturally wish to buy easy terms of\r\npeace; and Aeschines might undertake to procure such terms, without\r\ncommitting a particularly heinous offence, since he would only be\r\ngetting some advantage for himself out of the general good fortune of\r\nhis country. But to secure advantages for himself at his country's\r\nexpense, when his country was already suffering disaster, would be far\r\nworse. And as Aeschines complains that the generals had incurred\r\ndisaster, he convicts himself of the worse offence.'\r\n\r\n§ 148. The _Tilphossaeum_ was apparently a mountain near Lake Copais in\r\nBoeotia. The town which Strabo calls Tilphusium may have been on the\r\nmountain. Neones, or Neon, was a Phocian village; Hedyleion, a mountain\r\nin Boeotia.\r\n\r\n§ 149. _Ah! he will say_, &c. Either the words are interpolated, or\r\nthere is a lacuna. The objection is nowhere refuted.\r\n\r\n§ 156. Doriscus, &c. The places mentioned did not really belong to\r\nAthens, but to Cersobleptes, who was being assisted by Athenian troops,\r\nso that, strictly speaking, Philip was within his rights; and in fact\r\n(according to Aeschines), Cersobleptes and the Sacred Mountain were\r\ntaken by Philip the day before the Athenians and their allies swore to\r\nthe Peace at Athens.\r\n\r\n§ 162. _Eucleides_ had been sent to protest against Philip's attack\r\nupon Cersobleptes in 346 (see vol. i, p. 122). Philip replied that he\r\nhad not yet been officially informed by the Athenian ambassadors of the\r\nconclusion of the Peace, and was therefore not yet bound by it.\r\n\r\n§ 166. _procure their ransom_: i.e. from the various Macedonians who\r\nhad captured them, or to whom they had been given or sold.\r\n\r\n§ 176. _committed to writing_, &c. Formal evidence (as distinct from\r\nthe mere assertions of a speaker) was written down, and the witness was\r\nasked to swear to it. A witness who was called upon might swear that he\r\nhad no knowledge of the matter in question ([Greek: _exomnysthai_]). By\r\nwriting down his evidence and swearing to it, Demosthenes took the risk\r\nof prosecution for perjury.\r\n\r\n§ 180. _might be proved in countless ways_: or 'would need a speech of\r\ninfinite length '. But as [Greek: _kai_] and not [Greek: _de_] follows,\r\nI slightly prefer the former rendering. (The latter is supported by the\r\nThird Philippic, § 60, but there the next clause is connected by\r\n[Greek: _de_].)\r\n\r\n_Ergophilus_ was heavily fined in 362 (see Speech against Aristocrates,\r\n§ 104); Cephisodotus in 358 (ibid. § 167, and Aeschines against\r\nCtesiphon, § 52); Timomachus went into exile in 360 to escape\r\ncondemnation (against Aristocrates, § 115, &c.). Ergocles was perhaps\r\nthe friend of Thrasybulas (see Lysias, Orations xxviii, xxix), and may\r\nhave been condemned for his conduct in Thrace, as well as for\r\nmalversation at Halicarnassus. Dionysius is unknown.\r\n\r\n§ 187. _has got beyond_, &c.: an ironical way of saying that he has so\r\nmuch overdone his application to himself of the title of (prospective)\r\n'benefactor' of Athens, that another word (e.g. 'deceiver') would be\r\nmore appropriate. The word [Greek: _psychrhon_] is (at least by Greek\r\nliterary critics) applied to strong expressions out of place, and here\r\nalso, probably, of an exaggerated phrase which falls flat. This is\r\nperhaps the best interpretation of a very difficult passage.\r\n\r\n§ 191. For Timagoras, see § 31 n. Tharrex and Smicythus are unknown.\r\nAdeimantus was one of the generals at Aegospotami, the only Athenian\r\nprisoner spared by Lysander, and on that account suspected of treason\r\nby the Athenians, and prosecuted by Conon (called 'the elder', to\r\ndistinguish him from his grandson, who was a contemporary of\r\nDemosthenes).\r\n\r\n§ 194. guest-friend. The term ([Greek: xenos]) was applied to the\r\nrelationship (more formal than that of simple friendship) between\r\ncitizens of different states, who were bound together by ties of\r\nhospitality and mutual goodwill.\r\n\r\n§ 196. _the Thirty_: i.e. the 'Thirty Tyrants' who ruled Athens (with\r\nthe support of Sparta) for a few months in 403. See n. on § 277.\r\n\r\n§ 198. Aeschines warmly denies this story. He says that Demosthenes\r\ntried to bribe Aristophanes of Olynthus to swear that it was true, and\r\nthat the woman was his own wife. He adds that the jury, on an appeal\r\nfrom Eubulus, refused to let Demosthenes complete the story.\r\n\r\n§ 199. _initiations_: see Speech on Crown, §§ 259 ff., with notes.\r\n\r\n§ 200. _played the rogue_. The scholiast says that clerks were\r\nsometimes bribed to alter the laws and decrees which they read to the\r\nCourt; and a magistrates' clerk had doubtless plenty of opportunities\r\nfor conniving at petty frauds.\r\n\r\n§ 204. _should not have been sworn to_. This is out of chronological\r\norder as it stands, and emendations have been proposed, but\r\nunnecessarily.\r\n\r\n§ 209. _would not have him for your representative_: in the question\r\nabout Athenian rights at Delos. See Introduction to the Speech.\r\n\r\n§ 213. _I have no further time, &c_.: lit. 'no one will pour water for\r\nme' into the water-clock, by which all trials were regulated.\r\n\r\n§ 221. _consider_, &c. There is an anacoluthon in the Greek, which may\r\nbe literally translated, 'Consider, if, where I who am absolutely\r\nguiltless was afraid of being ruined by them--what ought these men\r\nthemselves, the actual criminals, to suffer?'\r\n\r\n§ 222. _get money out of you_: i.e. to be bought off.\r\n\r\n§ 230. _choregus and trierarch_: see Introd. to Speech on Naval Boards,\r\nand n. on Philippic I. § 36.\r\n\r\n§ 231. _all was well_ ([Greek: eupenespai]). The reading is almost\r\ncertainly wrong. Weil rightly demands some word contrasting with\r\n[Greek: agnoein] ('did not understand his country') in the\r\ncorresponding clause.\r\n\r\n§ 237. _vase-cases_: i.e. boxes to contain bottles of oil or perfume\r\nfor toilet use.\r\n\r\n§ 245. _the cock-pit_. That this is the meaning seems to be proved by\r\nthe words of Aeschines (against Timarchus, § 53); otherwise the natural\r\ntranslation would be 'to the bird-market'. Cocks were no doubt sold in\r\nthe bird-market; but Aeschines refers directly to cock-fighting, not to\r\nthe purchase of the birds.\r\n\r\n§ 246. _hack-writers_: lit. 'speech-writers,' who composed speeches for\r\nlitigants, and no doubt padded them out with quotations from poets, as\r\nwell as with rhetorical commonplaces. Demosthenes taunts Aeschines\r\nparticularly with ransacking unfamiliar plays, instead of those he knew\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n§ 249. _reared up... greatness_: or possibly, 'reared up all these sons\r\nof hers.'\r\n\r\n_Hero-Physician_. See Speech on the Crown, § 129 n.\r\n\r\n_Round Chamber_, in the Prytaneum or Town Hall (see § 31 n.).\r\n\r\n§ 252. _at the risk of his own life_. He tried to avoid the risk by\r\nfeigning madness. Salamis was in the hands of the Megareans, and the\r\nAthenians had become so weary of their unsuccessful attempts to recover\r\nit, that they decreed the penalty of death upon any one who proposed to\r\nmake a fresh attempt. The verses, however, which are quoted in the\r\ntext, are probably derived not from the poem which Solon composed for\r\nthis purpose, but from another of his political poems.\r\n\r\n§ 255. _with a cap on your head_. Plutarch (Solon 82 c) says that\r\n'Solon burst into the market-place suddenly, with a cap on his head'.\r\nThe cap was intended to suggest that he had just returned from Salamis,\r\nsince it was the custom to wear a cap only when on a journey, or in\r\ncase of illness (of. Plato, _Republic_, iii. 406_d_). There may\r\npossibly be an allusion also to Aeschines' own alleged sickness (§ 136\r\nabove), but this is very doubtful. The words more probably mean,\r\n'however closely you copy Solon' (as you copied his attitude in\r\nspeaking), 'when you run about declaiming against me.'\r\n\r\n§ 257. _accepted the challenge_. At the examination before the Board of\r\nAuditors (Logistae) the question was almost certainly put, whether any\r\none present wished to challenge the report of the ambassador under\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n§ 259. _claim_ ([Greek: axioumenoi]): or, 'are thought worthy'; but the\r\nfirst sense is much better in the parallel passage in § 295, and this\r\n'middle' use seems to be sufficiently attested, though the active voice\r\nis used in the same sense in § 338.\r\n\r\n§ 260. _paramount position_: i.e. among the tribes of North Greece\r\n(Magnetes, Perrhaebi, &c.).\r\n\r\n§ 264. _concluded the war, &c_. In 383 B.C. In fact, however, they only\r\nobtained peace by joining the Spartan alliance.\r\n\r\n§ 271. _Arthmius_: see Philippic III. § 42 (and note).\r\n\r\n§ 273. _Callias_, in 444 B.C. Cf. Speech for the Rhodians, § 29. The\r\nChelidonian Islands lay off the south coast of Lycia, the Cyanean rocks\r\nat the northern mouth of the Bosporus.\r\n\r\n§ 277. _Epicrates_ was sent as ambassador to Persia early in the fourth\r\ncentury, and received large presents. According to Plutarch he escaped\r\ncondemnation; but he may have been tried more than once. The comic\r\npoets make fun of his long beard.\r\n\r\n_who brought the people back from the Peiraeus_. Thrasybulus occupied\r\nthe Peiraeus in 403, secured the expulsion of the Thirty Tyrants from\r\nAthens, and restored the democracy.\r\n\r\n§ 278. _the decree_: i.e. the decree by which Epicrates and his\r\ncolleagues were condemned.\r\n\r\n§ 279. _for this is the splendid thing_: cf. § 120 n.\r\n\r\n§ 280. _exiled_ and _punished_. We should perhaps (with Weil) read\r\n[Greek: _e] ('or') for [Greek: kai] ('and').\r\n\r\n_descendant of Harmodius_: i.e. Proxenus, who had been only recently\r\ncondemned, and is therefore not named.\r\n\r\n§ 281. _another priestess_. According to the scholiast, the reference\r\nis to Ninus, a priestess of Sabazios, who was prosecuted by Menecles\r\nfor making love-potions for young men. The connexion of this offence\r\nwith the meetings of the initiated is left to be understood.\r\n\r\n§ 282. _the burden undertaken_. Such burdens as the duties of choregus,\r\ntrierarch, &c., might be voluntarily undertaken, as they were by\r\nDemosthenes (see n. on Philippic I. § 36).\r\n\r\n§ 287. _Cyrebion_, or 'Light-as-Chaff', was the nickname of Epicrates,\r\nAeschines' brother-in-law (not the Epicrates of § 277). _as a\r\nreveller_, no doubt in some Dionysiac revel, in which it was not\r\nconsidered decent to take part without a mask. (The original purpose of\r\nmasks, however, was not to conceal one's identity from motives of\r\nshame, though Demosthenes suggests it as a motive here.)\r\n\r\n_were water flowing upstream_. A half-proverbial expression implying\r\nthat the world was being turned upside-down, when such a person could\r\nprosecute for such offences.\r\n\r\n§ 290. _Hegesilaus_ was one of the generals sent to Euboea to help\r\nPlutarchus; cf. Speech on the Peace, § 5 n. He was accused of abetting\r\nPlutarchus in the deception which he practised upon Athens. For\r\nThrasybulus, cf. § 277.\r\n\r\n_the primary question_: i.e. of the guilt or innocence of the\r\ndefendant. If he was pronounced guilty, the question of sentence (or\r\ndamages) had to be argued and decided separately.\r\n\r\n§ 295. _claim to be_: cf. n. on § 259.\r\n\r\n_churning the butter_ ([Greek: etyrheue]): i.e. concocting the plot.\r\n(For the metaphor cf. Aristophanes, _Knights_ 479.)\r\n\r\n§ 299. _Zeus and Dione_. These names show that the oracles referred to\r\nwere probably given at Dodona.\r\n\r\n§ 303. _oath of the young soldiers_. When the young Athenian came of\r\nage, he received a shield and spear in the temple of Aglaurus, and\r\nswore to defend his country and to uphold its constitution (cf.\r\nLycurgus, _Against Leocrates_, § 76).\r\n\r\n§ 314. _keeping step with Pythocles_, who was a tall man, while\r\nAeschines was short.\r\n\r\n§ 326. _Drymus and Panactum_ were on the border between Boeotia and\r\nAttica. Nothing else is known of the expedition.\r\n\r\n§ 332. _Chares_. See nn. on Philippic I. §§ 24, 46; Olynthiac II. § 28,\r\nand Introductions.\r\n\r\n§ 333. _of one of whom_, &c.: i.e. of Philip (see § 111 ff., and\r\nIntrod. to Speech on the Peace).\r\n\r\n§ 342. _Euthycrates_. See Introd. to Olynthiacs.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE CHERSONESE\r\n\r\n§ 9. The argument is, 'if Philip is not committing hostilities so long\r\nas he keeps away from Attica, Diopeithes is not doing so, so long as he\r\nkeeps away from Macedonia, and only operates in Thrace.'\r\n\r\n_drive the vessels_, &c. See Speech on the Peace, § 25 n.\r\n\r\n§ 14. _passing the time_: i.e. until a convenient season for an attack\r\narrives.\r\n\r\n_those who are on the spot_: i.e. in Thrace, and who had doubtless sent\r\nmessages to Athens. Others think that the words mean 'those who are\r\nhere from Thrace'.\r\n\r\n_Etesian winds_. See First Philippic, § 31 n.\r\n\r\n_infatuation_: i.e. hostility to Athens.\r\n\r\n§ 16. _punish the settlers_: i.e. those who were sent with Diopeithes\r\nand demanded admission to Cardia.\r\n\r\n§ 18. _Chalcis_, in Euboea (see Introd.).\r\n\r\n§ 21. _keep our hands ... revenues_: a reference to the distributions\r\nof Festival-Money (see Third Olynthiac, with Introduction and notes).\r\n\r\n_contributions of the allies_. This interpretation seems on the whole\r\nbetter warranted than 'contributions promised to Diopeithes'.\r\n\r\n§ 24. _I consent to any penalty_: lit. *'I assess my own penalty at\r\nanything'--a metaphor from the practice of the law-courts, which\r\nallowed a convicted prisoner to propose an alternative penalty to that\r\nsuggested by the prosecutor.\r\n\r\n_Erythraeans_: Erythrae was on the coast of Asia Minor, opposite Chios.\r\n\r\n§ 25. _benevolences_: the same word as was used of the forced\r\ncontributions levied by English kings.\r\n\r\n§ 27. _surrendering_: i.e. to his soldiers, to be plundered (if the\r\nphrase is meant to convey anything but a vague accusation).\r\n\r\n§ 28. _wax-tablet_: i.e. a summons.\r\n\r\n_so many ships_. The critics of Diopeithes must have proposed the\r\nsending of a definite force to control him.\r\n\r\n§ 29. _a dispatch-boat_: lit. 'the _Paralus_'. This ship, and the\r\n_Salaminia_, were the two vessels regularly employed on public errands.\r\n\r\n_spitefulness_: i.e. towards Diopeithes.\r\n\r\n§ 30. _Chares_: see references in n. on Speech on Embassy, § 332.\r\n\r\n_Aristophon_. The reference may be to his conduct as general in the\r\nearly days of the war with Philip about Amphipolis. His activity as a\r\nstatesman began as far back as 403, and he was one of the most\r\ninfluential politicians in Athens from about 361 to 354.\r\n\r\n§ 31. _losing something_: _sc_. a scapegoat whom you could punish.\r\n\r\n§ 40. _Euthycrates_, &c. See Introd. to Olynthiacs.\r\n\r\n§ 44. _wretched hamlets_ ([Greek: kak_on]): lit. 'evils' or 'miseries';\r\nbut the word is possibly corrupt. (The original reading may possibly\r\nhave been [Greek: kalyb_on].) According to the scholiast, Drongilum and\r\nCabyle are near Amphipolis and the Strymon; but others assign different\r\nlocalities to them. Masteira is quite unknown.\r\n\r\n§ 45. _pit of destruction_ ([Greek: barhathrh_o]). This was literally\r\nthe pit into which the bodies of condemned criminals were thrown at\r\nAthens.\r\n\r\n_silos_: underground store-houses for grain, such as were found in Ceos\r\nnot many years ago, and may still be in use.\r\n\r\n§ 46. _irremediable_ ([Greek: an_ekeston]). The reading of two good\r\nmanuscripts [Greek: aneikaston] (otherwise only known as a late Greek\r\nword) may be correct. If so, it may mean 'unparalleled', or\r\n'inexplicable'.\r\n\r\n§ 57. The meaning is, that by denouncing those who propose active\r\nmeasures now, they are preparing the way in order to prosecute them so\r\nsoon as you find the war burdensome; whereas they should themselves be\r\nprosecuted for letting things go as far as they have gone.\r\n\r\n§ 59. _Oreus_. See Introd.\r\n\r\n_Pheraeans_, in 344. See Introd. to Second Philippic; and cf. Third\r\nPhilippic, § 12.\r\n\r\n_compromise_. Slavery seems to be ironically regarded as a compromise\r\nbetween activity and quiescence.\r\n\r\n§ 63. _robbed of at an earlier period_. The sense must either be this,\r\nor else 'all that you have lost in open war '. In either case\r\nemendation is required.\r\n\r\n§ 70. _trierarch and choregus_. Demosthenes was choregus in 348, and\r\ntrierarch in 363, 359, and 357.\r\n\r\n§ 74. _Timotheus_: in 358, when Athens liberated Euboea from the\r\nThebans. Cf. First Philippic, § 17, First Olynthiac, § 8. The effect of\r\nTimotheus' speech was such that the expedition started within three\r\ndays. (Speech against Androtion, § 14.)\r\n\r\n§ 75. _best counsel that he can_. The text is probably corrupt; but\r\nthis was probably the sense of the original.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD PHILIPPIC\r\n\r\n§ 2. _actively at work_: the reference is to Diopeithes (see Speech on\r\nChersonese, § 57).\r\n\r\n§§ 4, 5. Passages are repeated from the Speech on the Chersonese, § 4,\r\nand First Philippic, § 2.\r\n\r\n§ 8. _not to defraud us_: i.e. by making statements which he is not\r\nprepared to act upon.\r\n\r\n§ 11. _as though visiting his allies_. This is not true, though envoys\r\nfrom the Phocians, as from most other Greek states of importance, were\r\nin Philip's camp. With the whole passage, cf. Speech on Embassy, §§ 20\r\nff.\r\n\r\n§ 12. _Pherae_. See Speech on Chersonese, § 59 n. For Oreus see Introd.\r\nto Speech on Chersonese, and § 33 and 59 ff. of this Speech.\r\n\r\n§ 15. _Serrhium, &c_. See Introd. to Speech on Peace.\r\n\r\n_he had sworn to a Peace_. This is untrue; see Speech on Embassy, §\r\n156, where it is part of the charge against Aeschines' party, that they\r\nhad enabled Philip to take these places _before_ he had sworn to the\r\nPeace.\r\n\r\n§16. _religion_: with special reference here to the sanctity of the\r\noath.\r\n\r\n_into the Chersonese_: i.e. to help Cardia. The claim of Athens to\r\nCardia was not good, and it appears from the Speech of Hegesippus\r\nagainst Halonnesus, § 2, that the Athenians had recognized the\r\nindependence of the town.\r\n\r\n§ 18. _if anything should happen_: e.g. the outbreak of open war, or\r\n(more probably) a defeat.\r\n\r\n§ 23. _seventy-three years_: i.e. 476-404 B. c.\r\n\r\n_thirty years save one_: i.e. 404-376 B.C. (in the latter year Chabrias\r\ndefeated the Spartans off Naxos).\r\n\r\n_battle of Leucira_: in 371 B.C.\r\n\r\n§ 24. _disturb the established order_: i.e. by establishing\r\noligarchical governments in place of democracy.\r\n\r\n§ 26. _in the Thracian region_: strictly, in Chalcidice and the\r\nneighbourhood. See Introd. to Olynthiacs.\r\n\r\n_robbed their very cities of their governments_. This is preferable to\r\nthe (grammatically) equally possible rendering, 'robbed them of their\r\nconstitutions and their cities,' as it suits the facts better. Philip\r\nseems to have substituted tetrarchies for separate city-states. (See\r\nSpeech on Chersonese, §26, and Second Philippic, § 22 n.)\r\n\r\n§ 27. _Ambracia_. See Introd. to Speech on Chersonese. _Elis_: Introd.\r\nto Speech on Embassy. _Megara_: Speech on Embassy, §§ 294, 295.\r\n\r\n§ 32. _Pythian games_. See Introd. to Speech on Peace. In 342 Philip\r\nsent a deputy to preside in his name.\r\n\r\n§§ 33, 34. See Introd. to Speech on Chersonese. Echinus was a Theban\r\ncolony in Thessaly, on the north coast of the Malian Gulf.\r\n\r\n§ 42. _Arthmius_, &c. (cf. Speech on Embassy, §271). Zeleia was in the\r\nTroad, near Cyzicus. Arthmius was apparently proxenus of Athens at\r\nZeleia, and as such had probably certain rights at Athens, of which the\r\ndecree deprived him; so that Demosthenes' remarks at the beginning of\r\n§44 are slightly misleading.\r\n\r\n§ 46. At the end of this section two versions are imperfectly blended,\r\nand it does not appear what were the contents of the document. Some\r\nsuppose that the insertion 'He reads from the document' is an early\r\nconjectural interpolation.\r\n\r\n§ 49. _because be leads_, &c. Philip did, in fact, bring the Macedonian\r\nheavy infantry to great perfection for the purposes of a pitched\r\nbattle, though the decisive action was generally that of the cavalry.\r\nBut the other troops which Demosthenes names would enable him to\r\nexecute rapid movements with success. The use of light-armed troops had\r\nalready been developed by the Athenian general, Iphicrates.\r\n\r\n§ 50. _with such advantages_: lit. 'under these conditions' (_not_ 'to\r\ncrown all', nor 'at the head of these troops').\r\n\r\n§ 52. Contrast Speech on Naval Boards, Section 9.\r\n\r\n§§ 57 ff. See Introd. to Speech on Embassy.\r\n\r\n§ 59. Euphraeus had been a disciple of Plato, and an adviser of\r\nPerdiccas, Philip's elder brother. It was he who recommended Perdiccas\r\nto entrust the government of part of Macedonia to Philip, whom he\r\nafterwards so strongly opposed.\r\n\r\n§ 72. _embassies_. See Introd. to Speech on Chersonese.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE CROWN\r\n\r\n§ 1. _to take counsel_, &c. Aeschines had asked the jury to refuse\r\nDemosthenes a hearing, or at least to require him to follow the same\r\norder of treatment as himself.\r\n\r\n§ 3. _unpleasant_. Many render [Greek: duocheres] 'inauspicious',\r\n'ill-omened'; but as we do not know exactly what was in Demosthenes'\r\nmind, it is better not to give the word a meaning which it does not\r\nbear elsewhere. It may, however, mean 'vexatious'.\r\n\r\n§ 11. _knave as you are_, &c. The assonance of the original might\r\nperhaps be partly reproduced by rendering 'evil-minded as you are, it\r\nwas yet a very simple-minded idea that your mind conceived', &c.\r\n\r\n§ 12. _it does not enable the State_: lit. 'it is not possible for the\r\nState.' The point is that the prosecution of Ctesiphon, while\r\nexpressing the malice of Aeschines towards Demosthenes, does not enable\r\nthe State to punish Demosthenes himself for his alleged offences, since\r\nany penalty inflicted would fall on Ctesiphon.\r\n\r\n§ 13. _to debar another_, &c. This probably refers to the attempt to\r\ndeprive Demosthenes of a hearing, not (as some have thought) to the\r\nattempt to get so heavy a fine inflicted upon Ctesiphon that he would\r\nbe unable to pay it, and would therefore lose his rights as a citizen.\r\n\r\n§ 17. _ascribed to me_, &c. Aeschines was anxious, in view of the\r\nexisting state of feeling at Athens, to disown his part in connexion\r\nwith the Peace of Philocrates; while Demosthenes undoubtedly assisted\r\nPhilocrates in the earlier of the negotiations and discussions which\r\nled to the Peace.\r\n\r\n_appropriate_. 'The recapitulation of the history is not a mere\r\nargumentative necessity, but has a moral fitness also; in fact, the\r\nwhole defence of Demosthenes resolves itself into a proof that he only\r\nacted in the spirit of Athenian history' (Simcox).\r\n\r\n§ 18. _When the Phocian war bad broken out_: i.e. in 356-5. Demosthenes\r\nmade his first speech in the Assembly in 354.\r\n\r\n_those who detested the Spartans_: i.e. the Messenians and Arcadians.\r\n\r\n_those who had previously governed_, &c.: e.g. the oligarchies which\r\nhad governed with the help of Sparta in Phlius and Mantinea, and were\r\noverthrown after the battle of Leuctra.\r\n\r\n§ 19. _would be forced_, &c. This is a misrepresentation, since Philip\r\nand the Thebans had been in alliance for some time, and Thebes had no\r\nsuch grounds for apprehending evil from Philip, as would make her apply\r\nto Athens.\r\n\r\n§ 21. _Aristodemus_, &c. See Introd. to Speech on the Peace. As a\r\nmatter of fact, Demosthenes acted with Philocrates at least down to the\r\nreturn of the First Embassy, and himself proposed to crown Aristodemus\r\nfor his services (Aeschines, On the Embassy, §§ 15-17).\r\n\r\n§ 23. _the Hellenes bad all_, &c. It is not easy to reconcile this\r\npassage with § 16 of the Speech on the Embassy, from which it appears\r\nthat representatives of other states were present in Athens; but these\r\nso-called envoys may have been private visitors, and in any case there\r\nwas no real hope of uniting Greece against Philip.\r\n\r\n§ 24. _Eurybatus_ is said to have been sent as an envoy by Croesus to\r\nCyrus, and to have turned traitor. The name came to be proverbial.\r\n\r\n§ 27. _those strongholds_. See Introd. to Speech on the Peace.\r\n\r\n§ 28. _But they would have watched_, &c. The passage has been taken in\r\nseveral ways: (1) 'They would have had to watch,' &c., and this would\r\nhave been discreditable to Athens; (2) 'They would have watched,' &c.,\r\ni.e. they would not have been excluded, as you desired, in any case;\r\n(3) 'But, you say, they would have paid two obols apiece,' and the city\r\nwould have gained this. The sentence which follows favours (3), but\r\nperhaps (2) is best. The petty interests of the city would include\r\n(from the point of view assumed by Aeschines) the abstention from\r\nshowing civility to the enemy's envoys. The two-obol (threepenny) seats\r\nwere the cheapest.\r\n\r\n§ 30. _three whole months_. In fact the ambassadors were only absent\r\nfrom Athens about ten weeks altogether.\r\n\r\n_equally well_. The reading ([Greek: homoios]) is probably wrong; but\r\nif it is right, this must be the meaning.\r\n\r\n§ 32. _as you did before_, in 352. See Introd. to First Philippic.\r\n\r\n§ 36. _decree of Callisthenes_. This ordered the bringing in of effects\r\nfrom the country. See Speech on Embassy, §§ 86, 125.\r\n\r\n§ 41. _property in Boeotia_. See Speech on Embassy, § 145.\r\n\r\n§ 43. _their hopes_: sc. of the humiliation of Thebes.\r\n\r\n_and gladly_: i.e. they were glad to be free from a danger which\r\n(though remotely) threatened themselves, as the next sentence explains.\r\nI can see no good reason for taking the participle [Greek:\r\npolemoumenoi] as concessive ('_although_ they also,' &c.).\r\n\r\n§ 48. For Lasthenes see Introd. to Olynthiacs. Timolaus probably\r\ncontrived the surrender of Thebes after the battle of Chaeroneia.\r\nEudicus is unknown. Simus invoked Philip's aid against the tyrants at\r\nPherae in 352 (see Introd, to First Philippic). Aristratus was tyrant\r\nof Sicyon, and made alliance with Philip in 338. For Perillus, see\r\nSpeech on Embassy, Section 295.\r\n\r\n§ 50. _stale dregs_: strictly the remains, and especially the wine left\r\nin the cups, from the previous night's feast; here the long-admitted\r\nresponsibility of Aeschines for the Peace of 346.\r\n\r\n§ 63. _Dolopes_: a small tribe living to the south-west of Thessaly.\r\n\r\n§ 65. _free constitutions_. This refers especially to the Thessalians,\r\nwho had been placed under tetrarchies (see Philippic III. § 26).\r\n\r\n§ 70. _Aristophon_. See Speech on Chersonese, § 30 n. Diopeithes is\r\nperhaps Diopeithes of Sphettus (mentioned by Hypereides, Speech against\r\nEuxenippus, § 39), not the general sent by Athens to the Chersonese.\r\n\r\n§ 71. For the events mentioned in this section, see Introd. to Speech\r\non the Embassy.\r\n\r\n§ 72. _Mysian booty_. A proverbial expression derived from the helpless\r\ncondition of Mysia (according to legend) in the absence of its king,\r\nTelephus.\r\n\r\n§ 79. _to the Peloponnese_, in 344 (see Introd. to Second Philippic):\r\n_to Euboea_ in 343-2 (see Introd. to Speech on Embassy); _to Oreus_,\r\n&c., in 341 (see Introd. to this Speech).\r\n\r\n§ 82. _as their patron_, i.e. as consul (or official patron) of Oreus\r\nin Athens. See n. on Speech for Rhodians, § 15. civil rights. See vol.\r\ni, p. 52.\r\n\r\n§ 83. _this was already the second proclamation_: i.e. the proclamation\r\nin accordance with the decree of Aristonicus. It is indeed just\r\npossible that the reference is to the proposal of Ctesiphon, 'for this\r\nis now the second proclamation,' &c. If so, we should have to assume\r\nthat the proclamation under the decree of Demomeles in 338 was\r\nprevented by the disaster of Chaeroneia. But the first sentence of §\r\n120 is against this (see Goodwin's edition _ad loc_.).\r\n\r\n§ 94. _inconsiderate conduct_: i.e. in joining the revolt of the\r\nAthenian allies in 356.\r\n\r\n§ 96. _when the Spartans_, &c. The section refers to the events of 395.\r\n\r\n_Deceleian War_: i.e. the last part of the Peloponnesian War (413-404\r\nB.C.), when Deceleia (in Attica) was occupied by the Spartans.\r\n\r\n§ 99. _Thebans... Euboea_: in 358 or 357. See Speech for\r\nMegalopolitans, § 14 n.\r\n\r\n§ 100. _Oropus_. See Speech for Megalopolitans, Section 11 n.\r\n\r\n_I was one_. Demosthenes was, in fact, co-trierarch with Philinus\r\n(Speech against Meidias, § 161).\r\n\r\n§ 102. See Speech on Naval Boards (with Introd. and notes), and n. on\r\nOlynthiac II, § 29.\r\n\r\n_obtaining exemption_. The undertaking of the trierarchy conferred\r\nexemption from other burdens for the year, and (conversely) no one\r\nresponsible for another public burden need be trierarch. The leaders of\r\nthe Taxation Boards referred to in § 103 are probably not (as generally\r\nsupposed) the richest men in the _Naval_ Boards [Footnote: They may\r\nindeed have been so, but it was in virtue of their function as leading\r\nmembers of the Hundred Boards (for collecting the war tax) that they\r\nwere grouped together as the Three Hundred.] (responsible for\r\ntrierarchy), but those in the Hundred Boards responsible for the war\r\ntax. In each of these Boards there was a leader, a 'second', and a\r\n'third', and these, all together, are almost certainly identical with\r\nthe 'Three Hundred' responsible for advancing the sum due. When these\r\nwere already advancing the war tax, they became exempt from trierarchy,\r\nand their poorer colleagues in the Naval Boards (to which of course\r\nthey also belonged) had to bear the burden without them. But under\r\nDemosthenes' law the trierarchic payment was required from all alike,\r\nin strict proportion to their valuation as entered for the purposes of\r\nthe war tax; and the Three Hundred (the leaders, seconds, and thirds)\r\nwere no longer exempted. (This explains their anxiety to get the law\r\nshelved.) Even in years when they were not exempt, before Demosthenes'\r\nlaw was passed, they only paid a very small share in proportion to\r\ntheir wealth, since all the members of each Naval Board paid the same\r\nsum. It appears, however, that (though the Three Hundred as such cannot\r\nbe shown to have had any office in connexion with the trierarchy) the\r\nricher men in the Naval Boards arranged the contracts for the work of\r\nequipment, and that when they had contracted that the work should be\r\ndone (e.g.) for a talent, they sometimes recovered the whole talent\r\nfrom their poorer colleagues. (Speech against Meidias, § 155.)\r\n\r\n§ 103. _lie under sworn notice_, &c. ([Greek: en hupomosia]). One who\r\nintended to indict the proposer of a law for illegality had probably to\r\ngive sworn notice of his intention, and the suggestion made to\r\nDemosthenes was that when such notice had been given, he should let the\r\nlaw drop.\r\n\r\n§ 105. _the decree_, &c.: i.e. either a decree suspending the law until\r\nthe indictment should be heard, or one ordering the trial on the\r\nindictment to be held.\r\n\r\n§ 107. _no trierarch_, &c. A trierarch who thought the burden too heavy\r\nfor him could appeal against it by laying a branch on the altar in the\r\nPnyx, or by taking sanctuary in the Temple of Artemis at Munychia. A\r\ndilatory or recalcitrant trierarch could be arrested by order of the\r\nten commissioners ([Greek: apostuleis]) who constituted a sort of\r\nAdmiralty Board.\r\n\r\n§ 111. _the laws_, &c. The laws alleged to have been violated were\r\ncopied out, and accompanied the indictment. With regard to the laws in\r\nthe present case, see Goodwin's edition, pp. 313-6.\r\n\r\n§ 114. _Nausides_ was sent to oppose Philip at Thermopylae in 352 (see\r\nIntrod. to First Philippic). Diotimus had a command at sea in 338, and\r\nhis surrender was demanded by Alexander in 335, as was also that of\r\nCharidernus (see n. on Olynthiac III, § 5), who had now been a regular\r\nAthenian general for many years, and had been sent to assist Byzantium\r\nin 340 (see Speech against Aristocrates, _passim_).\r\n\r\n§ 121. _hellebore_: supposed in antiquity to cure madness.\r\n\r\n§ 122. _reveller on a cart_, e.g. on the second day of the Anthesteria,\r\nwhen masked revellers rode in wagons and assailed the bystanders with\r\nabusive language. Such ceremonial abuse was perhaps originally supposed\r\nto have power to avert evil, and occurs in primitive ritual all over\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n§ 125. _the statutable limit_. There was a limit of time (differing\r\naccording to the alleged offence) after which no action could be\r\nbrought. Demosthenes could not now be prosecuted for any of the\r\noffences with which Aeschines charged him.\r\n\r\n§ 127. _Aeacus_, &c.: the judges of the dead in Hades, according to\r\npopular legend.\r\n\r\n_scandal-monger_. The Greek word ([Greek: spermologos]) is used\r\nprimarily of a small bird that pecks up seeds, and hence of a person\r\nwho picks up petty gossip. (In Acts xvii. 18 it is the word which is\r\napplied to St. Paul, and translated 'this babbler'.)\r\n\r\n_an old band in the market-place_: i.e. a rogue. A clerk would perhaps\r\noften be found in the offices about the market-place; or the reference\r\nmay be to the market-place as a centre of gossip.\r\n\r\n_O Earth_, &c. Demosthenes quotes from the peroration of Aeschines'\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n§ 129. The stories which Demosthenes retails in these sections deal\r\nwith a time which must have been forty or fifty years before the date\r\nof this speech, and probably contain little truth, beyond the facts\r\nthat Aeschines' father was a schoolmaster (not a slave), and was\r\nassisted by Aeschines himself; and that his mother was priestess of a\r\n'thiasos' or voluntary association of worshippers of Dionysus-Sabazios,\r\namong whose ceremonies was doubtless one symbolizing a marriage or\r\nmystical union between the god and his worshippers. (Whether the form\r\nof 'sacred marriage' which was originally intended to promote the\r\nfertility of the ground by 'sympathetic magic' entered into the ritual\r\nof Sabazios is doubtful.) Such a rite, though probably in fact quite\r\ninnocent, gave rise to suspicions, of which Demosthenes takes full\r\nadvantage; and the fact that well-known courtesans (such as Phryne and\r\nperhaps Ninus) sometimes organized such 'mysteries' would lend colour\r\nto the suspicions.\r\n\r\n_Hero of the Lancet_ ([Greek: to kalamit_e aer_oi]). The interpretation\r\nis very uncertain (see Goodwin, pp. 339 ff.); and, according as [Greek:\r\nkalamos] is taken in the sense of 'lancet', 'splints', or 'bow',\r\neditors render the phrase 'hero of the lancet', 'hero of the splints',\r\n'archer-hero' (identified by some with Toxaris, the Scythian physician,\r\nwhose arrival in Athens in Solon's time is described in Lucian's\r\n[Greek: Skuth_es ae Proxenos]). That the Hero was a physician is shown\r\nby the Speech on the Embassy, § 249.\r\n\r\n§ 130. _for they were not like_, &c. ([Greek: ouge gar h_onetuchen _en,\r\nall ois hu daemos kataratai]). The meaning is quite uncertain. The most\r\nlikely interpretations are: (1) that given in the text, [Greek: a\r\nbebioken] being understood as the subject of [Greek: _en], and [Greek:\r\n_on etuchen] as = [Greek: tout_on a etuchen], i.e. 'not belonging to\r\nthe class of acts which were such as chance made them,' but acts of a\r\nquite definite kind, viz. the kind which the People curses (through the\r\nmouth of the herald at each meeting of the Assembly); (2) 'for he was\r\nnot of ordinary parents, but of such as the People curses'; the subject\r\nof [Greek: _en] being Aeschines. But there is the difficulty that, with\r\nthis subject for [Greek: _en, _on etuchen] can only represent [Greek:\r\ntout_on _on etuchen _on], whereas the sense required is [Greek: tout_on\r\noi etuchon], or (the regular idiom) [Greek: t_on tuchunt_on]; and the\r\nsense is not so good, for the context [Greek: opse gar]) shows that the\r\nclause ought to refer to the _acts_ of Aeschines about which he is\r\ngoing to speak, not to his parentage, which the orator has done with.\r\n\r\n_Glaucothea_. Her real name is said to have been Glaucis. Glaucothea\r\nwas the name of a sea-nymph. The change of the father's name Tromes\r\n('Trembler') to Atrometus ('Dauntless') would also betoken a rise in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n_Empusa_, or 'The Foul Phantom': a female demon capable of assuming any\r\nshape. Obscene ideas were sometimes associated with her.\r\n\r\n§ 132. For Antiphon, see Introd. to Speech on the Embassy.\r\n\r\n_struck off the list_: at the revision of the lists in 346. (Each deme\r\nrevised the list of its own members, subject to an appeal to the\r\ncourts.)\r\n\r\n_without a decree_: i.e. a decree authorizing a domiciliary visit.\r\n\r\n§ 134. _when ... you elected him_. See Introd. to Speech on the Embassy.\r\n\r\n_from the altar_: a peculiarly solemn form of voting; it is mentioned\r\nin the Speech against Macartatus, § 14.\r\n\r\n§ 136. _when Philip sent_, &c. See Introd. to Speech on the Embassy.\r\n\r\n§ 137. The ostensible purpose of Anaxinus' visit was to make purchases\r\nfor Olympias, Philip's wife. Aeschines states that Anaxinus had once\r\nbeen Demosthenes' own host at Oreus.\r\n\r\n§ 141. _paternal deity_: as father of Ion, the legendary ancestor of\r\nthe Ionians, and so of the Athenians.\r\n\r\n§ 143. _and of one_, &c. I have followed the general consensus of\r\nrecent editors; but I do not feel at all sure that the antecedent of\r\n[Greek: us] is not [Greek: polemos]. In that case we should translate,\r\n'which led to Philip's coming to Elateia and being chosen commander of\r\nthe Amphictyons, and which overthrew,' &c.\r\n\r\n§ 146. _nature of the resources_, &c.: i.e. especially the possession\r\nby Athens of a strong fleet.\r\n\r\n§ 148. _representatives on the Council_. The Amphictyonic Council was\r\ncomposed of two representatives (Hieromnemones) from each of twelve\r\nprimitive tribes, of which the Thessalians, the Boeotians, the Ionians\r\n(one of whose members was appointed by Athens), and the Dorians (one\r\nmember appointed by Sparta) were the chief, while some of the tribes\r\nwere now very obscure. There were also present delegates (Pylagori)\r\nfrom various towns. These were not members of the Council, and had no\r\nvote, but might speak. Athens sent three such delegates to each\r\nmeeting. (See Goodwin, pp. 338, 339.)\r\n\r\n§ 150. _make the circuit_, or 'beat the bounds'. The actual proceedings\r\n(according to Aeschines' account, summarized in the Introd. to this\r\nSpeech) were much more violent.\r\n\r\n_It was clearly impossible_, &c. The argument is unconvincing.\r\nAeschines may have known of the intention of the Locrians without their\r\nhaving served a formal summons.\r\n\r\n§ 158. _one man_: i.e. Philip.\r\n\r\n§ 169. _the Prytanes_: the acting Committee of the Council.\r\n\r\n_set fire to the wicker-work_: i.e. probably the hurdles, &c., of which\r\nthe booths were partly composed. Probably a bonfire was a\r\nwell-understood form of summons to an Assembly called in an emergency.\r\n\r\n_the draft-resolution_. See Introd., vol. i, p. 18.\r\n\r\n_on the hill-side_: i.e. on the Pnyx, the meeting-place of the Assembly.\r\n\r\n§ 171. _the Three Hundred_. See n. on § 102.\r\n\r\n§ 176. _philippize_. The word was coined during the wars with Philip,\r\non the analogy of 'medize'--the term used of the action of the traitors\r\nwho supported the invading Persians (Medes) early in the fifth century.\r\n\r\n§ 177. _to Eleusis_, which was on the most convenient (though not the\r\nshortest) route for an army marching to Thebes.\r\n\r\n§ 180. _Battalus_: a nickname given to Demosthenes by his nurse on\r\naccount of the impediment in his speech from which he suffered in early\r\ndays, or of his general delicacy. Aeschines had tried to fix an obscene\r\ninterpretation upon it.\r\n\r\n_Creon_. See Speech on the Embassy, § 247.\r\n\r\n_at Collytus_: i.e. at the Rural Dionysia held in that deme.\r\n\r\n§ 189. _any one_: lit. 'any one who chooses,' i.e. to call him to\r\naccount. The expression ([Greek: ho boulomenos]) is apparently half\r\ntechnical, as applied to a self-appointed prosecutor. (Cf.\r\nAristophanes, _Plutus_ 908 and 918.)\r\n\r\n§ 194. _the general_: i.e. at Chaeroneia.\r\n\r\n§ 195. _Philip employed_. Most editors say '_Aeschines_ employed'. But\r\nthis would require [Greek: outos] not [Greek: ekeinos], and § 218 also\r\nsupports the interpretation here given.\r\n\r\n§ 198. _treasured up_, &c. The suggestion seems to be that Aeschines\r\nforesaw the disasters, but concealed his knowledge, 'storing them up'\r\nin order to make a reputation out of them later.\r\n\r\n§ 204. _to leave their land_, &c.: i.e. at the time of Xerxes' invasion\r\nin 480, when the Athenians abandoned the city and trusted to the\r\n'wooden walls' of their ships.\r\n\r\n§ 208. On this magnificent passage, see the treatise _On the Sublime_,\r\nchaps, xvi, xvii.\r\n\r\n§ 209. _poring pedant_: lit. 'one who stoops over writings'. Here used\r\nperhaps with reference to Aeschines' having 'worked up' allusions to\r\nthe past for the purpose of his Speech, while he remained blind to the\r\ngreat issues of the present. Many editors think that the reference is\r\nto his earlier occupation as a schoolmaster or a clerk; but this is\r\nperhaps less suitable to the context.\r\n\r\n§ 210. _staff...ticket_. The colour of the staff indicated the court in\r\nwhich the juror was to sit; the ticket was exchanged for his pay at the\r\nend of the day.\r\n\r\n§ 214. _a very deluge_. He is thinking, no doubt, of the disaster at\r\nChaeroneia and the destruction of Thebes.\r\n\r\n§ 215. _while their infantry_, &c. The Theban forces when prepared for\r\naction would naturally camp outside the walls (see Olynth. I, § 27,\r\nwhere Demosthenes similarly thinks of the Athenian army encamping\r\noutside Athens). But although they were thus encamped outside, and had\r\nleft their wives and children unguarded within, they allowed the\r\nAthenian soldiers to enter the city freely.\r\n\r\n§ 216. _the river_: probably the Cephisus. Both battles are otherwise\r\nunknown. If one of them was in winter, it must have taken place not\r\nlong after the capture of Elateia, and several months before the battle\r\nof Chaeroneia.\r\n\r\n§ 219. _somewhere to lay the blame_: or possibly, 'some opportunity of\r\nrecovering himself,' or 'some place of retreat'. But the interpretation\r\ngiven (which is that of Harpocration) is supported by the use of\r\n[Greek: anenenkein] in § 224.\r\n\r\n§ 227. _counters all disappear_. The calculation was made by taking\r\naway, for each item of debt or expenditure, so many counters from the\r\ntotal representing the sum originally possessed. When the frame (or\r\n_abacus_) containing the counters was left clear, it meant that there\r\nwas no surplus. (The right reading, however, may be [Greek: an\r\nkathair_osin], 'if the counters are decisive,' or [Greek: han\r\nkathair_osin], 'whatever the counters prove, you concede.')\r\n\r\n§ 231. _cancel them out_ ([Greek: antanelein]): strictly, to strike\r\neach out of the account in view of something on the opposite side (i.e.\r\nin view of the alternative which you would have proposed).\r\n\r\n§ 234. _collected in advance_: i.e. Athens had been anticipating her\r\nincome.\r\n\r\n§ 238. _if you refer_, &c. Aeschines had accused Demosthenes of\r\nsaddling Athens with two-thirds of the expense of the war, and Thebes\r\nwith only one-third.\r\n\r\n_three hundred_, &c. See Speech on Naval Boards, § 29 n.\r\n\r\n§ 243. _customary offerings_, made at the tomb on the third and ninth\r\ndays after the death.\r\n\r\n§ 249. _Philocrates_: not Philocrates of Hagnus, the proposer of the\r\nPeace of 346, but an Eleusinian. For Diondas, see § 222. The others are\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\n§ 251. _Cephalus_. Cf. § 219. He was an orator and statesman of the\r\nearly part of the fourth century. (The best account of him is in\r\nBeloch, _Attische Politik_, p. 117.)\r\n\r\n§ 258. _the attendants' room_. The 'attendants' are those who escorted\r\nthe boys to and from school--generally slaves.\r\n\r\n§ 259. _the books_, &c. Cf. § 129 and notes. The books probably\r\ncontained the formulae of initiation, or the hymns which were chanted\r\nby some Dionysiac societies. The service described here is probably\r\nthat of the combined worship of Dionysus-Sabazios and the Great Mother\r\n(Cybele).\r\n\r\n_dressing_, &c. The candidate for initiation was clothed in a\r\nfawn-skin, and was 'purified' by being smeared with clay (while sitting\r\ndown, with head covered) and rubbed clean with bran, and after the\r\ninitiation was supposed to enter upon a new and higher life. It is\r\npossible that the veiling and disguising with clay originally signified\r\na death to the old life, such as is the ruling idea in many initiations\r\nof a primitive type. (Cf. Aristophanes, travesty of an\r\ninitiation-ceremony in the _Clouds_ 256.)\r\n\r\n§ 260. _fennel and white poplar_. These were credited with magical and\r\nprotective properties.\r\n\r\n_Euoe, Saboe_: the cry to Sabazios. One is tempted to render it by\r\n'Glory! Hallelujah!' In fact, the Dionysiac 'thiasoi', or some of them,\r\nhad many features, good as well as bad, in common with the Salvation\r\nArmy. The cry 'Euoe, Saboe' is of Thracian origin; 'Hyes Attes' is\r\nPhrygian. The serpents, the ivy, and the winnowing-fan figured in more\r\nthan one variety of Dionysiac service. It is not certain that for\r\n'ivy-bearer' ([Greek: kittophorhos]) we should not read 'chest-bearer'\r\n([Greek: kistophoros]) used with reference to the receptacle containing\r\nsacred objects, of which we hear elsewhere in connexion with similar\r\nrites.\r\n\r\n§ 261. _fellow-parishioners_; lit. 'members of your deme'. Each deme\r\nkept the register of citizens belonging to it. Enrolment was possible\r\nat the age of 18 years, and had to be confirmed by the Council. (See\r\nAristotle, _Constitution of Athens_, chap. xiii.)\r\n\r\n§ 262. _collecting figs_, &c. Two interpretations are possible: (1)\r\nthat the spectators in derision threw fruit--probably not of the\r\nbest--at Aeschines on the stage, and he gathered it up, as a fruiterer\r\ncollects fruit from various growers, and lived on it; or (2) that while\r\nhe was a strolling player, Aeschines used to rob orchards. Of these (1)\r\nseems by far the better in the context.\r\n\r\n§ 267. _I leave the abysm_, &c. The opening of Euripides' _Hecuba_. The\r\nline next quoted is unknown. 'Evil in evil wise' ([Greek: kakon\r\nkak_os]) is found in a line of Lynceus, a fourth-century tragedian.\r\n\r\n§ 282. _denied this intimacy with him_: or possibly (with the\r\nscholiast), 'declined this office.'\r\n\r\n§ 284. _the tambourine-player_. Such instruments were used in orgiastic\r\nrites.\r\n\r\n§ 285. Hegemon and Pythocles were members of the Macedonian party, who\r\nwere put to death in 317 by order of the Assembly. (See Speech on\r\nEmbassy, §§ 215, 314.)\r\n\r\n§ 287. _same libation_: i.e. the same banquet. The libation preceded\r\nthe drinking. To 'go beneath the same roof' with a polluted person was\r\nsupposed to involve contamination.\r\n\r\n_in the revel_. Cf. Speech on the Embassy, § 128. The reference,\r\nhowever, is here more particularly to Philip's revels after the battle\r\nof Chaeroneia, in which, Demosthenes suggests, the Athenian envoys took\r\npart.\r\n\r\n§ 289. The genuineness of the epitaph is doubtful. Line 2 is singularly\r\nuntrue. The text is almost certainly corrupt in places (e.g. ll. 3 and\r\n10).\r\n\r\n_their lives_, &c. As the text stands, [Greek: aret_es] and [Greek:\r\ndeimatos] must be governed by [Greek: brab_e,], 'made Hades the judge\r\nof their valour or their cowardice.' But this leaves [Greek: ouk\r\nesa_osan psuchas] as a quasiparenthesis, very difficult to accept in so\r\nsimple and at the same time so finished a form of composition as the\r\nepigram. There are many emendations.\r\n\r\n_'Tis God's_, &c. The line, [Greek: m_eden hamartein esti the_on kai\r\npanta katorhthoun], is taken from Simonides' epitaph on the heroes of\r\nMarathon. The sense of the couplet is plain from § 290; but [Greek: en\r\nbiot_e] in l. 10 is possibly corrupt.\r\n\r\n§ 300. _the confederacy_, i.e. Athens, Thebes, and their allies at\r\nChaeroneia.\r\n\r\n§ 301. _our neighbours_, especially Megara and Corinth.\r\n\r\n§ 308. _the inactivity which you_, &c.: i.e. abstention from taking a\r\nprominent part in public life.\r\n\r\n§ 309. _opening of ports_: i.e. to Athenian commerce.\r\n\r\n§ 311. _What pecuniary assistance_, &c. Demosthenes is thinking of his\r\nown services in ransoming prisoners, &c. Some editors translate, 'What\r\npublic financial aid have you ever given to rich or poor?' i.e. 'When\r\nhave you ever dispensed State funds in such a way as to benefit any\r\none?' It is impossible to decide with certainty between the two\r\nalternatives; but the meanings of [Greek: politik_e] ('citizen-like',\r\n'such as one would expect from a good fellow-citizen') and [Greek:\r\nkoin_e], which I assume, seem to be supported by §§ 13 and 268\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n§ 312. _leaders of the Naval Boards_. See Introd. to Speech on Naval\r\nBoards.\r\n\r\n_damaging attack_, &c. This probably refers to modifications introduced\r\non Aeschines' proposal into Demosthenes' Trierarchic Law of 340, not at\r\nthe time of its enactment, but after some experience of its working.\r\n(See Aeschines, 'Against Ctesiphon,' § 222.)\r\n\r\n§ 313. Theocrines was a tragic actor, who was attacked in the\r\npseudo-Demosthenic Speech 'Against Theocrines'. Harpocration's\r\ndescription of him as a 'sycophant', or dishonest informer, may be\r\nmerely an inference from the Speech.\r\n\r\n§ 318. _your brother_. See Speech on the Embassy, §§ 237, 249.
