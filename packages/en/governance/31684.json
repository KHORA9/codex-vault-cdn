No. 8.\r\n  January, 1889.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWICKED LEGISLATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe patience with which mankind submits to the demands of tyrants\r\nhas been the wonder of each succeeding age, and heroes are made of\r\nthose who break one yoke only to bow with servility to a greater. The\r\nRoman soldier, returning from wars in which his valor had won wealth\r\nand empire for his rulers, was easily content to become first a\r\ntenant, and then a serf, upon the very lands he had tilled as owner\r\nbefore his voluntary exile as his country's defender, kissing the hand\r\nthat oppressed, so long as it dispensed, as charity, a portion of his\r\ntithes and rentals in sports and food. And now, after ages of\r\nwonder and criticism, the soldiers of our nineteenth-century\r\ncivilization outvie their Roman prototypes in submitting to exactions\r\nand injustice of which Nero was incapable either of imagining or\r\nexecuting, bowing subserviently to the more ingenious tyrant of an\r\nadvanced civilization, if but his hand drop farthings of pensions in\r\nreturn for talents of extortion. It may not be that the soldiers\r\nand citizens of America shall become so thoroughly debauched and\r\ndegraded, nor that the consequences of their revolt shall be a\r\nburning capitol and a terrified monopolist; but if these evils are\r\nto be averted, it will be only because fearless hands tear the\r\nmask from our modern Neros, and tireless arms hold up to popular\r\nview the naked picture of national disgrace.\r\n\r\nTwenty-eight years ago the first step had been taken towards the final\r\noverthrow of the objective form of human slavery. There were, even in\r\nthose days, cranks who were dreaming of new harmonies in the songs of\r\nliberty; and when tyranny opposed force to the righteous demands of\r\nconstitutional government, ploughshares rusted in the neglected\r\nfields, workshops looked to alien lands for toilers, while patriots\r\nanswered the bugle-call, and a nation was freed from an eating cancer.\r\nBut what was the return for such sacrifices? Surely, if ever were\r\nsoldiers entitled to fair and full reward, it was those who responded\r\nto the repeated call of Lincoln for aid in suppressing the most\r\ngigantic rebellion of history--not in the form of driblets of charity,\r\ndoled with cunning arts to secure their submission to extortions, not\r\noffered as a bribe to unblushing perjury and denied to honest\r\nsuffering, but simple and exact justice, involving a full performance\r\nof national obligation in return for the stipulated discharge of the\r\nduty of citizenship. The simple statement of facts of history will\r\nserve to expose the methods of those who pose as _par excellence_ the\r\nsoldiers' friends and the defenders of national faith.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers who enlisted in the war of the rebellion were promised by\r\nthe government, in addition to varying bounties, a stipulated sum of\r\nmoney per month. It requires no argument to prove that the faith of\r\nthe government was as much pledged to the citizen who risked his life,\r\nas to him who merely risked a portion of his wealth in a secured loan\r\nto the government. But the record shows that the pay of the former was\r\nreduced by nearly sixty per cent, while the returns of the latter were\r\ndoubled, trebled, and quadrupled; that in many cases government\r\nobligations were closed by the erection of a cheap cast-iron tablet\r\nover a dead hero, while the descendants of bondholders were guarded in\r\nan undisturbed enjoyment of the fruits of their ancestors' greed. For,\r\nafter the armies were in the field, the same legislative enactment\r\nthat reduced the value of the soldier's pay increased that of the\r\ncreditor's bond, by providing that the money of the soldier should be\r\nrapidly depreciated in value, while the interest upon bonds should be\r\npayable in coin; and then, after the war was over, another and more\r\nvaluable bond was prepared, that should relieve the favored creditor\r\nof all fear of losing his hold upon the treasury by the payment of his\r\ndebt. That the purpose of the lawmakers was deliberate, was exposed in\r\na speech by Senator Sherman, who was Chairman of the Finance Committee\r\nof the Senate while the soldiers in the trenches were being robbed in\r\nthe interest of the creditors at home. In reviewing the financial\r\npolicy of his party during the war, Mr. Sherman said, in a speech in\r\nthe Senate, July 14th, 1868 [Footnote: Congressional Record, page\r\n4044]:\r\n\r\n  \"It was, then, our policy during the war, to depreciate the value\r\n  of United States notes, so that they would come into the Treasury\r\n  more freely for our bonds. Why, sir, we did a very natural thing\r\n  for us to do, we increased the amount to $300,000,000, then to\r\n  $450,000,000, and we took away the important privilege of\r\n  converting them into bonds on the ground that, while this\r\n  privilege remained, the people would not subscribe for the bonds,\r\n  and the notes would not be converted; that the right a man might\r\n  exercise at any time, he would not exercise at all.\"\r\n\r\nNo page of our national history contains a more damning record of\r\ninjustice than this. Mr. Sherman recognizes and admits that the notes,\r\nas issued and paid to the soldiers and producers of the country, were\r\nfundable at the holder's option in a government interest-bearing bond.\r\nHe confesses to the foreknowledge that in nullifying this right the\r\nvalue of the notes would be decreased and to that extent the soldiers'\r\npay be diminished. No organ of public opinion raised the cry of\r\nbreaking the plighted faith of the nation. The soldier had no organ\r\nthen; but years after the wrong had been perpetrated, there appeared\r\nin Spaulding's \"History of the Currency\" the naïve statement, \"It\r\nnever seemed quite right to take away this important privilege while\r\nthe notes were outstanding with this endorsement upon them.\" By a law,\r\npassed against the protests of the wisest and most patriotic members\r\nof the popular branch of Congress, it had been provided that these\r\ngovernment notes, so soon to be further depreciated in value, should\r\nbe a full legal tender to the nation's defenders, but only rags in the\r\nhands of the fortunate holder of interest-bearing obligations of the\r\ngovernment, upon which they were based, and into which they were\r\nfundable at the option of the holder. In one of his reports while\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, Hon. Hugh McCulloch showed that fully\r\nthirty per cent of the cost of supplies furnished the government was\r\ndue to the depreciation of the currency, the initial step in such\r\ndepreciation being the placing of the words \"Except duties on imports\r\nand interest on the public debt\" in the law and upon the back of the\r\nnotes. But, having provided that one class of the government creditors\r\nshould be secured against the evil effects of a depreciated currency,\r\nthose friends of the soldiers and defenders of the nation's honor\r\nproceeded to a systematic course of depreciation of the currency,\r\nwhile the soldiers were too busy fighting, and the citizens too\r\nearnest in their support of the government, to criticize its acts.\r\nDuring the war the sentiment was carefully inculcated, that opposition\r\nto the Republican party or its acts was disloyalty to the government,\r\ncopperheadism, treason; and protests against any of its legislation\r\nwere answered with an epithet. It so happened that very little\r\ncontemporary criticism was indulged in, from a wholesome fear of\r\nsocial or business ostracism, or the frowning portals of Fort\r\nLafayette.\r\n\r\nBut from the very commencement of the war there had been felt at\r\nWashington a strong controlling influence emanating from the money\r\ncentres. The issue of the demand notes of the government during\r\nthe first year had furnished a portion of the revenues required,\r\nand had served to recall the teachings of the earlier statesmen\r\nand the demonstrations of history--that paper money bottomed on\r\ntaxes would prove a great blessing to the people, and a just\r\nexercise of governmental functions. This was only too evident to\r\nthose controlling financial operations at the great money centres. The\r\nnation was alive to the necessities of the government; the people\r\nanswered the calls for troops with such promptness as to block the\r\nchannels of transportation, often drilling in camp, without arms,\r\nawaiting production from the constantly running armories. Those\r\ncamps represented the people. From them all eyes were bound to the\r\nsource of supply of the munitions of war; in them all hearts burned\r\nfor the time for action, even though that meant danger and death.\r\nThere were other camps from which gray-eyed greed looked with far\r\ndifferent motives. The issue of their own promissory notes, based\r\nupon a possibility of substituting confidence for coin, had proven\r\nin the past of vast profit to the note-issuers of the great money\r\ncentres. The exercise of that power by the government would\r\ninevitably destroy one great source of their profits, and transfer it\r\nto the people. Sixty millions of the people's own notes, circulating\r\namong them as money, withstanding the effect of the suspension of\r\nspecie payments by both the banks and the national Treasury, was a\r\nforceful object-lesson to all classes. To the people, it brought a\r\nstrong ray of hope to brighten the darkness of the war cloud. To some\r\namong the metropolitan bankers who in after years prated so loudly of\r\ntheir patriotism and financial sagacity, it brought to view only\r\nthe danger of curtailed profits. The government Treasury was empty;\r\ntroops in the field were unpaid and uncomplaining; merchants\r\nfurnishing supplies, seriously embarrassed for the lack of money in\r\nthe channels of trade. The sixty millions of demand notes were\r\nabsorbed by the nation's commerce like a summer storm on parched\r\nsoil. Under such circumstances, at the urgent request of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, the Ways and Means Committee of the House\r\nof Representatives framed a bill authorizing the issue of one\r\nhundred and fifty millions of bonds, and the same amount of Treasury\r\nnotes, the latter to be a full legal tender, and fundable in an\r\ninterest-bearing bond at the option of the holder. The contest between\r\nthe popular branch of the government and the Senate, upon this\r\nmeasure, forms one of the most interesting and instructive lessons\r\nof the financial legislation of the nation. In the Senate, a\r\nbitter and determined opposition to the legal-tender clause was\r\ndeveloped. The associated banks of New York had adopted a resolution\r\nthat the Treasury notes of the government should only be received\r\nby the different banks from their customers as \"a special deposit to\r\nbe paid in kind;\" and it was one of the lessons of the war, that\r\nnotices containing the announcement above quoted remained posted in\r\nthe New York banks until a high premium on those very notes, over\r\nthe dishonored greenbacks, caused a shrewd depositor to demand of\r\nthe bank his deposits in kind. The demand was settled by a delivery\r\nof greenbacks, which were a full legal tender for the purpose, and\r\nthe notices suddenly disappeared. The compromise effected between\r\nthe two Houses resulted in the issue of the emasculated greenback,\r\nand it also led the way to the establishment of the National Banking\r\nsystem, and the issue of the promissory notes of the banks to be\r\nused as money.\r\n\r\nMuch of the force of all criticism of the system so devised has been\r\nweakened by the fact that the attack has been aimed at the banks\r\nthemselves, and not against one special feature of the system. In\r\nexplanation, though not in excuse for this, should be stated the fact\r\nthat every issue of the annual finance report of the government\r\ncontained the special pleadings of the comptrollers of the currency,\r\nconcealing some facts, misstating others, and creating thereby the\r\nimpression that they were endeavoring to win the favor of the banking\r\ninstitutions. Added to this were the efforts of those controlling the\r\nnational bank in the great money centres to secure a permanency of the\r\nnote-issuing feature of their system, after a very general public\r\nsentiment against it had been aroused, and even after its evil effects\r\nhad been felt by smaller banks located among, and supported more\r\ndirectly by, the producing classes. But now, when the discussion is\r\nremoved from the arena of politics, when the volume of the bank-note\r\nsystem is rapidly disappearing, and when many of the best and\r\nstrongest banks are seeking to be relieved from the burden of\r\nnote-issuance, it is opportune to discuss calmly and without prejudice\r\nthe wisdom of the original acts and their effects upon the country.\r\n\r\nIt has been claimed that by the organization of the national banks\r\nthe government was enabled to dispose of its bonds and aided in\r\ncarrying on the war. Do the facts warrant the claim? All national bank\r\nnotes have been redeemable solely in Treasury notes. They do not\r\npossess the legal-tender qualification equal to the Treasury note, and\r\ncannot therefore be considered any better than the currency in which\r\nthey are alone redeemable, and in comparison with which they have less\r\nuses. These are truths that were just as palpable twenty-five years\r\nago as to-day. It follows that the issue of the bank notes did not\r\nfurnish any better form of currency than that which came directly from\r\nthe government to the people. Every dollar of such notes issued\r\ncontributed just as much towards an inflation of the currency as the\r\nissue of an equal amount of Treasury notes. With these facts in mind,\r\na review of the organization of the banks and their issue of notes\r\nwill reveal the effect of such acts.\r\n\r\nIn 1864 the notes of the government had been depreciated to such an\r\nextent that coin was quoted at a premium ranging from 80 per cent to\r\n150 per cent. The record of a single bank organized and issuing notes\r\nunder such circumstances is illustrative of the whole system.\r\n\r\nTake a bank with one hundred thousand dollars to invest in government\r\nbonds as a basis for its issuance of currency. The bonds were bought\r\nwith the depreciated Treasury notes. Deposited with the Comptroller of\r\nthe Currency at Washington, the bank received ninety thousand dollars\r\nof notes to issue as money. It also received six thousand dollars in\r\ncoin as one year's advance interest upon its deposited bonds, under\r\nthe law of March 17, 1884. This coin, not being available for use as\r\nmoney, was sold or converted into Treasury notes at a ratio of from\r\ntwo to two and a half for one. The bank, therefore, had received, as a\r\nworking cash capital, a sum in excess of the money invested in its\r\nbonds. The transaction stands as follows:\r\n\r\n  Invested in bonds                            $100,000\r\n  Received notes to issue              $90,000\r\n  Received coin equal to, say           12,000--102,000\r\n                                                 ------\r\n  Bank gains by transaction                      $2,000\r\n\r\nFrom this it will appear that the bank has the use, as currency, of\r\nmore than the amount of its bonds, while the government is to pay, in\r\naddition, six per cent per annum on the full amount of bonds so long\r\nas the relations thus created continue. Surely no argument is needed\r\nto prove that, if the government had issued the $90,000 in the form\r\nof Treasury notes, and had paid out the interest money for its current\r\nobligations, there would have been no greater inflation of the\r\ncurrency, a more uniform currency would have been maintained, and a\r\nsaving effected of the entire amount of interest paid on bonds held\r\nfor security of national bank notes, which at this date would amount\r\nto a sum nearly representing the total bonded debt of the country.\r\n\r\nBut there remains a still more serious charge to be made against this\r\nsystem. Defended as a war measure by which the banks were to aid the\r\ngovernment in conquering the rebellion, the fact remains that at the\r\ndate of Lee's surrender only about $100,000,000 of bonds had been\r\naccepted by the banks, even though they received a bonus for the act.\r\nBut, after the war had closed, and the government was with one hand\r\ncontracting the volume of its own circulating notes by funding them\r\ninto interest-bearing bonds, the banks were allowed to inflate the\r\ncurrency by the further issue of over $200,000,000 of their notes.\r\nTime may produce a sophist cunning enough to devise an adequate\r\ndefence or apology for such legislation. His work will only be saved\r\nfrom public indignation and rebuke when a continued series of outrages\r\nshall have dulled the national intelligence and destroyed the national\r\nhonor.\r\n\r\nBut there came a time when the policy of the government was radically\r\nchanged. The soldiers had conquered a peace,--or thought they\r\nhad,--and, as they marched in review before their commander-in-chief,\r\nhad been paid off in crisp notes of the government--legal tender to\r\nthe soldier, but not to the bondholder; the time for government to pay\r\nthe soldiers had ceased; the national banks had been allowed to show\r\ntheir patriotism and their willingness to aid the government overthrow\r\na rebellion already conquered, by the issuance of their notes to add\r\nto an inflated and depreciated currency; the soldiers had returned to\r\nthe arts of peace, and had taken their places as producers of the\r\nnation's wealth and taxpayers to the national Treasury. Then Mr.\r\nSherman, with his brother patriots and statesmen, discovered that the\r\ncountry (meaning, of course, the bondholders) was suffering under the\r\nevils of a depreciated currency. Their tender consciences had never\r\nsuffered a twinge while the soldiers were receiving from the\r\ngovernment a currency depreciated in value as the result of its own\r\nacts. But when the soldier became the taxpayer, and from his toil was\r\nto be obliged to pay the bondholder, then the patriotic hearts of Mr.\r\nSherman and his co-conspirators in the dominant political party\r\ntrembled at the thought of a soldier being allowed to discharge his\r\nobligations in the same kind of money he had received for his\r\nservices. As a recipient of the government dole, paper money,\r\npurposely depreciated, was quite sufficient. From the citizen by the\r\nproduct of whose toil a bonded interest-bearing debt was to be paid,\r\n\"honest money\" was to be demanded. It required no argument to convince\r\nthe government creditor that this was a step in his interest, and\r\npublic clamor was hushed with the catchwords of \"honest money\" and\r\n\"national honor,\" while driblets of pensions were allowed to trickle\r\nfrom rivers of revenue. The Nero of Rome had been excelled by his\r\nChristian successor, and the dumb submission of ancient slaves became\r\nmanly independence in contrast with modern stupidity.\r\n\r\nBy the passage of the so-called \"Credit-strengthening Act,\" in March,\r\n1869, it was provided that all bonds of the government, except in\r\ncases where the law authorizing the issue of any such obligation has\r\nexpressly provided that the same may be paid in lawful money, or other\r\ncurrency than gold and silver, should be payable in coin. This act was\r\ndenounced by both Morton and Stevens, as a fraud upon the people, in\r\nthat it made a new contract for the benefit of the bondholder. The\r\ninjustice of the act could have been determined upon the plainest\r\nprinciples of equity: if the bonds were payable in coin, there was no\r\nneed for its passage; if they were not so payable, there could be no\r\nexcuse for it. If there existed a doubt sufficiently strong to require\r\nsuch an act, it was clearly an injustice to ignore the rights of the\r\nmany in the interests of the few. But the men who had not scrupled to\r\nsend rag-money to the soldiers in the trenches, and coin to the\r\nplotters in the rear, had no consciences to be troubled. They had\r\ndared to pay to the soldiers the money of the nation, and then rob\r\nthem of two-thirds of it under color of law, and now needed only to\r\nsearch for methods, not for excuses. Political exigencies must be\r\nguarded against. The public must be hoodwinked, the soldier element\r\nplacated with pension doles.\r\n\r\nThe first essential was to stifle public discussion. Some fool-friends\r\nof the money power had introduced and pressed the bill early in 1868.\r\nThere were still a few Representatives in Congress who had not bowed\r\nthe knee to Baal, and they raised a vigorous protest against the\r\niniquitous proposal. Discussion then might be fatal to both the scheme\r\nand the party, and Simon Cameron supplemented an already inodorous\r\ncareer by warning the Senate that this bill would seriously injure\r\nthe Republican party, and that it should be laid aside until the\r\nexcitement of a political campaign had subsided, and it could be\r\ndiscussed with the calmness with which we should view all great\r\nfinancial questions.\r\n\r\nHere was the art of the demagogue, blinding the eyes of the people with\r\nsophistry and false pretences in order to secure by indirection that\r\nwhich could not be obtained by fair discussion. A Presidential election\r\nwas approaching. An honest Chief Executive had rebelled against the\r\nattempt to nullify the results of the war by converting the Southern\r\nStates into conquered territories, in order that party supremacy should\r\nbe secured, even at the expense of national unity and harmony. Any\r\ndiscussion of a proposition to burden the victorious soldier with\r\ngreater debt, in the interest of a class of stay-at-homes, would have\r\ncaused vigorous protests from the men whose aid was necessary for party\r\nsuccess. Thaddeus Stevens had announced that if he thought \"that the\r\nRepublican party would vote to pay, in coin, bonds that were payable\r\nin greenbacks, thus making a new contract for the benefit of the\r\nbondholders, he would vote for Frank Blair, even if a worse man than\r\nHoratio Seymour was at the head of the ticket.\" Oliver P. Morton, the\r\nwar-Governor of Indiana, had been equally vigorous in his language;\r\nand practical politicians foresaw that even Pennsylvania and Indiana\r\nmight be lost to the Republican party with these men arrayed against\r\nit. Therefore the cunning proposal to postpone this discussion \"until\r\nafter the excitement of a Presidential election was over, and we could\r\ndiscuss this with the calmness with which we should view all great\r\nfinancial questions.\" The hint was taken, the contest of 1868 was fought\r\nunder a seeming acquiescence in the views of Stevens and Morton; the\r\ndear people were hoodwinked with catch-phrases coined to deceive, and a\r\nnew lease of power was secured by false pretence. But when the\r\nexcitement of the election had passed, and there was no longer any\r\ndanger of \"injuring the Republican party,\" all discussion was stifled;\r\nand the first act signed by the newly elected President was that which\r\nhad been laid aside for that season of \"calmness with which we\r\nshould view all great financial questions.\"\r\n\r\nThe next step in the conspiracy was a logical sequence to all that had\r\npreceded. Having secured coin payment of interest and principal of all\r\nbonds, it was now in order to still further increase the value of the\r\none and to perpetuate the payment of the other. To this end, silver\r\nwas demonetized by a trick in the revision of the Statutes, reducing\r\nthe volume of coin one-half, and decreasing the probability of rapid\r\nbond payments. Then the volume of the paper currency was contracted by\r\na systematic course of substituting interest-bearing bonds for\r\nnon-interest-bearing currency, and the first chapter of financial\r\nblunders and crimes of the Wall Street servants ended in a panic,\r\nrevealing, in its first wild terror, the disgraceful connection of\r\nhigh public officials with the worst elements of stock-jobbery.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that a direct proposition in 1865, to double the amount\r\nof the public debt as a free gift to the creditor-class, might have\r\ncaused such a clamor as would have forever driven from power its\r\nauthors, and have silenced the claims of modern Republicans that they\r\nwere the sole friends of the soldier, and defenders of national honor.\r\nBut the financial legislation of the Republican party has done more\r\nand worse than this. Its every act has been in the interest of a\r\nfavored class, and a direct and flagrant robbery of the producing\r\nmasses. It has won the support of corporate monopoly by blind\r\nsubmission to its demands, and, with brazen audacity, sought and\r\nobtained the co-operation of the survivors of the army by doling out\r\npensions and promises. And yet, with a record that would have\r\ncrimsoned the cheek of a Nero or Caligula, its leaders are posing as\r\ncritics of honest statesmen, and the only friends and defenders of the\r\nsoldier and laborer. The leaders of its earlier and better days have\r\nbeen ostracised and silenced in party councils, while audacious\r\ndemagogues have used its places of trust as a means of casting anchors\r\nto windward for personal profit. Its party conventions are controlled\r\nby notorious lobbyists and railroad attorneys, and the agricultural\r\npopulation appealed to for support. Truly the world is governed more\r\nby prejudice than by reason, and American politics of the present day\r\noffer but slight rewards to manliness or patriotism.\r\n\r\nClinton Furbish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HONOR OF AN ELECTION.\r\n\r\n(President Cleveland's Defeat, 1888.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                Whose is the honor?

None of the speakers\r\nhad been very long out of their teens; all of them were familiar\r\ningredients of that cream-nougat compound, called society.\r\n\r\nMr. de Silva Street was of the harmless blonde and immaculate\r\nlinen type. He was invited everywhere for his present boots, and\r\nwell-received for his expectant bonds; his sole and responsible\r\nancestor having \"fought in his corner\" with success, in more than one\r\nof the market battles for the belt.\r\n\r\nMr. Wetherly Gage had glory enough with very young belles and\r\ntenacious marriageable possibilities, in being society editor of _Our\r\nPlanet_; while Mr. Trotter Upton had owned more horses and been more\r\nof a boon to sharp traders than any man of his years in the\r\nmetropolis. A brief young man, with ruddy, if adolescent, moustache\r\napparently essaying the ascent of a nose turned up in sympathetic hue,\r\nhis red hair was cut in aggressive erectile fashion, which emphasized\r\nthe _soubriquet_ of \"Indian Summer,\" given him by the present\r\nunconscious subject of the critical trilogy.\r\n\r\n\"But remember, Trotter, she is my pet partner,\" simpered Mr. Street at\r\nthe shapely back disappearing down the hallway; and he caressed where\r\nhis blond moustache was to be.\r\n\r\n\"And might have been of your--mother's,\" added Mr. Gage, with the\r\nlonesome titter that illustrated all of his acidulous jokelets.\r\n\r\n\"Remember she is a lady, and a guest of your host besides,\" chimed in\r\na tall, dark man, as he joined the group. The voice was perfectly\r\nquiet; but there seemed discomforting magnetism in the glance he\r\nrested on one after the other, as he filled a glass and raised it to\r\nhandsome, but firm-set lips.\r\n\r\nThe three typical beaux of an abnormal civilization shifted position\r\nuneasily. Trotter Upton pulled down his cuffs, and laboriously admired\r\nthe horse-shoe and snaffle ornamenting their buttons, as he answered:\r\n\r\n\"Sorry we shocked you, Van. Forgot it was your lecture season! But\r\nI'll taut the curb on the boys, so socket your whip, old fel!\"\r\n\r\n\"If your tact kept pace with your slang, Upton, what a success you'd\r\nbe!\" Van Morris answered, carelessly. \"'Tis a real pity you let the\r\nstable monopolize so much of the time that would make you an ornament\r\nto society.\" Then he set down his unfinished glass, sauntered into the\r\nhall, and approached the subject of discussion.\r\n\r\nMiss Rose Wood was scarcely a beauty; nor was she the youngest belle\r\nof that ball by perhaps fifteen seasons of German cotillion. But she\r\nhad tact to her manicured finger-tips, delicate acid on her tongue's\r\ntip, and that dangerous erudition, a brief biography of every girl in\r\nthe set, was handily stored in her capacious memory. She had,\r\nmoreover, a staunch following of gilt-plated youths who, being really\r\nafraid of her, made her a belle as a sort of social Peter's pence.\r\n\r\nMiss Wood had just finished a rapid \"glide,\" when she came under fire\r\nof the punch-room light-fighters; but, though Mr. Upton had once\r\njudged her \"a trifle touched in the wind,\" her complexion and her\r\ntasteful drapery had come equally smooth out of that trying ordeal.\r\nEven that critic finished with a nod towards her as their mentor moved\r\naway:\r\n\r\n\"She _does_ keep her pace well! Hasn't turned a hair.\" And he was\r\nright in the fact so peculiarly stated; for it was less the warmth of\r\nthe dancing-room than of her partner's urgence, that brought Miss Rose\r\nWood into the hall, for what Mr. Upton called \"a breather.\"\r\n\r\nThe visible members of the Wood family were two, Miss Rose and her\r\nfather, Colonel Westchester Wood. \"The Colonel\" was an equally\r\nfamiliar figure at the clubs and on the quarter-stretch; nor was he\r\nchary of acceptance of the cards to dinners, balls, and opera-boxes,\r\nwhich his daughter's facile management brought to the twain in\r\nshowers. He had a certain military air, and a nebulous military\r\nhistory; boasted of his Virginia-Kentucky origin, and more than hinted\r\nat his Blue Grass stock-farm. Late at night, he would mistily mention\r\n\"My regiment at Shiloh, sah!\" But, as he was reputed even more expert\r\nwith the pistol than most knew him to be with cards, geography and\r\nchronology were never insisted on in detail. But the Colonel was\r\nundisputed possessor of a thirst, marvellous in its depth and\r\ncontinuity; and he had also a cast-iron head that turned the flanks of\r\nthe most direct assaults of alcohol, and scattered them to flaunt the\r\nred flag on his pendulous nose, or to skirmish over his scrupulously\r\nshaven cheeks.\r\n\r\nOf the invisible members of \"the Colonel's\" household, fleecy rumors\r\nonly pervaded society at intervals. The social Stanleys and\r\nLivingstons who had essayed the sources of the Wood family stream in\r\nits dark continent of brown-faced brick, on a quiet avenue, sent back\r\nvague stories of a lovely and patient invalid, and a more lovely and\r\nequally patient young girl, mother and sister to Miss Rose. There was\r\na misty legend sometimes floating around the clubs, that \"the\r\nColonel,\" after the method of Cleopatra, had dissolved his wife's\r\nfortune in a posset, and swallowed it years before. But again the\r\nreputation of a dead shot cramped curiosity.\r\n\r\nAnd a similar mist sometimes pervaded five o'clock teas and reunions\r\n_chez la modiste_, to the effect that the younger sister was but as a\r\nMidianite to the elder, while the mother was dying of neglect. But as\r\nneither subject of this gossip was in society, the mist never\r\ncondensed into direction.\r\n\r\nSociety found Miss Rose Wood a peculiarly useful and pleasant person;\r\nand it took her--as \"the Colonel\" took many of his pleasures--on\r\ntrust.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe ball was a crowded one; but was, perhaps, the most brilliant and\r\nselect of that season, combining a Christmas-eve festivity with the\r\n_début_ party of the acknowledged beauty and prize-heiress of the\r\nentire set.\r\n\r\nBlanche Allmand had been finally finishing abroad for some years,\r\nafter having won her blue-ribboned diploma from Mde. de Cancanière, on\r\nMurray Hill. Rumors of her perfections of face and form and character\r\nhad come across the seas, in those thousand-and-one letters, for which\r\na fostering government makes postal unions. And ever mingled with\r\nthese rumors, came praises of those thousand-and-one accomplishments,\r\nwhich society is equally apt to admire as to envy, even while it does\r\nnot appreciate.\r\n\r\nBut what most inspired with noble ambition the gilded youth of that\r\nparticular _coterie_, was the universally accepted fact that old Jack\r\nAllmand was master of the warmest fortune that any papa thereabouts\r\nmight add to the blessing he bestowed upon his son-in-law.\r\n\r\nAnd, like Jeptha of old, he \"had one fair daughter and no more.\" A\r\nwidower--not only \"warm,\" but very safe--he had weathered all the\r\nshoals and quicksands of \"the street,\" and had brought his golden\r\nargosy safe into the port of investment. Then he had retired from\r\nbusiness, which theretofore had engrossed his whole heart and soul,\r\nand lavished both upon the fair young girl, to bring whom from final\r\nfinishing at the _Sacre Coeur_, he had just made himself so hideously\r\nsea-sick.\r\n\r\nIt was very late in the season when the delayed return of the pair was\r\nannounced, with numerous adjectives, in the society columns; but Mr.\r\nAllmand's impatience to expose his golden fleece to the expectant\r\nJasons would brook no delay. Blanche was allowed scarcely time to\r\nunpack her many trunks; to exhibit her goodly share of the _chefs\r\nd'oeuvres_ of Pengat and Worth to the admiring elect; and to receive\r\ngushing embraces, only measured by their envy, when the _début_ ball\r\nwas announced for Christmas-eve.\r\n\r\nHis best Christmas gift had come to the doting father; and what more\r\nfitting season to show his joy and pride in it, and to have their\r\nlittle world share both?\r\n\r\nWhen Blanche, backed by Miss Rose Wood, had hinted that it was rather\r\nan unusual occasion, he had promptly settled that by declaring that\r\nshe was a peculiarly unusual sort of girl. So the invitations went\r\nforth; the Allmand mansion was first turned inside out, and then\r\nilluminated, and flower-hidden for the _début_ ball.\r\n\r\nThat it would be _the_ affair of the season none doubted. Already,\r\nmany a paternal pocket had twinged responsive to extra appeals from\r\nmarketable daughters; and as to beaux, they had responded _nem. con._,\r\nwhen bidden to the event promising so much in present feast, and which\r\nmight possibly so tend to prevent future famine. For already the clubs\r\nhad discounted the chances of one favorite or another for winning the\r\nmarital prize of the year.\r\n\r\nForemost among those who had hastened to welcome Blanche back to her\r\nnew home was Miss Rose Wood. She had the mysterious knack of \"coming\r\nout\" gracefully with every fresh set; of perfectly adapting herself to\r\nits fads, and especially to its beaux. Set might come and set might\r\ngo, but she came out forever; and some nameless tact implied to every\r\n_débutante_, what Micawber forced upon Copperfield with the brutality\r\nof words, that she was the \"friend of her youth.\"\r\n\r\nSo, already, Miss Wood was prime favorite and prime minister at the\r\nhome-court of the confiding Blanche, who, spite of brave heart and\r\nstrong will of her own, fluttered not unnaturally in the unwonted buzz\r\nand glare of her new life. But most particularly had Rose Wood warned\r\nher against the flirts and \"unsafe men\" of their set; including, of\r\ncourse, Vanderbilt Morris and her present partner of the ball in the\r\nranks of both.\r\n\r\nThat partner, Andrew Browne, was avowedly the best _parti_ of the\r\nentire set. Handsome, fun-loving, and well-cultivated, he was that\r\n_rara avis_ among society beaux, a thorough gentlemen by instinct; but\r\nhe was lazily given to self-indulgence, and had the prime weakness of\r\nbeing utterly incapable of saying \"no,\" to man or woman. The intimate\r\nfriend and room-mate of Van Morris for many years, Browne had never\r\nlost a sort of reverence for the superior force and decision of the\r\nother's character; and, though but a few years his junior, in all\r\nserious social matters he literally sat at his feet.\r\n\r\nAnd Morris had always grown restive when Miss Rose Wood made one of\r\nher \"dead sets\" at Andy's face and fortune; for a far-away experience\r\nof his own, in that quarter, had taught him how small an objection to\r\nthat maiden would be a fortune with the man whom she blessed with her\r\naffection.\r\n\r\n\"And _that_ brand of the wine of the heart,\" he had once cautioned\r\nAndy, \"does not improve with age.\"\r\n\r\nDoubtful of that young gentleman's confident response, that\r\n\"_he_ was not to be caught with chaff,\" Van still kept watch and\r\nward. So, leaving the elegant book-room of the elegant avenue\r\nmansion--converted, for the nonce, into an elegant bar-room for Mr.\r\nTrotter Upton and his friends--Morris sauntered through knots of\r\npretty women and of pretty vacuous-looking men, resting on seats\r\nhalf-hidden in potted plants, and approached the pair interesting\r\nhim most.\r\n\r\nNeither glowed with delight at his advent, although Andy seemed only\r\nto be rattling off common-places, in peculiarly voluble style. Morris\r\nasked for the next waltz; Miss Wood glanced shyly up at her companion,\r\ndropped her eyes demurely, and believed she would rest until the\r\n_cotillon_. Then, after a few more small necessaries of social life\r\nabout the beauty of the girls, the heat of the rooms, and the elegance\r\nof the flowers, she permitted Andy to drift easily towards the door\r\nthat opened on the dim-lit coolness of the conservatory.\r\n\r\nAs they turned away, Rose Wood sent one sharp glance of her gray eyes\r\nglinting into Morris's; then hers fell, and even he could find only\r\nbare common-place in her words:\r\n\r\n\"So many little dangers, you know, Mr. Morris--at a ball. One cannot\r\nbe _too_ prudent.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not answer; but the look that followed her graceful figure had\r\nvery little of flattery in it.\r\n\r\n\"Curse that _Chambertin_!\" he muttered in his moustache. \"I warned him\r\nagainst the second pint at dinner. Andy _couldn't_ be fool enough,\r\nthough,\" he added, with a shrug, and moved slowly towards the\r\ndancing-room.\r\n\r\nThe critical group, still around the big punch-bowl, looked after him\r\ncuriously.\r\n\r\n\"_He's_ not soft on the old girl, is he?\" queried Mr. de Silva\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" chuckled Mr. Wetherly Gage. \"Morris is too well up in Bible\r\nlore to marry his grandmother!\"\r\n\r\n\"And he don't have to,\" put in Mr. Trotter Upton, with a sage wink.\r\n\"I'd back Van against the field to win the Allmand purse, hands down,\r\nif he'd only enter. But he _won't_; so you're safe, Silvey, if you've\r\ngot the go in you. But Lord! Van's too smart to carry weight for age!\r\nWhy, you may land me over the tail-board, if the woman that hitches\r\n_him_ double won't have to throw him down and sit on him, Rarey\r\nfashion!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the speaker, remarking _sotto voce_, that here was luck to the\r\nwinner, drained his glass with a smack, set it down, and lounged\r\ninto the smoking-room. There he lazily lit one of Mr. Allmand's\r\nfull-flavored Havanas, and thoughtfully stored his breast pocket\r\nwith several more.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the horsey pundit's offered odds seemed not so wisely\r\nlaid.\r\n\r\nIn the great room a crowded waltz was in progress; and Morris saw\r\nBlanche Allmand standing on the opposite edge of the whirling circle.\r\nHer head and her dainty slipper were keeping time to the softly\r\naccented music; while a comical expression--half anger, half\r\nmischief--emphasized the nothing she was saying to her companion.\r\n\r\nVan caught her eye and, adept that he was in the social signal-service,\r\ntook in the situation at a glance. He slightly raised his eyebrows and\r\nbarely moved his lips; she assented with the smallest of nods and a\r\nhappy flush; and, a moment later, he had edged around the masses of\r\nbumping humanity and offered his arm.\r\n\r\n\"My waltz, I believe,\" he said, with the ease of the heir-apparent of\r\nAnanias. \"I was unlucky enough, in losing the first turn, not to\r\ngrudge Major Bouncey the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"You deserve to lose the whole for coming late,\" the girl answered,\r\ndrawing her arm from her partner's with that pretty reluctance which\r\nmakes society's stage-business seem born in woman. \"It was just too\r\ngood of Major Bouncey to take your place and save my being a\r\nwall-flower.\" And, not pausing for that gallant soldier's labored\r\ndisclaimer, the graceful pair glided away to the graceful time of 'La\r\nGitana' waltz.\r\n\r\n\"Horrid bore, that Bouncey,\" Blanche panted in the first pause. \"Don't\r\nstop near him! He does all his dancing on my insteps; and I dare not\r\nstop for fear of his still more dreadful spooning.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would not have _me_ blame him? A better balanced brain might well\r\nlose its poise, with _such_ temptation!\" And the man looked down on\r\nher with very eloquent eyes.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Then Van Morris bent his head, and the eyes still\r\nmore strongly emphasized the words:\r\n\r\n\"Blanche, do you know how dangerously lovely you are?\"\r\n\r\nThe girl's frank eyes dropped beneath the strong light in his; but\r\nthere was not a shade of consciousness in the soft laugh that prefaced\r\nher reply:\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I've a cheval-glass and this is my first ball. So I suppose I\r\nknow how 'dangerous' I am! Then, too, that awful Bouncey called me a\r\nlily of the valley!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the purest flower made by God's hand,\" were Morris's simple\r\nwords; but the vibrant tone came from deeper than the lips, now close\r\npressed together.\r\n\r\n\"But I _know_ I'm not,\" Blanche retorted, merrily, \"for _they_ drink\r\nonly dew, and I am quite wild for Regent's punch!\"\r\n\r\nThey were at the refreshment room, now nearly deserted. Once more the\r\nman's eyes grew darker and deeper, as they met the girl's frank blue\r\nones.\r\n\r\n\"And yet, not purer,\" he said, unheeding the interruption, \"than the\r\nheart you, little girl, will soon give to some----\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped abruptly; but the eyes added more than the words left\r\nunsaid.\r\n\r\nAgain Blanche dropped her eyes quickly; but her color never\r\nheightened, nor did the soft laces nestling over the graceful bust\r\nmove at all quicker than the waltz might warrant. Van's face still\r\nbent over her with earnest expression, as she sipped the glass of\r\npunch he handed her; but neither spoke until they had crossed the\r\ncorridor and passed another door into the conservatory.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nThe soft, warm air, heavy with the breath of the \"Grand Duke\" and of\r\norange blossoms; the tremulous half-light from colored lamps hung amid\r\nthe leaves; the dead stillness of the place, broken only by the plash\r\nof the fountain falling back into its moss-covered basin, all\r\ncontrasted deliciously with the hot, dusty atmosphere and giddy\r\nbuzzing under the flaring gas-jets left behind.\r\n\r\nThey strolled slowly down the gravelled walk, between rows of huge\r\ntubs, moist and flower-laden with the products of almost every clime.\r\nHere gleamed the glossy leaves of the Southern _grandiflora_; the rare\r\nwax plant crept along the wall beyond, its pink, starry blooms\r\ngleaming delicately among the thick, artificial-seeming leaves; while,\r\nas though in honor of the happily-timed birthnight of the fair young\r\nmistress of all, a gorgeous century plant had opened its bud in a\r\nglory of form and color, magnificent as rare.\r\n\r\n\"Blanche, do you remember how long I have known you?\" Morris asked,\r\nsuddenly breaking the silence. \"Ever since you were like _this_; a\r\nclose, callow bud, giving but vague promise of the glorious flowering\r\nof your womanhood! I watched the opening of every petal of your mind\r\nand tried to peer through them into the heart of the flower. But they\r\nsent you away; and now your return dazzles me with the brilliance and\r\nbeauty of the full bloom. This was the past--_this_ is the present!\"\r\n\r\nAnd reaching up, the man suddenly snapped off the glowing blossom from\r\nthe cactus and held it before the girl, close to the pale camellia bud\r\nhe had plucked before.\r\n\r\nShe raised her beautiful face, crowned with its halo-like glory of\r\nhair, full to him; and the expression it took was graver and more\r\nwomanly than before. But still no agitation reflected in the candid\r\neyes that looked steadily into his, and the voice, more softly\r\npitched, had no tremor in it, as she answered:\r\n\r\n\"_Please_ think of me, then, as the child you used to know; never as\r\nthe _débutante_ who must be fed, _à la_ Bouncey, on the sweets of\r\nsentiment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take sentiment--I mean the higher sentiment, that lifts us sometimes\r\nabove our baser worldly nature--out of life, and it is not worth the\r\nliving,\" Morris said earnestly. \"That man could not understand it any\r\nmore than he could understand you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you are right,\" she answered, quietly. \"_We_ are too old\r\nfriends to talk society at each other; and you are _so_ different from\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps Morris was luckier for not replying.\r\n\r\nIt may be that the Destiny, which, we are told, shapes our ends, did\r\nnot leave his so rough-hewn as it might have.\r\n\r\nHe himself could scarcely have told what thoughts were framing\r\nthemselves in his mind; what words had almost formed themselves on his\r\ntongue. There are moments in life, when we live at the rate of hours;\r\nand Van Morris was certainly going the pace, mentally, for those ten\r\nseconds of silence, before the echo of the girl's voice ceased\r\nvibrating on his ear. He was vaguely conscious, some ten seconds later\r\nstill, that rarely had a calm, well-posed man of the world found\r\nhimself quite so dizzy, from combined effects of a quick waltz, a\r\nflower-laden atmosphere, and a rounded arm pressing only restfully\r\nupon his own.\r\n\r\nSuddenly that pressure grew sharp and decided. They stopped abruptly\r\nat a sharp turn of the walk.\r\n\r\nOn a somewhat too small rustic seat, under the fruit-laden boughs of\r\nan orange tree, and comfortably screened thereby from the gleam of the\r\ntinted lantern, sat Miss Rose Wood and Mr. Andrew Browne.\r\n\r\nTheir two heads were rather close together; their two hands were\r\nsuspiciously distant, as though by sudden movement; and the lady's fan\r\nhad fallen at her feet, most _à propos_ to the crunch of the gravel,\r\nunder approaching feet.\r\n\r\nBut only Blanche--less preoccupied with her thoughts than her\r\ncompanion--had caught the words, \"Dismiss carriage--escort home,\"\r\nbefore Miss Wood's fan had happened to drop at her feet.\r\n\r\nWhat there might be in those words to drop the color out of rosy\r\ncheeks, or to clench white little teeth hard together, it might well\r\npuzzle one to guess. But the face that had not changed under the\r\nstrong music of Van Morris's voice, now grew deadly white an instant;\r\nthen flooded again with surging rush of color.\r\n\r\nBut very quickly, though with perfect self-possession, Miss Wood had\r\nrisen and advanced one step, to arrange Blanche's lace, with the\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\"Your _berthé_ is loose, darling!\"\r\n\r\nThen, as she inserted the harmless, unnecessary pin, she whispered in\r\nthe shell-like ear:\r\n\r\n\"_Don't_ scold me, loved one! Indeed, I was _not_ flirting. I only\r\ncame out here to keep him from the--_champagne punch!_\"\r\n\r\nBlanche made no reply to this whispered confidence; nor did she seem\r\nespecially grateful for the grace done to her toilette. She never so\r\nmuch as glanced at Andy Browne. He, also, had risen, after picking up\r\nthe dropped fan, with not effortless grace; and now stood smiling,\r\nwith rather meaningless, if measureless, good nature upon the\r\ninvaders.\r\n\r\nAnd Van Morris was all pose and _savoir faire_ once more. He might\r\nhave been examining Blanche on her progress in algebra, for all the\r\nconsciousness in his manner as he complimented Miss Wood on her\r\npeculiarly deft management of that dangerous weapon, the pin. But\r\nthere was no little annoyance in the whispered aside to his friend:\r\n\r\n\"Don't drink any more to-night, Andy. _Don't!_\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Van; I promise,\" responded the other, with the most\r\nbeaming of smiles. \"Tell you the truth, don't think I need it. Heat of\r\nthe room, you know--\"\r\n\r\n\"And the second pint of _Chambertin_ at dinner,\" finished Morris, as\r\nMiss Wood--the toilette and _her_ confidence both completed--slipped\r\nher perfectly gloved hand into Andy's arm again.\r\n\r\nPrecisely, then, three sharp notes of the cornet cut through the\r\nstillness under the flowers. It was followed by the indescribable\r\nsound, made only by the rush of many female trains towards one spot.\r\nLike the chronicled war-horse, Andy shook his mane at the first note;\r\nMiss Wood nodded beamingly over her shoulder at the second; and the\r\npair were hastening off by the time the third died away.\r\n\r\nBlanche showed no disposition to take the vacated seat.\r\n\r\n\"The German is forming,\" she said, \"and I am engaged to that colt-like\r\nMr. Upton.\"\r\n\r\nOnly at the door of the conservatory she paused.\r\n\r\n\"Does Mr. Browne ever drink too much wine?\" she asked abruptly.\r\n\r\nVan never hesitated one second. He lied loyally. \"Why, _never_, of\r\ncourse,\" he deprecated, in the most natural tone. \"With rare\r\nexceptions. But what deucedly sharp eyes she has,\" he added, mentally,\r\nas Mr. Upton informed them that \"the bell had tapped,\" and took\r\nBlanche off.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same moment, a waiter rushed by with a wine-cooler and\r\nglasses; and he heard the pompous butler direct:\r\n\r\n\"Set it by Mr. Browne's chair. He leads in _ler curtillyun!_\"\r\n\r\nMorris half started to countermand the order. Then he reconsidered and\r\nleaned against the doorway.\r\n\r\n\"He can't mean to drink it, after his promise to me,\" he thought.\r\n\"Anyway, he might get something worse. Besides, I am not his guardian;\r\nand,\" he added very slowly, a strange smile hovering about his lips,\r\n\"I can scarcely keep my own head to-night.\"\r\n\r\nSomehow he, best dancer in town as he was, had no partner to-night.\r\nThe sight before him had no novelty; and Mr. Trotter Upton's vivacious\r\nprancing somewhat irritated him, in spite of the amusement at himself\r\nhe felt at the sensation.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't think I was so far gone as to be jealous of Trotter,\" he\r\nmuttered.\r\n\r\nThen he slipped into the hat-room and was quickly capped and cloaked\r\nfor that precious boon to the bored, the exit _sans adieu_.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nIt was a raw, searching Christmas morning into which Van Morris\r\nstepped, as he softly closed the door of the Allmand mansion and\r\nturned up his fur collar against \"a nipping and an eager air.\"\r\n\r\nEven in that fashionable section the streets already showed somewhat\r\nof the bustle of the busy to-morrow. Belated caterers' carts spun by;\r\nearly butchers' and milk-wagons rumbled along, making their best speed\r\ntowards distant patrons. Here and there, gleams from gas-lit windows\r\nslanted athwart the frosty darkness, punctuated by ever-recurrent\r\nflaring of street lamps. Not infrequent groups of muffled men--some\r\njovial with reminiscent scenes of pleasure left behind, and some\r\nhilarious from what they brought along with them--passed him, as he\r\nstrode rapidly along the echoing flags, too intent on his own thoughts\r\nto notice any of them.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, from beneath one of the gloom punctuators opposite, a\r\nwoman's voice cut the air sharply:\r\n\r\n\"_Please_ let me pass!\"\r\n\r\nMorris, alert in a second, had crossed the street and joined the group\r\nof four intuitively, before he knew it himself. Three young men, whose\r\nevening dress told that they were of society, and whose unsteady hold\r\nof their own legs, that they had had just a little too much of it,\r\nbarred the way of a young girl. Tall, slight, and with a mass of\r\nblonde hair escaping from the rough shawl she drew closer about her\r\nhead as she shrank back, there was something showing through her\r\nwomanly terror that spoke convincingly the gentlewoman. The trio\r\nchuckled inanely, making elaborate bows; and the girl shivered as she\r\nshrank further into the shadow, and repeated piteously:\r\n\r\n\"Do, _please_, let me pass! _won't_ you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly they will,\" Van answered, stepping up on the pavement and\r\ntaking her in at a glance. \"Am I not right, gentlemen?\" he added\r\nurbanely to the unsteady trio.\r\n\r\n\"Not by a damned sight!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who the devil are you?\" were the prompt and simultaneous rejoinders.\r\n\r\n\"That doesn't matter,\" Van answered quietly; \"but you are obstructing\r\nthe public streets and frightening this evident stranger.\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't know any stranger at two o'clock in the morning,\" was the\r\nillogical rejoinder of the third youth, who clung to the lamp-post.\r\n\r\n\"What about it, anyway?\" said the stoutest of the three, advancing\r\ntowards Morris. \"Do _you_ know her?\"\r\n\r\n\"_You_ evidently do not,\" Van replied; then he turned to the girl\r\nwith the deference he would scarce have used to the leader of his\r\nset. \"If you will take my arm, I will see you safely to the nearest\r\npoliceman.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl hesitated and shrunk back a second; then, with that\r\ninstinctive trust which--fortunately, perhaps--is peculiarly feminine,\r\nslipped her red, ungloved little hand into his arm.\r\n\r\nThe leader of the trio staggered a step nearer. \"You're a nice\r\nmasher,\" he said thickly; \"but if it's a row you're looking for, you\r\ncan find one pretty quick!\"\r\n\r\nMorris glanced at the man with genuine pity.\r\n\r\n\"You look as though you might be a gentlemen when you are sober,\" he\r\nsaid. \"_I_ am not looking for a row; and if you boys make one, you'll\r\nonly be more ashamed of yourselves on Christmas day than you should be\r\nalready. And now I wish to pass.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll give you a pass,\" the other answered; and, with a lurch, he\r\nfronted Morris and put up his hands in most approved fighting form. At\r\nthe same moment, the girl--with the inopportune logic of all girls in\r\nsuch cases--clung heavily to Morris's arm and cried piteously:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no! You mustn't! Not for me!\" and, as she did so the man lunged\r\na vicious blow with his right hand, full at Morris's face.\r\n\r\nBut, though like J. Fitz-James, \"taught abroad his arms to wield,\" Van\r\nMorris had likewise used his legs to wrestle in England, and had\r\nmoreover seen _la savatte_ in France. With a quick turn of his head,\r\nthe blow passed heavily, but harmlessly, by his cheek. At the same\r\ninstant his foot shot swiftly out, close to the ground, and with a\r\nsharp sweep from right to left, cut his opponent's heels from under\r\nhim, as a sickle cuts weeds, sprawling him backwards upon the\r\npavement.\r\n\r\nDrawing the girl swiftly through the breach thus made, Morris placed\r\nher behind him and turned to face the men again. They made no rush, as\r\nhe had expected; so he spoke quickly:\r\n\r\n\"You'd better pick up your friend and be off. You don't look like boys\r\nwho would care to sleep in the station,\" he said, \"and here comes the\r\npatrol wagon.\"\r\n\r\nThey needed no second warning, nor stood upon the order of their\r\ngoing. The downed man was on his feet; and it was devil take the\r\nhind-most to the first corner. For the rumbling of heavy wheels and\r\nthe clang of heavy hoofs upon the Belgian blocks were drawing nearer.\r\n\r\nTo Van's relief, for he hated a scene, it proved to be only a\r\n\"night-liner\" cab, though with rattle enough for a field battery; but\r\nto his tipsy antagonists it had more terror than a park of Parrot\r\nguns.\r\n\r\n\"Can I do anything more for you?\" he asked the girl; then suddenly:\r\n\"You're not the sort to be out alone at this hour of the night. Are\r\nyou in trouble?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, indeed I am!\" she answered, with a sob; again illogical, and\r\nbreaking down when the danger was over. \"What _must_ you think of me?\r\nBut mother was suddenly _so_ ill, and father and sister were at a\r\nball, and the servants slipped away, too. I dared not wait, so I ran\r\nout alone to fetch Doctor Mordant. _Please_ believe me, for--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Cab!\" broke in Van. \"Certainly I believe you,\" he answered the\r\ngirl, as the cab pulled up with that eager jerk of the driver's\r\nelbows, eloquent of fare scented afar off. \"I'll go with you for\r\nDoctor Mordant, and then see you home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, is that _you_, Mr. Morris?\" cried Cabby, with a salute of his\r\nwhip _à la militaire;_ but he muttered to himself, \"Well, I _never_!\"\r\nas he jumped from the box and held the door wide.\r\n\r\n\"That's enough, Murphy,\" Van said shortly. \"Now, jump in, Miss, and\r\nI'll--\" But the girl shrank back, and drew the shawl closer round her\r\nface. \"No, I won't either. Pardon my thoughtlessness; for it isn't\r\nexactly the hour to be driving alone with a fellow, I know. But you\r\ncan trust Murphy perfectly. Dennis, drive this lady to Dr. Mordant's\r\nand then home again, just as fast as your team can carry her!\" And he\r\nhalf lifted the girl into the carriage.\r\n\r\n\"That I will, Mr. Van,\" Murphy replied cheerily, as he clambered to\r\nhis seat.\r\n\r\nThe girl stretched out two cold, red little hands, and clasped his\r\nfur-gloved one frankly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! thank you a thousand times,\" she said. \"I _knew_ you were a\r\ngentleman at the first word to those cowards; but I never dreamed you\r\nwere Mr. Van Morris. I've heard sister speak of you _so_ often!\"\r\n\r\n\"_Your_ sister?\" Van stared at the cheaply-clad night wanderer, as\r\nthough _he_ had had too much Regent's punch.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sister Rose--Rose Wood,\" she said, with the confidence of\r\nacquaintance. \"I'm her sister, you know--Blanche.\"\r\n\r\n\"Blanche? Your name is Blanche? I cannot tell you how happy I am to\r\nhave chanced along just now, Miss Wood;\" and Van bared his head in the\r\ncutting night wind to the blanket-shawled girl in the night-liner, as\r\nhe would not have done at high noon to a duchess in her chariot. \"But\r\nI'm wasting your time from your mother; so good-morning; and may your\r\nChristmas be happier than its eve.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-by! And oh, _how_ I thank you!\" the girl said, again extending\r\nher hand over the cab door. \"I'll tell Rose, and _she_ shall thank\r\nyou, better than I can!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-night! But don't trouble _her_,\" Van said, releasing the girl's\r\nhand. \"One minute, Murphy,\" he added aside to the driver; \"here's your\r\nChristmas-gift!\"\r\n\r\nA bright gold piece glinted in the dirty fur glove, in which Dennis\r\nMurphy looked to find a shilling under the next gas-lamp.\r\n\r\n\"Blanche! and the same golden hair, too!\" Van muttered to himself, as\r\nthe cab rocked and ricketted down the street. \"Well, I suppose that is\r\nwhat the poet means by 'the magic of a name'!\" and he suddenly\r\nrecalled that he was still standing bareheaded in the blast. \"And Rose\r\nWood's sister looks like that! Well, verily one half the world does\r\n_not_ know how the other half lives!\"\r\n\r\nThen he turned and strode rapidly homeward; pulling hard, as he\r\nthought many strange thoughts, on the dead cigar between his lips.\r\n\r\nOnce in his own parlor, Van Morris walked straight to the mirror over\r\nthe mantel, and looked long and steadily at himself. Then he tossed\r\nMr. Allmand's half-smoked cigar contemptuously into the grate, lit one\r\nhe selected carefully from the carved stand near, and threw himself\r\ninto a smoking-chair before the ruddy glow of coals.\r\n\r\n\"I must be getting old,\" he soliloquized. \"I didn't use to get bored\r\nso easily by these things. Either balls are not what they were, or _I_\r\nam not. Now, 'there's no place like home!' Not much of a box to call\r\nhome, either!\" And he glanced round the really elegant apartment in\r\nhalf-disgust. \"There's _something_ lacking! Andy's the best fellow in\r\nthe world, but he's so wanting in order. Poor old boy! Wonder if he\r\n_will_ drink anything more? I surely must blow him up to-morrow\r\nmorning. How deucedly sharp _she_ is!\" and he smiled to himself. \"She\r\nsaw through Rose Wood's game at a glance. Wonder if she saw through\r\n_me_?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked steadily into the glowing coals, as though castles were\r\nbuilding there. Once or twice his lips moved soundlessly; and suddenly\r\nhe reached over to the escritoire near by, and taking an oval case\r\nfrom it, opened it, and gazed long and earnestly at the picture in it.\r\nThe face was the average one of a young girl, with stiff plaits of\r\nhair stiffly tossed over the shoulder, in futile chase after grace;\r\nbut the wide blue eyes were a glory of purity and trust, and they were\r\nthe eyes of Blanche Allmand.\r\n\r\nThen he rose abruptly, walked to the sideboard, and filled a glass\r\nwith water. Then he placed carefully in it the cactus flower and\r\ncamelia bud, which had never left his hand since he plucked them in\r\nthe conservatory. As he did so, Morris' face grew serious, and looked\r\ndown wistfully into the fire.\r\n\r\nWhen he raised his eyes they were full of hopeful light, and they\r\nrested long and steadily upon the flowers.\r\n\r\n\"Yes! It _is_ better!\" he exclaimed aloud, as though continuing a\r\ntrain of thought. \"Some of _that_ family bloom only once in a\r\ncentury. I cannot look for miracles, and many a hand may reach for\r\n_my_ flower. Yes, to-morrow shall settle it! The Italian was even\r\nmore philosopher than poet when he said, '_Amare e no essere amato\r\ne tiempo perduto_'!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Andrew Browne tumbled into the cosy parlor of that bachelor's\r\nbox at 4 A.M. on Christmas morning, he was by all odds the happiest\r\nman of his acquaintance, even if he knew himself, which was more than\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\nHe slammed the door, slung his fur-lined overcoat across the sofa,\r\nturned up the gas until it whistled merrily, and poked the fire until\r\nit roared again. Then he hunted the boot-jack, and drew off one boot;\r\nchanged his mind, and flung himself into the smoking-chair, and\r\nstretched booted and unbooted foot to the blaze. Thus posed, he\r\ntrolled out, \"_Il segreto per esser felice_,\" in a rich baritone; only\r\ninterrupting his _tempo_ to spit out superfluous ends, bitten from his\r\ncigar, in the effort to phrase neatly and smoke at the same time.\r\n\r\n\"Why the deuce don't you get to bed?\" growled Van Morris from the next\r\nroom. He was aroused from dreams of Blanche Allmand, music, diamond\r\nsolitaires, and orange-blossoms, mixed into one sweet confusion. \"Stop\r\nyour row, can't you? and go to bed!\"\r\n\r\n\"You go to bed yo'sef!\" responded the illogical Andy, rising, not too\r\nsteadily, on his one boot, and throwing wide the folding-door. \"Who\r\nwants to go to bed? _I_ sha'n't.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're an idiot!\" muttered Mr. Morris; and he turned his face to the\r\nwall.\r\n\r\n\"Guess am an idiot,\" responded Andy, blandly. \"But I ain't tight,--only\r\nhappy! I'm the happiest idiot--_Il segreto per ess_--Say, Van! I'm so\r\n_devilish_ happy, ol' boy!\"\r\n\r\nMorris turned over with a groan, and pulled the covering over his\r\nhead. The strong, small word he uttered as he did so is not to be\r\nfound in the church service. But Andy was not to be snubbed in that\r\nstyle. He stepped forward; attempted to sit on the bed's edge;\r\nmiscalculated his momentum, and succeeded in landing plump on the\r\ncentre of his friend's person.\r\n\r\n\"Confound you!\" gasped the latter, breathless. \"You're as drunk as--as\r\na fool!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I ain't,\" chuckled Andy, imperturbably happy. Then he laughed\r\ntill the bed shook; composing himself suddenly into gravity, with a\r\nfierce snort--\"No, I ain't: you're sober!\"\r\n\r\n\"And when _she_ asked, I said you never drank,\" reproached the irate\r\nand still gasping Morris. \"I _lied_ for you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Tha's nothing. I'll lie for you; lie for you to-morrow--see'f I\r\ndon't! Say, Van, ol' boy, I ain't tight; only happy--_so_ happy! Van!\r\n_Van!_\" and he shook the pretended sleeper heavily. \"I'm goin' to\r\nreform! I'm goin' to be married!\"\r\n\r\n\"_What? Rose Wood?_\"\r\n\r\nVan Morris sat bolt upright in bed now. The tone of voice in which he\r\ninvoked Miss Wood might have brought response from that wise virgin,\r\ndisrobing for triumphant rest full ten blocks away.\r\n\r\nBut he found it vain to argue with Andy's mixed Burgundy and champagne\r\npunch. Contradiction but made him insist more strongly that he _was_\r\nengaged to the old campaigner, whom Morris had so manoeuvred to\r\noutflank. Finally, in a miscellaneous outfit of evening pants,\r\nnight-gown, and smoking-cap, he succeeded in getting the jubilant\r\ngroom _in futuro_ into bed, where he still hummed at the much-sought\r\nsecret of happiness, until he collapsed with a sudden snore, and slept\r\nlike the Swiss.\r\n\r\nThen Morris walked the floor rapidly, wrapped in thought and a cloud\r\nof fragrant cigar-smoke. Then he threw himself once more into the\r\nsmoking-chair, and gazed long and earnestly into the coals, a heavy\r\nfrown resting on his face. Suddenly it cleared off; the sunshine of a\r\nbroad smile took its place; and Van tossed the end of his cigar\r\nexultingly into the fire. Then he rose and stretched himself like a\r\nveritable son of Anak, when\r\n\r\n           \"Stalwart they court the rapture of the fight.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have it, by George!\" he cried. \"I'll get the poor fellow out of\r\nthis box, if the old girl did induce him to pop, and accepted him out\r\nof hand! Andy! I say, Andy, wake up!\" and he ran into his chum's room,\r\ndragged him out of bed, and had him at the fire, before he was well\r\nawake.\r\n\r\nMr. Andrew Browne was no longer in a mood even approaching the\r\njubilant. He had utterly forgotten the secret _per esser felice_,\r\nduring his two hours' nap. He confessed to a consuming desire for\r\nCongress-water, and made use of improper words upon finding only empty\r\nbottles, aggravating in reminiscence of it, in the carved ebony\r\nsideboard.\r\n\r\nFinally he sat down, with his head in his hands, and told his story\r\ndismally enough.\r\n\r\nMiss Rose Wood's carriage had been dismissed, as per programme. Andy\r\nhad led the German with her, and a bottle of champagne at his side. He\r\nhad walked home with her; had told her--in what wild words he knew\r\nnot--that he loved her; and had been, as Van had surmised, \"accepted\r\nout of hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, Van, I'm bound, as a man of honor, to marry her!\" finished the\r\nnow thoroughly dejected _fiancé_. \"Yes, I know what you'd say; it _is_\r\na pretty rum thing to do; but then she mustn't suffer for my cursed\r\nfolly!\"\r\n\r\n\"Suffer? Rose Wood _suffer_ for missing fire one time more?\"\r\n\r\nSurprise struggled with contempt in the exclamation Morris shot out by\r\nimpulse.\r\n\r\n\"But, if she loves me well enough to engage--\" Andy began, rather\r\nfaintly; but his mentor cut him short.\r\n\r\n\"Love the d--_deuce!_\" he retorted. \"Why, she's a beggar and a\r\nhusband-trap!\"\r\n\r\n\"But her family? What will _they_ think?\" pleaded Andy, but with very\r\nlittle soul in the plea.\r\n\r\n\"Poor little Blanche!\" muttered Morris, half to himself. \"Bah! the\r\ngirl _has_ no heart!\"\r\n\r\n\"Blanche?\" echoed Van, in a dazed sort of way. \"Why, you don't suppose\r\nBlanche will know it! I never thought of _her!_\" and he rose feebly,\r\nand stood shivering in his ghostly attire.\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course, Rose Wood couldn't keep such great news. Why, man,\r\nyou're the capital prize in the matrimonial lottery; but hang me if\r\nMiss Wood shan't draw another blank this time!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a compound of deadly nausea and effortful dignity in the\r\nelbows Mr. Andrew Browne leaned upon the mantel, which hinted volumes\r\nfor what his face might have said, had it been visible through the\r\nfingers latticed over it.\r\n\r\n\"I am a gentleman,\" he half gasped. \"It _may_ be a trap; but I'll keep\r\nmy word, and--_marry_ her, unless--unless, Van, you get me out of\r\nit!\"\r\n\r\n\"Go to bed, you spoon!\" laughed his friend. \"I have the whole plan cut\r\nand dried. I'll teach you your lesson as soon as you sleep yourself\r\nsober.\"\r\n\r\nMorris stood many minutes by the bedside of his quickly-sleeping\r\nfriend; but, when he turned into the parlor again, his face was pale\r\nand stern.\r\n\r\n\"The way of the world, always,\" he said aloud. \"One inanely eager,\r\nanother stupidly backward. 'Fools rush in where angels fear to tread!'\r\nPoor boy! he'd give as much to-morrow to unsay his words as I would to\r\nhave spoken those I nearly said last night!\"\r\n\r\nThe chill gray dawn outside was wrestling at the windows for entrance\r\nwith the sickly glaring gas-light within. Morris drew aside the heavy\r\ncurtains and pressed his forehead against the frost-laced pane. Long\r\nhe looked out into the gray haze with eyes that saw nothing beyond his\r\nown thoughts. Then he turned to the fire again. The gray ash was\r\nhiding the glow of the spent coals. Then he took up the glass once\r\nmore and looked earnestly at the contrasted flowers it held. He\r\nreplaced it almost tenderly, and walked slowly to his own room.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know _myself_,\" he said; \"I think I know _her_. I'll hesitate\r\nno longer; some fool may 'rush in.' To-morrow shall settle it. The\r\ntough old Scotchman was right:\r\n\r\n                 'He either fears his fate too much,\r\n                    Or his deserts are small,\r\n                 That dares not put it to the touch\r\n                    To gain or lose it all!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nThat same afternoon, at two o'clock, Mr. Vanderbilt Morris's stylish\r\ndog-cart, drawn by his high-spirited bays, drew up at Miss Rose Wood's\r\ndomicile. Holding the reins sat Mr. Andrew Browne, beaming as though\r\n_Chambertin_ had never been pressed from the grape; seemingly as fresh\r\nas though headache had never slipped with the rest out of Pandora's\r\nbox.\r\n\r\nBut it may have been only seemingly; for, faultlessly attired from\r\nscarf-pin to glove tips, Andy was still a trifle more uneasy than the\r\ndancing of his restless team might warrant in so noted a whip as he. A\r\nqueer expression swept over his handsome face from time to time; and,\r\nas he came to a halt, he glanced furtively over his shoulder, as\r\nthough fearing something in pursuit.\r\n\r\n\"Ask Miss Rose if she will drive with me,\" he said hurriedly to the\r\nservant. \"Say I can't get down to come in; the horses are too fresh.\"\r\n\r\nThen the off-horse danced a polka in space, responsive to deft\r\ntickling with the whip.\r\n\r\nMiss Wood did not stand upon ceremony, nor upon the order of her\r\ngoing, but went at once to get her wraps.\r\n\r\n\"Better late than never,\" she said to herself, as she dived into a\r\ndrawer and upset her mouchoir case in search for a particular\r\nhandkerchief. \"I really couldn't comprehend his absence and silence\r\nall day--but, poor boy! he's _so_ young!\" And then Miss Rose, as she\r\ntied a becoming cardinal bow under her chin, hummed two bars of \"The\r\nWedding March\" through the pins in her mouth.\r\n\r\nTwo minutes later saw her seated on the high box beside her future\r\nlord _in posse_; the bays plunging like mad and Andy swinging to the\r\nreins as if for life. For, before she could speak one word--and for no\r\nreason to her apparent--he had let the limber lash drop stingingly\r\nacross their backs.\r\n\r\nVery keen was the winter wind that swept by her tingling ears; and\r\nMiss Wood raised her seal-skin muff and hid her modest blushes from\r\nit. For that gentle virgin had ever a familiar demon at her elbow. His\r\nname was Experience; and now he whispered to her: \"A red nose never\r\nreflects sentiment!\"\r\n\r\n\"And _he_ is so particular how one looks,\" Miss Rose whispered back to\r\nthe familiar; and her tip-tilted feature sought deeper protection in\r\nthe furs.\r\n\r\nAt length, when well off the paved streets, the mad rush of the brutes\r\ncooled down to a swinging trot--ten miles an hour; Browne's tense arms\r\nrelaxed a trifle; and he drew a long, deep breath--whether of relief,\r\nor anxiety, no listener could have guessed. But he kept his eyes still\r\nrooted to that off-horse's right ear as though destiny herself sat\r\nupon its tip.\r\n\r\nThen, for the first time, he spoke; and he spoke with unpunctuated\r\nrapidity, in a hard, mechanical tone, as though he were a bad model of\r\nEdison's latest triumph, and some tyro hand was grinding at the\r\ncylinder.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Rose,\" he began, \"we are old friends--never so old; but I can\r\nnever sufficiently regret--last night!\"\r\n\r\nHe felt, rather than saw, the muff come sharply down and the face turn\r\nfull to him; regardless now of the biting wind.\r\n\r\n\"No! don't interrupt me,\" he went on, straight at the off-horse's\r\nright ear. \"I _know_ your goodness of heart; _know_ how it pained you;\r\nbut you could have done nothing else but--_refuse me!_\"\r\n\r\nMiss Rose Wood's mouth opened quickly; but a providential gutter\r\njolted her nearly from the seat; and the wind drove her first word\r\nback into her throat like a sob.\r\n\r\nThe inexorable machine beside her ground on relentless.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I understand what you would say: that you refused me _firmly_\r\nand _finally_ because I--_deserved it!_\" Had Andy Browne's soul really\r\nbeen the tin-foil of the phonograph, it could not have shown more\r\nutter disregard of moral responsibility. \"You knew I was under the\r\ninfluence of wine; that I would never have dared to address you had I\r\nbeen myself! I repeat, I deserve my--_decisive rejection!_ It was\r\nproper and just in you to say '_No!_'\"\r\n\r\nWoman's will conquered for one brief second. Spite of wind and spite\r\nof him, Miss Wood began:\r\n\r\n\"'_No?_' I--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, '_no!_'\" broke in the relentless machinery. It ground on\r\nimplacable, though great beads stood on Andy's brow from sheer terror\r\nlest he run down before the end. \"_No!_ as firmly, as emphatically as\r\nyou said it to me last night. Indeed, I honor you the more for flatly\r\nrefusing the man who, in forgetting his self-respect, forgot his\r\nrespect--_for you!_ But, Miss Rose, while I pledge you my honor never,\r\n_never_ to speak to you again _of love_, I may still be--_your\r\nfriend!_\"\r\n\r\nThe bays were bowling down the street again by this time; when another\r\n_kismet_, in small and ugly canine form, flew at their heads with yelp\r\nand snarl. Rearing with one impulse, the spirited pair lunged forward\r\nand flew past the now twinkling lamps in a wild gallop. Andy pulled\r\nthem down at last; their swinging trot replacing the dangerous rush.\r\nThe Wood mansion was almost in sight; but the Ancient Mariner was a\r\ntyro to Andy Browne in the way he fixed that off-horse's right ear\r\nwith stony stare.\r\n\r\nHe might have looked round in perfect safety. The lithe figure by him\r\nsat gracefully erect. The face a trifle pale; the lips set tight\r\nagainst each other, with the blood pressed out of them, were not\r\nunnatural in that cutting wind. The eyes, fixed straight ahead, as his\r\nown, gleamed gray and cold; only a half-closing of the lids, once or\r\ntwice, hiding an ugly light reflecting through them from the busy\r\nbrain behind. But Andy never turned once until he brought up the bays\r\nstock still and leaped down to offer his hand to the lady at her own\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nShe took it, naturally; springing to the ground as lightly as any\r\n_débutante_ of the season. Not one trace of annoyance, even, showed on\r\nthat best educated face.\r\n\r\n\"Andy, we _are_ old friends,\" she said, offering her hand frankly.\r\n\r\nHe took it mechanically, with a dazed soft of feeling that he must be\r\neven a bigger fool than he felt himself.\r\n\r\n\"Real friends,\" Miss Wood went on, pleasantly, \"and I'll prove it to\r\nyou now. _You_ have acted like a man of honor to me; _I_ will betray\r\none little confidence, and make two people happy!\"\r\n\r\nThe man still stood dumb; and his eye furtively wandered to the pawing\r\noff-horse, as if to take _his_ confidence as to what it meant. The\r\nwoman's next words came slowly, and she smiled; a strange smile the\r\nlips alone made, but in which the glinting gray eyes took no share.\r\n\r\n\"For Van Morris is your best friend, after all. He will remember that\r\nI told him, last night, 'One cannot be too careful'!\"\r\n\r\nShe rose on tiptoe, whispered three words, and was gone before he\r\ncould frame one in reply.\r\n\r\nOnce more those ill-used bays got the whip fiercely; and they turned\r\nthe corner so short that Mr. Trotter Upton looked over his shoulder\r\nwith a grin, and remarked to the blaze-faced companion in his sulky\r\nshafts:\r\n\r\n\"Nine hundred dollars' worth of horse risked with nine dollars' worth\r\nof man! Van Morris better drive his own stock. G'long!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nIt was two o'clock when Mr. Andrew Browne had ridden forth to\r\nrecapture his plighted troth.\r\n\r\nThe shades of Christmas evening had now wrapped the city completely,\r\nand the gilt clock upon his parlor mantel now pointed to six. Still he\r\nhad not returned; and still Van Morris's eagerness to test the issue\r\nof his own tactics was too keen to let him leave their rooms. He had\r\neven resisted the temptations of a gossip at the club, and was smoking\r\nhis fifth cigar--a thought-amused smile wreathing his lips--when the\r\nchime of six startled him suddenly to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"How time flies!\" he exclaimed. \"And we are to dine at the Allmand's\r\nat seven.\"\r\n\r\nHe tossed away his cigar, turned into his own apartment, and made an\r\nunusually careful toilet. Then he looked into Browne's still vacant\r\nroom once more.\r\n\r\n\"Where _can_ he be?\" he muttered. \"By George! he must have bungled\r\nfearfully if he did not pull through. He certainly had his lesson by\r\nheart! But _she_ must not be kept waiting,\" and his face softened\r\ngreatly, and the deep, strong light came back into his eyes. \"How\r\nceaselessly that old verse comes back to me! And now 'to put it to the\r\ntest' myself.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned to his escritoire, and took a small Russia case from the\r\ndrawer; then to the mantel, and carefully shook the dampness from the\r\ntwo flowers he had placed there that morning. Putting case and flowers\r\ncarefully in his vest pocket, Van paused at the door, gave a long,\r\nsweeping glance--with a sort of farewell in it--to the rooms; then\r\nshut himself outside, still repeating _sotto voce_,\r\n\r\n                 \"He either fears his fate too much,\r\n                   Or his deserts are small.\"\r\n\r\nMetropolitan Christmas was abroad in the streets. Young and old,\r\ngrandsire and maiden, beggar and parvenu jostled one another on the\r\npavements. Rough men, laden with loosely-wrapped, brown-papered\r\npackages, strode happily homeward; wan women skurried along leading\r\neager children from unwonted shopping for dainties; carriages rolled\r\nby, with the gas-light glimpsing on occupants in evening dress, driven\r\nChristmas dinnerward.\r\n\r\nVan Morris recked little of all this, as he strode rapidly over the\r\nvery spot where his coolness had saved an ugly misadventure twelve\r\nhours before. His brain was going faster than his body; one goal only\r\nhad he in view; one refrain ever sounded in his memory: \"To gain, or\r\nlose, it all!\"\r\n\r\nA quick turn of the corner, and he stood at the door he had quietly\r\nescaped from during the ball. The servant replied to his inquiry that\r\nMiss Blanche was in the library; and thither he turned, with the\r\nfreedom of long intimacy.\r\n\r\nOnly the warm glow of fire-light filled the room; there was a rustle,\r\nas of a retreating silk dress. There was also a man's figure, backed\r\nby the fire, with that not infrequent expression all over it that\r\ntells he would really be at his ease if he only knew how.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Andy! And in your driving suit!\"\r\n\r\n\"Van, dearest old boy,\" cried the other, irrelevantly, \"congratulate\r\nme! I'm the luckiest dog alive!\"\r\n\r\n\"With all my heart,\" Van answered, shaking the proffered hand\r\nheartily. \"I was sure it would come out all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were?\" Andy fairly beamed. \"She said so!\"\r\n\r\n\"What? _she_ said so? Did Rose Wood expect you to break off, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no! Not _that_. She said she knew you'd be glad of the match.\"\r\n\r\n\"Glad of--the match!\" Van stared at his friend, with growing suspicion\r\nin his mind.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you dear old Van! I'm engaged, and just the happiest of--\"\r\n\r\n\"_Engaged?_\" and Van seized Andy by the shoulders with both hands.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, all fixed! And Rose Wood is just the dearest, best girl after\r\nall! I'd never have known happiness but for her!\"\r\n\r\nVan Morris turned the speaker full to the firelight, and stared hard\r\nin his face.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't have believed it, Andy,\" he said, contemptuously. \"You\r\nhave come _here_ drunk again!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed! I have pledged my word to _her_ never to touch a drop!\"\r\nprotested Andy, with imperturbable good nature. \"And, Van, _she has\r\naccepted me_.\"\r\n\r\n\"_She?_\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Rose said, 'Morris has his heart set on the match;' I went\r\nstraight on that hint, and Blanche Allmand will be Mrs. Andrew Browne\r\nnext Easter.\"\r\n\r\nMorris answered no word.\r\n\r\nWith a deep, hard breath, he turned abruptly, strode to the alcove\r\nwindow, and peered through the curtains into the black night beyond. A\r\ngreat surge of regret swept over him that shook the strong man with\r\npain pitiful to see. He pressed his forehead against the cold glass;\r\nand the contrast, so strong, to the hope with which he had looked out\r\nthus at the gray dawn, sickened him with its weight. There was a boom\r\nin his ears, as of the distant surf; and his brain mechanically groped\r\nafter a lost refrain, finding only the fragment: \"To lose it all!\r\n_lose it all!_\"\r\n\r\nBut heart-sickness, like sea-sickness, is never mortal, and it has the\r\ninestimable call over the latter of being far less tenacious. And Van\r\nMorris was mentally as healthy as he was physically sound. He made a\r\nstrong effort of a strong will; and turned to face his friend and\r\nhis--fate. In his hand he held a wilted camellia bud and a crushed\r\ncactus flower.\r\n\r\nMoving quickly to the fire, he tossed them on the glowing coals;\r\nwatching as they curled, shrivelled, and disappeared in the heat's\r\nmaw. Then he moved quietly to the window and looked into the night\r\nonce more.\r\n\r\nWholly wrapped up in his new-found joy, Andy Browne saw nothing odd in\r\nhis friend's manner or actions. He moved softly about the room, and\r\nonce more hummed, \"_Il segreto per esser felice_;\" very low and very\r\ntenderly this time.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the rustle of silk again sounded on Morris's ear.\r\n\r\nHe turned quickly, and looked long, but steadily, into the beautiful\r\nface. It was very quiet and gentle; glorified by the deeper content in\r\nthe eyes and the modest flush upon the cheek. His face, too, was very\r\nquiet; but it was pale and grave. His manner was gentle; but he\r\nretained the little hand Blanche held out to him, in fingers that were\r\nsteadier than her own.\r\n\r\n\"I reminded you last night,\" he said, very gravely, \"how long we had\r\nbeen friends, Blanche. It is meet, then, that I should be the first to\r\nwish you that perfect happiness which only a pure girl's heart may\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\nThen, without a pause, he turned to Andy, and placed the little Russia\r\ncase in his hand. As it opened, the eye of a dazzling solitaire\r\nflashed from its satin pillow.\r\n\r\n\"Andy, old friend,\" he added, \"Rose Wood told you only the truth. I\r\n_had_ set my heart on Blanche's happiness; and only this morning I got\r\nthat for her engagement ring. Put it on her finger with the feeling\r\nthat Van Morris loves you both--better than a nature like Rose Wood's\r\ncan ever comprehend.\"\r\n\r\nT. C. De Leon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE WINDOWS OF A GREAT LIBRARY.\r\n\r\n        \"The dead alive and busy.\"--Henry Vaughan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        Without, wind-lifted, lo! a little rose\r\n        (From the great Summer's heart its life-blood flows),\r\n        For some fond spirit to reach and kiss and bless,\r\n          Climbs to the casement, brings the joyous wraith\r\n        Of the sun's quick world, without, of joyousness\r\n          Into this still world of enchanted breath.\r\n        And, far away, behold the dust arise,\r\n        From streets white-hot, into the sunny skies!\r\n        The city murmurs: in the sunshine beats,\r\n        Through all its giant veins of throbbing streets,\r\n        The heart of Business, on whose sweltering brow\r\n        The dew shall sleep to-night (forgotten now).\r\n        There rush the many, toiling as but one;\r\n        There swarm the living myriads in the sun;\r\n        There all the mighty troubled day is loud\r\n        (Business, the god whose voice is of the crowd).\r\n        And, far above the sea-horizon blue,\r\n        Like sea-birds, sails are hovering into view.\r\n        There move the living; here the dead that move:\r\n          Within the book-world rests the noiseless lever\r\n          That moves the noisy, throngèd world forever.\r\n        Below the living move, the dead above.\r\n\r\nJohn James Piatt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"GOING, GOING, GONE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\"Take it to Rumble. He will give you twice as much on it as any other\r\npawnbroker.\"\r\n\r\nThe speaker was a seedy actor, and the person he addressed was also a\r\nfollower of the histrionic muses. The latter held before him an ulster\r\nwhich he surveyed with a rueful countenance.\r\n\r\nIt was not the thought of having to go to the pawnbroker's that made\r\nhim rueful, for he would have parted with a watch, if he had possessed\r\none, with indifference; but the wind that whistled without and the\r\nsnow that beat against the window-pane made him shiver at the thought\r\nof surrendering his ulster. However, he had to do it. Both he and his\r\nfriend were without money, and it was New Year's eve, which they did\r\nnot mean to let pass without a little jollification. Therefore they\r\nhad drawn lots to determine which should hypothecate his overcoat in\r\norder to raise funds. The victim was preparing to go to the\r\nsacrifice.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" continued his friend, \"take it to Rumble. He is the Prince of\r\nPawnbrokers. Last week I took a set of gold shirt studs to him. He\r\nasked me at what I valued them. I named a slightly larger sum than I\r\npaid for them, and the old man gave me fully what they cost me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us go at once to Rumble's,\" said the other, seizing his hat, and\r\nthe two sallied forth into the night and the storm.\r\n\r\nDown the street they went before the wind-driven snow. Fortunately\r\nthey did not have far to go.\r\n\r\nWhen they opened the door of Rumble's shop, the old pawnbroker looked\r\nup in surprise. The tempest seemed to have blown his visitors in. The\r\nwindows rattled; the lights flared; fantastic garments, made in the\r\nstyle of by-gone centuries, swayed to and fro where they hung, as\r\nthough the shapes that might have worn them haunted the place; a set\r\nof armor, that stood in one corner, clanked as though the spirit of\r\nsome dead paladin had entered it and was striving to stalk forth and\r\ndo battle with the demons of the storm; while the gust that had\r\noccasioned all this commotion in the little shop went careering\r\nthrough the rooms at the rear, causing papers to fly, doors to slam,\r\nand a sweet voice to exclaim:\r\n\r\n\"Why, father, what is the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, my dear, it is only the wind,\" answered the old man, as he\r\nadvanced to receive his visitors.\r\n\r\nThe one with whom he was acquainted nodded familiarly to the\r\npawnbroker, while he of the rueful countenance pulled off his ulster\r\nand threw it on the counter, saying:\r\n\r\n\"How much will you give me on that?\"\r\n\r\nRumble, who was a large man, rather fleshy and slow of movement,\r\nstarted toward the back of the shop with a lazy roll, like a ship\r\nunder half sail. He made a tack around the end of the counter and hove\r\nto behind it, opposite the men who had just come in. He pulled his\r\nspectacles down from the top of his bald head, where they had been\r\nresting, drew the coat toward him, looked at it for an instant, then\r\nraised his eyes till they met those of his customer.\r\n\r\n\"How much do you think it is worth?\" he said, uttering the words\r\nslowly and casting a commiserating glance at the thinly-clad form of\r\nthe man before him.\r\n\r\n\"I paid twenty dollars for it,\" said the young man. \"It is worth ten\r\ndollars, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes!\" returned the pawnbroker. \"Shall I loan you ten dollars on\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you please,\" answered his customer, whose face brightened when he\r\nheard the pawnbroker's words. He had thought he might get five dollars\r\non the ulster. The prospect of getting ten made him feel like a man of\r\naffluence.\r\n\r\nThe pawnbroker opened a book and began to fill the blanks in one of\r\nthe many printed slips it contained. One of the blanks he filled with\r\nhis customer's name, James Teague. That was his real name, not the one\r\nby which he was known to the stage and to fame. That was far more\r\naristocratical.\r\n\r\nAs Rumble handed Teague the ticket and the ten dollars, he took a\r\nstealthy survey of his slender and poorly-clad form, then glanced\r\ntoward the window on which great flakes of snow were constantly\r\nbeating, driven against it by the wind that howled fiendishly as it\r\nwent through the street, playing havoc with shutters and making the\r\nswinging sign-boards creak uncannily.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Dixon,\" said the pawnbroker, turning to Teague's companion, \"will\r\nnot you and your friend wait awhile until the storm slackens? It is\r\npleasanter here by the fire than it is outside.\"\r\n\r\nHis visitors agreed with him and accepted his invitation. They seated\r\nthemselves beside the stove which stood in the center of the room,\r\nand from which, through little plates of isinglass, shone cheerful\r\nlight from a bed of fiery coals. Both leaned back in their chairs;\r\nboth turned the palms of their hands toward the stove, to receive the\r\ngrateful heat; and when the old pawnbroker joined them, smiling\r\ngenially as he sank into his great arm-chair, which seemed to have\r\nbeen made expressly for his capacious form, the same thought came to\r\nboth of his guests. To this thought Dixon gave expression.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Rumble,\" he asked, \"how happened it that you became a pawnbroker?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I might say that it was by chance,\" replied Rumble. \"I was not\r\nbred to the business.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought not,\" answered Dixon, as he and his friend exchanged\r\nknowing glances.\r\n\r\n\"I was a weaver by trade,\" continued Rumble, \"and until two years ago\r\nworked at that calling in England, where I was born. But I made little\r\nmoney at it, and when an aunt, at her death, left me five hundred\r\npounds, I decided to come to this country and go into a new\r\nbusiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what put it into your head to choose that of a pawnbroker?\" asked\r\nDixon.\r\n\r\n\"Because everybody told me that larger profits were made in it than in\r\nany other. You see I am getting on in years, and I have a daughter for\r\nwhom I must provide. When I die I want to leave her enough to make her\r\ncomfortable.\"\r\n\r\nThe street door was opened and for a moment the room was made\r\ndecidedly uncomfortable by a cold blast accompanied by driving snow.\r\nAgain the windows rattled, the armor clanked, and the hanging suits\r\nswung and shook their armless sleeves in the air.\r\n\r\nA tall, slight young man, clad in well-worn black clothes, stood by\r\nthe door. Although his beardless pale face was the face of youth, it\r\nwas not free from the marks of care, and in his large lustrous dark\r\neyes there was a yearning look that spoke, as plainly as words, of\r\ndesires unfulfilled.\r\n\r\nDixon and Teague exchanged glances which as much as said, \"here's\r\nanother customer for the pawnbroker.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is Miss Rumble in?\" said the newcomer in a hesitating manner, as he\r\nturned toward the old pawnbroker.\r\n\r\n\"You wouldn't have her out on such a night, would you, Mr. Maxwell?\"\r\nsaid Rumble, laughing. \"She is in the sitting-room,\" he added,\r\npointing to the rear; \"go right in.\"\r\n\r\nBut Maxwell did not go right in. He knocked lightly at the door, which\r\nin a moment was opened by a young woman, whose girlish face and\r\nwillowy figure presented a vision of loveliness to those in the outer\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nAs Maxwell disappeared in the sitting-room, Dixon and his friend again\r\nexchanged glances which showed that they had changed their opinion in\r\nregard to the newcomer's relations with the pawnbroker.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" asked Teague, \"have the profits in this business met your\r\nexpectations?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not been in it long enough to tell, for I have not had an\r\nauction,\" replied Rumble. \"In one respect, however, I have been\r\ndisappointed. Very few articles on which I have loaned money have been\r\nredeemed. I don't understand it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you are too liberal with your customers,\" said Dixon.\r\n\r\n\"You would not have me be mean with them, would you?\" answered Rumble.\r\n\"Why, you know they must be in very straitened circumstances to come\r\nto me. If I took advantage of people's poverty, I would expect that\r\nafter their death all the old women who have pawned their shawls with\r\nme would send their ghosts back to haunt me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I never thought of that,\" murmured Dixon. \"If their ghosts do\r\ncome back what very lively times some pawnbrokers must have!\"\r\n\r\n\"But if your customers do not redeem their goods, how do you expect to\r\nget your money back?\" asked Teague.\r\n\r\n\"From auctions,\" replied the pawnbroker.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" was Teague's response.\r\n\r\n\"You should have a good auctioneer,\" said Dixon.\r\n\r\n\"The goods will bring a fair return,\" replied Rumble quietly.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was apparent that the pawnbroker had begun to mistrust his\r\nmethods of doing business, it was also evident that he had great faith\r\nin auctions. He had attended auctions in his time and had bid on\r\narticles, only to see them go beyond the length of his modest purse.\r\nNow, he said to himself, the auctioneer would be on his side. The\r\nbidding would go up and up and up, and every bid would bring just so\r\nmuch more money into his pocket. Altogether he was well satisfied.\r\n\r\nThe faces of his guests showed that they at once admired and pitied\r\nthe old man. They admired his generosity and his faith in human\r\nnature, and wished that other pawnbrokers with whom they had dealt had\r\nbeen like him; they pitied him, for they knew that he would have a\r\nrude awakening from his dream when the hammer of the auctioneer\r\nknocked down his goods and his hopes of getting back the money he had\r\nloaned on them.\r\n\r\n\"It is time we were going,\" said Dixon, at last, as his eyes fell on a\r\ntall hall clock that stood in a corner, quietly marking the flight of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then let us go,\" answered Teague, as he cast a dismal look at\r\nthe windows, against which the snow was still driven in volleys by the\r\nwind that howled as loudly as ever.\r\n\r\nIt was the pawnbroker's turn to pity his visitors.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid you will take cold going from this warm room out into the\r\nstorm,\" he said to Teague. \"Let me lend you an overcoat. You see I\r\nhave more here than I have any use for,\" he added jocosely.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I could not think of letting you lend me one!\" exclaimed Teague,\r\nblushing probably for the first time in his life.\r\n\r\nDixon laughed quietly as he enjoyed his friend's confusion, while the\r\npawnbroker looked among his stock for a coat that would fit Teague.\r\nPresently he advanced with one which he held out with both hands, as\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n\"Let me help you put it on.\"\r\n\r\nTeague protested.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you can bring it back to-morrow when you come this way,\" added\r\nRumble.\r\n\r\n\"But how do you know I will bring it back?\" said Teague. \"I am a\r\nstranger to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, your friend is good surety for you,\" replied the pawnbroker. \"He\r\nis one of my few customers who have redeemed their pledges.\"\r\n\r\nA thundering blast struck the house. The wind beat at the windows as\r\nthough it meant to smash them.\r\n\r\nThe sound of the tempest persuaded Teague to accept the pawnbroker's\r\noffer. Without another word he caught the edge of either sleeve with\r\nhis fingers and put his arms out behind, while Rumble put the overcoat\r\non him. His arms, however, never found the ends of its capacious\r\nsleeves. It was almost large enough for a man of twice Teague's size.\r\nDixon had a fit of laughter at his friend's expense, and even the\r\npawnbroker could not forbear a smile.\r\n\r\n\"It is rather large for you, isn't it?\" said Rumble. \"Let us try\r\nanother.\" And then he added: \"Why, your own fits you best, of\r\ncourse.\"\r\n\r\nThen seizing Teague's ulster, which still lay on his counter, he threw\r\nit over its owner's shoulders, and bade the two men a hearty\r\ngood-night as they went forth into the storm.\r\n\r\nWhen he had succeeded in closing the door in the face of the tempest,\r\nhe turned the key in the lock, and then, with a shiver, returned to\r\nthe fire. As he stood before the stove he smiled and seemed to be\r\nchuckling over the thought that he had made Teague wear his own coat.\r\nHis face wore a happy look. He had a clear conscience. He knew that he\r\nwas a philanthropist in a small way, and had helped many a poor soul\r\nwhen the light of hope was burning dimly. But he took no credit to\r\nhimself for this. The opportunity of doing a little good had come in\r\nhis way, and he had not let it pass; that was all. Besides, as he\r\noften said, he expected to make money in his business. He simply\r\nconducted it on more liberal principles than most pawnbrokers. When he\r\nwent into it he was told that a large proportion of pawnbrokers'\r\ncustomers never redeemed their pledges, and that by advancing on goods\r\npawned only a small percentage of their value, a great deal of money\r\nwas made in the sale of unredeemed articles. He thought, therefore,\r\nthat it was only just to loan on whatever was brought to him nearly as\r\nmuch money as he deemed it would bring at auction. To do anything less\r\nwould, in his opinion, have been to cheat his customers. Besides, if\r\nhe loaned more money on goods, in proportion to their value, than\r\nother pawnbrokers, his return in interest was also greater when the\r\ngoods were redeemed. This was the peculiar principle on which he did\r\nbusiness, and it is needless to say that he did a very large business,\r\nmuch to the disgust of all other pawnbrokers having shops in his\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\nIt was not strange, therefore, that, as he stood before the fire on\r\nthat New Year's eve, the face of old John Rumble wore a contented\r\nsmile. The knowledge of having done good brings content, if it brings\r\nnothing else; and the pawnbroker knew that he had done well by his\r\ncustomers, and he thought, also, that his customers had done well by\r\nhim, as he surveyed his full shelves.\r\n\r\nWhile he stood there musing, the door of the sitting-room was opened\r\nand his daughter appeared.\r\n\r\n\"Come, father,\" said the girl. \"If you don't hurry you will not have\r\nthe punch ready by midnight.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man's face assumed an anxious expression, and he started with\r\na roll for the sitting-room.\r\n\r\nNot to have the punch ready to drink in the New Year at the stroke of\r\nmidnight, would indeed be a calamity. He had never failed to welcome\r\nthe New Year with a brimming cup. His father had done so before him,\r\nhis daughter had done so with him, and he hoped his grandchildren\r\nwould do so after him.\r\n\r\n\"Bring the punch-bowl, Fanny,\" he said, as he went to a cupboard and\r\ntook out a big black bottle.\r\n\r\nHis daughter brought him an old-fashioned blue china bowl and hot\r\nwater, and while he made the punch, Maxwell told him of his plans for\r\nthe coming year, about which he had been talking with Fanny.\r\n\r\nArthur Maxwell, who was a civil-engineer, had been followed by\r\nill-fortune for some time. Indeed, he made Rumble's acquaintance in a\r\npurely business way; but he called it good fortune that had led him to\r\nthe pawnbroker's door, for otherwise he would not have known Fanny.\r\nAnd now fortune seemed really to smile on him. He had secured a\r\nposition with a railroad company, and was going to Colorado as an\r\nassistant of its chief engineer, who had charge of the construction of\r\na railway there.\r\n\r\nAnd then, hesitating, he told the old man that Fanny had promised to\r\nbe his wife as soon as he could provide a home for her.\r\n\r\nThe pleasure which Rumble had expressed, as Maxwell told of his good\r\nfortune, was a little dashed by this last bit of information. Of\r\ncourse he had expected that his daughter would leave him sometime, and\r\nhe had not been blind to the fact that Maxwell had gained a place in\r\nher affections; nevertheless, he was not quite prepared for this news,\r\nand it left a shadow on his kindly face.\r\n\r\n\"But, father,\" said Fanny, advancing quickly, and placing her arm\r\nabout his neck and her head on his shoulder, \"Arthur and I hope that\r\nwe shall all be together. He may return to New York; but if we have a\r\nhome in the West you might live with us there.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a loving, tender look which Rumble gave his daughter as she\r\nuttered these words.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the clock began to strike, horns were heard in the\r\nstreet, bells were rung, and in a lull in the storm the musical notes\r\nof a chime fell on their ears.\r\n\r\nRumble filled the cups, and then, raising his, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Here's to the New Year, and here's to your success, Arthur, and to\r\nFanny's happiness.\"\r\n\r\nAnd while the clock was still striking, the three drank in the New\r\nYear.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThat year, however, was not a fortunate one for Rumble. His little\r\nfund had dwindled. He had, as he thought, barely enough to conduct his\r\nbusiness to the time when he could legally have an auction. But how\r\nwas he to do this and pay his rent? That problem troubled him. It was\r\nfinally solved by the consent of his landlord, in consideration of a\r\nhigh rate of interest, to wait for his rent until Rumble had his\r\nauction. When this arrangement was made, the pawnbroker, who had been\r\ngloomy for some time, again wore a cheerful look. His daughter had\r\nadvised him to pay his rent and curtail his business for the time\r\nbeing; but that, he said, would never do; and when he had tided over\r\nthe crisis in his affairs, he went on distributing his money among the\r\npeople who brought him their old clothes and their all but worthless\r\njewellery.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time pawnbrokers called on him and tried to persuade him\r\nthat his method of doing business was a mistake; that it was not only\r\nhurting their business, but was ruining himself. Rumble was not\r\nconvinced. If his way of doing business took from the profits of other\r\npawnbrokers, they were only meeting with justice, he said; they had\r\nmade money enough out of the poor; he meant to treat his customers\r\nbetter. He admitted that he might not get his money back from some of\r\nhis investments, but then the auction would make it all right; what he\r\nlost in one way he would get back in another. He looked to the auction\r\nas to a sort of Day of Judgment, when there would be a grand evening\r\nof accounts.\r\n\r\nAt last the great day came--the day of the auction. Rumble was full of\r\nthe importance of the event, and had donned his best clothes in honor\r\nof the occasion. He had advertised the auction in several newspapers,\r\nand he expected a large attendance. He was somewhat disappointed when,\r\na little while before the time set for the sale, it began to rain; but\r\nhe hoped for the best.\r\n\r\nWhen the auctioneer rapped on his desk and announced that he was about\r\nto open the sale, there were not more than a dozen people in the room.\r\nAmong them Rumble recognized several pawnbrokers, and the others\r\nlooked as though they might belong to the same guild. He wondered why\r\nthey were there. Had they come to bid--to bid at his auction, on goods\r\non which he had loaned more money than they would have loaned? He did\r\nnot understand it.\r\n\r\nWhen the sale began Rumble took a seat near the auctioneer and\r\nwatched the proceedings. He soon understood why the pawnbrokers were\r\nthere. The prices obtained were absurdly small. There was very little\r\ncompetition, and the sale had not gone far before it dawned on\r\nRumble's mind that the pawnbrokers had a tacit understanding that they\r\nwould not bid against one another, but would divide the stock among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe poor old man's heart sank, and great beads of perspiration\r\nappeared on his brow, as lot after lot went for almost nothing. All\r\nhis worldly possessions were melting away before his eyes, and he had\r\nnot the power to put out his hand and save them. Was he dreaming? No,\r\nfor he could hear the auctioneer's voice, loud and clear, crying:\r\n\r\n\"Going--going--gone!\"\r\n\r\nHe turned his head and saw his daughter standing in the sitting-room,\r\nnear the open doorway, with her eyes fixed upon him. Her face was\r\nwhite, white as the 'kerchief about her neck. She understood it all.\r\nYes, it was all too real.\r\n\r\n\"Going--going--gone!\"\r\n\r\nAgain those terrible words rang like a knell in his ears, and every\r\ntime he heard them he knew that he was a poorer man; he knew that more\r\nof his little stock had gone at a sacrifice.\r\n\r\nAt last he scarcely heeded the words of the auctioneer, but sat\r\nstaring before him like one spell-bound. The buzz of conversation\r\nabout him seemed like a sound coming from afar, like the roll of waves\r\non the seashore; and through it all, at intervals, like the faint note\r\nof a bell warning seamen of danger, came those words telling of his\r\nown wreck:\r\n\r\n\"Going--going--gone!\"\r\n\r\nWhen the auction was over Fanny went to her father's side. He was\r\napparently dazed. She helped him to rise. He leaned heavily upon her\r\nas she led him into the sitting-room, where he sank back into a chair,\r\nand did not utter a word for a long time. At last, when he found\r\nvoice, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Going--going--gone! It's all gone, Fanny, all gone! We are ruined!\"\r\n\r\nThe sale on which Rumble had built so many hopes, realized but little\r\nmore than enough to pay the rent he owed. He did not have money enough\r\nto continue his business, and a few days after the auction his\r\npawnshop was closed.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, to add to their distress, Fanny had received a letter\r\nfrom Arthur Maxwell, informing her that the railroad company with\r\nwhich he had found employment had failed, owing him several hundred\r\ndollars--all his savings. He wrote that there was a prospect that a\r\nlabor-saving invention of his would be put in use in one of the mines.\r\nThis was the only gleam of hope in the letter. Fanny answered it,\r\ngiving Arthur an account of the misfortune which had befallen her\r\nfather. Although she gave him the number of the new lodging into which\r\nthey moved when her father's shop was closed, she received no reply.\r\nShe had hoped soon to have some cheering word from him, but none came.\r\nShe could not understand his silence. This, in addition to her other\r\ntroubles, seemed more than she could bear.\r\n\r\nSince the auction Rumble had not been a well man. His nerves at that\r\ntime had received a shock from which he had not recovered.\r\n\r\nBetween nursing her father, and earning what little she could by\r\nsewing, Fanny had a hard time. The pittance she got for her work did\r\nnot go far toward meeting their expenses. Rumble had given up his shop\r\nin the early autumn, and the little money he had saved from the wreck\r\nhad disappeared when winter set in. At last it became necessary to\r\npawn some of their household goods. Fanny would not let her father go\r\nthe pawnbroker's, but went herself. When she returned, and showed him\r\nthe little money she had obtained on the articles she had pledged, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Why, I would have given twice as much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, father,\" answered Fanny, \"but all pawnbrokers are not like\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" muttered the old man. \"If they were they would be poor like\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Rumble was not able to work, he was always talking of what he\r\nwould do when he felt a little stronger. He worried continually\r\nbecause he was dependent upon his daughter, and every time she went to\r\nthe pawnbroker's he had a fit of melancholy.\r\n\r\nAt last, just before Christmas, he became seriously ill. The doctor,\r\nwhom Fanny called in, said he had brain fever, and gave her little\r\nhope of his recovery. His mind wandered, and seemed to go back to the\r\nauction, of which he spoke almost constantly. Many times he repeated\r\nthe words of the auctioneer, that had made such a deep impression on\r\nhim: \"Going--going--gone!\"\r\n\r\nIt was a gloomy Christmas for Fanny, and when New Year's eve came she\r\nwas still watching by the bedside of her father, whose fever had\r\nreached its crisis.\r\n\r\nHer thoughts went back to another New Year's eve, when Arthur Maxwell\r\nhad told her of his plans for the future. And it had been so long\r\nsince she had heard from him!\r\n\r\nShe had to get some medicine which the doctor had ordered, and while\r\nher father slept, asking an acquaintance who lodged on the same floor\r\nto watch over him, she went out, taking with her a gold locket which\r\nshe meant to pawn.\r\n\r\nAlthough she knew that a pawnbroker had opened a shop where her father\r\nhad kept his, she had never gone to it. But something seemed to lead\r\nher there that evening. When she reached the place her heart almost\r\nfailed her; but, summoning courage, she entered the shop, and\r\npresented the locket to the pawnbroker. While he was examining it two\r\nmen entered. The pawnbroker's clerk waited on them. She seemed to feel\r\ntheir eyes on her.\r\n\r\nWhen she gave the pawnbroker her name, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Rumble? Frances Rumble? Why, a young man was here to-day inquiring\r\nfor Mr. Rumble, and some time ago the carrier brought two letters here\r\nfor you. I could not tell him where you lived, and he took them\r\naway.\"\r\n\r\nFanny's heart beat wildly. She was sure that the letters were from\r\nArthur, and that it was he who had inquired for her father.\r\n\r\n\"Is this Miss Rumble?\" said one of the men who had followed her into\r\nthe shop.\r\n\r\nShe turned and recognized Dixon. The person with him was Teague. Dixon\r\nhad just pawned a watch, and had remarked that he wished Rumble still\r\nkept the shop.\r\n\r\nWhen Fanny told them of her father's illness and of his misfortune,\r\nDixon and Teague insisted on going home with her, meaning to lend\r\nassistance in some way.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached Fanny's humble lodging, and followed her into her\r\nfather's room, they found Maxwell at Rumble's bedside.\r\n\r\nA cry of joy escaped Fanny as her lover folded her in his arms. She\r\nsoon learned from him that he had never received the letter in which\r\nshe wrote him about her father's trouble and their removal from the\r\nold shop. It had missed him while he was moving about in the West. And\r\nthen he told her of the success of his invention.\r\n\r\nRumble, whose mind was lucid for the moment, said:\r\n\r\n\"You will be happy at last, Fanny. Arthur has come for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, too, will be happy with us, father,\" replied Fanny, taking\r\nhis hands in hers.\r\n\r\nThe old man smiled faintly, and rolled his head to and fro on his\r\npillow, as if he thought differently.\r\n\r\nThe clock began to strike; it was midnight, and the New Year was at\r\nhand. The sound of bells came to their ears, and a distant chime was\r\nheard.\r\n\r\nRumble's mind once more began to wander; again he talked about the\r\nauction; again he muttered the words that had troubled him so much:\r\n\r\n\"Going--going--gone!\"\r\n\r\nThey were his last words. The old man's life went out with the old\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nAlbert Roland Haven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROOT OF THE SPOILS SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is known as the spoils system of politics, in a measure common to\r\nall times and all forms of government, seems to have reached its\r\nhighest development in our Republic. This fact justifies the suspicion\r\nthat something in our form of administration is favorable to such\r\ndevelopment; and whether we regard the spoils system as praiseworthy\r\nor reprehensible, it will be instructive to inquire why it has\r\nprevailed in this country as among no other free people.\r\n\r\nMost persons who deplore the spoils system urge as one of its greatest\r\nevils that it substitutes for the discussion of principles a mere\r\nscramble for office; that it teaches men to value the material prizes\r\nincident to government above political truth. Such reasoners have\r\nstrangely mistaken cause for effect. The rarity of ideas in our\r\npolitical discussions is not an effect, but the immediate cause of the\r\nspoils system; and behind both, as the direct cause of the latter and\r\nthe remote cause of the former, lies the difficulty of expressing the\r\npopular will in legislative enactment. In other words, we have\r\nsubstituted the pursuit of place for the discussion of principles,\r\nbecause the relations of the people to the law-making body are not\r\nsufficiently close.\r\n\r\nNo reader of this periodical needs to be reminded that when our\r\npresent constitution was written the mass of freemen had not, as now,\r\ncome to believe that a constitutional government should include a\r\nlegislature promptly obedient to the popular will; a ministry\r\ndependent upon the support of a majority in the popular branch of the\r\nlaw-making body; and an executive powerless to interfere in\r\nlegislation. It was natural, then, that our forefathers, imperfectly\r\nacquainted with this modern device of free peoples, should have\r\nbelieved that they had secured the prompt and certain efficacy of the\r\npopular will in government by placing no restriction as to national\r\nelections upon the wide suffrage already prevailing in most of the\r\nStates, and providing that the chief magistrate and both branches of\r\nthe national legislature should be elective and chosen for short\r\nterms. They could not foresee that in course of time a constitutional\r\nmonarch would come to have less power than the executive head of the\r\nRepublic; that an hereditary House of Lords less often than an\r\nelective Senate would dare to cross the will of the popular\r\nlegislative body; that the popular branch of the legislature in a\r\nconstitutional monarchy would, in effect, change at will the\r\nadministrative head of the government, while in the new Republic\r\npremiers would retain power despite the adverse verdict of the people\r\nas expressed in legislative majorities; and, finally, that the\r\nenfranchised portion of a people dwelling under a constitutional\r\nmonarchy would determine at the ballot-box every great question\r\narising in their politics, and drive from power all men who should\r\ndissent from the popular decision, while the whole people of the\r\nRepublic might be balked not only of their will in matters upon which\r\nthey had distinctly made up their minds, but even of bringing\r\nquestions thus potentially decided to the practical test of the\r\nballot-box, and of introducing other important issues into the realm\r\nof popular discussion.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of procuring from the people of the United States an\r\nunequivocal decision upon any political question, and of expressing\r\nthat decision in legislative enactment, is familiar to every student\r\nof our history. The questions that occupy Congress now are in large\r\npart the same that were debated there forty years ago, save that the\r\nissue of slavery and the extreme States' rights theory have\r\ndisappeared. But even in these cases the exceptions prove the rule;\r\nfor it is grimly significant of our legislative immobility that the\r\ntwo great questions of a century should finally have been settled by\r\nthe sword. If the people declared for anything at the general election\r\nof 1884, they may be supposed to have declared for a revision of the\r\ntariff, since the platform of principles adopted by each great party\r\nat its National Convention affirmed the necessity of such revision;\r\nyet Congress not only failed to legislate for that object, but\r\nactually at one time refused to discuss a measure designed to meet the\r\nissue in question, and at another stopped in the midst of such\r\nlegislation to test the popular will upon the very same matter.\r\nFurthermore, while it will be assumed by most persons that whatever\r\nthe significance of the election four years ago, the contest just\r\nended sets the seal of disapproval upon the recent effort of the House\r\nof Representatives to revise the tariff; yet we hear already that the\r\nLI. Congress can hardly escape some such legislation as has just been\r\nattempted. The truth is, that the election of 1884, as all our\r\nelections, was in the main a struggle for spoils. The question at\r\nissue was not tariff revision or any other great economic idea, but\r\nwhich party should administer during the next four years the great\r\npatronage of the Federal Government. In the contest of November last\r\nthe people for the first time in twenty years had a living issue\r\npresented, but so unused were they to the discussion of economic\r\nprinciples that it may be questioned whether the verdict just\r\ndelivered with so much apparent emphasis was really the expression of\r\na well-ascertained public opinion. It is worthy of note, too, that\r\nbelievers in the spoils system of politics are already taunting the\r\nvanquished with the folly of presenting a political idea to the\r\nAmerican people, and prophesying a more rigid exclusion of principles\r\nfrom politics in all time to come.\r\n\r\nSuch difficulties have beset us throughout all our history. Let men\r\nwince as they would under galling injustice and false economics, they\r\ncould not work their will upon the body whose duty it is to express in\r\nlegislation the political desires of the people. A mocking fate seemed\r\nto balk the accomplishment of our most earnest purposes, and men whose\r\ninterests were adverse to the public good constantly took it upon\r\nthemselves to declare that the people had not spoken upon whatever\r\nvital question was uppermost, or that their words had meant something\r\nother than they seemed to mean. The result of all this was what we\r\nsee. A self-governing people must have some sort of political\r\nactivity, and since it was early discovered that the discussion of\r\nprinciples was little better than a vain occupation, the pursuit of\r\nplace soon became almost the sole object of political organization. If\r\nit was almost impossible to carry a question from the stage of popular\r\ndiscussion to that of legislative enactment, it was a very simple\r\nmatter to elect presidents and congressmen who should see to a proper\r\ndistribution of places. Since men could not accomplish the rational\r\nobject of political endeavor, they strove for what was easily\r\nattainable. If they could not make the laws they could at least fill\r\nthe offices. Then came the easy descent to Avernus. Politics having\r\nbecome a mere struggle for place, public affairs were left more and\r\nmore in the hands of men who found such work congenial, and the mass\r\nof the people, to whom the hope of office is but a shadowy illusion,\r\nbecame less and less interested in a struggle that held for most\r\nvoters neither the promise of gain nor the incentive of high purpose.\r\nThe spoils system having thus been established, the causes that bred\r\nit were in their turn intensified by its reaction, and the evil round\r\nwas complete. To make matters worse, the struggle for wealth,\r\nstimulated by the marvellous richness of a part of the country,\r\nclaimed the attention of thousands to the exclusion of politics, and\r\nthose who would naturally have led in affairs of State adopted the\r\nevil philosophy that it is cheaper to be robbed by professional\r\npoliticians than to neglect private business for the sake of public\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nHaving sought thus to trace the steps by which our form of administration\r\nhas begotten the spoils system, let us endeavor to prove the conclusion\r\nby another process of reasoning. Were our government a parliamentary\r\nsystem, such as exists among the free peoples of the Old World, we\r\nshould have a legislature promptly responsive to movements of the popular\r\nwill, a ministry sitting in one or the other house of Congress, and\r\ndependent for continuance in power upon the support of a majority in the\r\nLower House, and an executive disarmed in whole or in part of the power\r\nto negative legislative enactments. The result would be to concentrate\r\ninterest not as now upon the election of a president whose chief\r\nfunction is to distribute places, and whose part in legislation is\r\nalmost purely negative, but upon the choice of the legislative body whose\r\nmajority should determine the political complexion of the president's\r\nadvisers and the general policy of the administration. At each general\r\nelection for members of the Lower House the issue would be some\r\nwell-defined question then under hot discussion, and in most instances\r\nCongress would have been dissolved for the express purpose of taking the\r\nsense of the people upon the matter at issue. Public interest in\r\npolitical discussion would return, because great principles, such as\r\nhave an important bearing upon the lives of all men, would be under\r\ndebate, and the mass of voters would have such an incentive to activity\r\nas the shadowy hope of place could never furnish. The knowledge that\r\nthe popular will would find prompt expression through the law-making\r\npower would render it impossible for the people to be turned from their\r\npurpose by the jugglery of place-hunters.\r\n\r\nWith a whole people interested in political discussion no conceivable\r\nabuse of patronage could balk them of their will, and the spoils\r\nsystem would disappear because the factitious importance of\r\noffice-holders and office-seekers, favored by the defects of our\r\npresent form of administration, could no longer obscure the vastly\r\ngreater question of the public weal. This change in the popular\r\nattitude toward politics would be sufficient of itself to seal the\r\ndoom of the spoils system; but if other influences were needed they\r\nwould be found in the new relations of the ministry to the legislature\r\nand the people, since a cabinet bound to take the initiative in great\r\nlines of policy and required to give an account of itself to a hostile\r\nminority in Congress would have little time and less stomach for the\r\nnice apportionment of political rewards to partizan deserts. Finally,\r\nshould we adopt the principle of a ministry dependent upon the support\r\nof a majority in the Lower House, the possibility of two changes of\r\nadministration within a single year would make the spoils system, as\r\nwe now have it, unendurable and unworkable. Indeed, it may be\r\nquestioned whether a rigid application of the spoils system by the\r\nadministration coming into office in March 1889 would not place the\r\nevils of that system in a peculiarly glaring light, when it is\r\nremembered that a very large number of those who would be asked to\r\nmake places for party workers unversed in the routine of public office\r\nhave exercised their official functions for barely four years, and but\r\nrecently acquired the skill so necessary to the efficient transaction\r\nof business.\r\n\r\nThe attentive reader will have noted that it has been argued, first\r\nthat the spoils system is the natural and inevitable outcome of the\r\nrigidity that seems unseparable from our form of administration; and\r\nsecond, that such a system, in its grossest development, is almost\r\nimpossible under a parliamentary government. The latter line of\r\nargument has been taken less for its own sake than for the purpose of\r\nstrengthening the conclusions reached by the former; and the writer\r\nwould not be understood as insisting that to eliminate the spoils\r\nsystem we must adopt exactly such a parliamentary form as now exists\r\namong the free peoples of Europe. Any system that should make it easy\r\nto ascertain the popular will, and should insure the prompt and\r\ncertain expression of that will in legislation, would accomplish the\r\nobject of substituting principles for spoils in our politics. To\r\nsuggest a plausible plan for grafting upon our system this far more\r\ndemocratic scheme of administration would be a stupendous work,\r\ncalling for the highest exercise of trained political sagacity; but it\r\nis not difficult to indicate some of the things that need not be done.\r\nIt is not necessary that the president should be reduced to any such\r\nmere figure-head as is the monarch in the half-dozen parliamentary\r\ngovernments of Europe. Perhaps the principle of a ministry sitting in\r\nthe houses of Congress might be omitted; and it is not clear that the\r\npresident's veto would have to be altogether sacrificed. It is not\r\npositive, indeed, that a formal amendment of the constitution would be\r\nnecessary to obtain the essentials of the reform under consideration.\r\nWe have amended the spirit of the constitution in one highly important\r\nfeature without changing the letter of that instrument. Perhaps the\r\nnearest way to the object in view lies through a more intimate\r\nrelation between the cabinet and the committees of the Lower House.\r\n\r\nFinally, the consideration presents itself that if the conclusions\r\nreached here are correct, those persons who have sought by statutory\r\nrestriction and appeals to public conscience to abolish the spoils\r\nsystem have not employed the wholesome policy of attacking the evil at\r\nits source. They seem to be mowing rather than uprooting the weeds.\r\nDoubtless our political garden has been tidied, but the roots of the\r\nevil growth and the aptitudes of the soil remain. The reform system,\r\nas applied to the great body of minor clerical offices, will probably\r\nprevail from now on; but we can scarcely hope that the broad spirit of\r\ncivil service reform can reign in this land until the people shall\r\nhave made themselves immediate masters of the legislative power.\r\n\r\nEdward V. Vallandigham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNCLE SCIPIO.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce more the wizard of the Christmas-time lifts his wand in our\r\nhomes, brightening young eyes that look forward, dimming old ones that\r\nlook backward. Thou hast prisms of hope for the young; prisms of tears\r\nfor the old, but shining always in our souls with a light all thine\r\nown. We hail thee, lovely spirit of this matchless festival!\r\n\r\nWould that words could paint to you a picture which I carry in my\r\nheart! I see it through a light brilliant, yet tender, that Christmas\r\nmorning long ago in the old Georgia home. Those were dark days of war\r\nwhich I remember, and the shadow of death had already fallen on our\r\nhouse: but there was one day in the year when we did not feel its\r\nchill. What shadows can withstand the light of the Christmas fire in\r\nthe heart of a child?\r\n\r\nWe had grown to be pretty thorough Bohemians, my little brother and\r\nI, in those war days, and were ready to take any stray bit of sport,\r\nasking no questions whatever for conscience' sake. But the outlook was\r\nrather bad for us, one dreary December. The holidays were very near,\r\nand we saw no preparations for rendering the big dining-room royal\r\nwith holly and cedar, as usual, for King Cole's reception. We had\r\nalready ceased to press our grievances in the \"big house,\" for we\r\nfelt, through a child's instinct, that we were standing in the\r\npresence of griefs greater than our own.\r\n\r\nWe began to fear that Santa Claus had been killed in the war, or\r\nthat maybe he would not care to come to us now since the fire had\r\ngrown so small in the huge fire-place, where it used to roar and flash\r\naround the back-log, until the polished floor was flooded in light,\r\nand the candelabra's lights shone cold and pale as stars through a\r\nconflagration. Even the crimson rugs and hangings, that used to\r\nbrighten up the dark old floor and furniture, had disappeared, one\r\nby one, to be transformed into haversacks and warm garments for our\r\npoor boys at the front, whose hearts were stouter and courage more\r\nlasting than their regimentals. And so, we thought, poor little\r\ninfants! that perhaps our deity would desert the altars on which the\r\nfires burned so low, and would go, with all his wonderful store, to\r\nthe happy children away in the North. There, we were told, the cities\r\nblazed with light and merriment for weeks before his coming; there the\r\nsnow sometimes fell whole days at a time, until it lay like a white\r\ncarpet along the streets, where children could walk without fear,\r\nand which never echoed to the tramp of foes; for there the heavy\r\nbooming cannon never sounded to drown the chiming bells, and\r\nblanch the children's laughing lips with terror. Why, we argued,\r\nshould he not go there instead of driving his reindeer across\r\nbloody fields and deserted highways, to bring gifts to two poor\r\nlittle children? Truly we would have been comfortless in that sad\r\ntime but for one old standby, who had never yet failed us. Dear old\r\nUncle Scipio--his ebony face shines in the light of memory as it\r\nused to shine in the light of the kitchen fire. To him we turned in\r\nour trouble. We did not know all his worth then, but we knew him for\r\nthe sympathizer in all our childish griefs. Oh, those preposterous\r\nold stories he used to tell us! but they could raise the sheeted dead\r\nthen in every corner of the old kitchen, as we sat in awed silence\r\non his knee, and watched the supper fire die out.\r\n\r\nAnd not to us only, was Uncle Scipio the stay and comfort in those\r\ndark days, but to our mother also. He had been the guardian,\r\nplaymate, and tyrant of two eager boys, my brothers, through infancy,\r\nand through the sunny college days, when, with the school boy's\r\nprofanation of the classics, they had stumbled on the story of his\r\ngreat prototype, and laughingly called him \"Scipio Africanus.\" Through\r\ntear-dimmed spectacles he watched them march away, two boy soldiers,\r\nwith no premonition of misfortune on their faces, and minds full of\r\ngreat Shakespearian thoughts of \"all the pomp and circumstance of\r\nglorious war.\" And last of all, he stood by my father's stirrup when\r\nhe mounted to ride on his last journey, and took his final orders\r\nconcerning us.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, I remember, there was quite a disturbance among the\r\nnegroes; some were for following in the wake of the first Union troops\r\nthat should pass, as the only sure means of gaining their promised\r\nfreedom. These, we knew, had been trying to persuade Uncle Scipio to\r\njoin them. To us this was a thing too preposterous to think of; but I\r\nthink that mother and grandmother really had some doubts on the\r\nsubject. So one day the latter asked him what he should do if the\r\nopportunity should be offered him to go. I was balancing on the\r\nrockers of her chair at the time, and I shall never forget the look he\r\ngave her in reply.\r\n\r\n\"I can't go, ole missus,\" he said, shaking his gray head, as he rose\r\nfrom emptying an armful of lightwood knots into the wood box, and\r\ndusted the splinters from his sleeve. \"I can't go, nohow, and leave\r\nyoung missus and de chillun in dese yere times. Mars Ben he done die,\r\nand lef' me to take care o' dese yere darlins o' hisen, and no kind o'\r\nproclamation, dis side de Jordan o' def, gwine to free ole Scipio from\r\ndat charge.\"\r\n\r\n\"But don't you want to be free if the rest are?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, ole missus, but ef de Lord mean to bring freedom to dis ole\r\nnigger, he kin fin' him here. Ef He mean to fetch our people dry shod\r\ntru dis Red Sea o' blood, outen de house o' bondage, den when I hears\r\nde soun' o' dem timbrels, and de dancin', an' de shoutin', I praise\r\nHim too; but I don't tink He gwine to be angry kase one ole man love\r\nhis home so much 'til he got to stay behind and weep wid dem in de\r\nhouse where de eldest born am slain.\"\r\n\r\nAnd faithfully he kept his promise to the slain. But see! I began to\r\ntell you the story of that memorable Christmas-time, and am letting\r\nthe shadows of the intervening years crowd between me and the\r\nYule-log. Avaunt! ye ghosts of bitter days of want, of hatred and\r\ncontention; the spirit of peace and good-will exorcise ye from the\r\nhearth of Christmas memories!\r\n\r\nI was going to tell you how Uncle Scipio undertook to save us from\r\ndespair in that terrible time.\r\n\r\nWe, the much abused community of infants, had submitted with\r\ntolerable fortitude to taking our rye substitute for coffee,\r\nsweetened with sorghum, and similar hardships; but now, as the\r\nholidays approached, and we saw no signs of festivity, we began to\r\nfeel great apprehensions.\r\n\r\nWe resolved to confide our fears to Scipio.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think,\" I asked him one evening, as we sat in our usual\r\nevening attitudes before the fire, \"that old 'Santy' will forget us\r\nthis year because it is so cold and dark, and because everybody is so\r\nsad, and?--\"\r\n\r\nHere my griefs overcame utterance: I could say no more.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Lawd o' messy!\" cried the dear old creature, taking a closer\r\nlook at my tearful face. \"What dat yer sayin', chile? Ole Santy Claus\r\nforgit yer, honey? What make yer tink he gwine to forgit yer? Well,\r\nwell! You's a funny little chile, sho'--yer makes me laugh 'til I\r\ncries; sho' yer do.\"\r\n\r\nI noticed that he did take off his \"specs\" and wipe them with his\r\nyellow bandana, but I didn't see anything to laugh at. He gazed sadly\r\nenough, I thought, into the embers for awhile, and smoothed my hair in\r\na thoughtful way. Then an inspiration seized him; he saw his way\r\nthrough the dilemma. He straightened himself in his chair, and\r\nreadjusted his glittering ornaments across his nose. He assumed the\r\nair which all the country 'round knew as the precursor of something\r\noracular, for he was \"not 'zactly a preacher, no sah! but sort of a\r\n'zorter 'mongst de breren.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, my dear little chillun,\" he began, \"I dunno who tuk an' turned\r\nin an' put dat funny notion in yer heads 'bout ole Santa Claus\r\nforgitten yer, but pay 'tickler extension to what I'se gwine to say to\r\nyer. You mustn't go to kalklatin' on none o' dem high-falutin' tings\r\nwhat he used to fotch here fo' de wah sot in, fur de times is mighty\r\nhard, and de ole feller'll have to run de blockade to git yere\r\nt'all--sho' he will. But ef you sez you'll be powerful good til' dat\r\ntime, an' don't go to pesterin' yer ma 'bout it, I'll promise yer dat\r\nhe aint gwine to forgit yer altogedder.\"\r\n\r\nThis was surely consolation; but it required all our faith in Uncle\r\nScipio to keep our courage alive until the great day. It drew near and\r\nnearer, and still we saw no unusual stir in the house, and our hearts\r\nbegan to sink a little. At last it wanted but one day, and I shall\r\nnever forget that Christmas eve.\r\n\r\nUncle Scipio was very much preoccupied, and could not be disturbed by\r\nany means, that day; so we betook ourselves to the society of our\r\nelders. But there matters were worse. There was little of privation\r\nand bad news that we had not become pretty familiar with by this time,\r\nand war, I remember, seemed to me the normal condition of things. But\r\nit soon became clear to me that something a little worse than usual\r\nwas apprehended that day.\r\n\r\nThere were whispered conversations going on above our heads, but we\r\ncaught enough of it to know that a piece of terrible news had arrived.\r\nA party of refugees had passed through our town in the early morning.\r\nThey were a company of fragile women and children, with a few faithful\r\nnegroes, fleeing from their homes as from a pestilence. They told us\r\nthat a large company of Yankees had made their appearance a few miles\r\nabove us, and if they followed the most direct route to the railroad,\r\nwould, in all probability, reach us that night or the following day.\r\nOur little town being on the line of the railroad, rarely escaped the\r\nmilitary visitations. Besides, it was at this time the depository of a\r\ngreat deal of cotton, which it was feared might be the occasion of its\r\nbeing burned.\r\n\r\nI have heard mother say that this day before Christmas there were just\r\nthree able-bodied men in the town--the hospital doctor, the miller,\r\nand the conscript officer; not a very formidable defence against a\r\nhostile invasion. But I suppose those two lonely women, my mother and\r\ngrandmother, must have looked for help in this extremity, towards the\r\neverlasting hills where the twelve legions of angels lay encamped, for\r\nthey bore their anxiety like Spartans.\r\n\r\nThe day dragged through, however, and the last sun rays showed us no\r\nblue coats on the western road towards which aching eyes had turned\r\nthrough the heavy hours. Things began to look a little more hopeful.\r\nWe began to feel that reaction from anxiety which is almost sure to\r\ncome when the candles are lighted.\r\n\r\nWe sat close together in the sitting-room, and took our very frugal\r\nsupper there in quite a hysterical sort of cheerfulness.\r\n\r\nThe day had passed without disaster, and we had been told that in case\r\nthe \"Yankees\" should make their appearance during the night, and our\r\ngarrison of three be obliged to evacuate the town, the village\r\nchurch-bell would be rung to apprize the citizens of the situation.\r\n\r\nNo, we felt sure the enemy _could_ not come on Christmas eve. We even\r\nventured to hang up our stockings in the accustomed place.\r\n\r\nWe knelt, my brother and I, by dear old grandmother's knee, and said\r\nour prayers to Him who, she told us, knew what it was to spend His\r\nfirst Christmas days here under the shadow of the sword, and would not\r\nthat one of His little ones should perish. Then tossed by hope and\r\nfear, we slept.\r\n\r\nIt was a notable fact, but one which escaped comment in the general\r\nanxiety of that night, that Uncle Scipio had not appeared as usual,\r\nafter his out-of-door tasks were finished. It had gone pretty hard\r\nwith us all not to be able to confide everything to this faithful old\r\nfriend; but the strictest injunctions had been laid upon us to keep\r\nthe whole matter a secret from the negroes, for many reasons. So he\r\nknew nothing, and went about his tasks all day, singing his most\r\ndirge-like tunes, which meant some pleasant preoccupation of mind. We\r\nhad learned that. We knew soon after what it was that occupied his\r\nheart and head that day.\r\n\r\nI do not know how long we had slept in our trundle bed, but I know I\r\nhad travelled in my dreams over many leagues of fairy land, walking\r\nunder endless avenues of lighted Christmas trees, when suddenly, I\r\nthought, from some unseen source, the deep tones of a bell struck\r\ndiscord on the radiant air. It seemed so out of place in that\r\nenchanted region; and at the sound all the lights on the trees\r\nflickered and went out, and we were lost in the dark. Louder and\r\nnearer the bell still sounded; and then we awoke and our hearts stood\r\nstill with terror.\r\n\r\nWe knew it was the village church-bell, proclaiming its story to the\r\nsleeping town. The enemy were upon us, and our Christmas fires would\r\nbe the light of blazing homes. Oh, such awakening after such dreams!\r\nSo eloquent was every face, of horrible certainty, that scarcely a\r\nword was spoken. It was only about midnight, but I was dressed by\r\ntrembling hands--mother had not been undressed at all. And then we\r\nwaited--for what? We could not have told precisely. But after a little\r\nthe bell ceased to ring, and then we listened for the tramp of horses\r\nand the quick Northern voices speaking words of command to the men. We\r\nhad heard it before, and knew the sound well. Once before I had\r\nawakened from sleep and seen the distorted shadows of horsemen chase\r\none another across the strip of moonlight just over my bed, and looked\r\nfrom my window to see the moonlight glittering on the sabres and gun\r\nbarrels of an armed host surrounding our house. That is not a sight to\r\nbe forgotten, let me tell you, children who are born and reared in the\r\nlap of peace and plenty.\r\n\r\nFor quite a while--it seemed ages to me--we sat in silence looking at\r\none another. But though the lights twinkled in all the neighboring\r\nwindows, telling of other anxious watchers, no unusual sound disturbed\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nWhat could it mean? Surprise began to succeed to alarm. It occurred to\r\nsome one to call up Uncle Scipio, and get him to investigate. But it\r\nwas wonder on top of wonder--he was not to be found; neither had his\r\nbed been disturbed during the night. Had he deserted us and gone over\r\nto the enemy, then? No, we could not really doubt him, even yet; but\r\nhis absence was too significant; there must be some plot hatching\r\nsomewhere in the dark.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing for us to do but wait. But we had not to wait much\r\nlonger; for presently in walked the absentee, clothed in his most\r\nmajestic air, but a little non-plussed to see us all up and dressed.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Scipio! where have you been?\" we exclaimed indignantly. \"How\r\ncould you leave us at such a time and the town full of soldiers? Which\r\nway are they coming? What shall we do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I clar,\" he answered, in a bewildered sort of way, \"dis yere\r\nproceedin' clean tops my cotton! Is you all clar outen yer minds, or\r\nwhat's de matter wid yer? I aint seed nary a Yankee dis night, and I\r\njes bin way up to de Mef'dis chache, ringing de Christmas chimes fur\r\nto cheer you up a little. Did'n ole Scip tell you, honeys, dat dis was\r\ngwine to be de boss Christmas? And he done kep his word. I met ole\r\nSanty out yonder, sittin' on de pump and he sez he's comin' here\r\nsoon's iver he kin; so you better git to bed 'mejitly, ef not sooner;\r\nef you don't he'll be here and ketch you 'Christmas gif' fust, sho' he\r\nwill.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so this was the end of it all. The dear old soul had taken it into\r\nhis funny old head to give us a surprise and ring the Christmas chimes\r\nas in the old times.\r\n\r\nWell, we tried to soften the blow, when we told him what a blunder he\r\nhad made; but we knew it would be a long time ere he would recover\r\nfrom his chagrin. He had long been a terror to the idle young darkies\r\nabout town, and they were only too glad to get something to use\r\nagainst him. Of course there was general indignation among the\r\ncitizens when they learned that they had suffered a false alarm; but\r\nwhen they considered the beautiful motive that prompted the action,\r\nthe tide of reproach was turned aside, and it all ended in a general\r\nlaugh at Uncle Scipio's expense.\r\n\r\nIt still wanted several hours till day, when our fears were relieved\r\nby his appearance, and we went to bed again.\r\n\r\nWith the first streak of light, however, we were up with bare feet and\r\nfrowzy heads to find Uncle Scipio's promise had not failed us. The\r\nChristmas saint had been upon our hearthstone and left his footprints\r\nthere. The stockings were as fantastically distended as ever in the\r\npalmiest times.\r\n\r\nI suppose the children of the present day would not covet the\r\nwonderful objects that we hauled forth from heel and toe. Yet I have\r\nspent many Christmas holidays amid the gayeties of the metropolis\r\nsince then, and its richest gifts wax poor when I remember that\r\nmorning. What did it matter to us that both toys and confections bore\r\nthe stamp of home manufacture--little wooden dolls, like Chinese\r\ndeities, carved out of wood by Uncle Scipio's jack knife--strange\r\npeople baked in sweet bread with coffee grains for eyes? What did it\r\nmatter that the war cloud hovered around us; that to-morrow might\r\nrenew the scenes of yesterday? We were happy in our treasures. We\r\nknow, now, what the charm was that made them precious, for we know\r\nthat\r\n\r\n             \"The painted vellum hallows not the prayer,\r\n             Nor ivory and gold the crucifix.\"\r\n\r\nAh! that will ever be the day of days to me. And with it are enshrined\r\nin fadeless green, the names of many whose eyes have long been closed\r\nupon the wars and joys of this earth. Not the least dear among these\r\nwill ever be old Scipio, who loved us better than his own freedom; who\r\nstood by us in the day of trial, and was faithful till death to the\r\ncharge of a master who could never return to take account of his\r\nstewardship.\r\n\r\nHe was grandiloquent, insisted on spectacles, though he generally read\r\nthe hymns upside down; wore a collar on Sundays that would put our\r\nmodern dudes to naught; but he was a prophet, for all that, and saw\r\nfarther than most men into the future.\r\n\r\nWe trust he has honor now in his own country; while in our hearts his\r\nmemory will yearly ring the chimes of Christmas bells.\r\n\r\nCeline McCay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RESULT.\r\n\r\n(November 6th, 1888.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                   We have no longer Uncle Sam,\r\n                     Nor yet our Yankee-doodle;\r\n                   The first is but an Uncle Sham,\r\n                     The last is Yankee-boodle.\r\n\r\nJames McCarroll.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSILK CULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There are so many persons thirsting for information,\" I says to Mrs.\r\nWrigglesniff, \"let's tell them all about it.\" It was always my way to\r\nstir in something useful with what was agreeable; and here was an\r\nopportunity, while pursuing an avocation that was at once pleasant and\r\nlucrative, to bring forward at the same time, an illustration of those\r\ngreat economic and philosophic principles, that lie at the foundation\r\nof all government and are the ground-work of the social fabric. The\r\ntariff, although an intricate subject, I felt was one that could be\r\nelucidated by simple exemplification in practical life; and so I\r\nopened up to her one day, by remarking upon the great importance of\r\nfostering our \"infant industries.\" That most efficient mother was\r\nnursing the baby at the time. The baby was four weeks old, weighed\r\nsixteen pounds, and could partake of more nourishment at nature's\r\nfountain, than any two ordinary pair of twins.\r\n\r\n\"Infant industry! here's one now,\" observed Mrs. W., gazing with\r\nmaternal fondness upon the lusty native American in her lap, who was\r\ntugging away with a zeal quite amazing.\r\n\r\nYou should first understand, however, that Mrs. W. is a superior woman\r\n\"as has got intellect into her,\" as her uncle John Fetherly Brown was\r\nwont to say. Her father's second cousin was a half-brother to Noah\r\nWebster, and she has, therefore, inherited some of the qualities of\r\nthat distinguished philosopher. I proposed the subject to her one day,\r\nin a genial sort of a way, and she said, \"W.,\" says she, \"You're a\r\nfool! Silk indeed!\" She always calls me \"W.,\" as the whole of it makes\r\nit too long, and being a practical woman, she is aware that life is\r\nshort. I could not help admiring the promptness with which Mrs. W.\r\narrived at her conclusions; and as she is a most excellent judge of\r\nhuman nature, I changed the subject, not wishing to exasperate her.\r\n\r\nThe way it came about was this. I had read all about it in the papers\r\nand books and things, and was thinking over it one day and all of a\r\nsudden I spoke up, and says I:\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. W., let's have worms.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at me just that way for a minute, I thought there was going\r\nto be a funeral. So I said, says I, \"We can get the eggs from\r\nWashington for nothing; then we can have the stands in the attic, and\r\nthere's the osage-orange hedge, that does nothing in the world but\r\nkeep the boys from stealing apples, and we have no apples to steal;\r\nthe children can feed them, so that the total cost will be nothing. We\r\ncan sell the cocoons at $1.50 a pound; and suppose we raise five\r\nhundred pounds only the first season; there's $750, which is\r\nabsolutely clear profit, the whole of it. We can then buy a carriage,\r\nand we will give a ball, and 'ye shall walk in silk attire.'\"\r\n\r\nMrs. W. turned up her nose. In using that expression, I do not mean\r\nthat she actually inverted that feature of her countenance, but the\r\nexpression of her face indicated the idea which usually finds\r\nutterance in the word 'Rats.' At this point I took occasion to explain\r\nto Mrs. W. the relations of this most beautiful and fascinating\r\nindustry to the principles of political economy. My amiable lady had\r\nfrequently said it was all \"bosh;\" that to try to raise silk in this\r\ncountry was mere gammon. I explained to her that her position, as a\r\nphilosophical proposition, would be true, were it not for the\r\nfostering care of a paternal government, which had inaugurated the\r\nAmerican system of protection. That this great principle of protection\r\nwas the source of our national wealth, that the tariff on silk was\r\nsixty per cent, and----\r\n\r\n\"Tariff!\" inquired Mrs. W., \"what is tariff?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tariff, my dear,\" said I, \"I am surprised. I had supposed that such\r\nan intellect as yours would have familiarized itself with the great\r\neconomic questions of the day.\" But I did not wish to be too severe\r\nwith her, as I remembered that the sphere of woman did not bring her\r\ninto contact with these rugged issues that are the theme of\r\nphilosophers and statesmen; so I explained briefly, but still kindly:\r\n\r\n\"My dear, a tariff is a tax paid by the importer.\"\r\n\r\nTo this she made the very singular reply: \"But how is taxing a people\r\ngoing to make them rich, and be the source of national wealth? I know\r\nwhen tax day comes around, you are always groaning and saying that it\r\nkeeps your nose flat on the grindstone, to raise money enough to pay\r\nyour taxes.\" I told her she still failed to see the point, as she was\r\nreferring to mere state taxes, while I, upon a higher plane, was\r\nviewing the comprehensive bearings of national institutions.\r\n\r\n\"W.,\" she said, \"you don't know any more about it than Horace Greeley\r\ndid.\" Such a reference to the great apostle of American protection, I\r\nconfess, shocked me; but I suppressed my feelings in consideration of\r\nher sex.\r\n\r\nI have said that Mrs. W. is a woman of intellect; but she has no\r\nenthusiasm. With me it is different. I am all enthusiasm and no--I was\r\nabout to say no intellect; but I mean no such intellect as has Mrs.\r\nW.\r\n\r\nSo she says: \"That's the way you're always doing, W.; going into\r\nsomething you don't know anything about, throwing away your money; and\r\nthat's about all you're fit for.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my love!\" I exclaimed, \"there's no chance to lose money in silk\r\nworms. You get them for nothing, feed them for nothing; and how is it\r\npossible to lose money on them, with the tariff at sixty per cent ad\r\nvalorem?\"\r\n\r\n\"W.,\" she interrupted, \"when you talk Latin to me, please explain\r\nyourself.\"\r\n\r\nSome people have thought that there was an asperity in Mrs. W.'s\r\nnature, that occasionally found expression in words, but it is not so.\r\nShe is of most amiable disposition, and I never knew her to--if I may\r\ncoin a word--to asperse. I, therefore, said that in the tariff laws,\r\nduties were levied upon the value of articles, as stated in the\r\nimporter's invoice.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said she, \"won't the importers value too low?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my dear,\" I said, \"that would be dishonest, and importers are\r\nnever dishonest; indeed it is upon the virtue and integrity of the\r\npeople that the welfare of our institutions depends.\" As I was about\r\nto expand upon this theme, my wife checked me with the remark that we\r\nwould take the American eagle and the rest of it, at another time, but\r\njust now we would hear about the silk worms. I told her I had made all\r\nnecessary arrangements, and would that day write to the \"Department\"\r\nat Washington, and secure the necessary supply of eggs to commence a\r\nflourishing business. I did so and in due time I received from the\r\ncapital of the nation, a nice little wooden box, and inside of that\r\nanother little tin box, and inside of that were the eggs. They were\r\nabout as big as pin's heads and it looked as though there were\r\nmillions, but I don't suppose there were that many.\r\n\r\nI exhibited them with pride to the partner of my bosom, exclaiming,\r\n\"Such is the fostering care of a paternal government, it raises these\r\neggs at vast expense, and bestows them liberally upon those who ask.\"\r\nI then explained to Mrs. W. how it was that our glorious republic\r\nnursed those infant industries that were so delicate they could not\r\nstand alone; supporting them with great assiduity, inasmuch as they\r\ncould not support themselves. I showed her how employment was thus\r\nfurnished to thousands of persons, who would otherwise be idle, or\r\nengaged in some other occupation that was able to take care of itself;\r\nof course, therefore, making wages lower. I contrasted the condition\r\nof the American laborer, with that of the European serf, trodden under\r\nthe iron heel of despotism, at ten cents a day, and satisfied her that\r\nthe laboring man in the United States was the best paid, and therefore\r\nthe happiest and most contented being on earth, owing to the fact of a\r\nprotective tariff, ever since 1789.\r\n\r\n\"W.,\" exclaimed that angelic creature, \"why is it, then, that the\r\nworkingmen are always striking and marching around town with brass\r\nbands? First shoemakers, then carpenters and railroad men, and\r\nstone-masons, and iron-molders, and hod-carriers--all wanting higher\r\nwages. Where does the happiness and content come in? I heard you say,\r\nyourself, the other day, that the disorganized system of labor was\r\nsuch in this country, that it was degenerating into socialism and\r\nanarchy and was ruining every branch of business.\"\r\n\r\nI hated to do it, but I crushed her with the reply: \"Ah! my dear, that\r\nis begging the question.\"\r\n\r\nBut that sweet creature, unruffled as a summer sea, preserved an\r\nequanimity that astounded me, as she said: \"Why is it, W., that\r\nwhenever a woman corners a man in argument, he simply ends the\r\ndiscussion by telling her she is 'begging the question?'\" Seeing that\r\nshe did not exactly catch the drift of my logic, I adroitly turned the\r\nsubject to silk-worms again, and how we should proceed in our\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said I to Mrs. W., \"I will procure the necessary lumber, at\r\nusual market rates, and make a stand on which to lay the frames.\"\r\n\r\nShe observed: \"You know, W., you never made anything in your life and\r\ncan't do it. Go up to the carpenter and he will do what you want for\r\nfifty cents, and you can't buy the lumber for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. W.,\" I replied, \"I scorn your words. I propose that this\r\nundertaking shall be absolutely inexpensive, except, perhaps, the\r\noutlay for the raw material.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" she observed, \"try it.\" My! what a head that woman has. I\r\ntook a book that had a picture of the stand I wanted, and took the\r\ndimensions carefully down; went to the lumber yard, selected the\r\npieces, and they cost only $1.25; went home, measured, planned, and\r\nfigured, and found that I had ordered the upright cut the length of\r\nthe cross pieces, and _vice-versa_, so that the whole was useless. My\r\ndisposition, however, is to take cheerful views of things, and I\r\nexplained to Mrs. W. that I could still use the stuff for pickets on\r\nthe front fence, some of which were missing. Mrs. W. quietly observed:\r\n\"How are you going to use four-foot pickets on a six-foot fence?\"\r\n\r\nWhen I purchased the second lot I was very careful to proceed\r\ndeliberately. I am a good deal of a carpenter, if things would only\r\ncome out square when finished: but they never will. When I saw a\r\nboard, somehow the saw runs off to one side, and when I try to nail it\r\nto the other board, the two won't fit; and by the time I get around to\r\nthe fourth side, one end of the concern is up in the air, and I have\r\nto sit on it to keep it down. I have often gazed with admiration on a\r\nreal carpenter, to see him run his saw along, straight as a string and\r\ntrue as a die, and then put the pieces all together and have them fit,\r\nnice as a cotton hat. This is true genius.\r\n\r\nSensible of the danger and liability to mistake in putting the pieces\r\ntogether, I told Mrs. W., who was superintending the operation, that\r\nwe would not use nails, but screws, so that in case of error--and all\r\nhuman judgment is fallible--we could take the screws out and take the\r\npieces apart, which could not be done with nails. Mrs. W. conceded the\r\nsuggestion to be a valuable one. So we went to work, she kindly\r\nlending her assistance. I measured all the pieces, got them the exact\r\nlength, and for the greater certainty, stood them up on the floor to\r\nsee if they would all fit. They certainly seemed to do so, as far as\r\nmortal vision could determine. As all this required a great deal of\r\ndeliberation, a great deal of measuring, a great deal of sawing, some\r\nchiselling, etc., the hour of sunset was approaching when I had put in\r\nthe last screw, and triumphantly called Mrs. W. from her afternoon nap\r\nto witness the success of my mechanical endeavors. I stood the blamed\r\nthing up on its four legs, and three of 'em were on the floor, and the\r\nfourth wasn't. It was impossible for me to discover the defect in my\r\nworkmanship. I could make any three of the legs stand on the floor,\r\nbut the fourth could not be prevailed upon for any consideration. The\r\ncross-pieces, which should have been horizontal, and which, to that\r\nend, had been measured with mathematical precision, slanted up on one\r\nside and slanted down on the other. I was in despair, until Mrs. W.\r\nbrought her intellect to bear upon my difficulties; when it appeared\r\nthat three of the uprights were four feet six inches high, and the\r\nfourth was four feet seven inches. How it happened no one could\r\nexplain.\r\n\r\n\"Now, W.,\" says Mrs. W., \"send for the carpenter.\" I did so. He\r\ncame--a rough, totally uncultured man. He could barely write his name\r\nand his clothes were principally suspenders. But that uneducated man\r\njust took these pieces of wood, and knocked them here, and knocked\r\nthem there, and, by aid of some disreputable shingle nails, in twenty\r\nminutes had as neat looking a stand made as ever you saw come out of a\r\ncabinet maker's shop. I was abashed and paid him twenty-five cents.\r\nMrs. W. said nothing, but smiled.\r\n\r\nWe had some frames, about two feet square, covered with brown paper.\r\nThese we placed on the stand and spread out the eggs. I was a little\r\nuneasy about what kind of a hen to get to hatch them, as I could find\r\nnothing in the books on the subject; but Mrs. W. called me my usual\r\npet name, and said that the first warm day was all the hen needed.\r\nWonderful woman that! Just as she predicted! In a few days the brown\r\npaper was covered with little dark specks in a state of agitation.\r\nMrs. W. spoke of them contemptuously as \"nasty black worms.\"\r\n\r\nThey grew at a prodigious rate. I explained to the children that all\r\nthey had to do was to go down to the osage-orange hedge, cut off the\r\ntwigs and branches, and feed them to the worms; that in a few weeks\r\nthe product would be ready for market, and if the Mills bill didn't\r\ninterfere with protection to American industry, the profits would be\r\nlarge, and should be equally divided between themselves and their\r\nmother. The children were highly elated and were soon discussing what\r\nshould be the color of the carriage horses. One wanted black, the\r\nother blue; and the excitement ran so high that parental intervention\r\nbecame necessary and some spanking ensued. The next morning our early\r\ndreams were disturbed by fearful outcries from the direction of the\r\nfront fence. The smallest of the children had tumbled head first into\r\nthe osage-orange hedge, and could not get out. Anyone who knows the\r\ninfernal, brutal intensity with which the thorns of the osage-orange\r\nsting, can understand the predicament of that child. We extracted her\r\nin a fearfully lacerated condition. She was punctured all over. Having\r\nread in a book entitled \"Three Thousand Valuable Receipts, for\r\nTwenty-five Cents,\" that ammonia was good for stings, I applied\r\nammonia liberally to that bleeding child, until she became absolutely\r\nfrantic. Her screams attracted Mrs. W. to the scene, and she\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Have you no more sense than to put ammonia on raw flesh like that?\" I\r\npointed to the \"Three Thousand Valuable Receipts, for Twenty-five\r\nCents,\" which she immediately picked up and threw out of the window.\r\nThe child ultimately recovered, but from that day abhorred silk\r\nculture in all its branches. Still the industry went on. The children\r\nwere so stung by the thorns that the work devolved on me, and it was a\r\ntask most fearful. There is a poison in the thorn of the osage-orange\r\nthat not only makes the pain exquisite, but swells one up as though he\r\nhad been stung all over by bees, or had chronic dropsy. My hands and\r\narms were puffed up, and my face looked as though I had been in a\r\nprize-fight. As I observed to Mrs. W., however, these were minor\r\ndifficulties, and we could put up with them in consideration of the\r\nlarge profits which would ensue. One day one of the servants--they are\r\nalways going around and turning things up side down--left one of the\r\nframes on the floor, and all the worms, to the number of several\r\nhundred, scattered themselves profusely about the house, and without\r\nany reference to the comfort or convenience of the family. If you\r\nopened the flour barrel, there was a silk worm. They pervaded the\r\nsugar and crawled into the cream. You found them in bed and the mash\r\nwas awful. How many were trodden into the parlor carpet can never be\r\nknown. This, too, was but an episode; and as the worms grew in size\r\nand began to spin their cocoons, the process was quite interesting,\r\nand even Mrs. W. overcame her repugnance to the crawling little\r\nwretches.\r\n\r\nI was startled one day, as I was feeding my silk-worms, who were\r\nconsuming the osage-orange leaves at the rate of a bushel a day,\r\nmaking two bushels of litter, to hear Mrs. W. abruptly ask:\r\n\r\n\"W., what is a consumer?\" The unexpectedness of the interrogation\r\nfound me at fault for a moment; but reflecting a little while and\r\nlooking at the silk-worms, I concluded the best way to put it was: \"A\r\nconsumer, my dear, is--well, a consumer in this country is one who\r\nconsumes.\" Thinking that no exception could be taken to such a\r\ndefinition, I was triumphant.\r\n\r\n\"W.,\" said that pertinacious person, \"you don't hang together well, if\r\nany. You said the other day that this tariff thing was for the benefit\r\nof the producer, etc.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear,\" I replied, \"I seize the occasion. 'My foot is on my native\r\nheath, and my name is McGregor.' When our industries were in their\r\ninfancy, it was found impossible to compete with foreign productions.\r\nLabor was so cheap abroad that they could undersell us in our own\r\nmarkets. We had laid the foundation of a broad, comprehensive\r\nmanufacturing interest; we had taken men from agricultural and other\r\npursuits, where they earned a livelihood, and put them in new and\r\nstrange employments, about which they knew nothing, where they\r\nexpected to earn more than a livelihood. But this could not be done on\r\naccount of prices. So government imposed high duties, and the producer\r\nsold his articles for a higher price. In this way he was benefited and\r\nenabled to make money. The tariff added just so much to the price of\r\nthe article sold, and the producer was happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"But who paid this extra price?\" queried Mrs. W.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I replied, \"it is a principle of political economy, I believe,\r\nthat all taxes are paid ultimately by the consumer, so that in a case\r\nof this kind--\"\r\n\r\n\"The consumer is the American people,\" interrupted Mrs. W.\r\n\r\n\"My dear,\" I cried, \"once more I am compelled to observe, you are\r\nbegging the question.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mendicant again,\" was her arch reply, and a cry from the nursery\r\nended the discussion.\r\n\r\nIn about six weeks we had the cocoons. Of course, during that time the\r\nhouse was littered with dirt, dried leaves, and all sorts of unclean\r\nthings; and if you ran about the premises in the dark, barefooted, you\r\nwere sure to step on an osage-orange twig; and I am satisfied, from\r\nthe amount of squalling done, that if the season had lasted six months\r\nmost of the children would have been exterminated.\r\n\r\nI corresponded with some concern in one of the eastern cities, stating\r\nthat I had a large amount of fine cocoons, and wanting to know what\r\nthey would pay. I observed to Mrs. W. that I was confident of\r\nreceiving a reply to the effect that I should ship the cocoons, draw\r\nat sight for five hundred dollars, leaving the balance to be paid as\r\nper account sales.\r\n\r\nThe reply was, to send on half-a-pound as a sample, and they would see\r\nif they could take them. When we came to weigh out half-a-pound, both\r\nMrs. W. and I were appalled. It took about two bushels--nearly, if not\r\nquite, half of the entire crop. However, they were sent, and Mrs. W.\r\nsnickered as she did up the package.\r\n\r\nIn the course of several weeks I received a specimen, say about a\r\nskein, of the most beautiful silk I had ever beheld, with an\r\norder to forward the balance of the cocoons per Adams Express, which\r\nI did at the expense of one dollar. Waited several months for\r\nacknowledgement of receipt, wrote various letters, the postage on\r\nwhich was two cents each. As considerable time elapsed while we were\r\n\"waiting for the returns,\" and as I was determined that Mrs. W.\r\nshould understand this great subject of the tariff, as I knew she\r\ncould if she gave her mind to it, I proceeded to eviscerate the\r\nwhole matter. Said I, \"When a tariff is laid upon a manufactured\r\narticle, it enables the manufacturer in this country to pay his\r\nworkmen higher wages.\"\r\n\r\n\"And does he always do it?\" said Mrs. W.\r\n\r\n\"Always,\" I replied. \"Statistics show that when the tariff on iron was\r\nincreased twenty per cent the manufacturers of iron immediately raised\r\nthe wages of all their employés twenty per cent.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said that clear-headed woman, \"what excellent persons these\r\niron men are. They do not hire their men for as little as they can,\r\nbut pay them more than they want.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly so,\" I replied; \"the general rule I admit to be that a man\r\npays as little as he can for labor; but under the protective system,\r\nthe tariff increases the price of the manufactured article, so that\r\nthe manufacturer is enabled to sell his goods for that higher price,\r\nand the workman thus gets the benefit of it.\"\r\n\r\nThis argument seemed to have great weight with her, as it gave her new\r\nlight on things, for she said it was contrary to experience; but I\r\nexplained to her that unless some flaw could be found in the\r\nsyllogism, the conclusion was irresistible, all experience to the\r\ncontrary notwithstanding. I then showed her how entirely disinterested\r\nthe manufacturers were; that all their efforts were solely for the\r\nbenefit of the workmen; that, personally, the tariff made no\r\ndifference to them; that they never besought Congress to lay high\r\ntariffs; that no one ever knew of the iron men, or the sugar men, or\r\nthe copper men, besieging the legislators at Washington to impose\r\nduties upon articles they made; that it was the workmen who always did\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI do not know exactly how long it was that we waited to receive our\r\nfortune from those cocoons, but one day a postal card came to hand\r\nfrom the parties to whom I had sent my wealth, stating that they had\r\nreceived so many cocoons they could not tell which mine were. Inasmuch\r\nas mine were the only ones that had ever been shipped from the town\r\nwherein I reside, it occurred to me that this remark might be\r\nconsidered in the nature of a joke. Then there followed another\r\nvoluminous correspondence. I appealed to Adams Express Company, who\r\nsaid they would send out a \"tracer\"; I did not like to betray my\r\nignorance by showing that I did not know what a tracer was, but,\r\nfrankly, I should not have known one had I met it on the street. But\r\nwith the infinite knowledge of affairs that Mrs. W. has, that\r\nremarkable woman signified to me that a tracer was something that goes\r\nup and down and to and fro upon the face of the earth, like a roaring\r\nlion, seeking something, and not generally finding it. It is an\r\nimmense consolation, however, to railroad men and others; for it\r\nappears that after a \"tracer\" has been \"sent out,\" nothing more can,\r\nby any possibility, be done by anybody. Whether or not the tracer had\r\nanything to do with the final result I never knew. But about six\r\nmonths after I had transmitted my cocoons to that large silk\r\nmanufacturing house that paid such large wages to American workmen for\r\nthe purpose of fostering American industry, I received a note sending\r\na balance-sheet, and enclosing a check for eighty-eight cents.\r\n\r\nWhen I received this portentous paper, I observed to Mrs. W.: \"My\r\ndear, how much do you suppose we got for our cocoons?\" \"About\r\nseventy-five cents,\" was the reply. The mind that woman has for detail\r\nis simply wonderful.\r\n\r\nThe check I have had framed, and hung up in the parlor, but when I\r\nbalanced the books, I still found the profit large, thus:\r\n\r\n    Dr.                _W. in Acc't with Silk Worms._              Cr.\r\n  =======================================================================\r\n  1887.   |                   |       | 1888.|                   |\r\n          |                   |       |      |                   |\r\n  Jan. 1, | Cash p'd lumber   |  $2 00| Feb. | By acc't sales    |  $0 88\r\n   \"   \"  |  \"    \"  carpenter|     25|  \"   | \" amt. experience |\r\n          |                   |       |      |    gained         | 500 00\r\n  Sept. 1,|  \"    \"  express  |     50|      |                   |\r\n  Nov.    |  \"    \"     \"     |   1 00|      |                   |\r\n  1888.   |                   |       |      |                   |\r\n  Feb.    |  \"    \"  postage  |     20|      |                   |\r\n          |      Profit       | 496 93|      |                   |\r\n          |                   |-------|      |                   |-------\r\n          |                   |$500 88|      |                   |$500 88\r\n\r\nD.

The\r\ncorner-stone in the foundation of communism is that agency of the\r\ngovernment which makes of the sovereign power that legal process which\r\ncontrols all private affairs for the good of the people. In popular\r\nphrase, it upholds the paternal form which enters every man's house\r\nand regulates by law all his transactions. This is the foundation,\r\nwhile the holding of property in common is rather a consequence than a\r\ncause. If there are no rights pertaining to the citizen but those\r\nderived from government, to give practical effect to the scheme all\r\nproperty owned by the government must be held in its care in common by\r\nits dependents.\r\n\r\nHeretofore this theory has been advocated by the poor and oppressed,\r\nand stoutly resisted by the rich. We are treated to a reversal of\r\nposition in the parties, and the rich are practically pressing the\r\nscheme upon the poor.\r\n\r\nJefferson, the father of modern democracy, taught that the government,\r\na mere form of expression, in the way of rule, by the people, who held\r\nthe sovereignty was only a trust of power, instituted for the sole\r\npurpose of keeping the peace between the citizens. To use a popular\r\nphrase, it was nothing but the intervention of the constable.\r\n\r\nOur central government, not being built altogether upon this broad yet\r\nsimple proposition, opened in its mixed nature the door to communism\r\nfound in the paternal form. Indeed, it would have been entirely\r\ndivested of the Jeffersonian theory had it not been for the necessity\r\nunder which the framers found themselves of conciliating the States,\r\nthat then jealously fought every proposition looking to a deprivation\r\nof their sovereign rights. All that we so happily gained then came\r\nfrom a regard to the several States and not to any thought of popular\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nThis fact gave us a Constitution under which, we have managed to\r\nlive, comparatively prosperous, for a century. Had it been otherwise,\r\nour Constitution would have gone to pieces in the first twenty-five\r\nyears of its existence. A constitution is a legal recognition of\r\ncertain general rules of conduct that are ever the same under all\r\ncircumstances. Legislation is the adaptation of those rules to\r\nindividual cases; and as these vary and change with continuously\r\nnew conditions, a fixed application in a constitution is impossible.\r\nFor this restriction, as far as it goes, we have to thank the States\r\nand not the sagacity of the fathers.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution was scarcely enacted before the communism of a\r\npaternal form began to manifest itself. The Federal party was of this\r\nsort. It sneered at and fought the sovereignty of the people, and\r\nfound its governing element in a class that was supposed to hold\r\nin itself the intelligence and virtue of the people. It has\r\ndeparted and been done to death, not by the people, who failed to\r\ncomprehend or feel the situation, but by the same cause that\r\ncreated the Constitution,--and that was the jealous opposition of\r\nthe States to a centralization of power at Washington.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of the Federal party the Whig organization was formed,\r\non the same line and for the same purpose as those of its Federal\r\npredecessor. Henry Clay, its author, an eloquent but ignorant man,\r\nformulated his American system, that was a small affair in the\r\nbeginning, but had deadly seeds of evil in its composition. Mr. Clay\r\nsaw the necessity for manufactures in the United States; and as\r\ncapital necessary to their existence in private hands could not be\r\nobtained, he proposed that the government should intervene through a\r\nmisuse of the taxing power and supply the want. It was a modest want\r\nat first. \"Let us aid these infant industries,\" he said, \"until they\r\nare strong enough to stand alone, and then the government may withdraw\r\nand leave competition to regulate prices.\" It was a plausible but\r\ninsidious proposition.\r\n\r\nThis was fought bitterly by the South, not altogether from a high\r\nground of principle, although the argument was made that the\r\ngovernment at Washington had no such power under the Constitution, but\r\nthe main motive was self-interest. The South was an agricultural\r\nregion, and found in cotton, rice, sugar, and tobacco staples that had\r\ntheir better, indeed their only, market in Europe, and saw no sense in\r\ntrammelling it with laws to benefit Eastern capital. The American\r\nsystem was having a rough time and bidding fair to die out, when the\r\nsectional issue between the North and South culminated in war, and\r\ndriving not only the South but the democracy from the government, left\r\nthe paternal party in power.\r\n\r\nThis organization was made up mainly of Whigs. The abrupt dissolution\r\nof that party threw in the newly formed Republican organization the\r\nmajority that from the first until now has governed its movements. How\r\npatriotic a party founded on property is, we learn from its first act\r\nafter securing control of Congress. In the terrible war that followed\r\nsecession, the greatest of dangers that threatened success was in\r\nEuropean interference. Common sense, to say nothing of patriotism,\r\ndictated that Congress should at least abstain from measures likely to\r\noffend the governments abroad, if it did not do all in its power to\r\nconciliate. Greed recognized no such duty. Almost the first measure of\r\nany importance introduced and passed to a law was the Morrill tariff,\r\nthat slapped the greatest war powers of Europe in the face. Under\r\npretence of raising a war revenue, they made a deadly attack on\r\nresource from that source, for they well knew that as they increased\r\nthe duties they lessened the income.\r\n\r\nThe panic and distress that followed this measure in all the markets\r\nof the world can well account for the deadly hostility to our\r\ngovernment felt abroad. Small wonder that while arms were furnished\r\nthe South in the greatest abundance, cruisers were fitted out in\r\nEnglish ports to prey upon our helpless commerce. The greater danger\r\nof official recognition was only averted by the stubborn stand taken\r\nby Great Britain; and as it was, we now know that had the South been\r\nable to continue the war ninety days longer that intervention would\r\nhave come. A French army, sent there for that purpose, would have\r\ninvaded our lands from Mexico, while the fleets of allied France and\r\nEngland would have dissipated our so-called blockade, lifted the\r\nConfederacy's financial credit to par, and we would have been called\r\non to make terms of peace at Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nAll this gathered evil was shattered at Nashville by the gallant\r\nThomas and his noble Army of the Cumberland, when he not only defeated\r\nthe fifty thousand veterans under Hood, but annihilated an army.\r\n\r\nThis was the birth of the communism of wealth that is to govern our\r\ncountry for the next four years. Of course it is absurd to charge\r\nnearly a half of our people with corrupt motives and unpatriotic\r\nconduct. We have no such intent. We are only striving to show that the\r\nsuccess of the Republican policy is fatal to the Republic. This party,\r\nas we have said, is in no sense a political organization. It is a\r\ngreat combination of private interests that seek to use the government\r\nto further their own selfish ends. Governments through all the ages\r\nhave been the deadly enemies of the people they governed. Ours,\r\ncontrolled by the Republican party, makes no exception to the rule.\r\nThe gigantic trusts, or combinations, are eating the substance out of\r\nhonest toil, and back of them stands the awful shadow of a powerful\r\norganization making those trusts possible, and doing to the people\r\nprecisely the cruel wrong it was created to prevent. Palaces multiply\r\nas hovels increase; and while millionaires are common, the million\r\nsink back to that hopeless poverty of destitution that has the name of\r\nfreedom, as a mockery to their serfdom.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INFAMY OF IT.\r\n\r\nFor years past it has become more and more patent to the people of the\r\nUnited States that the ballot has come to be a commercial affair, and\r\ninstead of serving its original purpose of a process through which to\r\nexpress the popular will, represents only the money expended in its\r\nuse. For a long time it was abused through stuffing, false counts,\r\nrepeating, and switching tickets. In the late Presidential election we\r\nseemed to have passed from that stage to open and shameless bribery.\r\n\r\nThis is simply appalling to those who love their country and believe\r\nin our great Republic. The old system of roguery that attacked the\r\nintegrity of the ballot was that of a few low villains, who could be\r\nmet by an improved box and other stringent, legalized guards that\r\nwould make the vile practices difficult, and punishment easily\r\nsecured. But this open purchase of votes indicates a poison in the\r\nspring head itself, and a consent found in the apathy of the public.\r\n\r\nWhat good would be the Australian system, that seeks to shield the\r\nsecret ballot, where the official agents themselves would of course\r\nbe corrupt and purchasable? Under this system the voter entering a\r\nstall by himself finds an official to give him such ticket as he may\r\ndemand. What will be the good of this when that agent can be\r\npurchased? We really simply give the corruption into the hands of the\r\ncorruptionists through the very enactment called in to protect us.\r\n\r\nOur unhappy condition is recognized. There is not a man, woman, or\r\nchild in our country possessed of any brain but knows that Benjamin\r\nHarrison was elected President by open, wholesale bribery. Mr. Foster\r\nadvertised this in his well-known circulars wherein he called for\r\nfunds, and quoted Senator Plumb as saying that the manufacturers ought\r\nto be squeezed. And why should they be squeezed?--because, he said,\r\nthey are the sole beneficiaries of the one measure at issue in the\r\ncanvass. This was followed by Senator Ingalls' famous advice to the\r\ndelegate at the Chicago convention, which said, \"Nominate some such\r\nfellow as Phelps, who can tap Wall Street.\" This was followed by the\r\nDudley circular directing the purchase of \"floaters in blocks of five\r\nor more,\" and assuring those dishonest agents that the funds would not\r\nbe wanting to close the purchase.\r\n\r\nUnder this exhibit of evidence the fact cannot be denied; but to make\r\nit conclusive, the New York _World_ has gathered from all parts of the\r\ncountry clear, unmistakable proof of wide-spread, clearly planned, and\r\nopenly executed purchase of voters.\r\n\r\nThe chair of the Chief Executive has followed the seats of Senators to\r\nthe market, and that highest gift of the citizen has been sold to the\r\nhighest bidder. The great political fabric of the fathers, built from\r\nwoful expenditure of patriotic effort and blood, is honeycombed with\r\nrot, and remains, a mere sham, to shame us before the world.\r\n\r\nOf course we are not so silly as to attach blame only to one party.\r\nThe difference between the two lies in the fact that the one had more\r\nmoney than the other, and a stronger motive for its use. The\r\nRepublicans being a \"combine\" of property interests, depending upon\r\nthe government to make those interests profitable, were impelled to\r\nexertion far beyond the Democrats, who were struggling for the power\r\nonly that a possession of the government brings. But we are forced to\r\nremember that the votes purchased came from the Democratic party. Said\r\na prominent Democrat of Indiana to the writer of this: \"We had enough\r\nmoney to purchase the State had we known the nature of the market, and\r\npossessed agents upon whom we could rely. The agents of our opponents\r\nwere preachers, deacons, elders, class-leaders, and teachers in\r\nSunday-schools, and could be relied on to use their swag as directed.\r\nOur fellows put our money in their pockets, and left the voting to\r\ncare for itself. And then, again, while we were on the lookout for\r\nrepeaters, pipe-layers, and ballot-box stuffers, they were in open\r\nmarket purchasing votes. We learned the nature of the business when\r\ntoo late to meet it, had we even had the means to make our knowledge\r\navailable.\"\r\n\r\nNo doubt this gentleman told the truth. The sums subscribed, that\r\ncounted in the millions, came from men not only of means, but of high\r\nsocial positions, who, not being altogether idiots, well knew the\r\npurpose for which their ample means were assessed. That able and\r\nhonorable gentleman, Judge Gresham, whose well-known courage and\r\nintegrity rendered him unavailable as a candidate for the Presidency\r\nat Chicago, points openly to these respectable corruptionists as the\r\nreal wrong doers. It is more than probable that such may escape the\r\npenitentiary, and it is poor comfort to know that when such die\r\nlamented, their souls, in the great hereafter, will have to be\r\nsearched for with a microscope.\r\n\r\nThe pretence offered for such assessments is too thin to cover the\r\ncorrupt design. Says a prominent editor of the political criminals:\r\n\r\n\"The legitimate expenses of a national political canvass have come to\r\nbe enormous. There is a great educational work to be done; a vast\r\nliterature to be created and circulated; an army of speakers to be\r\nbrought into the field; various organizations to be made and\r\nmobilized; machinery to be perfected for getting out the full vote;\r\nsafeguards to be provided against fraud: all the immense enginery for\r\npersuading and marshalling at every fighting point the last score\r\namong six million voters.\"\r\n\r\nThe comments upon this made by the New York _Evening Post_ are so to\r\nthe point, and conclusive, that we quote them in full. The _Post_\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, this being so, why did Wanamaker and Quay, when they had\r\nfinished their noble work, burn their books and accounts? Missionary,\r\ntract, and Bible societies for mutual improvement and for aid to home\r\nstudy, lyceums and lecturing associations, not to speak of charitable\r\nand philanthropic associations, do not, after six months of unusual\r\nactivity, commit all their papers, vouchers, and books of accounts to\r\nthe flames. No such thing is ever thought of in Wanamaker's Bethel\r\nSunday-school. Why, then, was it done by the Advisory Committee?\r\nReligious and educational organizations, such as the Advisory\r\nCommittee seems to have been, on the contrary, when they have raised a\r\nlarge sum of money and spent it in worthy ways are usually eager to\r\npreserve and spread the record of it, that others coming after them\r\nmay be encouraged to do likewise. In fact, the more one reflects on\r\nthe Wanamaker-Quay holocaust, the more mysterious it seems.\"\r\n\r\nThis election of a chief magistrate, that shook the great republic\r\nfrom centre to circumference, was but a continuation of the corrupt\r\nsystem that began some years since, and is known to the public as that\r\nof \"addition, division, and silence.\"\r\n\r\nThis condition of the polls is no menace to our government. That\r\nperiod is gone. It is a loss of all. The ballot is the foundation\r\ncorner-stone of the entire political fabric. Its passage to the hands\r\nof corrupt dealers is simply ruin. We may not realize this, but we do\r\nrealize the contempt into which it has fallen. When the new President\r\nswings along Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol to be inaugurated,\r\nupon the side of his carriage should be printed what history with its\r\ncold, unbiased fingers will put to record:\r\n\r\n                 \"BO'T FOR TWO MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PULPIT CULT.\r\n\r\nIn the days of our Saviour the rich man of Jerusalem would, on a\r\nSabbath morning, bathe and anoint his body, and putting on fine linen\r\nand wearing-apparel, move in a dignified fashion to the synagogue,\r\nfeeling that he was serving God by making God respectable in the eyes\r\nof men.\r\n\r\nThe proneness of poor human nature to lose in the mere form that for\r\nwhich the form was created to serve is the same throughout the world,\r\nand through all the ages, evolution to the contrary notwithstanding.\r\nAs our physical being is, and has been, and will ever be about the\r\nsame, our spiritual suffers little change. When Adam and Eve, leaving\r\nthe garden of Eden, encountered the typhoid fever, that dread disease\r\nhad the same symptoms, made the same progress to death or recovery,\r\nthat puzzles the physicians to-day. That horrible but curious growth\r\nwe call cancer was the same six thousand years ago that it is in this\r\nnineteenth century. The sicknesses of the soul are the same in all\r\nclimes and in the presence of all creeds.\r\n\r\nSaid a witty ordained infidel who preached the salvation of unbelief\r\nmany years at London, on visiting a business men's prayer meeting:\r\n\"Our merchants may not be Jews in their dealings, but they are\r\ncertainly Hebrews in their prayers.\"\r\n\r\nThe form has survived the substance. We have retained the customs\r\nand phraseology, while losing the meaning. As the rich men of\r\nJerusalem who on the Sabbath thronged the Temple and were solemnly\r\nearnest in their prayers, returned to their cheating the day after,\r\nso we give unto God one-seventh part of our time and devote the rest\r\nto the practices of Satan. We are full of wrath and disgust at the\r\nSunday-school cashier who appropriates the money of other people and,\r\nunable longer to conceal his thefts, flees to Canada. This is\r\nunjust. The poor man was not less pious than his president or his\r\ndirectors who neglected their duties and in many cases shared in\r\nthe luxury. His crime was not in what he did, but in being caught at\r\nit before he could carry out his intent to replace the funds from his\r\nsuccessful speculations. He saw in the leaders of his little\r\ncongregation in the Lord, millionaires who had made all they\r\npossessed through fraud, and why should he, with the best intentions,\r\nnot accumulate a modest competence through the same means? He\r\nheard nothing to the contrary from the pulpit. The eloquent divine\r\ntold, in winning words, of the righteousness of right and the\r\nsinfulness of sin, but the illustrations were all, or nearly all,\r\ntwo thousand years old, and the words were the words of Isaiah and\r\nthe prophets. To denounce the sins of to-day in \"the vulgar tongue\"\r\nwould be to offend the millionaires of the congregation and lessen\r\nthe salary of the worthy divine.\r\n\r\nThe late Chief Justice Chase once startled the writer of this by\r\nsaying: \"The wicked men are not in the penitentiary, they are in the\r\nchurches. The criminals we convict are not wicked, they are simply\r\nweak--weak in character and weak in intellect. The men from whom\r\nsociety suffers are the cold, selfish, calculating creatures who not\r\nonly keep clear of the courts but seek the churches, and deceive\r\nothers as they deceive themselves and hope to deceive the Almighty.\"\r\n\r\nSin is never so dangerous as when it gets to be respectable. The\r\nsanction of law, whether it gets to be such through custom or legal\r\nenactment, so nearly resembles the order of God that we accept it as\r\nsuch, and if it furthers our selfish greed we take it gladly.\r\n\r\nThe moral code, like that of municipal law, is made up of a few simple\r\nrules, easily understood, and the trouble comes in on the practice of\r\nthe one and the application of the other. That church is divine which\r\nsubordinates the rule to the practice, and has works as well as faith\r\nto testify to its commission. That is the true religion which leaves\r\nthe sanctuary with the believer, and is with him at all hours, eats at\r\nhis table, sleeps in his bed, and accompanies him to his labor. It\r\nnever leaves him alone.\r\n\r\nHow we have separated the two, the precept from practice, this pulpit\r\ncult bears evidence. The high-toned infidel and lofty agnostic sneer\r\nat the humble Catholic who, in deepest contrition, confesses his sins\r\nto his spiritual adviser and goes forth relieved, probably to fall\r\nagain. How much better it is to attend divine worship one day in\r\nseven, put on a grave countenance, and listen to eloquent discourses,\r\nmore eloquent prayers, and heavenly music, and then go out with no\r\nthought of religion until the next Sunday returns for a like\r\nperformance!\r\n\r\nTwo thirds of what comes under the head of moral conduct in one is\r\npure selfishness. A man may be honest in his dealing, honorable in his\r\nconduct, a good citizen, a loving husband, and an affectionate father,\r\nand yet be without kindness, charity, faith, hope--in a word, all that\r\nbrought Christ upon earth in His mission of peace.\r\n\r\nOne summer and autumn we lived at a mountain resort on the line of a\r\ngreat railroad. We saw, day after day, long lines of cattle-cars\r\ncrowded with their living freight in a three-hundred-mile pull of\r\nintensest agony. The poor beasts were jammed against each other,\r\nunable to lie down,--to get under the hoofs of the others was\r\ndeath,--fighting, hungry, in the last stages of thirst, panting with\r\ntongues protruded, and their beautiful eyes staring with that\r\nexpression of wild despair which the scent of blood brings to them,\r\nthey rolled on to their far-off slaughter-houses with moans that were\r\nheart-breaking.\r\n\r\nIt was our fortune that same autumn to meet one of the cattle-merchants\r\nat church. He was there with his family. A stout, middle-aged man of\r\neminent respectability, he was a church-member, and looked up to as a\r\nmodel citizen. We saw him listening to the eloquent sermon, and\r\nwondered if there were not a low, deep undertone of agony running\r\nthrough the discourse. When the prayers were offered up he knelt\r\nhumbly, and covered his face with his hands. Did they shut out the\r\nwild, despairing eyes of those suffering beasts?\r\n\r\nYet how amazed would that estimable citizen have been had his minister\r\nsaid to him: \"You are railroading your soul to hell. Every moan of\r\nthose tortured animals goes up to God for record. You are freighting\r\ndisease to great cities, and the fevers and death are yet to be\r\nanswered for by you--wretched sinner!\"\r\n\r\nThere is not a fashionable church in any city of our land that has not\r\nwithin gunshot of its door great masses of starving, sinful,\r\npoverty-stricken humanity. Crowded into tenement-houses, from the damp\r\ncellars to the hot garrets, they make one wonder, not that they die,\r\nbut that they live. No eloquent discourse on the righteousness of\r\nright and the sinfulness of sin; no well-balanced sentences of\r\nprayers, sent up on perfumed air to our heavenly Father; no deep-toned\r\nthunder set to music in hymns, ever reach their ears, or could, if\r\nthey did, carry consolation to the sorrowful, or curing to the sick.\r\nAnd yet, from marble pulpits to velvet-cushioned pews, the work goes\r\non.\r\n\r\nWe beg pardon: it does not go on. The well-meaning divines complain of\r\nnon-attendance. They are startled by the fact that not one-tenth of\r\nour population of sixty millions are really attending church-members.\r\nWhat can be done to popularize the pulpit? There is but one way, and\r\nthat is to make the people desire to attend. Time was when the great\r\ntruths of Christianity were new to the human race. The multitudes were\r\neager to hear of the revelation, and the Church sent out its\r\nmissionaries to preach and teach mankind. So far as a knowledge of\r\nthese truths is concerned, the civilized people have been taught.\r\nThere is not a criminal in jail to-day but knows more theology than\r\nSt. Paul. The people are weary of this everlasting thrash of\r\ntheological chaff. The civilized world is fairly saturated with\r\npreaching, which has come to be stale, flat, and in every sense\r\nunprofitable.\r\n\r\nInstead of asking the people to come to the church, let the church go\r\nto the people. This is the secret of the sneers attending the Catholic\r\nfaith. There is, with it, very little preaching, but a great deal of\r\npractice. Its orphan asylums, its homes for the aged poor, its\r\nhospitals, to say nothing of its great body of devoted priests and\r\nholy sisters of charity, tell why it is that its temples are thronged,\r\nand its conversions almost miraculous.\r\n\r\nIt is a grave error to suppose that true religion is to be advanced\r\nthrough the intellect. It makes its appeal to the heart. If it is not\r\na refuge to the woful wayfarers of earth, it is nothing. If the\r\nsorrowful may not find comfort; they who are in pain, patience and\r\nhope; if the poor may not get sympathy and aid, and the dying\r\nconsolation, it is of doubtful good.\r\n\r\nAs for the preaching, all that we can say is, that when one produces\r\nevidence and proceeds to argue, he admits a doubt that neither\r\nevidence nor argument is of avail. God's truths call for no evidence.\r\nIf they are not self-evident, no process of poor human reason can\r\nmake them visible. An argument in behalf of such is a confession and a\r\ndefeat. The man who undertakes to prove that the sun shines is insane\r\nand a bore.\r\n\r\nThe pulpit work of worthy divines who think aloud upon their legs has\r\nlost its attraction in losing its novelty. They imitate the late Henry\r\nWard Beecher. And these immediate divines are filling their churches\r\nas merely platform-lecturers indulging in certain mental gymnastics\r\nthat glitter and glisten like a winter's sun on fields of ice. It is\r\nall brilliant and amusing to a few, but it is not religion.\r\n\r\n\r\nA BEAUTIFUL LIFE.\r\n\r\n\"Died at New York, 28th of November, 1888, Mrs. Eleanor Boyle\r\nSherman.\"\r\n\r\nThe above simple announcement of a sad event was read through more\r\ntears than usually fall to the lot of one whose unassuming, quiet life\r\nwas passed in the privacy of a purely domestic existence. This not\r\nbecause she was the wife of a noted officer, nor the daughter of one\r\nof Ohio's most famous statesmen, but for the excellence of her\r\ncharacter and the Christian spirit of her retired career, that made\r\nher life one long, continuous deed of goodness. If ever an angel\r\nwalked on earth administering to the sorrows and sickness of those\r\nabout her, that angel was Mrs. Sherman. Inheriting much of her great\r\nfather's fine intellect, she added a heart full to overflowing with\r\nthe sweetest sympathy for affliction in others. Self-sacrifice was to\r\nher a second nature. She not only carried in patient humility the\r\ncares imposed upon her by our Saviour, but cheerfully took up the\r\nwoful burdens of those whose failing spirits left them fainting on\r\ntheir way. Her exalted social position was no bar to the poor,\r\ndowntrodden, and oppressed. Her hand like her heart was ever open.\r\n\r\nThe heroism of private life is little noted among us. Acting out great\r\ndeeds of self-sacrifice in the silent, unseen walks of domestic\r\nexistence, it lacks the sustaining plaudits of a thoughtless public,\r\nand has no incentive to effort other than that found in the conscious\r\npresence of an approving God, and no hope of recompense beyond the\r\npromised approval of the hereafter when our heavenly Father shall say,\r\n\"Well done, thou good and faithful servant.\"\r\n\r\nNo man, however exalted his position may be, or distinguished his\r\nservices, is ever followed to his tomb by more real mourners than one\r\ncarriage can convey. The crape-canopied hearse, the nodding plumes of\r\nwoe, the wailing music of the hired bands, the long procession of\r\nslow-moving coaches, the tramp of hundreds, tell only of human vanity:\r\nwe make our show of sorrow. One vehicle only holds hearts breaking in\r\nan agony of grief--hearts that know nothing in their woe of the dear\r\none's greatness; know only that he has gone from their household that\r\nhis presence had made so happy. In his death the dear walls of that\r\nhome were shattered, the fire upon the hearth is dead, and the hard\r\nworld darkened down to desolation's nakedness. Could all who were\r\nfavored in knowing this beautiful character, and blessed by her very\r\npresence, been called to form the funeral cortege, real heart-felt\r\ngrief would have lived along the entire procession, and sobs, not\r\nstrains of mournful music, would have broken on the ear. And in this\r\nprocession would have been found not only the rich and well-born, clad\r\nin costly silks and furs, who had received from this gracious lady the\r\ndivine influences of the Christian spirit, but the thinly clad poor,\r\nthe dependent orphans, and helpless age. It is such a procession that\r\ndoes not disperse and disappear at the cemetery, but follows in prayer\r\nthe mourned-for spirit to its home in heaven.\r\n\r\nIt is not for us to invade the sacred privacy of this lovely life. We\r\nowe an apology to her blessed memory for even this mention of her\r\nname. We know how she shrank from such while among us, and it is only\r\nas a duty to the living that we venture on this tribute to her\r\nexcellence.\r\n\r\nWhat we feel, and what must be felt by all, a pagan poet imbued\r\nunknowingly with the truest Christian impulses has sung in immortal\r\nverse:\r\n\r\n                                    \"But thou art fled,\r\n          Like some frail exhalation which the dawn\r\n          Robes in its golden beams;--ah, thou hast fled!\r\n          The brave, the gentle, and the beautiful,\r\n          The child of grace and genius! Heartless things\r\n          Are done and said i' the world, and many worms\r\n          And beasts and men live on, and mighty earth,\r\n          From sea and mountain, city and wilderness,\r\n          In vesper low or joyous orison,\r\n          Lifts still its solemn voice:--but thou art fled--\r\n          Thou canst no longer know or love the shapes\r\n          Of this phantasmal scene, who have to thee\r\n          Been purest ministers, who are, alas!\r\n          Now thou art not!\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                    \"Art and eloquence,\r\n          And all the shows of the world, are frail and vain\r\n          To weep a loss that turns their lights to shade.\r\n          It is a woe 'too deep for tears' when all\r\n          Is reft at once, when some surpassing Spirit,\r\n          Whose light adorned the world around it, leaves\r\n          Those who remain behind, not sobs nor groans,\r\n          The passionate tumult of a clinging hope,\r\n          But pale despair and cold tranquillity--\r\n          Nature's vast frame, the web of human things,\r\n          Birth and the grave, that are not as they were.\"\r\n\r\nAs a low, sweet echo to the music of those words, we add a tribute to\r\nthe memory of this noble woman from the gifted pen of Helen Grace\r\nSmith:\r\n\r\n          Ah! Death hath passed us by--hath passed us near;\r\n          The swift, keen arrow cutting the light air,\r\n                  And falling where she stood\r\n                  In perfect motherhood,\r\n          With silver crown of years upon her hair.\r\n\r\n          The many years--the glorious full years,\r\n          All shining with her charity and truth--\r\n                  How tenderly we trace\r\n                  Their silent work of grace,\r\n          Fulfilling the sweet promise of her youth!\r\n\r\n          A life complete, yet lived not all in sun,\r\n          But following sometimes through shadowed ways,\r\n                  Where sorrow and distress\r\n                  Cried loud that she might bless\r\n          With her pure light the darkness of their days.\r\n\r\n          Resplendent mission, beautiful as his\r\n          Who fought for her in fighting for his land--\r\n                  Who heard the loud acclaim\r\n                  That gave his honored name\r\n          To live wherever deeds of heroes stand.\r\n\r\n          And she, the wife, the mother--ah! her tears\r\n          Fell for the wounded sufferers and the dead--\r\n                  Fell for the poor bereaved,\r\n                  The helpless ones who grieved\r\n          Where ruin and despair lay thickly spread.\r\n\r\n          Now peace--God's peace--is brooding o'er the land,\r\n          And peacefully she sleeps, her life-work done.\r\n                  We would not break that sleep,\r\n                  That rest so calm, so deep,\r\n          That sweet reward by faithful service won.\r\n\r\n          Only we kneel, as often she hath knelt,\r\n          Where Heaven's love lights up the quiet aisle,\r\n                  And, praying as she prayed,\r\n                  Our sorrow is allayed--\r\n          Our grieving changed to gladness in God's smile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PASSING SHOW.\r\n\r\nThe political season is over, and popular fancy lightly turns to\r\nthoughts of the drama. New York's gay winter festivities are opening,\r\nand the theatres are nightly crowded with appreciative audiences. It\r\nwould be strange indeed if, with upwards of twenty-five comfortable\r\nresorts for popular amusement in the metropolis, and a weekly change\r\nof attractions drawn from the best American and European sources, the\r\nmost fastidious taste should fail to be pleased.\r\n\r\nProbably the most successful of this year's dramatic ventures is \"The\r\nYeomen of the Guard\" at the Casino. The managers of that theatre have\r\nbeen wise to replace their variety-shows with this excellent comic\r\nopera. It steadily holds its own in spite of the critics, and after a\r\nthree-months' run continues as popular as ever. Mr. Aronson says it\r\nmay remain at the Casino until the end of April. Gilbert and\r\nSullivan's productions are always new, always attractive. Each has a\r\ncharacter of its own, yet no one could fail to detect the humor of\r\nGilbert and the merry melodies of Sullivan in them all. If one may\r\nventure to compare their beauties, we should say that \"Pinafore\"\r\nexcelled in vivacity--that peculiar sprightliness which the French\r\ncall _verve_; \"The Pirates\" in humor; \"Patience\" and \"Iolanthe\" in\r\nsatire--the one of a social craze, the other of political flunkeyism;\r\nand \"The Yeomen of the Guard\" in quaintness. The patter songs of the\r\nfirst are lacking in the last, hence its airs are not so dinned into\r\none's ears by the whistling youth of every street-corner, but the\r\nmusic is of a distinctly higher order. It is unfortunate that there is\r\nno change of scenery between the two acts. The dingy background of the\r\nTower is not relieved by brilliance of costume, and the eye of the\r\nordinary theatre-goer, accustomed to look for altered scenic effects,\r\nis disappointed at the repetition, only relieved by moonlight in the\r\nsecond act.\r\n\r\nSome of the incidents of the play resemble \"Don Cæsar de Bazan,\" and\r\nare similarly worked out. Colonel Fairfax, imprisoned as a sorcerer,\r\nmarries a young ballad-singer, who receives a hundred crowns, with the\r\nassurance that within an hour she will be a widow through her\r\nhusband's execution. He escapes, and is disguised as one of the Yeomen\r\nof the Guard, with whom, in spite of her vows, the young girl falls in\r\nlove. A pardon for Fairfax arrives, his identity is established, the\r\nsinger learns that the man she loves is already her husband, and all\r\nends happily. In this transmutation of character, from the imprisoned\r\nsorcerer to one of the prison-keepers, we recognize the topsyturvydom\r\nof Gilbert, which is the distinguishing mark of his genius, from the\r\nBab Ballads all through his later productions. In catchwords the\r\npresent opera is lacking, and in the puns which never failed to draw\r\nout the \"ohs\" of the audience. But there is the same genial\r\nundercurrent of innocent humor which for years has amused the whole\r\nEnglish-speaking public, and for which Mr. Gilbert deserves the\r\nlasting gratitude of a world too much given to life-sadness and mental\r\nworry. If \"a merry heart doeth good like a medicine,\" it is safe to\r\nsay that the prescriptions of this most ingenious dramatic author have\r\neffected more widespread good than those of the most celebrated\r\nfollowers of Æsculapius.\r\n\r\nIt is especially to its music that the operetta owes its success. In\r\nthis production Sullivan has excelled his former efforts. The first\r\nchorus is very fine, and in orchestration Sir Arthur shows himself to\r\nbe without a rival. Its pure melodies form a valuable addition to\r\nEnglish music, and mark the growth of a new school of which he is the\r\nleader. The influence of Wagner is clearly seen in some of its\r\nmajestic marches, but the English composer escapes the metaphysical\r\nand unintelligible harmonies of the German school. Sir Arthur has\r\nevidently aimed at producing a more classical composition than any of\r\nhis previous works, and he has done this perhaps at some slight\r\nsacrifice of immediate popularity. The jingle of \"Pinafore\" and \"The\r\nPirates\" is replaced by a more sober style, which is likely to produce\r\na lasting impression on English music.\r\n\r\nMary Anderson captured the town, as usual, on her return from England\r\nearly in November. Palmer's theatre was so crowded that it was\r\ndifficult to get a seat even four weeks in advance, and the audiences\r\nwere so enthusiastic that their enthusiasm constituted quite an\r\ninterruption to the play. She chose \"The Winter's Tale\" as her opening\r\npiece, taking the parts both of Hermione the queen and of her daughter\r\nPerdita. Miss Anderson is the first actress who has ever dared to so\r\ninterpret the play. She tried it at the London Lyceum, to the horror\r\nof the critics, but it proved a great success. The resemblance between\r\nHermione and her daughter, which Shakespeare insists on so strongly,\r\ngave Miss Anderson the idea of trying both parts. This plan had the\r\nadditional advantage, that the leading lady is not suppressed by being\r\ncut out of the act in which Hermione does not appear. Her studies\r\nabroad have undoubtedly improved \"Our Mary.\" The coldness and\r\nstatuesqueness with which she has been reproached could not now be\r\ndiscovered by the most adverse critic. She is more womanly, softer,\r\nless angular, and more graceful. The programme at Palmer's should have\r\nbeen varied so as to give the public opportunity to see her in the old\r\n_rôles_ that used to charm all beholders. One must not forget the\r\nexquisite scenery with which this piece has been set. It was used at\r\nthe Lyceum, and, although it has been considerably cut down to fit the\r\nsmaller stage of Palmer's theatre, it is one of the best settings ever\r\nseen in this country.\r\n\r\nEdwin Booth and Lawrence Barrett have been doing fairly with their\r\nShakespearean revivals at the Fifth Avenue. There is no truth in the\r\nreport that any difference has occurred between them. They will appear\r\ntogether at the Broadway Theatre next season, with better support, it\r\nis to be hoped, than they have recently had. Miss Mina Gale, who plays\r\nthe leading female parts, however, is a promising young actress.\r\n\r\nAgnes Booth has scored a great triumph as Mrs. Seabrook in \"Captain\r\nSwift\" at the Madison Square. For painstaking attention to detail,\r\nnicety of intonation, and powerful expression, Agnes Booth is in the\r\nfront rank of leading ladies. We have seen her in many society dramas,\r\nand in each she has shown a charming appreciation of all the\r\nrequirements. At the Madison Square, with its cosey stage, the visitor\r\nforgets that he is one of the audience, and feels almost like an\r\nintruder upon a scene in a private drawing-room. The situations in\r\n\"Captain Swift\" are striking. The hero, an illegitimate son of Mrs.\r\nSeabrook, goes away in his youth to Australia, cracks a bank, and\r\nreturns after many years, unconsciously to become a rival to the\r\nlegitimate son for the affections of his cousin. The mother discovers\r\nhis identity, and discloses it to him in order to prevent the\r\nill-starred marriage. The mingled expression of shame, suffering, and\r\nmaternal love in Agnes Booth's face during this scene is one not soon\r\nto be forgotten. The audience remains spellbound for a moment, then a\r\nburst of enthusiastic applause crowns her effort. In the original\r\nplay, as written by Mr. Haddon Chambers, the hero, being followed by\r\nan Australian detective, commits suicide. As altered for the American\r\nstage--by Mr. Boucicault, it is said,--Captain Swift, to relieve the\r\nSeabrook family from embarrassment, gives himself up to the officers\r\nof justice. In either case the _morale_ of the play--the portrayal of\r\nan absconding bank-burglar and horse-thief as polished, brave,\r\ngenerous, gentle--is to be regretted, as every apotheosis of vice\r\nshould be. Mr. Barrymore, as Captain Swift, exhibits some capital\r\nacting, and Annie Russell makes a very graceful Mabel Seabrook.\r\n\r\nMrs. Burnett's dramatization of her well-known story, \"Little Lord\r\nFauntleroy,\" is attracting large crowds at the Broadway Theatre. It is\r\npeculiar in that it depends entirely for its success on the acting of\r\na child, or rather children, Elsie Leslie and Tommy Russell\r\nalternating in the title _rôle_. This arrangement has been adopted\r\nbecause the part is so long that it would be too fatiguing for a young\r\nchild to play it night after night. Both the children show a\r\ndelightful unconsciousness in the recitation of their lines, but\r\nTommy's natural boyishness fits the character rather better than\r\nElsie's assumed character, although her gracefulness charms the\r\naudience. The motive of the play, as in the story, is the love of a\r\nboy for his mother; and this makes it a great attraction for the\r\nladies.\r\n\r\nA pretty play is \"Sweet Lavender\" at the Lyceum. Its plot is simple. A\r\nyoung lawyer falls in love with his housekeeper's gentle little\r\ndaughter, but family pride prevents their union until, by the\r\nopportune failure of a bank, his fortunes are reduced to a level with\r\nhers. Its clever details and quiet humor make it well worth seeing.\r\nPinero, the author, is a playwright skilled in the mechanical\r\narrangement of his situations, and everything runs smoothly. Miss\r\nLouise Dillon as Lavender, fits the part exactly.\r\n\r\nThompson and Ryer's play of \"The Two Sisters\" at Niblo's made many\r\nfriends, in spite of its somewhat threadbare theme. There was the\r\ntypical dissolute young man who seduces one of the sisters, and the\r\nbenevolent hotel-keeper who befriends and marries the other. The\r\nvillain murders his father, is arrested, and dies, while the betrayed\r\ngirl is given a home by her sister's husband. Some good singing is\r\nscattered throughout the play.\r\n\r\nA similar drama, full of love and murder, was \"The Fugitive,\" by Tom\r\nCraven, which had a very brief run at the Windsor.\r\n\r\nVivacious Nelly Farren and the London Gaiety Company, which recently\r\nheld the boards of the Standard Theatre in \"Monte Christo, jr.,\" gave\r\nNew Yorkers an enlivening taste of English burlesque. The play is\r\nnothing, the dancing everything.\r\n\r\nThe German opera season is well under way. The Metropolitan Opera\r\nHouse opened with \"The Huguenots,\" which was followed by \"William\r\nTell\" and \"Fidelio.\" Herr Anton Seidl, with his unrivalled orchestra,\r\nmakes these productions of the great German and Italian composers a\r\nyearly treat to lovers of music, which is looked forward to with\r\neagerness and parted from with regret.\r\n\r\n\"The Old Homestead\" holds its own at the Academy of Music; the \"Brass\r\nMonkey\" at the Bijou has had a longer run than it deserves; Clara\r\nMorris has been appearing in Brooklyn; Louis James and Marie\r\nWainwright are beginning their New York engagement. \"She\" was\r\npronounced a great success in Boston, over $1600 being taken in at one\r\nperformance. Mr. Boucicault is conducting his Madison Square\r\ntheatre-school of acting with patience and confidence, although the\r\nresults thus far are not very promising. Of the eighty pupils, the men\r\nare awkward and the women lack talent. However, as Mr. Boucicault\r\nsaid, if but three or even one out of the eighty should come to\r\ndramatic eminence, it would be well worth all the trouble.\r\n\r\nOur German fellow-citizens are to be congratulated on the opening of\r\nMr. Amberg's new theatre in Fifteenth Street. The location is central,\r\nthe house is well built, the company good, and the repertory includes\r\ndrama, comedy, farce, and comic opera.\r\n\r\nThere have not been many dramatic events abroad this season. The new\r\nShaftesbury Theatre in London is possessed of such a wonderful\r\nfire-proof curtain that a few weeks ago the audience had to be\r\ndismissed because they could not raise it. \"Captain Swift\" proved a\r\ngreat success, financially, at the Haymarket, and \"Nadjy\" is\r\nattracting crowds at the Avenue Theatre. At Terry's, \"Dream Faces,\" a\r\none-act play, and \"The Policeman,\" a three-act farce, had good houses.\r\nGrace Hawthorne has just had to pay a hundred pounds to the owners of\r\nsome lions. She was seeking to produce an English version of\r\n\"Theodora,\" and engaged a den of lions twelve months in advance of the\r\ntime she wanted them. She demurred to paying for the animals that she\r\nhad not used, but the case went against her. On the Continent there is\r\nnot much doing. P. A. Morin, the dean of Holland's dramatists and\r\nactors, recently celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of his first\r\nappearance, his golden jubilee, at Amsterdam. It is announced that\r\nPatti will sing in \"Romeo and Juliet,\" at the Grand Opera House,\r\nParis, giving three performances for one thousand dollars each.\r\n\r\nMore attention than usual is being paid just now to the development of\r\nmusical taste on both sides of the water. Mr. Walter Damrosch has been\r\nlecturing in New York on Symphony. The Liederkranz and the Symphony\r\nSociety have been giving enjoyable concerts; and Herr Moriz Rosenthal,\r\nthe pianist, has met with a success that has only been rivalled in\r\nlate years by Joseffy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVIEWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the late George Butler, quite regardless of fact, and for the fun\r\nof the thing, telegraphed from Long Branch to Dion Boucicault at New\r\nYork, that Billy Florence and Jack Raymond had been saved from a\r\nwatery grave by a huge Newfoundland, Boucicault responded, \"God is\r\ngood to the Irish.\" This sentence, so often quoted, passed, without\r\nits point, among the masses. What Dion caught on the nib of his pen\r\nand wired to the world was the fact that these two famous comedians,\r\nwith their English names, were Irish by birth, instincts, and\r\nblunders. The people that present to the earth the only race that has\r\nwit for its national trait never had two more striking illustrations\r\nof the fact than in these stage delineators of genius. Raymond is in\r\nhis grave, and the inevitable dust of forgetfulness is gathering upon\r\nhis tomb. But Florence, so kindly known throughout the land as Billy\r\nFlorence, is yet alive, and very much alive. The evidence of this fact\r\nis before us in a book entitled _Florence Fables_ (Belford, Clarke &\r\nCo.). Those so-called fables are not fables, but fiction without\r\nmorals, but full of interest, which is much better, and come to the\r\nreader in the shape of love-stories, odd adventures, and strange\r\nincidents at home and in foreign lands.\r\n\r\nThe book is sure of a wide sale, for the multitudes that have seen\r\nFlorence in his merry performances, and learned to love as well as\r\nenjoy this finished comedian behind the footlights, will be curious to\r\nlearn how he appears as an author. But they \"who come to scoff\" will\r\nhold on to enjoy. The name is enough to attract; the book itself is\r\nsufficiently charming to entrance the reader.\r\n\r\nIn the last issue of BELFORD'S we gave a specimen of the humor: to\r\nfind the pathos and the true love the reader must consult the volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Divided Lives_, a novel, by Edgar Fawcett (Belford, Clarke &\r\nCo.).--There is no more charming writer of English fiction than Edgar\r\nFawcett, and the volume before us is one of his best. He builds upon\r\nthe English method, animated by the French motive, and deepens the\r\nshallow affection of the first to the unfathomable depths of human\r\npassion to be found in the last. His dramatic ability holds one to the\r\ninterest of his book whether it has plot or not. Of course he has his\r\nfaults. His characters are known to us mostly by name, labelled, as it\r\nwere, and he will at any time sacrifice one or a dozen to work up a\r\ndramatic effect. Then he has affectations, not precisely of style, but\r\nof phraseology, that irritate; and he cannot resist putting smart\r\nspeeches into the mouths of everybody. Here is an example:\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, no,\" Angela replied, \"there never was a more devoted friend\r\nthan Alva is. To leave her charming home, and all her gay town life,\r\nfor weeks, just that she may be near me! It is something to vibrate\r\nthrough one's entire lifetime.\"\r\n\r\nThis is said by a little girl to her lover, and the lover responds:\r\n\r\n\"It teaches me a lesson. What is easier than to misjudge our\r\nfellow-creatures, and how wantonly we're forever doing it! We are all\r\nlike a lot of mountebanks behind an illuminated sheet. The uncouth\r\nshadows we cast there are the world's misrepresentation of us.\"\r\n\r\nAs these young people were desperately in love with each other, but\r\nthen just engaged, this sort of talk, however clever, is as much out\r\nof place and jarring on one as would be the murder scene from\r\nMacbeth.\r\n\r\nEdgar Fawcett is given to a delineation of social life in New York.\r\nThis is a wide and varied field, and the author makes it intensely\r\ninteresting. We have called attention, however, to the fact that he is\r\nnot altogether correct. The English motive, of turning the interest\r\nupon social caste, is not true when applied to our mixed condition. We\r\nhave no aristocratic class, as recognized in England; and the\r\nassumption of such in real life is too ludicrous and unreal for the\r\npurpose of the novelist. Mere wealth without culture, and culture\r\nwithout wealth, contend in a mixed condition with each other, without\r\nsupplying the interest to be found in earnest endeavor to overcome\r\nunjust distinctions and power. When Mr. Fawcett does deal with a class\r\nhe is not always just. In his _Miriam Balestier_, published in the\r\nNovember number of BELFORD'S, by far the most artistically beautiful\r\nwork from the pen of our author, he by implication attacks an entire\r\nprofession that has held through generations not only the admiration\r\nbut love of the public. There is absolutely nothing in the vocation of\r\nan actor that either degrades or demoralizes. On the contrary, there\r\nis much to elevate and refine--the work sustained by art found in\r\npainting and music, the thought and feelings of the poets; and while\r\nthis is meant to amuse, the stage has been the most potent factor in\r\nnot only furthering civilization and culture in the masses, but\r\nawaking in the hearts of the many the loftiest patriotism known to\r\nhumanity. It has awakened a deeper feeling for the home, a firmer\r\ntrust in the law of right, and a stronger faith in virtue than aught\r\nelse of human origin. That taints, stains, and abuses have attached is\r\nno fault of the drama. One could as well attack the bar or the pulpit\r\nbecause a few unworthy members have disgraced themselves, as to hold\r\nthe stage responsible for the recognized evils that have fastened\r\nthemselves to a part. That we have senseless burlesques and lascivious\r\nexhibits of nakedness at a majority of our theatres is the fault of\r\nthe patrons, not the stage. The manager, like any other dealer in\r\ncommercial wares, caters to the taste of his customers, and the stage\r\nis no more responsible for their productions than the street is for\r\nthe wretched street-walker.\r\n\r\nSo long as citizens take their wives and children to witness the\r\nshameless productions, so long will the managers produce them, and\r\nwhen remonstrated with, shrug their shoulders, and ask, \"Well,\r\nwhat would you?\" The pulpit denounces the drama, but leaves untouched\r\ntheir congregations in their patronage of its abuse. The great city\r\nof New York, for example, lately entertained a convocation of\r\nProtestant clergymen, met to consider the sad fact that they were\r\npreaching to empty churches, and to devise means through which to\r\nawaken the religious conscience of the multitude. They went to\r\ntheir meetings along streets where every other house was a saloon,\r\nwhere the beastly American practice of \"treating\" makes each a door\r\nto ruin; and they passed corners where the walls were aflame with\r\npictured advertisements of naked legs, bare bosoms, and faces fairly\r\nenamelled with sin. One reads their debates with amazement. Their\r\nclerical minds were troubled with what? The doings of \"papists,\" as\r\nCatholics were designated.\r\n\r\nOur pen has carried us from our author. Of course Mr. Fawcett will\r\nsay--and say with truth--that his strictures were aimed at the abuse\r\nand not the legitimate use of the drama. But his fault was that he\r\ndoes not make this clear, and by intimation he leaves himself open to\r\nthe charge.\r\n\r\nAside from this, his work is a work of genius; and his story of the\r\nlittle girl who struggled with such vain endeavor against her\r\nenvironment will live among the noblest productions of fiction given\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Professor's Sister_, by Julian Hawthorne (Belford, Clarke &\r\nCo.).--This is the most successful work of a successful novelist, and\r\nholds the reader entranced from the first page till nearly the last.\r\nWe say reader, but not all readers. Mr. Hawthorne is as peculiar in\r\nhis work as his eminent father was, with a more select audience. He is\r\nat home in the wild, weird production of humanity, touched and marked\r\nby a spiritualism that is far above and beyond the average readers of\r\nromance. If it calls for as much culture, in its way, to enjoy a work\r\nof art as its creation called for in the artist, Mr. Hawthorne's\r\nfictions demand the same tastes and thought the author indulges in.\r\nThe little girl who craves love-stories, or the traveller upon the\r\ncars who picks up a book to lose in its pages the wearisome sense of\r\ntravel, will scarcely select the _Professor's Sister_, and if he or\r\nshe does, will wonder what in the name of Heaven it is all about.\r\n\r\nThere is another class, however, that will read with avidity and\r\ninterest every page of this book, and this class grows wider in our\r\nmidst every day. One meets at every turn a man or woman who will tell,\r\nin a matter-of-fact way generally, that is positively comical, of some\r\nexperience he or she has had with spooks. This, not the old-fashioned\r\nexperience with ghosts. All that has long since been relegated to the\r\nhalf-forgotten limbo of superstitious things. One hears of communions\r\nwith the dead, told off as one would tell of any ordinary occurrence\r\ncommon to our daily life. This is the natural reaction of the human\r\nmind against the scientific materialism of the day, that seeks to\r\npoison and destroy all religious faith. Religion is as necessary to\r\nhealth of mind as pure air is to that of body, and when deprived of\r\neither, we struggle for loop-holes of light and breath with\r\ninstinctive desperation. Shut out the light of heaven from the soul,\r\nbe it in library or laboratory, and one sickens and resists.\r\n\r\nMr. Hawthorne wisely lays the scene of his story in Germany. The\r\nrarefied condition of the German mind is recognized the world over,\r\nand through the everlasting smoke of philosophers' and students' pipes\r\none is prepared for all sorts of fantastic shapes moving through the\r\nmist. The author opens with a talk on occult subjects that sounds like\r\nvoices heard in a fog-bank. With the reader thus prepared, he plunges\r\nhim into a drama where substantial men and women mingle with spirits,\r\nand the strange story does overcome us like a summer's cloud, without\r\nour special wonder.\r\n\r\nWe have said the story holds one spellbound till near the end. The\r\n_dénoûment_ is not good. \"Calling spirits from the vasty deep\" is much\r\neasier than disposing of them after they come. To give a satisfactory\r\nexplanation of the mystery, and to exorcise the spirit back to rest,\r\nmake no easy task, and Mr. Hawthorne is not to blame for finding it\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nWe cannot drop the book without calling attention to the author's\r\nhappy use of English, in depicting character. Here is a specimen:\r\n\r\n\"Madame Hertrugge was white, red, and black. Her skin was white, her\r\ncheeks and lips red, her hair, eyes, and eyebrows black. Her mouth was\r\nbeautifully formed, and firm, with a firm chin. Her eyes were rather\r\nfull, imperious, and ardent. She was overflowing with vitality. The\r\nhand which she extended to one in greeting was soft but strong, with\r\nlong fingers. She was dressed in black, as became her recent\r\nwidowhood; but she had not the air of mourning much. She was sensuous,\r\nvoluptuous, but there was strength behind the voluptuousness. You\r\nreceived from her a powerful impression of sex. Every line of her,\r\nevery movement, every look, was woman. And she made you feel that she\r\nvalued you just so far as you were man. You might be as nearly Caliban\r\nas a man can be, but if you were a man she would consider you. You\r\nmight court her successfully with a horsewhip, but if she felt the\r\nmaster in you, and were convinced that you were captivated by her, she\r\nwould accept you. It was ludicrous to think of the senile old merchant\r\nhaving married such a creature. In fact, marriage, viewed in\r\nconnection with this woman, seemed an absurdity. There was nothing\r\nholy about her, nothing reserved, nothing sacred. I don't mean that\r\nshe was not ladylike, as the phrase is. She knew the society\r\ncatechism, and practised it to a nicety, but like a clever actress,\r\nrather than by instinct or sympathy. It was obvious that she didn't\r\nvalue respectability and propriety the snap of her white fingers, save\r\nas a means to an end; and if she were in the company of one whom she\r\ntrusted intimately, she would laugh those popular virtues to scorn\r\nwith her warm, insolent breath. As it was, all the forms and\r\nceremonies in the world could not disguise her. Her very dress\r\nsuggested rather than concealed what was beneath it. She was a naked\r\ngoddess--a pagan goddess--and there was no help for it. She made you\r\nrealize how powerless our nice institutions are in the presence of a\r\ngenuine, rank human temperament.\r\n\r\n\"And be it here observed that I am here writing of her as a\r\ntemperament, and nothing more. I knew nothing of her former life and\r\nexperience. I had no reason to think that her conduct has ever been\r\nless than unexceptionable. But the facts about her were insignificant\r\ncompared with her latent possibilities. Circumstances might hitherto\r\nhave been adverse to her development; but opportunity--rosy, golden,\r\naudacious opportunity--was all she needed. She certainly bore no signs\r\nof satiety; she had nothing of the _blasé_ air. She was thirsty for\r\nlife, and she would appreciate every draught of it. She was impatient\r\nto begin. And, contemplating her abounding, triumphant, delicious\r\nwell-being, it seemed as if she might maintain the high-tide of\r\nenjoyment until she was a hundred. It really inclined one to paganism\r\nto look at her.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_What Dreams May Come_, by Frank Lin (Belford, Clarke & Co.).--This is\r\na cleverly constructed story of English life by an American pen, and\r\nthe average reader is kept in doubt as to the sex of the author. There\r\nis a clear, incisive style of the masculine sort on one page that\r\nindicates the man; there is a treatment of female wearing apparel on\r\nanother that gives proof of the feminine. With us there is one feature\r\nthat solves the doubt. The pages abound in convictions. Now the female\r\nmind, as a general thing, is not given to doubt. When a woman believes\r\nanything she believes it, and her faith is as firm as the solid rock.\r\nShe stands \"on hardpan,\" to use a phrase common to the Pacific slope.\r\nAlthough the book is built on dreams, the theory of heredity it is\r\nwritten to promulgate is no dream in the mind of this fair author. We\r\nhave called attention to the fact that the use of the novel to\r\nillustrate some doctrine, philosophical or religious, is really an\r\nabuse. One takes up such form of fiction to be amused, and one feels\r\nput upon and abused to find it an essay more or less learned on life\r\nand things. If a little information can be injected in the story\r\nunbeknownst, like the parson's liquor told of by President Lincoln,\r\nwell and good; but it is rarely done successfully. If philosophy is\r\nindulged in, one quickly detects the bald head and wrinkled brow; if\r\nit is religion, the cloven hoof or wicked tail of Satan betrays the\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\nWhen it was once proposed by a staff officer to drive an obnoxious\r\nguest from headquarters by a liberal use of burnt brimstone, General\r\nSherman said, \"That is high strategy in its way, but it is not war.\"\r\n\"When one goes a turkey-hunting one does not care to be killed by\r\nbears,\" said an old hunter; and when a seeker after amusement, to be\r\nfound in a love-story, opens what purports to be a novel, it is\r\nshocking to find it a learned treatise on some abstruse subject.\r\n\r\nThe book before us is another illustration of this defect. It opens\r\nwith an exquisite picture of Constantinople a hundred years since. In\r\nthis prologue some wicked conduct is rather hinted at than told. After\r\nthis the story opens and moves on pleasantly enough, until the fact is\r\ndeveloped that the hero and heroine are reproductions of the sinful\r\ngrandfather and grandmother long since lost to the census-taker of the\r\nBritish empire. What was evil in the ancestors is an innocent love in\r\nthe descendants; and the fair author exhibits considerable power by\r\npreserving the sanity of her characters, to say nothing of that of the\r\nreader, in the complications and situations that follow.\r\n\r\nThe book is of interest to us, not so much for what it accomplishes,\r\nas the promise of better things. It exhibits all the qualities\r\nnecessary to a successful writer of fiction. There is a keen\r\nappreciation of character, a love of nature, and a clear, incisive\r\nstyle that make a combination which if properly directed insures\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PASSING OF THE YEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Like some triumphal Orient pageantry\r\n           Beheld afar in slow and stately march,\r\n         Glittering with gold and crimson blazonry,\r\n           Till lost at length through many a dusky arch--\r\n         I saw the day's last clustering spears of light\r\n           Enter the cloudy portals of the night.\r\n\r\n         The wind, whose brazen clarions had blown\r\n           Imperious fanfarons before the sun\r\n         All the brief winter afternoon, died down,\r\n           And in the hush of twilight, one by one,\r\n         Like maidens leaning from high balconies,\r\n           The early stars looked forth with lustrous eyes.\r\n\r\n         Then came the moon like a deserted queen,\r\n           In blanchèd weed and pensive loneliness;\r\n         Not as she rises in midsummer green,\r\n           Hailed by a festal world in gala dress,\r\n         With thin sweet incense swung from buds and leaves,\r\n           And strident minstrelsy of August eves;\r\n\r\n         But treading in cold calm the frozen plain,\r\n           With bare white feet and argent torch aloft,\r\n         Unheralded through all her drear domain,\r\n           Save where the cricket sang in sheltered croft,\r\n         And, faintly heard in fitful monotone,\r\n           A solitary owl made shuddering moan.\r\n\r\nCharles Lotin Hildreth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LION'S SHARE.\r\n\r\nBy Mrs. Clark Waring.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nSUKEY IN THE MEADOW.\r\n\r\n\"Where's that cow?\"\r\n\r\nThe speaker was old Farmer Creecy. He was coming up the back steps,\r\nand his words were addressed to his wife, who was manipulating an\r\narchaic churn on the back porch.\r\n\r\n\"What cow?\" sharply retorted Mrs. Creecy, startled out of all\r\nknowledge of four-footed beasts by the unexpectedness of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\"_What cow!_ Look here, now, Alvirey, have you got any sense at all?\r\nHow many cows have we got? Can't you count that far? Don't you know\r\nhow many?\"\r\n\r\nAlvirey did. Looking like a sheep being led to the slaughter, and\r\nfeeling worse than two sheep under such circumstances, she hung her\r\nhead low, and answered, meekly:\r\n\r\n\"One cow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I ask you, again, where is that cow?\"\r\n\r\n\"And why do you ask me that, Jacob Creecy? You know as well as I do\r\nwhere she is. She's down in the meadow.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where's Mell?\"\r\n\r\n\"Down there, too. They ain't nobody else to keep Sukey out the corn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ain't, hey? Ha! ha! ha! That's all you know about it! Where does you\r\nkeep your senses, anyhow, Alvirey? Out o' doors? Because, I ain't\r\nnever had the good luck to find any of 'em at home, yet, as often as\r\nI've called! This very minute there's somebody else down in the meadow\r\nlong side o' Mell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, who, Jacob? Who can it be?\"\r\n\r\n\"You wouldn't guess in a month o' Sundays, Alvirey. Not you! Guessing\r\nto the point ain't in your line. It's that chap what's staying over at\r\nthe Guv'ner's, who looks like he had the title-deeds of the American\r\ncontinent stuffed loose in his vest-pocket.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't say so! Lor'! Jacob, what does he want down there with\r\nMell?\"\r\n\r\n\"What does he want? If you had a single grain of sense, Alvirey, you'd\r\nknow without any telling. He wants to make a fool of her! That's what\r\na man generally has in view when he runs after a woman. But, I am a\r\nthinking, that chap won't make no fool out of Mell, for Mell's got a\r\nlong head, like her old daddy, and a tongue of learning to back it!\r\nJust you keep on a saying nothing. You never missed getting things\r\ninto a mess yet, as I knows on, 'cept when you let 'em alone. I'll\r\nshut down on him right away, and then I'll be _blarsted_ if Mell can't\r\ntake care of herself! Don't be nowise uneasy, Alvirey. Mell takes\r\nafter her old dad.\"\r\n\r\nAlvirey did not return immediately to her churning. She craned her\r\nneck and got on her tiptoes, and gazed curiously after her husband as\r\nhis stout figure rolled heavily to the edge of the breezy woodland,\r\nand thence beyond to the newly cleared grounds, and onward still to\r\nthat narrow path among the pines, whose turf-margined and daisy-dotted\r\ntrack was a covert way to the meadow. Presently, through its mazy\r\nwindings and the medium of a hazy summer atmosphere, Mr. Creecy came\r\nin sight of a youthful Jersey, sedately cropping some tender blades of\r\ngrass on the enticing borderland of a promising cornfield, and a young\r\ngirl not far away seated on an old stump in a shady nook under a clump\r\nof trees. Her costume consisted principally of an airy muslin frock,\r\nnebulous in figure, and falling about her in simple folds, and a white\r\nsun-bonnet, which was a bonnet and something more--to be explicit, an\r\nartistic elaboration of tucks and puffs and piled-on embroideries,\r\nbeneath which peeped forth a face as prodigal of blooming sweets as a\r\nbasket heaped with spring flowers.\r\n\r\nAt her feet lounged in careless fashion a young man. He was lithe and\r\nstraight, and had that striking cast of countenance which catches the\r\nobservant eye on first sight. This look of distinction, which in him\r\nwas as marked in form as in feature, has been called, not inaptly,\r\nthoroughbredness. A self-made man never has it. All that a man may do\r\nwill not put it upon himself, but his son possesses it as an\r\nheritage.\r\n\r\nLooking upon such persons, we know intuitively that they have always\r\nhad the best of everything, beginning from their cradle, the best of\r\n_its_ kind.\r\n\r\nNot always strong, these thoroughbred faces are generally attractive.\r\nThe one before us possesses both strength and beauty. We may consider\r\nit foremost among his first-rate advantages.\r\n\r\nSeeing this huge monster of humanity bearing down upon them,\r\nslow-wabbling, like a proboscidian mammal, fast-puffing, like a steam\r\nlocomotive, the young man lifted himself to a sitting posture, and\r\nwithout any suspicion as to the true state of the case, remarked to\r\nhis companion:\r\n\r\n\"Here comes a doughty old customer, upon my word! 'What tempest, I\r\ntrow, threw this whale with so many tons of oil'----\"\r\n\r\nThe young lady cleared her throat--she cleared it point-blankly.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, but, perhaps you do not know, that is--is--my father.\"\r\n\r\nStammering forth these words, she at the same time turned very red in\r\nthe face.\r\n\r\nThis was slightly awkward, or would have been to another. As for this\r\nyoung man, he did not mind a little thing like that.\r\n\r\n\"I did not know it,\" he told the girl, unruffled; \"I crave your\r\npardon. The fact is, it is an habitual failing of mine to make sport\r\nof fat people. The lubberly clumsiness of a huge corporation of human\r\nflesh is to me so irresistibly comic! My mother tells me a dreadful\r\nday of retribution is coming--a day, wherein I shall be fifty and fat,\r\nand a fit subject for the ridicule of others.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot discern the foreshadows of such a day,\" replied the girl,\r\nglancing with unconscious approbation at the admirable outlines of\r\na figure whose proportions were well-nigh faultless. She fingered\r\nnervously at her bonnet-strings, smiled a panic-stricken little smile,\r\nbroke out into a cold sweat of fearful expectation, and through all\r\nthe horrors of the situation, tried her best to emulate the young\r\nman's inimitable air of cultured composure. He got up at this\r\njuncture from the ground, not hastily, not awkwardly, but in his own\r\ntime and at his own pleasure, and standing there, entirely at his\r\nease, looked every inch the living exemplar of that expressive\r\nlittle phrase--\"don't-care.\"\r\n\r\nSome persons object to being interrupted, he did not.\r\n\r\nThe girl stood up, too, but stood with such a difference! More and\r\nmore disconcerted she became with every passing second, so ashamed was\r\nshe of her unsightly old father, in his blue cotton farm clothes,\r\ndirty and baggy, and his red cotton handkerchief--no redder than his\r\nface--so ashamed, and with such a sense of guilt in her shame! Truth\r\nto tell, the contrast between the two men thus confronted, was almost\r\nstartling; the bloated ungainliness of the one, the sinewy shapeliness\r\nof the other; the misshapen grotesqueness of the one, and the\r\nsculpturesque comeliness of the other. It was a contrast painful to\r\nany intelligent observer, and for the poor girl before us, about to\r\nintroduce a lover of such mold to a father of such aspect, it was like\r\nbeing put to the rack.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Devonhough, father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. _Who?_\" gasped a big voice, struggling out from smothered depths\r\nof grossness.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Devonhough,\" repeated the daughter, looking all manner of ways,\r\n\"a friend of the Rutlands.\"\r\n\r\n\"How does ye, Mr. Deviloh?\" inquired the old farmer, in his\r\nexceedingly countrified, agonizingly familiar manner; extending a big,\r\nrough, red, and very filthy hand to be shaken by this exquisite sprig\r\nof refined gentility. Mr. Devonhough, needless to mention, touched it\r\nas gingerly as if it had been a glaringly wide awake and aggressively\r\ndisposed Cobra de Capello. He endured the ceremony in silence,\r\nhowever; about as much as could be reasonably expected from one so\r\nsuperbly self-controlled.\r\n\r\n\"What will father do next?\" wondered the perturbed young lady, in\r\nburning suspense. What he did was to stare unmercifully into the young\r\nman's face, as if every separate feature was a distinct and\r\nincomprehensible phenomenon, and, afterward, inspect him with due\r\ncarefulness, and at his very deliberate leisure, from the hat on his\r\nhead to the shoes on his feet.\r\n\r\nMr. Devonhough did not flinch. Some persons object to being stared at;\r\nhe did not. It is very foolish to mind such things. And besides, he\r\nhad eyes as well as this old Brobdingnagian, and knew how to use them\r\nto quite as good a purpose. While the bellicose Creecy took in slowly\r\nthe outward manifestations of this bland young stranger, the young\r\nstranger himself, in about two seconds and a half, had cross-examined\r\nevery constituent element in the old man's body, and thoroughly\r\nanalyzed even the marrow in his bones.\r\n\r\nWe have intimated that the old man's figure was bad; his face was a\r\ndreadful climax to a bad figure, so marred it was by worry, so\r\nbattered by time, so travel-stained on life's rough journey, so\r\nbattle-scarred in life's hard strife. Behind this forbidding frontage,\r\nthe old man kept in store a good, sound heart; but what availed that\r\nto his present inquisitor? A good, sound heart in an ugly body, is the\r\nlast thing a young man looks for in this world, or cares to find.\r\n\r\nFrom the inspection of so much ugliness, Mr. Devonhough glanced\r\ntowards the daughter; it was merely a glance, for with a delicate\r\nsense of feeling, he quickly looked away in an opposite direction.\r\nFlushed she was with shame, ill at ease, ready to cry out with a\r\nbitter cry, accusingly towards heaven, unspeakably humiliated; but,\r\nwithal, a winsome lass, so fresh and fair, so pretty. Such a father!\r\nSuch a girl! In heaven's name how do such things come about?\r\n\r\nSatisfied with his investigations, Mr. Creecy now remarked, quite\r\ncheerfully:\r\n\r\n\"I s'pose, sir, you air a drover?\"\r\n\r\n\"A drover? No, sir; as far as I am able to judge, I am not. More, I\r\ncannot say, as I do not know what you mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Den I reckin, sir, you air er furiner inter the bargin.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; not a foreigner either, though I was educated abroad--partly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dat's it,\" ejaculated the old man, triumphantly. \"Eddicashun is the\r\nthing what plays the Ole Harry wid the onderstan'in'. Dar is my little\r\nMell, dar, when she war er chit of er gal, an' knowed nuthin' 'bout\r\nthe things writ down in books, she war er mighty smart gal. She had a\r\nonderstan'in' of plain English, mity near es good es mine, an' she\r\ncould keep house, an' make butter, an' look arter farm bizniss in\r\ngin'ral, not ter say nuthin' 'bout sowin' her own cloes; an' now,\r\nbless God! arter gittin' er fine eddicashun, she don't know the\r\ndiffrance 'tween er hoss an' er mule, or er bull an' er heifer; an'\r\nshe'd no mo' let yer ketch 'er wid er broom in her han', or er common\r\nword on her lips dan steal er chickin! Es fur es my experance goes,\r\nnuthin' spiles er gal like high schoolin'. I purt myself ter a heap er\r\ntrouble, young man, ter edicate my only darter, but I'd purt myself\r\nter er long site mo', ter onedicate 'er, ef I know'd how!\"\r\n\r\nThis speech amused Mr. Devonhough to such an extent that he\r\nreluctantly displayed a set of very white teeth, and Mell's rather\r\nstrained gayety found an agreeable echo in his pleasant-sounding\r\nlaughter. Even the old farmer's features relaxed. He was \"consid'ble\r\nhefted up\" at the undisguised effect of his own facetiousness.\r\n\r\n\"The reason I axed ef yer wuz er cattle dealer,\" he proceeded, \"is\r\ndis. You 'pears ter be in the habit er comin' hur every mornin' ter\r\nsee our fine Jersey. She's er regular beauty, ain't she?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is--worth coming to see; but since you press the point, I feel\r\ncalled upon to disavow coming here for any such purpose.\"\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Devonhough turned his contemplative glance from the direction\r\nof Suke's charms, and fixed it mischievously upon Mell who, having\r\nalready, since the beginning of this interview, looked into the four\r\nquarters of the globe, now dropped her eyes in search of the mysteries\r\nbeneath it.\r\n\r\n\"To be honest wid ye,\" admitted old Creecy, \"I didn't 'low ye wuz\r\narter Suke, ezzactly, but I sorter reckin'd ef yer'd come ter see\r\nMell, it's the front do' yer'd er knockt at, es I ust ter do when I\r\nwent er courtin' my gal--Mell's mammy--an' had it out comferterble in\r\nthe parler. We has er very nice home up dar on the hill, with er whole\r\nlot er fine furnisher in the front room, which Mell never rested 'till\r\nI went in debt ter buy. Now its mos' paid fur, an' I kinder 'low Mell\r\n'ud be glad ter see yer mos' enny time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" responded Mr. Devonhough, with frigidity.\r\n\r\n\"He mought go now, Mell, ef yer'd ax him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to-day, thank you,\" turning to Mell, with more graciousness of\r\nmanner. \"In fact, I have not yet breakfasted;\" and he abruptly bowed\r\nadieu, and made his escape.\r\n\r\nHe was quite out of sight before father or daughter addressed a word\r\nto each other. At length the old farmer demanded roughly of the girl\r\n\"What in the tarnation she wuz er blubberin' erbout?\"\r\n\r\n\"What, indeed!\" sobbed Mell, in a frenzy of passion, and with eyes of\r\nstorm. \"I have good cause to cry. What else can I do? I can't say\r\n_Damn!_\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't yer? Why not? 'Tain't the cuss what's so bad; it's the feelin'.\r\nEf the devil's in yer, turn him out, I say. I ain't no advercate er\r\nbad language, but ef er man feels like cussin' all the time, he mought\r\nas well cuss! Dat's my opinion. An' ef it will help yer to cool down\r\ner bit, my darter, I'll express them sentiments, which ain't too bad\r\nfor a young lady ter feel, but only to utter. So here goes--but\r\nremember, Lord! 'tain't me, it's Mell--damn! damn! damn! Sich er\r\nkoncited, stiff-starched, buckram-backed, puppified popinjay, as this\r\nMr. Devil--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush your mouth,\" screamed the daughter, beside herself with rage; \"I\r\ndon't want _him_ damned!\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't! Then who?\"\r\n\r\nMell, wrought up to the highest pitch of exasperation, made no reply\r\nbeyond looking daggers and gnashing her teeth.\r\n\r\n\"Not your old dad, Mell?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, father; I don't want you damned either. But what did you come\r\ndown here for? What did you call him a cattle dealer for? What did you\r\ntalk about such horrid, nasty, disgusting things, for? Oh! I am\r\nmortified almost to death.\"\r\n\r\n\"I sorter reckon'd yer'd hate it worser'n pisen,\" chuckled the old\r\nfarmer; \"but er good dose of pisen is jess what some folks needs bad.\r\nCome, come, Mell, hold your horses! It's your eddicashun what's er\r\nbotherin' of yer!\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish to God I had no education!\" exclaimed Mell, passionately.\r\n\"It's turned out to be the worst thing I ever did do, to get an\r\neducation! It has made me unhappy ever since I came home and found\r\nthings so different from what they ought to be. How poor and mean a\r\nhome it is! How lowly its surroundings, how rude its ways and how I am\r\ndegraded and fettered and hampered and looked down upon for things\r\nbeyond my control!\"\r\n\r\n\"I knows--I knows\"--answered her old father, with that suspicious\r\nthrill-in-the-voice of a subjugated parent. \"It's yo' ignerront ole\r\ndaddy an' yo' hard-workin' ole mammy what's er hamperin' ye! We ain't\r\ngot no loving little Mell, no longer, to say, Popsy and Mamsy, so\r\ncute, but only er fine young miss, who minces out 'father' and\r\n'mother' so gran', an' can't hardly abide us, the mammy what bare her,\r\nand the daddy what give her bein'. I knows. Ef it warnt fer us, ye'd\r\nbe the ekill of the finess' lady in the lan', wouldn't ye, Mell? Wall,\r\nye kin be, my darter, in spite o' us, ef you play yo' kerds rite.\r\nYou'se got es big er forshun es Miss Rutlan'--bigger, I believe.\r\nHern's in her pockit, yourn's in yo' phiz. But, arter all, a gal's\r\npurty face don't 'mount ter mor'n one row er pins, ef she ain't got no\r\nbrains to hope it erlong. Play yo' purty face, Mell; play her heavy,\r\nbut back her strong wid gumshun! Then you'll git ter be er gran' lady\r\no' fashion, in spite o' yer ugly ole dad an' common ole mammy. Now, I\r\nwants ye ter tell me somethin' 'bout dat young jackanapes. What's his\r\nbizniss? What is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"A perfect gentleman!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sartingly--sartingly. I seed dat, as soon es I sot my eyes on 'im,\r\nbut what sorter man? My ole dad ust ter say, 'one fust-rate man could\r\nknock inter blue blazes er whole cart load er gentlemin'. I'll tell\r\nyer fer er fack, er gentlemin ain't nothin' nohow, but er man wid his\r\ndirty spots whitewasht. But what air the import er this one's\r\nintentions respectin' of ye?\"\r\n\r\nWhatever her ideas on this point, the girl was too modest to express\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"Wall, maybe you kin tell me the dispersition of your own min'\r\nregardin' him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I can do that,\" she replied with alacrity. \"Make up your mind to\r\nit. I'm going marry him just as soon as he asks me. And the sooner the\r\nbetter!\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly! But when is he gwine ter?\"\r\n\r\n\"How do I know, father?\"\r\n\r\n\"I kin tell ye, Mell. _Never!_\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't know one thing about it--not a thing!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sartingly not! It's the young uns these days what knows everything,\r\nan' the ole ones what dont know nuthin'. But yo' ole dad knows what\r\nhe's talkin' 'bout. The likes o' him will never marry any gal who puts\r\nherself on footin' wid er cow. Does yer reckin Miss Rutlan' would\r\nexcep' his visits in er cornfiel', and let him make so free?\"\r\n\r\n\"It only happened so, father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hump! It's happen'd so er good many times, es I happen ter know.\r\nHappenin' things don't come roun' so reg'ler, Mell. See hur, my gal,\r\n'tain't no use argufyin' wid me on the subjec'. I ain't got nary\r\nobjecshun ergin yo' marryin' the young man; provided--now listen,\r\nMell!--_provided you kin git him_. He's es purty es er grayhoun', an'\r\nI reckin has es much intellergence, but insted ef lettin' him make a\r\nfool er you, es he's now tryin' ter do, turn the tables, Mell. The\r\nbiggest fool on top o' this airth is the woman who wants ter git\r\nmarried; the next biggest fool is the man in er hurry ter git er wife!\r\nOne mo' word, Mell, an' I'll go my way, an' you kin go yourn. Ain't\r\ngwine ter mortify you no mo'. Remember, what I say: thar's only one\r\nthing you dassent do wid er fine gentlemin--_trus' him!_ Don't trus'\r\nhim, Mell; don't trus' him! My chile, the good Lord ain't denied ye\r\nbrains, use 'em! Here ends the chapter on Devilho--\"\r\n\r\nTurning off abruptly, Mr. Creecy puffed sturdily up the hill, leaving\r\nhis daughter deep in the sulks, but with much solid food for\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\nHer eyes followed him sullenly. He was but one remove from--a darkey.\r\nNever had he appeared so irredeemably ugly, awkward and illiterate;\r\nnever acted so altogether and exasperatingly vulgar, horrid and\r\nabominable, and yet she pondered deeply on his words. Their effect\r\nupon her surprised even herself. Can an unschooled man be wise? Ah,\r\nMell! wisdom is not curbed by rhetoric, nor ruled by grammar. The\r\n_respicere finem_ of the unlettered appears oftentimes to be _jure\r\ndivino_.\r\n\r\nAfter a while Mell wiped away the very last tear of agonized pride,\r\nwhich hung like a dewdrop on her long curling lashes. The gall and\r\nwormwood of her present feelings were somewhat abated. She knew what\r\nshe was going to do.\r\n\r\n\"I'll get out of this!\" exclaimed Mell, speaking to herself in\r\nparticular, and into space at large. \"Get out of it, the very first\r\nchance.\"\r\n\r\nGet out of what, Mell? This humdrum life of little cares and big\r\ntrials? this uncongenial association with an overworked and sickly old\r\nmother (once as pretty as yourself, Mell) and an ill-favored,\r\nill-mannered and illiterate old father?\r\n\r\nIs that what Mell intends to get out of?\r\n\r\nYes, and she means to do it in the easiest possible way, according\r\nto her own conception of the matter. Other girls may find it\r\nnecessary to work their way, by a long and tedious process, out of\r\ndisagreeable surroundings, but she will do it with one brilliant\r\nmaster-stroke--_coûte qu'il coûte_.\r\n\r\nPut a placard on pretty Mell; proclaim her in the market place; hawk\r\nthe news upon the street corners; inscribe it on the pages of the\r\ngreat Book up yonder!\r\n\r\nTo unite her destinies with some being--not divinely, blessing and\r\nbeing blessed--not vitally, loving and being loved; not necessarily a\r\nbeing affectionately responsive and, therefore, fitted to become the\r\nsharer of her joy and the assuager of her grief, but simply some being\r\nof masculine endowment serving in the capacity of a latch-key, through\r\nwhose instrumentality she can gain admission into the higher worldly\r\ncourts, for whose untasted delights her whole nature panted, is\r\nhenceforth, until accomplished, the end and aim of Mellville Creecy's\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nHo, there! all ye buyers, come this way!\r\n\r\nHere's a woman for sale!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nA MOTE IN THE EYE.\r\n\r\nIn Pompeii, eighteen hundred years ago, people--a good many people,\r\nwere dreadfully afraid of dogs; so much so that many of the\r\nhouseholders in that famous old city put _Cave Canem_ on their\r\nfront-door-sills, as a friendly piece of advice to all comers-in and\r\ngoers-out. Just how their feelings were affected towards the domestic\r\ncow, we are left to conjecture; but now, after eighteen hundred years,\r\nand in less famous localities, people--a good many people--are still\r\nafraid of dogs, and without a nice sense of discernment in their\r\nfears, include cows, putting the two together as beasts that want\r\n\"discourse of reason.\"\r\n\r\nNow, this is unrighteous judgment; for even a cow should be looked at\r\nfairly, even if she does show the cloven hoof. There are cows and\r\ncows, as well as men and men. Suke, the young Jersey, would not toss\r\nher horns at a butterfly, much less hurt a baby. She was sagacity\r\nitself, and granting she did not know the buttered side of bread,\r\nwhich is likely, she did know, to a moral certainty, where she got her\r\ngrass and how.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morn, Suke began to low, and hoping to be heard by\r\nvirtue of insistence, kept it up until nightfall, by which time she\r\nhad bellowed herself hoarse. Suke could make nothing out of it, and no\r\ndoubt dropped to sleep, theorizing on the perversity of remote\r\ncontingencies, and wondering why it was that she had spent all the\r\nlong hours of that breezy summer day in the lot, and the companion of\r\nher outings in the house.\r\n\r\nThe late afternoon found Mell in dainty attire, seated on the front\r\nporch, gazing wistfully in the direction of the Bigge House. He had\r\nnot found her in the meadow in the morning, perhaps, he would seek for\r\nher in the little house on the hill, in the evening. It could not be\r\nthat he had avoided paying her any attention that could be noticed by\r\nothers; she had sometimes thought so, but then it could not be. She\r\ndismissed the idea; it was too uncomplimentary to herself, and too\r\ndefamatory towards him.\r\n\r\nBut the slow hours dragged on; he came not. Mell sat alone. At ten\r\no'clock she crept sadly into bed--into bed, but not into the profound\r\nslumber of youth and a mind at ease. Far into the night, her unquiet\r\nthoughts were yet heaving to and fro; advancing as restless billows of\r\nthe sea, retreating as vaporous cloud-mists in the sky. Her snow-white\r\nbed--a feathered nest--erst so well suited to light-hearted repose,\r\nhad changed its flexible lines of comfort into rigid lines of care.\r\n\r\nDropping to sleep at last, Mell dreamed she had made the world all\r\nover, from pole to pole, after a new model and on a modern plan, and\r\nhaving fitted it up expressly for her own needs, found it ever so much\r\npleasanter, and a great improvement on the old.\r\n\r\nIt was upon the same old world, however, she opened her eyes the next\r\nmorning, and into one of its most worrying days, holding, indeed, more\r\nthan its share of disappointment and worry.\r\n\r\nBut when the third day was drawing to its weary close, and her\r\nlonging heart longed still unsatisfied, existence had become a burden\r\nalmost insupportable to poor Mell. For the third time she donned her\r\nprettiest dress. He _must_ come to-day. Out again upon the little\r\nporch, with a book in her hand, and trying to read, Mell was oppressed\r\nwith a sense of extreme isolation, a wasting famine of the heart, a\r\nparching thirst of the eye. In her despairing loneliness, incapable of\r\nany other occupation, she scanned eagerly every passer by; brooded\r\ndeeply on many passing thoughts. This lonely waiting, in a small waste\r\ncorner of the great wide universe, for a girl of Mell's ambitious turn\r\nof mind, was, in truth, hard. It was lowest pauperism to her panting\r\nspirit--panting to achieve not little things but great. Humble strife\r\nin a little world, amid work-a-day environment, and among everyday\r\npeople, had no charms for Mell. Such living was, in a word,\r\nunbearable.\r\n\r\nAnd over there across that beauteous valley, in the enchanted halls of\r\nthe unattainable, life was a delightful series of interesting events,\r\nredolent of delicate sentiments and sweet-smelling savors, spiced with\r\nnovelty, brimful of pleasure, amusing, absorbing, far-reaching,\r\nall-embracing; in brief, a ceaseless symposium, purged of every ugly,\r\ncommon or narrow element, as roseate and as captivating to the fancy,\r\nas hand-painted satin framed in mosaic.\r\n\r\nA boy walked up the garden path. The young lady seated on the porch,\r\nsaw him coming, and a feeling of exultation shot through all the blood\r\nin her veins. The boy held a note in his hand, and Mell jumped into\r\nthe contents of that note, intellectually, in less than the millionth\r\npart of a second. He could not stand it any longer; he was writing to\r\nknow if he might call, and when. She had a great mind to let him come\r\nthis very evening, though he did not deserve it; but then, do men ever\r\ndeserve just what they get, good and bad, at women's hands?\r\n\r\n\"A note, ma'am,\" said the boy. Mell took it in silence, opened it\r\ntremulously, and read:\r\n\r\n\"Suke is unhappy. Me too. Don't disappoint us to-morrow, and send me a\r\nbit of a line, sweet lassie, to say that you will not. J. P. D.\"\r\n\r\n\"The scribblings of a school-boy,\" muttered Mell, inconceivably\r\ndashed.\r\n\r\n\"No answer,\" she told the boy. When the messenger was beyond reach of\r\nrecall, she was sorry she had not replied to the note, or sent word,\r\nyes; for, perhaps, it would be better to see him once more, have a\r\nplain talk, and come to some understanding. The more she dwelt upon\r\nthe matter, the more certain she became that this was her best course;\r\nso upon the morrow, the half-past five o'clock breakfast was hardly\r\nwell over, when, with alternate hope and fear measuring swords within\r\nher, she fled to the lot for Suke. With one arm thrown affectionately\r\naround the Jersey's neck, the two proceeded most amicably to the\r\nmeadow. There she waited an hour nearly, before Jerome came; but he\r\ndid come, eventually, wearing the loveliest of shooting-jackets, with\r\nan English primrose in his buttonhole, radiantly handsome, deliciously\r\ncool, and as much at his leisure as if it did not make much difference\r\nto him whether he ever reached his destination or not.\r\n\r\nThus Jerome--but what of Mell? Every medullary thread, every\r\ncentripetal and centrifugal filament in her entire body was excited\r\nover his coming. She was flushed, and so hot and flurried, and had\r\nbeen waiting for him, it seemed to her, twelve months at least, and it\r\nenraged her now to see him sauntering so slowly toward her, just as if\r\nthey had parted five minutes ago. Poor Mell, after her experiences of\r\nthe past three days, was in that condition of body when a trifle\r\npresses upon one's nervous forces with all the weight of a mountain.\r\nIrritated, she returned his good morning coldly.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me, Mr. Devonhough! Is it really you? Why did you come? I did\r\nnot send you word I would be here.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you did not. Nevertheless, I knew you would.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, you knew nothing of the sort! How can you say that? I\r\nhad a strong notion not to come.\"\r\n\r\nJerome made a gesture of incredulity.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, a notion! I dare say. Girls live on notions, bonbons, sugar-plums,\r\ntaffy, and what not; a pound of sweetened flattery to every half\r\nounce of wholesome truth. But laying all notions aside, you will always\r\ncome, Mellville, when I send for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"How dare you,\" began Mell, nettled to the quick and purposed to give\r\nhim an emphatic piece of her mind, and then ignominiously breaking\r\ndown, constrained, dismayed, crimsoning to the tips of her ears,\r\npaling to the curves of her lips, and wishing she had died before she\r\nleft the farm-house that morning.\r\n\r\n\"And now I have offended you,\" said Jerome drawing nearer, \"and I did\r\nnot mean to do that, pretty one! I cannot help teasing you, sometimes,\r\nbecause when you are teased your face has that innocent, grieved\r\nexpression of a thwarted child, which I do so dearly love to see. And\r\nI must, perforce, do something in self-defence, you have been so cruel\r\nto me.\" His tones were low, now, and as oily as a lubricating\r\nlife-buoy. \"I have waited for you one hour each day; I have gone away\r\nafter every waiting, desolate and unhappy. Don't you know, when two\r\npeople think of each other as we do, when two people love each other\r\nas we do, that separation is the worst form of misery? Then why have\r\nyou been so cruel, Mell?\"\r\n\r\nPeeping under the fluted archway of the white sun-bonnet for an\r\nanswer, his face came in dangerous nearness to its wearer; their\r\nquickened breath united in a symphony of sweet sighs, their quickened\r\npulses throbbed in a unison of reciprocal emotion.\r\n\r\nOne moment more, and--Mell stood off at some little distance, looking\r\nback roguishly at the figure kneeling alone beside the old stump, with\r\noutstretched arms tenderly embracing naught, and stealthy lips\r\ndefrauded of their prey.\r\n\r\nMr. Devonhough did mind a losing game such as this. To be made to feel\r\nfoolish and to look foolish, was more than he could tolerate under any\r\nconjuncture of circumstances. He extricated himself as speedily and as\r\ngracefully as possible.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Creecy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Devonhough!\"\r\n\r\n\"You will probably treat me with ordinary civility, at the time of our\r\nnext meeting.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you will probably do the same toward me.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall see, as to that.\"\r\n\r\nHe bowed blandly, and turned upon his heel. He was going away? Well,\r\nhe wouldn't go far. Mell was so confident on this point, that she\r\nseated herself comfortably on the old stump again, and gave herself no\r\nuneasiness. She could not credit the evidences of her own senses when\r\nthe moving figure became first a mere speck upon the horizon, and then\r\na something gone, lost, swallowed up into the unseen.\r\n\r\n\"It passes belief,\" said Mell; \"surely he will come back, even yet!\"\r\n\r\nShe waited one hour longer; she waited two--he evidently did not\r\nintend to come back.\r\n\r\nShe went home with a troubled heart.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, feeling somewhat more cheerful at what she\r\nconsidered the certain prospect of seeing him again, and to a somewhat\r\nbetter purpose, she called for Suke, in feverishly high spirits, and\r\nthe two set off together on a spirited race down the hill.\r\n\r\nOne hour--two hours--three hours--and not a sign of her truant lover.\r\n\r\nMell burst into an agony of tears.\r\n\r\n\"I am no match for him,\" she sobbed. \"He is heartless and cynical, and\r\nimperious and selfish. He does not care in the very least bit for me\r\nand I\"--springing to her feet, and dashing away her tears--\"I do not\r\nknow, at this moment, Jerome Devonhough, whether I most love or hate\r\nyou!\"\r\n\r\nThis feeling of sullen resentment sustained her through that long,\r\nlong day. In the cool of the evening her mother sent her on an errand\r\nto the little country store, about a mile distant. Coming back she\r\nencountered a gay cavalcade of ladies and gentlemen on horseback,\r\nconspicuous among them, Jerome. She had no reason to suppose he\r\nrecognized, or even saw, the quiet figure plodding along on foot, and\r\ncatching the dust from their horses' hoofs.\r\n\r\n\"This is my life,\" said Mell, looking after them with yellow eyes,\r\n\"while others ride, I walk!\"\r\n\r\nThe noise of their clattering feet and merry voices had scarcely died\r\naway, when there came another sound; faint at first and uncertain, it\r\ncame nearer and nearer. A solitary horseman dashed up to her side and\r\ndismounted.\r\n\r\n\"Jerome! Is it you?\" exclaimed Mell, with a glad start, forgetting all\r\nthe anger she had been nursing against him since yesterday, in the joy\r\nof seeing him again. \"How could you tear yourself away from that\r\nlively crowd?\"\r\n\r\n\"One, if she is the right one, is crowd enough for me,\" declared\r\nJerome, with a laugh; and throwing his bridle reins negligently across\r\nhis arm, he walked along beside her. \"When I saw you, Mellville, I\r\ndropped my whip out of pure delight, and as it is a dainty trifle\r\nbelonging to Clara--Miss Rutland, that is--adorned with a silver\r\nstag's head and tender associations, I had, of course, to come back\r\nfor it. At all events, I could not have closed my eyes this night,\r\nwithout seeing you, making my humble confessions, and imploring your\r\nforgiveness for my conduct of yesterday. I behaved abominably. I\r\nconfess it. I am truly sorry. And, at the risk of falling in your\r\nesteem, I am going to tell you something--my temper is a thing\r\nvile--villainous, but it does not often get the better of me as it did\r\nyesterday. Forgive me, dearest?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not your dearest,\" Mell informed him, with head erect.\r\n\r\n\"Not? Why, how's that? 'Nay, by Saint Jamy,' but you are! I have one\r\nheart, but one, it is all yours; you have one, but one, it is all\r\nmine. We are to each other, dearest, _Ita lex scripta_.\"\r\n\r\n\"The matter is one in which I, myself, shall have a say-so.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have had a say-so! You have said: 'Jerome, I love you!'\"\r\n\r\n\"How can you speak so falsely? It is not true--I did not say so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in words,\" conceded her tormentor, \"but you do, all the same,\r\ndon't you, petite?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not your petite, either,\" protested Mell, driven almost to\r\ndesperation.\r\n\r\n\"No? Then you are sure to be my darling. That's it, Mell! You are\r\ncertainly a darling, and mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not!\" shrieked Mell, choking with anger. This mockery of a sore\r\nsubject was really unbearable.\r\n\r\n\"Not my darling, either?\" inquired Jerome, grave as a Mussulman. \"Then\r\nwhat the dickens are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"A woman not to be trifled with,\" said Mell, hotly; \"who finds it much\r\neasier to magnify injuries than to forgive them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like the rest of us,\" interposed Jerome; \"but that is not Christian,\r\nyou know.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are enough to turn the saintliest Christian into a cast-away,\"\r\nproceeded Mell, severely. \"Can't you be serious for a little\r\nwhile? I am not a child to be mocked at and cajoled and cozened and\r\nhood-winked, _faire pattes de velours_, treated to flim-flam and\r\nsweet-meats, knowing all the while that you are ashamed of my mere\r\nacquaintance.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't think such a thing!\"\r\n\r\n\"I do think it! I have cause to think it! See here, suppose you were\r\nin love with Miss Rutland--\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't suppose that! I couldn't be if my life depended on it; not\r\nafter seeing you. Why do you wish me to suppose that?\"\r\n\r\nHe shot a keen glance at her.\r\n\r\n\"That I may ask you this question--If you were, would you make love to\r\nher after the same methods you employ toward me?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I don't believe I would. I am quite sure I would not. The woman\r\nis herself responsible for the way in which love is made to her. I\r\ncan't be with you any time without wanting to call you some pet name,\r\nand I never feel that way with Clara.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is my fault, then, that you are so disrespectful?\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I disrespectful?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are. Listen to me for a moment, Mr. Devonhough. If you really\r\ncare for my society, as you say you do, why do you not seek it as you\r\ndo the society of other young ladies--at home? My father is a poor\r\nman, but he is honest; and honesty should count for something, even in\r\ngood society. He is also illiterate, but no one can say aught against\r\nhis character; and character ought to be more desirable than much\r\nlearning. Then, again, although the blood in my veins may lack in\r\nblueness, it is pure, which is a matter of some importance.\r\nAltogether, I don't see why you should look down upon me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not look down upon you!\" Jerome was earnest enough now. \"I\r\nknow that I ought to have called at the house, but--ahem! my time is\r\nnot exactly at my own disposal. In a word, I have not had an\r\nopportunity.\"\r\n\r\nJerome, saying this, looked far away in pensive thoughtfulness. Mell,\r\nlistening, looked hard into his face.\r\n\r\n\"Opportunity!\" ejaculated Mell. \"You manage somehow to call upon me\r\npretty often elsewhere!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at a visitable hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were I a man and wanted to see a girl, I'd _make_ my opportunity!\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed, derisively--there is something very undiverting in such a\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\"Would you, Mell? No, you would not. You would do like the rest of\r\nmankind; submit as best you could to the inflexible logic of events\r\nand do the best you could under the circumstances.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is a cornfield the best you can do under the circumstances?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is Mell--the very best. Now, my sweet Mell, I am going to be\r\nserious--really serious--dreadfully in earnest. I acknowledge that you\r\nhave some cause to find fault with me. There are things 'disjoint and\r\nout of frame' in my wooing, which I cannot explain to you at this\r\ntime. Bear with them, bear with me for a little--there's a dear\r\ngirl--and when I come back--\"\r\n\r\n\"You are going away! Where, Jerome? When?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only a run over to Cragmore, for a week or ten days. I have friends\r\nthere, who are writing for me. Another guest is coming to the Bigge\r\nHouse, and I rather think we shall be in each other's way, Mell.\"\r\n\r\nShe leant upon his words as if they planned\r\n\r\n                 \"Eternities of separate sweetness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mell, will your regard for me bear a heavy test? I cannot now speak\r\nsuch words to you as my feelings prompt me to speak, but will you not\r\ntrust me blindly until certain difficulties which surround me are\r\novercome? Is your affection great enough for that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know,\" faltered Mell; \"I would trust you to the world's end,\r\nand to the very crack of doom, if you would only tell me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then it would not be trust,\" Jerome gently reminded her, with his\r\nmysterious smile. Catching his glance of penetrating tenderness, a\r\nvivid breathing reality from a misty background of fogs and doubt,\r\nunder the spell of its enchantment, Mell thought she could. Her face\r\nsoftened.\r\n\r\n\"It will be hard, Jerome, but I will try.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, believe me, all will yet be well with us. Whatever untoward\r\nevent may occur, whatever else you may have cause to doubt, never\r\nquestion the sincerity of my attachment. I call upon God, who readeth\r\nthe heart of man, to witness that you, only, are dear to me--you,\r\nonly, precious in my sight. Believe that; be patient, and trust me.\"\r\n\r\nThe deep silence which followed these words was broken only by their\r\nslow moving feet, crushing the crisp leaves beneath them, and the wild\r\npalpitations of the girl's heart. Crystal stars made haste to lend\r\ntheir liquid glimmering to the scene, and blinked knowingly at each\r\nother from azure heights on high. The sweet south wind, in melting\r\nmood, murmured tunefully above their heads, swelling in delicious\r\ndiapason of melodious suggestions, and mingling with mysterious\r\nelements in stirring pulse and thrilling nerves.\r\n\r\nThe rasp of a discordant tone, thrust vehemently into this sweet\r\nblending of concordant harmonies, disturbed upon a sudden Mell's\r\nunwonted peace of soul. She heard her father's voice. He was saying:\r\n\"Don't truss him, Mell; don't truss him.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I be patient,\" she asked, with a touch of her old petulance,\r\n\"unless I know why it is you treat me so? Jerome, tell me your\r\ndifficulties.\"\r\n\r\n\"And by so doing increase them? No. My hands are full enough as it is,\r\nand to have you incessantly fretting and fuming about little crooked\r\nthings which all the fretting in creation won't straighten out, would\r\nbe more than I could stand. Melville, you must really consent to be\r\nguided blindly by my judgment in this matter. I have studied the\r\nsubject carefully, and it is only for a little while, sweet. We are\r\nyoung, we can afford to take things easy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Men of pluck,\" exclaimed Mell, with spirit, \"don't take things easy!\r\nThey grip hold of things and turn them into moulds of purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do they, little wiseacre? Then, manifestly, I am not a man of pluck.\r\nI am made of weak stuff, a feeble straw, perhaps, in your estimation,\r\ntossed about by every little puff of air! Ha! ha! ha! How little you\r\nknow about me, Mell!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" responded Mell, promptly, adding, with that lively\r\nturn of expression which gave such zest to her conversation, \"very\r\nlittle, and that little nothing to your credit!\"\r\n\r\nJerome was amused. He laughed and stopped, and forthwith laughed\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Melville, you charm me afresh at every meeting. Where do you get\r\nall your _sauce piquant_? Beside you for life, that old meddling\r\nbusy-body, _ennui_, will never get a single chance at a fellow. Your\r\nname ought to be Infinite Variety.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yours,\" retorted Mell, with the quickness he enjoyed, \"Palpably\r\nObscure! But here we are at my own gate. Fasten your horse and come\r\nin.\"\r\n\r\nHer voice was absolutely pleading.\r\n\r\n\"I would with ever so much pleasure, but--that whip is yet to be\r\nfound, and the riders will be coming back. I must at once rejoin them.\r\nGood night, Mell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-night,\" responded Mell, from the other side of the gate, and in\r\nangered tones, \"Jerome, have I not spoken plainly enough to you? Must\r\nI repeat that I am not your toy--not your plaything--but a resolute\r\nwoman, determined to maintain my own respect and to accept nothing\r\nless than yours? You shall not so much as make free with the tip end\r\nof this little finger of mine, until--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Jerome, \"let me know the worst. When will that terrible\r\ninterdict be removed?\"\r\n\r\n\"When you can enforce the right by virtue of possession.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaven speed that moment!\" exclaimed he, sighing audibly and mounting\r\nhis horse. \"When shall we meet again, Melville?\"\r\n\r\n\"That rests with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me see, then. Not to-morrow, for at daylight we are off to Gale\r\nBluff for the day. Not on Wednesday, for there's a confounded picnic\r\nafoot for that day. I wish the man who invented picnics had been\r\nendowed with immortal life on earth and made to go to every blessed\r\none of 'em! But on Thursday, Mell, I shall be in the meadow at the\r\nusual hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I won't!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you will, Mell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Positively, _I will not!_\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense. What is your objection? Where is the harm? The young ladies\r\nat the Bigge House entertain me out of doors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do they?\"\r\n\r\nMell was astonished, and began to waver.\r\n\r\n\"I thought it wasn't considered the thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, it is _the_ one thing warranted by the best usage.\r\nOut-of-doors is now in the fashion. Doctors preach it, preachers\r\nexpound it, legislators enact it, and the whole people make it a\r\ndecree _plebiscite_. Clara sits with me for hours under the trees--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, does she!\" interrupted poor Mell, with a pang. Seeing her way to\r\na question she had long been wanting to ask, she subjoined quickly:\r\n\"And what do you think of Clara Rutland, Jerome? Do you call her an\r\ninteresting girl?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never have called her that,\" replied Jerome, \"never that I know\r\nof, but--she'll do. One thing, she can talk a fellow stone blind at\r\none sitting. But that's nothing. Starlings and ravens can talk, too.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of this speech, Mell was doubly anxious to know Jerome's\r\nreal opinion of Clara Rutland. It seemed to her that the question was\r\nmore open at both ends than it ever had been before.\r\n\r\nJerome patted his horse's head, told him to \"Be quiet, sir!\" and\r\nresumed the threads of discourse.\r\n\r\n\"What was I saying? Oh, yes! We live out of doors at the Bigge House.\r\nThere wouldn't be any use for a house there at all, if it wasn't for\r\nbad weather. Those girls try their best to be agreeable, but none of\r\nthem are _provoquante_ and charming, like you, Mell. While they sleep\r\naway the sweetest hours of these golden summer mornings, what harm is\r\nthere in you and I enjoying pleasant converse together in the green\r\nfields, inhaling the pure air of heaven? I promise you to be on my\r\nbest behavior. I promise you to uphold the integrity of the tip end of\r\nthat little finger inviolate; and so you will be on hand without fail,\r\nMell, and so will I, and so will something else.\"\r\n\r\n\"What else, Jerome?\"\r\n\r\nHe bent low from his saddle-bow to whisper into her ear:\r\n\r\n\"That supreme happiness which is present everywhere when you and I are\r\ntogether. Be sure to come, darling. And now, once more, good-night!\"\r\n\r\nHe galloped off, leaving Mell standing in the gateway, and on the\r\nuncomfortable side of a very knotty point. Did Jerome really love her?\r\nShe believed he did--ardently. Did he love her well enough to surmount\r\nthose difficulties of which he had spoken? Did he love her well enough\r\nto marry her?\r\n\r\n\"Aye, there's the rub!\" cried Mell. Her mind fairly swarmed with ugly\r\nsuspicions, some of them as infinitesimal, and at the same time as\r\ndangerous as those microscopic bacteria which enter the physical\r\nlaboratory, disorganizing, and, if not quickly eliminated, destroying\r\nthe very stronghold of life itself. And as biological analysis was not\r\nyet, at that time, practiced as a method of research into the germs of\r\nthings, Mell must needs fall back entirely upon inferential\r\ndeductions.\r\n\r\nThose difficulties, what could they be that she might not know them?\r\nIf this tantalizing, and yet, withal, most fascinating, of created\r\nbeings, truly loved her--loved her in love's highest sense, and with\r\nno thought of deception, would he at every turn put her off with\r\nhoneyed words and paltry evasions? Would he have said, \"You must\r\nreally consent to be guided blindly by my judgment in this matter,\" if\r\nhe valued her as she valued him?\r\n\r\nOf one thing she was sure; she would be guided blindly by no human\r\nbeing, man or woman, in anything.\r\n\r\n\"_No, I won't!_\" she audibly informed the dew-damp lilies and\r\nthe secretive rose, stamping her foot to impress it upon their\r\nunderstanding. Catch any wide-awake, thoroughly independent,\r\naltogether self-sufficient and splendidly educated American girl\r\ngoing it blind at any man's behest! She would make short work of\r\nhis courtship, and him too--first.\r\n\r\nStill pacing distractedly up and down the garden path, Mell heard a\r\nwindow open, saw a head protrude, and heard a voice, which said:\r\n\r\n\"Send 'im ter his namesake, Mell. Let 'im git thar before he gits the\r\nbetter o' you!\"\r\n\r\n\"So he shall, father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then go ter bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going now--going to bed,\" she continued, communing with\r\nherself--\"to bed, but not to the meadow Thursday morning. I'll cut my\r\nthroat from ear to ear, just before I start to the meadow again at the\r\nbidding of Jerome Devonhough!\"\r\n\r\nBravo for Mell! Strong in this determination, she is now comparatively\r\nsafe, except for the one menacing fear, that this sentimental feeling\r\nshe has for Jerome may interfere with the more serious business of\r\nlife. Love was all well enough in its way, but what this country\r\nmaiden panted for, was a new life on a higher plane, with or without\r\nlove. It was the thing her education demanded. It was the thing she\r\nintended to accomplish.\r\n\r\nAfter all, she went to bed in very good spirits. She was tolerably\r\nsure of bringing Jerome to her own terms, and if not--well, not to\r\nmake a sad subject likewise tedious, Mell, in spite of all her love\r\nfor Jerome, was as much for sale as ever.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nA TOTAL ECLIPSE.\r\n\r\nNothing ever turns out just as we expect.\r\n\r\nThe next day promised to be long to Mell, but before the old tall\r\nclock in the corner tolled out the hour of ten, something happened\r\nwhich gave to its every moment a pair of golden wings. Miss Josey\r\nMartlett, one of those ancient angels who personate youth, who\r\nendeavor to assimilate facial statistics and unfledged manners, who\r\nare interested in everything under the sun except their own business,\r\ncame driving up to old man Creecy's farm. Under this lady's auspices\r\nit had been, and through her material assistance, that the sprightly\r\nlittle country girl had been mercifully snatched out of regions of\r\nignorance and darkness, and maintained for a number of years at a\r\nfamous boarding-school, where, among other things, she had been taught\r\nto worship the beautiful in all its forms, to cultivate the refined in\r\nall its processes, and to execrate the common and the ugly in all its\r\nmanifestations. A defective curriculum--for what is more common than\r\nhuman frailty; what uglier than, oftentimes, duty?\r\n\r\nLet us hasten to concede that old man Creecy has some show of reason\r\non his side. Not all education educates. The best may furnish us with\r\nfeet and hands, eyes and wings, trained members, fit implements,\r\nshields, anchorage, strongholds, and stepping-stones; but also\r\nhiding-places, weak spots, loopholes, clogs, and stumbling-blocks.\r\n\r\n\"I would stay, but I can't,\" protested Miss Josey, as Mell insisted\r\nupon her taking off her hat and sitting down in the most comfortable\r\nrocker in the house, while she herself sat beside her and toyed with\r\nthe visitor's hand, and fanned away the heat; and then ran for a glass\r\nof fresh buttermilk, and brought in some red peaches and blue grapes\r\non an outlandish little Jap waiter in all colors, \"just too 'cute for\r\nanything.\" Miss Josey was Mell's only connecting link with the country\r\n\"quality,\" and hence appreciated in due proportion to her importance.\r\n\r\n\"I declare, Mell, you spoil me to death,\" simpered Miss Josey, \"and\r\nnothing else in life is half so nice as being spoiled to death. But I\r\nmust eat and run--must, really--I'm just so busy I hardly know which\r\nway to turn. I want you to go to a picnic with me to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"A picnic!\"\r\n\r\nMell's heart got into her throat at one single bound, and stuck there.\r\nJerome had said something about a picnic.\r\n\r\n\"What picnic, Miss Josey?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Grange picnic. I'm one of the lady managers, as perhaps you know,\r\nand I want you to help me with the tables. Mrs. Rutland cannot go, and\r\nthere are so few to be depended on.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can depend on me,\" said Mell; \"I will go with you gladly--gladly\r\nspend and be spent for you, who have been always so kind to me.\"\r\n\r\nHadn't she, though? But this was the crowning act of all Miss Josey's\r\nkindness. At this picnic she would see Jerome, and, who knows, perhaps\r\nfind out his difficulties!\r\n\r\n\"You are a sweet girl, Mell,\" returned Miss Josey, gratified. \"So\r\ngrateful, in a world chock full of the basest ingratitude. I told Miss\r\nRutland, 'Mell Creecy is the girl to take your place. She knows what\r\nto do, and she'll do it!'\"\r\n\r\nAfter this, Mell could scarcely follow the drift of her visitor's\r\nconversation. She was in a ferment of impatience for Miss Josey to be\r\ngone, that she might put the finishing touches to a new white dress in\r\nreadiness for to-morrow's festivities. But Miss Josey, who couldn't\r\npossibly stay two short minutes when she arrived, did not get off\r\nunder two mortal hours, or more. This is one of those little\r\npeculiarities of the sex, which the last one of them disavows.\r\n\r\nGone at last, Mell went dancing over the house and singing over her\r\nwork at such a lively rate, that her father put his head in at the\r\nchamber-door wanting to know \"what she was er makin' sich er fuss\r\nerbout?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Grange picnic, father, tra-la-la! I'm going with Miss Josey,\r\nfolderolloll!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oho! Devilho gwine ter be thar, I s'pose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed! Hail, all hail! La-la-tra-la!\"\r\n\r\n\"Make him toe the mark, darter!\"\r\n\r\nMell's song abruptly ceased.\r\n\r\nTo make an individual of Mr. Jerome Devonhough's subtle intellect and\r\nmasterful will toe the mark was going to be no easy matter. He was far\r\nfrom being an exact science whose formula could be reduced to the\r\ntouchstone of certainty. Softer were his ways, and more complex his\r\nweb, the fabric of his purpose more difficult to trace, than the\r\nintricate meshes of this cob-webbery lace she was basting in the neck\r\nof her dress. Nevertheless, every stitch of her needle fastened down\r\nher gathering intentions to the figure of her mind. Jerome must have\r\ndone with these evasions; he must tell her the truth, and the whole\r\ntruth; he must henceforth act right up to the notch, or else she would\r\nput an end to everything between them, and in the future have nothing\r\nwhatever to do with him. Several measures such as these, rightly\r\nenforced, would, she believed, bring the most slippery Lothario in\r\nexistence down on his knees at a woman's feet, _If_ the man really\r\nloved the woman. _If_ Jerome really loved Mell.\r\n\r\n\"If, _Si, Wenn, Se!_\" vociferated Mell, stamping her fiery little\r\nfoot. \"Why was it ever put into articulate speech?\"\r\n\r\nShe knew it, this highly educated girl, in so many languages, and\r\ncould not blot it out in a single one of them! Is not mere human\r\nknowledge a kind of blunt tool?\r\n\r\nBut she was ready, bright and early, the next morning, so promptly\r\nready that Miss Josey commended her in unstinted terms.\r\n\r\n\"Had it been Clara,\" said Miss Josey, as Mell sprang lightly into the\r\nlittle basket phaeton, \"she'd have kept me waiting, probably, a whole\r\nhour without a scruple of compunction! Come, we will go to the Bigge\r\nHouse first for some things I must carry.\"\r\n\r\nTo the Bigge House? The gates of Paradise were about to open for\r\nMell. Rejoice with her, all ye who read. How will you feel when\r\nthe doors of your big house are about to unclose themselves before\r\nyour long-aspiring and wistful gaze, disclosing within the risen\r\nStar of Conquest, the bright realization of many golden visions and\r\nmany rose-colored dreams?\r\n\r\nThis Bigge House, of so much local fame and importance, was, in fact,\r\na spacious mansion of no small pretention, and having been originally\r\nbuilt for a man named Bigge, in spite of all that the present owners\r\ncould do in the way of writing and calling it Rutland Manse, it\r\nremained, year after year, the Bigge House. Pleasantly situated,\r\nwell-constructed, and well-kept, the house itself was surrounded by\r\nextensive and beautiful grounds, a grove, a grass plot, a flower\r\ngarden embellished with trellises, terraces, fountains, rare\r\nshrubbery, and an artificial pond to row pretty little boats on, and\r\nsecondly, to propagate fish. The family were of an old stock, but a\r\nnewly rich--a class who like much to enjoy their money, and better\r\nstill, to show it.\r\n\r\nOn this cloudless summer morn, perfect as weather goes, so perfect\r\nthat one might look upon it as a Providential complicity in the\r\nbooming of the Grange picnic, a gracious provision of nature to suit\r\none special occasion, the approaches to the Bigge House presented a\r\nstirring scene. Carriages, buggies, and wagons, vehicles of every\r\ndescription, and vehicles nondescript, lined the roadways in every\r\ndirection. Servants were rushing hither and thither, fresh arrivals\r\ncoming every few moments to swell the throng, voices calling to each\r\nother in joyous recognition, fair hands waving _au revoirs_, as they\r\ndashed by, without stopping, on their way to the scene of the day's\r\nfestivities. A pleasurable sense of expectation brightened every face,\r\na buoyant sense of exhilaration quickened every heart, and high above\r\nthe heads of all, a brilliant sun, regnant on a field of blue, lighted\r\nup the long sloping hills and broad green valleys. Mell looked about\r\nher wonderingly. Who were all these people, and how many of them would\r\nshe know before the day was done?\r\n\r\nMiss Josey had left her holding the reins while she ran in for a cargo\r\nof bundles. It was not at all necessary, except in Miss Josey's\r\nimagination. Her well-groomed little nag was alive, it is true, but\r\nsome live things creep, and Aristophanes--called Top,--was one of\r\nthem. He never thought of starting anywhere as long as he could stand\r\nstill. In this respect, he differed from his mistress, who never\r\nstayed anywhere, as long as she could find enough news to keep going.\r\n\r\n\"Hold him tight, Mell,\" had been Miss Josey's injunction when she left\r\nMell alone with Top.\r\n\r\nAt another time this arrangement would have greatly disappointed Mell.\r\nHer whole being had clamored to get inside the Bigge House, and,\r\nbehold! here she sat along with Top outside the sacred precincts. But,\r\nsomehow, her heart beat so high with rainbow-tinted fancies, she was\r\naltogether unconscious of anything amiss in the situation. If not\r\nwithin the very courts of the wonderful palace, the very penetralia of\r\nthe Penates, she was very near the goal; nearer than she had ever been\r\nbefore. She could almost look in--she could almost see the shining\r\ngarments and gloriously bright faces of the beings she envied, the\r\nbeings who lived that life so far above her own. She had come thus\r\nfar; she waited at the gate, and some day the great doors would be\r\nflung wide open for her; she would cross the threshold. But not alone.\r\nOne would bear her company who was ever an honored guest there, and\r\nin many another home of wealth and fashion and influence.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts transferred their suppressed rapture into the\r\nexpression of her face--into cheeks dazzling for joy--into eyes\r\nswimming in lustre--into a mouth wreathed into curves of exquisite\r\ntransport. She was beautiful.\r\n\r\nA number of young gallants came crowding about the gate. They stood in\r\nthe plentitude of checked tweeds and light flannel, with the latest\r\nsheen on a boot, and the latest paragon of a hat--mighty swells,\r\nconscious of their own superiority, eying this deuced pretty girl, and\r\nwondering who she was.\r\n\r\n\"You ought to know, Rube,\" said one.\r\n\r\n\"But, I don't!\" said Rube. \"I will know before I'm much older though,\r\nyou can depend upon me for that! She's with Miss Josey.\"\r\n\r\nMell did not notice them beyond a casual glance. They had about them,\r\nincontestably, an enormous lot of style, but compared to Jerome, they\r\nwere flat,--awfully flat. She caught a glimpse of him now, this\r\nswellest swell of the period, coming down the marble steps of the\r\nmansion.\r\n\r\nSome one is with him--a lady. Yes, just as she thought, Clara Rutland.\r\nHere they come. She, so--so--almost ugly, and he, so--so--so\r\nJerome-like. That's the only way to express it. Jerome is more than\r\nsimply handsome, more than merely graceful, more than a man among\r\nmen--he's a non-such, in a nut-shell!\r\n\r\nBut here he is, almost in speaking distance, and every step\r\nbringing him nearer. Isn't he going to be surprised? Isn't he going\r\nto be delighted? Isn't he going to shake her hand and smile that\r\nimpenetrable smile, and--?\r\n\r\nHow is this? Jerome has come and gone. He did not look at her--he did\r\nnot once raise his eyes in passing.\r\n\r\nJust ahead of this poky little vehicle, where Mell awaited the return\r\nof Miss Josey, stood a lordly equipage, all silver plate and shine,\r\nwith a well-dressed groom standing in front of the champing, restive,\r\nmettlesome animal, as eager to be off and gone somewhere as the most\r\nrestless of human hearts in a human bosom.\r\n\r\nInto this nobby turnout Jerome assisted Miss Rutland, and then\r\nspringing in himself, grasped the reins from the groom's hands. For\r\none awful moment (to Mell) the horse stood straight upon his hind\r\nlegs, and then, obeying Jerome's voice, who said in the quietest of\r\ntones, 'Go on, Rhesus,' gave one wild plunge and dashed ahead, leaving\r\nMell with a stifled feeling, as if she was buried alive under twenty\r\nfeet of volcanic ashes.\r\n\r\nBut what did it mean--his passing her without a sign of recognition?\r\nJerome might be of a truant disposition, of unstable fancy, and\r\nsuperior in his own strength to most ordinary rules, but he couldn't\r\nhelp knowing her face to face. There was a bare possibility that he\r\nhad not really seen her; his sight, come to think of it, was none of\r\nthe best, or, at least, he habitually wore an interesting little\r\n_pince-nez_ dangling from his button-hole, and sometimes, though not\r\noften, stuck it across the bridge of his well-shaped nose with telling\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nWith such arguments, and much wanting to be convinced, Mell recovered\r\nher equipoise to some extent, managing to hear about half Miss Josey\r\nwas saying, and to answer only once or twice very wildly at random.\r\nArrived at their destination, she assisted her patroness in\r\nreceiving and arranging the baskets; this important contingent of\r\nthe day's proceedings being satisfactorily disposed of, they\r\nfollowed the example of the crowd at large and strolled about in\r\nsearch of some amusement. A more delightful location for a day's\r\nouting it would be hard to find, the world over. On three sides of\r\nthe principal grove, stretched an immense plateau, smooth as a\r\nflower-garden, and level as a plumb line, and on the fourth side a\r\nsudden, bold declivity, just as if a giant hand had pulled the\r\nclustering hills apart and left them wide asunder, laying bare the\r\nheart of a magnificent ravine. In this wild gorge were stupendous\r\ncliffs and brinks, shady shelves o'erhanging secluded and romantic\r\nnooks, enormous rocks holding plentiful treasures in moss and\r\nlichen, singularly constructed mounds, probably the remaining\r\ndeposit of a prehistoric race, wild flowers in variety, wild scenery\r\nin perfection, and a beautiful stream of running water, wherein\r\ndisported finny tribes in abundance. Nothing in the highest art of\r\ngardenesque could produce such results as this. A mere ramble amid\r\nsuch scenes of diverse picturesqueness--nature's wear and tear in\r\nmoods of passion--amounts to a study of geological architecture under\r\nfavoring conditions.\r\n\r\nMell loved nature, but not as she loved Jerome. Her brains were\r\ncrammed with wild speculations in regard to him, which accounts for\r\nthe fact that she had no mind on that eventful day to invest in all\r\nthose wonderful manifestations of nature's power and nature's\r\nmystery.\r\n\r\nDuring their circuitous meanderings, two young men joined Miss Josey\r\nand were duly presented to her _protégé_. They were fine young\r\nfellows, and very pleasant, too, but Mell continued so preoccupied in\r\nthe vain racking of her brain, trying to imagine what had become of\r\nJerome and Clara Rutland, that she did not catch their names, and\r\nreplied to their efforts at conversation with monosyllabic remarks.\r\nOne of them, a merry-tempered, straightforward, stalwart young chap,\r\narmed with rod and bait, asked her, with a flattering degree of\r\nwarmth, if she wouldn't go with them a-fishing; but reflecting if she\r\ndid so, she would in all likelihood be out of the way of seeing Jerome\r\nfor hours to come, Mell declined without circumlocution, glad to get\r\nrid of him on the pretext of having promised to assist Miss Josey in\r\nher onerous duties, as commissary of subsistence. Discouraged, the\r\nyoung fisherman bowed and left.\r\n\r\n\"Such a pretty girl,\" he remarked to his companion. \"It's a pity she\r\ndoesn't know what to say!\"\r\n\r\nThink of Mell Creecy not knowing what to say! The girl who was always\r\nsaying things nobody else had ever thought of saying. Such is the\r\npretty pass to which an unhappy love may bring the brightest girl!\r\nAnd, after all, she saw absolutely nothing of Jerome until all those\r\nwagon upon wagon loads of baskets had been ransacked, and their\r\ntempting contents emptied out upon the festive board, giving forth\r\ngrateful suggestions of the coming mid-day meal.\r\n\r\nWhile squeezing lemons, flushed and more than ever anxious, deft of\r\nhand, but uneasy in mind, the buggy containing Jerome and Miss Rutland\r\ndashed into the grove.\r\n\r\n\"We've been all the way to Pudney,\" called out the young lady, holding\r\nup to view some tied-up boxes, \"and here are the prizes.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" responded Miss Josey, \"but do let us have the ice. The\r\nprizes are of no consequence to a famishing people, but the dinner is,\r\nand we are about ready.\"\r\n\r\n\"She's powerfully interested in the prizes,\" commented a girl at\r\nMell's elbow, \"but she has a good right to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" inquired Mell.\r\n\r\n\"Because she is going to be crowned queen of love and beauty.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've put things together, and that's the way they sum up to me. That\r\nyoung man with her can beat all of our boys, and he's going to crown\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he?\" ejaculated Mell.\r\n\r\nLet him dare to do it! Before Jerome Devonhough should place a\r\nvictor's crown on Clara Rutland's head, she would--well, what would\r\nshe do? \"_Anything!_\" muttered Mell, between her teeth.\r\n\r\nPoor Mell! She had been to such an expensive school and learned so\r\nmany things, and not one of them was of the slightest use to her in\r\nthis sore strait. Could there not be established a new school for\r\ngirls, differing materially from the old; founded upon a more\r\nadaptable basis, taught after a hitherto unknown method, and including\r\nprominently in its curriculum of studies, that branch of knowledge\r\nwhose acquisition enables a woman to bear long, to suffer in silence,\r\nand in weakness to be strong? These are the practical issues in a\r\nwoman's daily life, and although in such a school she might not get\r\nher money's worth in German gutturals and French verbs, she would, at\r\nleast, have indulged in a less reckless expenditure of time in\r\nobtaining useless knowledge.\r\n\r\nBut let us not blame the schools over much, and without a just\r\ndiscrimination. Not all the fault lies at their door. Something there\r\nis amiss among the girls themselves. It may be, that they love and\r\nhate, and talk too much, even in one language.\r\n\r\nIn a girl of Mell's temperament, love would not have been love,\r\nlacking jealousy, and its twin-feeling, revenge. More's the pity,\r\nMell!\r\n\r\nThat picnic dinner was splendid. Everybody enjoyed it but Mell, and it\r\nwas not the young fisherman's fault that she did not. Although he was\r\nin attendance upon another young lady, who seemed to know what to say,\r\nand said it incessantly, he kept an eye on Mell, and proffered her\r\nevery tempting dish he could lay his hands upon. To no purpose; for\r\nMell could not eat. She tried, and the very first mouthful paralyzed\r\nher ability to swallow. It was altogether as much as she could do to\r\nkeep from sobbing aloud in the faces of all these omnivorous, happy\r\npeople. What made it all the worse, at breakfast time she had been\r\nhappier than they--too happy, in fact, to eat, and now, here at\r\ndinner, she was too miserable.\r\n\r\nAnd there sat the author of all her misery, not twelve feet distant,\r\nperfectly oblivious to her proximity, nay, her very existence. Not by\r\nany chance did he ever look toward her, or show any consciousness of\r\nher presence. So devoted and so marked were his attentions to that\r\nuninteresting and anything but attractive Clara Rutland, that Mell\r\nheard it commented upon on all sides. These two, so sufficient unto\r\nthemselves, were among the first to leave the festal board and wander\r\noff in sylvan haunts. Anon, all appetites were satisfied, and amid the\r\nbuzzing of tongues and boisterous flashes of merriment, the multitude\r\nagain dispersed. Unobserved and in a very unenviable frame of mind,\r\nthe unhappy Mell stole away to herself. The paramount desire of her\r\nwounded spirit was to get beyond the ken of human eye. In a hidden\r\nrecess screened by an overhanging rock, she sat down, the prey of such\r\ndiscordant and chaotic thoughts as wear away, in time, the bulwarks of\r\nreason. It was yesterday, no, the day before, no, longer, that he had\r\ncalled upon God to witness that she alone was dear to him, she only\r\nprecious in his sight, and now, how stands the case? Ah, dear God, you\r\nheard him say it! Oh, All-seeing Eye, you have looked upon him this\r\nday, and will not a lightning blast from an indignant Heaven palsy the\r\nfalse tongue, whose words have no more meaning than loose rubble!\r\n\r\nInto the heaviness of these thoughts, growing heavier with access of\r\nbitterness as the moments sped, there came the ringing tones of a\r\nvoice--a voice well known to Mell.\r\n\r\nShaking off her lethargy and looking out from her hiding place, she\r\nbeheld the object of all these harrowing reflections, grasping Miss\r\nRutland's two hands in his own, as they together, and laughingly,\r\ndescended a precipitous declivity. Once down, they proceeded with\r\naccess of laughter, to push their way through a tangle of brushwood.\r\nTo get out of this into the beaten path, they must necessarily advance\r\nin the direction of her place of concealment, and, devoured with\r\njealousy, inflamed with distrust, tortured with the cruel madness of\r\nlove, Mell determined to satisfy herself on the spot, as to whether\r\nJerome's avoidance was premeditated or unintentional. Just as the\r\ncouple emerged from their nether difficulties, and stood on clear\r\nground and firm footing, Mell suddenly stepped forth upon the same\r\npath, confronting them face to face. Miss Rutland did not speak. Mell\r\nknew she would not, although they had attended the same boarding\r\nschool for years, lived in the same house, and graduated in the same\r\nclass, where Miss Rutland, unlike herself, achieved no distinction of\r\nself-merit; being content to be accounted distinguished through the\r\nsepulchre of a dead father.\r\n\r\nMell did not expect recognition from her in such a place at such a\r\ntime; for the neighboring rocks were alive with the best families in\r\nthe county, and Clara was one of those feeble brained persons, who\r\nhave minds suited to all purposes, save use and knowledge of that kind\r\nwhich may be put on and off as a movable garment. Such creatures,\r\ntossed about helplessly on the billows of circumstance, keep one\r\nfinger on the public pulse, and know you, or know you not, according\r\nto its beat. For all this, Mell cared nothing in that supreme moment.\r\nOne swift glance at Clara, and after that every faculty of her mind\r\nand body was centered on Jerome. He was evidently surprised at being\r\nnearly run over by this blustering and blowsy young lady, but beyond\r\nthat--nothing. He looked her full in the face, the unknowing look of a\r\ntotal stranger. The result of this look was to Mell calamitous. A\r\nwaving blankness came before her sight, her knees trembled, her\r\nstrength seemed poured out like water, and staggering to a tree, she\r\ncaught hold of it for support.\r\n\r\n\"Cut--cut, dead!\"\r\n\r\nThis, after all that had passed between them, was simply brutal. But\r\nthe despised and slighted country girl was only momentarily stunned,\r\nnot crushed. Out of the throes of her wounded pride and injured\r\naffection, there burst forth the devouring flames of a fiery and\r\npassionate nature, incapable of any luke-warmness in emotion. Her eyes\r\ndilated, her fingers twitched, her face set like a flint, her lip\r\ncurled in scorn, and she shook her clenched fist at Jerome's\r\nretreating figure.\r\n\r\n\"Contemptible coward! Miserable trickster! What have I ever done, that\r\nyou should refuse to speak to me in the presence of Clara Rutland?\"\r\n\r\nHer bosom heaved; she sobbed aloud, and shook her fist again.\r\n\r\n\"I'll make you sorry for this! I'll get even with you, yet!\" Words,\r\nwhose fierce earnestness embodied a prophesy, and were followed by a\r\nprayer:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, God, only give me the power to make him feel it, and I ask no\r\nmore! I care not what then befalls me!\"\r\n\r\nThis paroxysm of passion swept over her as a besom of destruction,\r\nleaving her quenched as tow, white, unnerved, quite pitiful and hushed.\r\nShe sank to the ground and into a state of semi-unconsciousness.\r\n\r\nSome one coming near, some one lifting her into a sitting posture,\r\nsome one pouring cold water upon her head, and holding something to\r\nher nose aroused her.\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" said the young fisherman, \"open your eyes--open them\r\nwide! It's nobody but me. I wouldn't tell another soul, for I know you\r\nwouldn't want the mischief of a fuss made over it. But how did you\r\ncome to pitch over?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not come to pitch over,\" said Mell, bewildered, \"did I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you did! I had been looking for you for ever so long, and\r\nstanding on top there, I happened to look down, and saw you lying\r\nhere. And you never will know how scared I was, for, at first, I\r\nthought you were dead. Gad, didn't I make tracks, though, after I got\r\nstarted! But, drink a little more of this, and now, don't you feel set\r\nup again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Considerably so,\" said Mell, trying, too, to look set up. He was so\r\nkind, and she, poor, bruised thing, so grateful. This little word,\r\nkind, so often upon the lip--upon yours and mine, and the lips of our\r\nfriends, as we encounter them socially on our pilgrimage day by day,\r\nis only at certain epochs in our own lives fully understood, and\r\ndeservedly cherished deep down in the heart. And yet, so few of us can\r\nbe great, and so many of us could be kind if we would, and oftener\r\nthan we are.\r\n\r\n\"I know just why you toppled,\" proceeded Mell's kind rescuer.\r\n\r\n\"But I didn't topple!\" again protested Mell.\r\n\r\n\"Did you fall down on purpose?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I did not fall at all, as far as I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly! those are the worst kind--the falls you can't tell anything\r\nabout.\"\r\n\r\nSo they are. Her's had not been far in space--she remembered it all\r\nnow, with an acute pang--but, oh, so far in spirit!\r\n\r\n\"You could walk now a little, couldn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I could,\" said Mell.\r\n\r\nShe got upon her feet with his assistance.\r\n\r\n\"You are shaky, yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"A little shaky,\" Mell admitted.\r\n\r\n\"Then take my arm.\"\r\n\r\nShe took it, as a wise being takes the inevitable all through life,\r\nsubmissively, and without saying much about it.\r\n\r\nThey walked slowly, and the young follower of dear old Ike watched his\r\ncompanion's every step, with a solicitude bordering on the fatherly.\r\n\r\n\"What do you suppose I am going to do with you, now?\"\r\n\r\nShe could not imagine.\r\n\r\n\"Give you something to eat--not that only, make you eat it! I gave you\r\nenough at dinner time, if you had only eaten it, but you left all my\r\ngoody-goodies untasted.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you unthanked,\" added Mell, with a ghost of her old smile, and a\r\n_soupçon_ of her old sprightliness.\r\n\r\n\"No matter about that! Only, I was worried that you could not eat, and\r\nI know the reason why.\"\r\n\r\nDid he? Did he know it? The girl at his side dreaded to hear his next\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Josey had been working you to death all the morning. I saw you\r\nhow you stayed around and looked after everything, while Miss Josey\r\nsat on one side with her hands folded. She's good at that! She never\r\ndoes anything herself but reap all the glory of other people's\r\nsuccesses. The very worst of these picnics is, that a few do all of\r\nthe work, and the many all the enjoying. Now, you--_you_ haven't had\r\nmuch of a time, have you?\"\r\n\r\nShe had not, but no girl in her right mind is going to confess, out\r\nand out, that she hasn't had a good time, even in the Inferno.\r\n\r\n\"Rather slow, perhaps,\" answered Mell, putting it as mildly on a\r\nstrained case, as the case would bear, \"but there's nobody to blame\r\nfor it, but myself. If I wasn't such a fool in some respects, I might\r\nhave had a--a perfectly gorgeous time. _You_ would have given me all\r\nthe good time a girl need to look for.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you wouldn't let me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see,\" explained Mell, warming with her subject, \"I had\r\npromised Miss Josey--\"\r\n\r\n\"Never promise her anything again!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I will! But, as I was saying, I promised her to come\r\nand take Miss Rutland's place--to come for that very purpose, and when\r\nI make a promise, however hard, I'm going to keep it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravo for you! Not every girl does that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Every high-principled girl does.\" Her tones were severely\r\nuncompromising.\r\n\r\n\"_Ought to_, you mean,\" rejoined her companion, with an incredulous\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\"No--_does!_\"\r\n\r\nLight words, lightly spoken, lightly gone! Alas! How these bubbles of\r\ntalk, subtle as air, come back home after a time, to twit us with\r\nscorn, to taunt us with falsity, to impute wrong unto us, to arraign,\r\nto accuse, to denounce, to condemn out of our own lips.\r\n\r\n\"Here we are,\" said Mell's companion, still laughing at the idea of a\r\nyoung woman thinking it necessary to hold tight to her word. \"Here we\r\nare. Now sit right down here and rest your head comfortably against\r\nthis tree. I'll be back in a twinkling.\"\r\n\r\nSo he was, with a plate in his hand filled with edibles, and a bottle\r\nof sparkling wine.\r\n\r\n\"Eat,\" commanded this eminently practical young man; \"eat and drink.\r\nThat's all you need now to fetch you round completely.\"\r\n\r\nThis settled the question, and settled it most judiciously and\r\nsatisfactorily. The solid food proved a balm of comfort to that\r\ndesolate goneness within her, which Mell had wrongly ascribed as due\r\nentirely to the volcanic derangement of her heart; and the strong wine\r\nsped through her veins a draught of health, a cordial to the mind, a\r\nrosy elixir of life.\r\n\r\nMell began to take some interest in her companion and her present\r\nsurroundings. She recognized in them a certain claim to her\r\nconsideration, and a certain charm. This young stranger was a\r\ngentleman in looks and bearing; he had some manliness in his nature,\r\nnevertheless, (Mell felt down on gentlemen) and a heart as brimming\r\nfull of charity as St. Vincent de Paul, himself. He was not ashamed\r\namong all his fine friends, to speak to a simple country girl, who,\r\ndestitute of fortune, had nothing to commend her but innate modesty\r\nand God-given beauty. So far from being ashamed, he was ministering to\r\nher wants as no one had ever ministered to them before--as kindly and\r\ncourteously as if she were in every respect his equal in social\r\nstanding. Jerome would not speak to her, and this gentleman, in her\r\nweakness, held the cup to her lips, and put the food into her mouth\r\nwith his own hands.\r\n\r\n\"I'll pray for him this very night,\" thought Mell, and moistened the\r\nthought with a grateful tear.\r\n\r\nBut, long before the edibles were consumed, every vestige of a tear\r\nhad disappeared from Mell's eyes, and she was talking back to this\r\npattern of a gentleman, as few girls of her age knew so well how to\r\ndo. The blood rushed back to her pallid cheeks, witchery to her\r\ntongue, magic to her glance.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be offended,\" she remarked to him, with enchanting candor,\r\nafter they had become the best of friends; \"but I did not hear your\r\nname this morning, and I have not the slightest idea who you are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you the slightest desire to know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed I have! You can't imagine--the very greatest desire!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let me refresh your memory somewhat. Do you recall a pug-nosed,\r\nfreckle-faced, bull-headed youngster, who used to pommel Jim Green\r\ninto blue jelly, every time he wanted to lift you over the swollen\r\ncreek or carry your school-bag, or--\"\r\n\r\n\"I do; I remember him well. But you--you are not Rube Rutland?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I wish you'd tell me who I am! I've been thinking I was Rube\r\nRutland for a good many years now--for I am older than I look.\"\r\n\r\n\"And to think I did not know you!\" exclaimed Mell.\r\n\r\n\"And to think I did not know _you!_\" exclaimed Rube. \"That's what gets\r\nme! I was asking everybody and in all directions who that stunning\r\ngirl was, with--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" inquired Mell, laughing, \"with _what?_ I'd like to know what\r\nis stunning about me.\"\r\n\r\n\"With the sweetest face I ever looked into.\"\r\n\r\nThis reply caused Mell's eyes, intently fixed upon the speaker, to\r\ndrop with rare grace to meet the maiden's blush upon her cheek. A\r\nperfectly natural action, it was for that reason and others, a very\r\neffective one.\r\n\r\n\"When I found out who you were,\" pursued Rube, studying the face he\r\nhad praised, seeing it glorified by his praises, \"I fairly froze to\r\nMiss Josey, wanting so much to renew our acquaintance, and when you\r\nhad no word of welcome for an old friend, and gave me the cold\r\nshoulder with such a vengeance, I was cut all to pieces over it. Fact!\r\nI couldn't enjoy fishing, and I feel bad yet!\"\r\n\r\n\"You might have known I did not recognize you,\" said Mell, lifting her\r\neyes. \"I cannot tell you how glad I am, Mr. Rutland.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Mr. Rutland!_ It used to Rube.\"\r\n\r\n\"And shall be Rube again, if you so desire! Rube, I am just delighted\r\nthat you've come back home!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nEVEN.\r\n\r\nSo far, she had dallied innocently enough with her old playfellow;\r\nneither seeking to please nor deceive, spreading no nets of\r\nenchantment, nicely baited, to entrap the fancy of this agreeable\r\nyoung man (rich too), who was as frank in nature and as transparent in\r\npurpose, as physically muscular and daring.\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock, Miss Josey came to sound the horn for the races, and\r\nthe crowd came surging back. Old and young, big and little, the cream\r\nof the county and its yeomanry, a congregation of the mass, a\r\nsegregation of the cliques, mounting high into the hundreds. The order\r\nof the Grange was then at the zenith of its fame and power.\r\n\r\nThe crowd, as we have said, came surging back. The best of the fun was\r\nyet to come. Mell roused herself and looked about her. Here were other\r\ngirls with sweet faces, and many of them, as she was aware, possessed\r\nof those heavier charms of worldly substance which oftentimes outweigh\r\nthe sweetest of faces. None of them must lure him from her. He should\r\nstick to her, now, come what would. The careless beauty, the ingenuous\r\nand undesigning woman, is immediately transformed into a greedy\r\nmonopolist, a wily fox, a cunning serpent, a contriving, intriguing,\r\nmanoeuvring strategist, bent upon mischief, who will play a deep game\r\nand stoop to the tricks of the trade, and shift, and dodge, and\r\nshuffle, and aim to bring down, by fair means or foul, the noble\r\nquarry.\r\n\r\nEye, lip, tongue, mind, heart, soul, the graces of youth, the\r\nallurements of beauty, the treasures of a cultivated mind, and all\r\nthose sweet mysteries of sense which float in the atmosphere between a\r\nyoung man and the maiden of his fancy, were put in motion to bear upon\r\nRube's case.\r\n\r\nHe did not move; no wonder; gorged on sweets, Rube had neither power\r\nnor inclination to be gone.\r\n\r\nAfter a little, a group of young men stationed themselves at a given\r\npoint, not far from where this couple sat. They had been into an\r\nadjacent farm-house and changed their clothes, and now appeared in\r\nknee pants, red stockings, and white jackets, a striking and\r\ninteresting accessory to an already animated and glowing landscape. In\r\nthis group of picturesque figures Jerome was conspicuous. Jerome\r\nlooked well in anything, and generally well to everybody.\r\n\r\nNot so, to-day.\r\n\r\nTo one pair of eyes, not distant, he now loomed up blacker in broad\r\ndaylight than the blackest Mephistopheles in a howling Walpurgis\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nHe saw Rube beside her, and she noted his start of surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Have a care!\" cogitated Mell. \"There may be surprises in store for\r\nyou--greater than this and not so easily brooked.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned her back upon him and gave her whole attention again to\r\nRube. The first duty of a woman is to respect herself, the second duty\r\nof a woman is to enforce the respect of others. Some of these days\r\nJerome Devonhough would be only too glad if she would deign to permit\r\nhim to speak to her.\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you going to take part?\" she asked her companion.\r\n\r\n\"No; I'm not in trim, and it's no use trying to beat Devonhough.\"\r\n\r\n\"_You_ could beat him,\" said she. She spoke with confidence and\r\nseductively.\r\n\r\n\"You are awfully complimentary, I declare! Do you wish me to run,\r\nMelville?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do. Yes, Rube, I wish it particularly. Why should this stranger\r\ncarry off the palm over our own boys?\"\r\n\r\n\"For the best of reasons. He deserves to carry it off. Devonhough can\r\nout-run, out-leap, out-ride, out-do anything in the county.\"\r\n\r\n\"Except _you_,\" again insinuated Mell.\r\n\r\n\"Say! what makes you believe so strong in me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing makes me, but--I cannot help it!\"\r\n\r\nAt this point, dear reader, if you are a man, and happily neither\r\nblind, nor deaf, nor over eighty years of age, take Rube's seat for a\r\nmoment, at Mell's feet. Let her tell you in the sweetest tones, that\r\nshe cannot help believing in you strong--let her bend upon you a\r\nglance sweeter than the tones, stronger than the words, and then say,\r\nhonestly, don't you feel, as Rube did at this juncture, mighty queer?\r\n\r\nUnder the spell, her victim stirred--he lifted himself slowly toward\r\nher, inquiring in a low voice, but with intense energy:\r\n\r\n\"Melville, are you fooling me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fooling you!\" she ejaculated, in soft reproach. \"Would I fool you,\r\nRube? Is that your opinion of _me_? You think, then--but tell me,\r\nRube, why do you think so?--that those early days are less dear to me\r\nthan to you--their memory less sweet?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have thought so,\" murmured he in great agitation, \"because I have\r\nnot dared to think otherwise--_until now_.\"\r\n\r\nAnd into his great soul there entered, then and there, the ineffable\r\nbeatitude of the true believer.\r\n\r\nOh, wicked, wicked Mell! One little hour ago, and you had forgotten\r\nhis very existence! Is the Recording Angel, who stands above your head\r\nup there, off duty, that you should dare to do it? Or, will it help\r\nyour case in the day of reckoning, that deception foul as this, has\r\nbeen raised by clever women into the dignity of a fine art, and goes\r\non among them all the while, as inexpugnable as an Act of Congress?\r\n\r\n\"Melville, I will run this race--run it to please you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew you would! And believe me, Rube, nothing could please me\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose I should win,\" said Rube, \"what then?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will be the hero of the day, and--\" Mell halted very prettily,\r\nbut finally brought it out in sweet confusion, \"and maybe _I_ would\r\nwear a crown.\"\r\n\r\n\"By my troth, you shall! But what of me? I take no stock in crowns\r\nlike that. If I should win, Mell, may I name my own reward?\"\r\n\r\n\"You may.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be a big one.\"\r\n\r\n\"The man who runs and wins generally gets a big one.\"\r\n\r\n\"But understand my meaning, Mell, understand it perfectly. I do not\r\nwant the shadow of a doubt to rest upon this matter. Who shall decide\r\nwhen lovers disagree?\"\r\n\r\nHe had been toying with a twig broken from a flowering bay; it was\r\nstripped of foliage, save a few green leaves at the end, and with this\r\nhe lightly touched the dimpled hand reposing upon her lap.\r\n\r\n\"_That_ is what I would ask. Will you give it to me, Mell, if I win\r\nthe race?\"\r\n\r\nMell trembled violently, but she said \"yes.\"\r\n\r\nThat was natural enough. When a woman says yes, it is time to tremble.\r\nEven Rube knew that.\r\n\r\n\"You mean it? It is a solemn promise! One of those promises you always\r\nkeep!\"\r\n\r\nAgain Mell trembled violently--worse than before, and again said\r\n\"yes.\"\r\n\r\nThat barely audible yes, had scarcely died upon her white lips when\r\nRube sprang to his feet, and casting off his fawn colored flannel\r\njacket and light waist-coat, tossed them in a careless heap upon the\r\nground at her feet. Divested of those outer garments, the symmetrical\r\ncurves of his young manhood, and the irregular curves of his honest\r\nface showed up to great advantage in white linen and a necktie--the\r\nlatter a very _chic_ article of its kind, consisting of blazoned\r\nmonstrosities of art, in bright vermillion on a background of\r\nwhite--blood on snow.\r\n\r\n\"You must excuse my shirt-sleeves,\" said Rube, during the process of\r\ndisrobing. \"I have no costume, so must do the best I can under the\r\ncircumstances.\"\r\n\r\nHe next made off with his suspenders, and began tugging at his shirt\r\nin an alarming fashion.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do?\" interrogated Mell, with a horrified\r\nexpression. \"You are not going to--\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Rube, laughing, and coloring too. \"I'm not going to take it\r\noff. I'm only going to--\" tugging all the while--\"make myself into a\r\nsailor boy, or flowing Turk, or a loose Brave, or a something or\r\nother, to keep pace with those brocaded Templars, Hospitallers, and\r\nKnights of the Golden Fleece over there. Come, now, can't you fix a\r\nfellow up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fix a fellow up?\" echoed Mell, helplessly. She never had 'fixed a\r\nfellow up,' and she knew less about it than the sacred writings of\r\nZoroaster.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Rube. \"Give me those ribbons you've got on--fix me up, put\r\nyour colors on me, don't you see?\"\r\n\r\nMell did see at last, and greatly relieved, proceeded to do his\r\nbidding. The sash from her own supple waist was deftly transferred to\r\nhis, and a knot of ribbons at her throat, after many trials, was\r\nfinally disposed of to their mutual liking.\r\n\r\n\"Now, don't I look as well as any of 'em?\" inquired the improvised\r\nknight, quite carried away with the fixing-up process.\r\n\r\n\"As well, and better,\" she assured him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" he held out his hand to her, \"let us seal the compact.\r\nIf I win, Melville----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mell, hurriedly.\r\n\r\n\"But if I fail.\"\r\n\r\n\"You _cannot_ fail, not if you love me!\" She spoke impatiently, and\r\nwith flashing eyes. \"A one-legged man could not, if he loved me! Love\r\nfinds a way, and love which cannot find a way is not love.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough,\" said Rube, below his breath. \"You will know whether I love\r\nyou or not.\"\r\n\r\nTheir hands were still clasped together in bond, until, perceiving\r\nthey had become a subject of curiosity to those about them, Rube at\r\nlength allowed Mell to withdraw hers, whereupon he turned off with a\r\nlight laugh; that proficuous little laugh, which amid life's\r\nthick-coming anxieties, great and small, serves so many turns, and\r\nturns so many ways, and covers up within us so much that is no\r\nlaughing matter.\r\n\r\nRube laughed and mingled with the crowd.\r\n\r\n\"Come out of that!\" shouted an urchin. It was the signal for a regular\r\nbroadside of raillery and chaff from the pestiferous small boy, a\r\nmany-tongued volume out of print, and circulating in open space at the\r\nrate of a thousand editions to the minute.\r\n\r\nNothing abashed, amid groans and jeers, and gibes, and hoots, Rube\r\ntook his place with the others, the only make-shift knight among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"For pity's sake, look at Rube,\" exclaimed Miss Rutland, \"actually in\r\nhis shirt sleeves? Rube, don't! You are not in costume, and you spoil\r\nthe artistic effect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look sharp,\" came Rube's laughing reply, \"or I'll spoil the artistic\r\nresult, also.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't get excited over the prospect,\" commented Jerome, nodding his\r\nhead reassuringly at Miss Rutland, \"there's not the remotest cause for\r\nalarm.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Rutland sat on a tub turned bottom side up, which had served its\r\npurposes in lemonade. Jerome took his ease on a wagon-body, also\r\nturned bottom side up, which had served its purposes as a table. Such\r\nare the phases of a picnic--and one picnic has more phases than all of\r\nJupiter's moons.\r\n\r\n\"The tortoise,\" pursued Jerome, now turning his attention more\r\nparticularly to Rube, \"is a remarkable animal, but like thee, oh\r\nfriend of my soul, 'thou drone, thou snail, thou slug,' not much on a\r\nrun. How much is it I can beat thee, Rube, every time and without\r\ntrying--three lengths?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just you keep quiet,\" retorted Rube. \"The man so sure, let him look\r\nto himself; the man who blows, let him beware! In all our trials at\r\nspeed there never was before anything to win, and I'm a fellow who\r\ncan't run to beat where there's nothing to win.\"\r\n\r\n\"A tremendous issue is involved on the present occasion,\" announced\r\nJerome in withering scorn. \"A lot of paper flowers strung on a piece\r\nof wire to stick on a girl's head, and when it's all over and done, I\r\ndon't know who feels most idiotic or repentant, the girl who wears 'em\r\nor the fellow who won 'em. I've been there! I know. I hope a more\r\nenduring crown than this perishable travesty will fall to my lot!\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I!\" prayed Rube aloud, and with devoutness.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Rutland, Rutland!\" exclaimed his friend, going off into an\r\nuncontrollable fit of laughter. \"There isn't anything in this\r\nwide world half so deliciously transparent as your intentions,\r\nunless--unless,\" subjoined Jerome, as soon as he could again\r\ncommand his voice, \"unless it be Miss Josey's juvenility.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush laughing,\" said Rube, drawing near and speaking low. \"See here,\r\nDevonhough, you don't care the snap of your finger about this affair;\r\nyou've said as much; so hold back, dear old fellow, won't you? Give me\r\na chance!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! ha! ha!\" roared Jerome, again going off. \"'_Dear old fellow._'\r\nThat's rich! Very dear old fellow, never so dear before!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, go along with you,\" responded Rube crossly. \"Go to the devil\r\nuntil you can stop laughing!\"\r\n\r\nHe was about to turn off in high dudgeon, when Jerome with an effort\r\npulled himself together and soberly considered the subject. \"Hold on,\r\nthen! I'd like to oblige you Rutland, of course I would, but there's\r\nClara! She expects me to--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hang Clara!\" said Rube, with the natural unfraternalness of a\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n\"That's what I propose to do,\" answered Jerome. \"Hang her with a\r\nwreath!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't!\" again pleaded Rube. \"Not this time. If you just won't,\r\nI'll--\"\r\n\r\n\"Rub-a-dub-dub!\" beat the drum.\r\n\r\n\"Into place!\" shouted a stentorian voice.\r\n\r\n\"Ready?\"\r\n\r\n\"One--two--Boom!\"\r\n\r\nThey were off in fine style, Jerome quickly showing the lead, and Rube\r\ngaining gradually upon him towards the middle of the course. To one\r\nspectator it was more interesting than the sword-dance, more exciting\r\nthan a steeple-chase. But the eager spectators at the starting place\r\ncould see very little beyond a certain point, owing to the crowd of\r\nboys and men which lined the sides of the track and closed up as the\r\nrunners passed. They could hear vociferous yelling and screaming,\r\nsometimes the outcry, \"Devonhough ahead!\" and then, again, \"Hurrah for\r\nRutland!\" and, at the last, a tremendous whooping and cheering and\r\nclapping of hands, in which no name was at first distinguishable.\r\nThen, amid the unbounded enthusiasm of the multitude, the victor was\r\nlifted above the heads of the crowd and brought back in triumph.\r\n\r\nMell had scarcely moved from the spot where Rube left her. She had\r\nhad some time for reflection, and had profited by it, to such an\r\nextent, that she now felt quite miserable. That was the way with Mell,\r\nand continues to be the way with Mell's kind. They make a practice of\r\nhitching together the cart of Unthought and the sure-footed beast\r\nThink-twice; the cart in front, the horse in the rear; and if, under\r\nsuch circumstances the poor brute, nine times out of ten, lands his\r\nliving freight into very hot water, too hot for their tender feelings,\r\nwho is to blame for it?\r\n\r\nSome very strange thoughts coursed through the girl's mind. Now,\r\nsuppose it was Rube seated up there on the heads of an idolizing\r\npopulace, and it became incumbent upon her to fulfill that promise so\r\nrashly and foolishly given, could she do it? No! No! She would rather\r\nlive a thousand years and scratch an old maid's head every hour in all\r\nthose years, than marry Rube Rutland!\r\n\r\nIt made her sick to think about it; every nerve in her body recoiled;\r\nevery good instinct within her lifted up a dissentient voice.\r\n\r\n\"Can't you see who it is?\" She inquired hoarsely of her nearest\r\nneighbor, a much be-banged girl, who peered above the crowd from the\r\ntop of a dry-goods box, with the cute expression of a fluffy-faced\r\npuppy, \"Can't you see?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not distinctly yet, but I think it is that young stranger, Rube\r\nRutland's friend; I'm pretty sure it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God!\" muttered Mell. She was ambitious, but she was not yet the\r\nhardened thing that ambition makes.\r\n\r\n\"My goodness!\" suddenly exclaimed the girl on the box. \"It isn't that\r\nstrange young man! It is Rube Rutland! I can see him distinctly now.\r\nOh, how glad I am! It is Rube Rutland, boys.\" \"Rutland forever!\"\r\nshouted back the boys.\r\n\r\nIn all that big crowd there was but one heart not glad. Rube was in\r\nthe house of his friends, the other a stranger. County pride, State\r\npride, local prejudice, all sided with Rube. Jerome was an alien. He\r\nhad come there to beat \"our boys,\" and one of our boys had beaten him.\r\nHuzza! Huzza! Shout the victory!\r\n\r\nThey did shout it with a noise whose loudness was enough to bring down\r\nthe roof of heaven. Never had there been such a victory at a Grange\r\npicnic before.\r\n\r\nDeafened by the noise Mell slunk back into the wood. All color forsook\r\nher face once more. She had played for high stakes, this ambitious\r\ngirl; she had won her game, and in the winning cursed her own folly\r\nand realized with a pang of unspeakable bitterness, that a victory for\r\nwhich one pays too dear a price is the worst kind of defeat.\r\n\r\nReleased from the well-meant persecutions of his many admirers, Rube\r\nasked for his coat and things, and a fan, and was next subjected to a\r\nstatement from the master of ceremonies.\r\n\r\n\"With this wreath,\" explained that individual, \"you may crown the lady\r\nof your choice, crown her queen of Love and Beauty, and it will be her\r\nprerogative to award the other prizes won on this occasion. Who is the\r\nfortunate lady?\"\r\n\r\nEvery woman in hearing distance held her breath, every man opened wide\r\nhis ears.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Mellville Creecy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whom did he say?\" queried Miss Josey, tremendously excited and not\r\nquite certain she had heard aright. Miss Josey was nibbling at a\r\npeach; she nibbled no more. Though blessed with an excellent appetite,\r\nMiss Josey in her hungriest moment was more eager to hear something\r\nnew than eat something nice.\r\n\r\n\"Did you say Mell, Rube?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" said Rube.\r\n\r\nIt struck the crowd speechless. What? Rube Rutland, the son of an\r\nex-Governor, an ex-Judge, an ex-Senator, dead now, but dead with all\r\nhis titles on him; Rube Rutland, the greatest catch in the State,\r\ngoing to crown Mellville Creecy, daughter of that old ignoramus who\r\nmade \"fritters\" of the King's English, and dug potatoes, and hoed\r\ncorn, and ploughed in the fields with his own hands? The thing was\r\npreposterous! It was a thing, too, to be resented by his friends and\r\nequals.\r\n\r\nMiss Rutland drew her brother aside.\r\n\r\n\"Rube, you cannot mean it! You surely have some sense! A little, if\r\nnot much! You can't crown that obscure girl with the cream of the\r\ncounty, your own personal friends, all around you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't I?\" said Rube. \"I can and _will!_ The cream of the county may\r\ngo to--anywhere.\" Rube closed up blandly: \"I will not limit them in\r\ntheir choice of locations. That would be not only ungenerous but\r\nungentlemanly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rube,\" persisted Miss Rutland, \"do listen to reason. What will mother\r\nsay? What will everybody say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Say what they darned please!\"\r\n\r\nRube was first of all a freeborn American--secondly, an aristocrat.\r\n\r\n\"What's the use of being somebody if you've got to knuckle down to\r\nwhat people say?\"\r\n\r\n\"But you are not obliged to crown anybody,\" insinuated Clara. \"Rather\r\nthan crown this low-born girl, make some one your proxy. Jerome\r\nwould--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I have no doubt, with pleasure! You are a deep one, Clara, but\r\nyou'll wear no crown this day. Might as well give it up.\"\r\n\r\nSo she perceived, and turned off in a rage, first informing him that\r\nhe always had been, and always would be an unconscionable ass.\r\n\r\n\"You have fully decided, then?\" questioned the master of ceremonies.\r\n\"I have,\" Rube told him, beginning to get put out. Pretty Mell might\r\nwell have been a scare-crow, such consternation had she created\r\namongst them all. \"I decided some time ago. Will it be necessary for\r\nme to mount a tree-top and blow a clarion blast before I can make you\r\nall understand that I am going to crown Mellville Creecy, and nobody\r\nelse?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not, certainly not,\" hastily replied the master of\r\nceremonies. He too was disappointed; he had a sister. Was there ever a\r\nman in power who didn't have a sister?--who didn't have a good many,\r\nall wanting crowns?\r\n\r\n\"Will you make a speech?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nary speech,\" declared Rube, laughing. \"I'm not so swift in my tongue\r\nas my legs! See here, Cap'n, there's no occasion for an unnecessary\r\namount of tomfoolery about this thing. Some gentleman bring Miss\r\nCreecy forward. I'll put this gewgaw on her in a jiffy, and that'll be\r\nthe end of it!\"\r\n\r\nRube smiled softly to himself. That was very far from being the end of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"Mell! Mell!\" screamed Miss Josie, running up to her _protegé_, the\r\nbearer of astonishing news, \"you don't know what's going to happen!\r\nYou'd never guess it! Rube is going to crown you, my pretty darling!\r\nYou are to be queen of Love and Beauty.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, I'd rather not,\" said Mell, drawing back.\r\n\r\n\"Rather not?\" screamed Miss Josey. \"Did anybody ever before hear of a\r\nwoman who would rather not be a queen--a queen in the hearts of men?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see how you can help it,\" continued Miss Josey. Mell did not,\r\neither, alas! \"But I don't wonder you feel a little frightened about\r\nit. It is such a wonderful thing for Rube to do: but Rube has two eyes\r\nin his head, Rube has, and knows the prettiest girl in the county when\r\nhe sees her! This thing is going to be the making of you, Mell (rather\r\nsay the undoing, Miss Josey) so don't be so frightened, but hold your\r\nhead high, and bear your honors bravely, and remember all eyes are\r\nupon you. The rest of the girls are fairly dying with envy, don't\r\nforget that!\"\r\n\r\nThis last remark brought Mell to her senses. Not one of them but would\r\ngladly stand where she stood--gladly put themselves in her shoes if\r\nthey could. Rube was not a mate, as mating goes, to be met with every\r\nday in the year. The sugared point of this timely suggestion served\r\nMiss Josey's purpose effectually. It stilled the wild throbbing in the\r\ngirl's heart, brought the blood back to her face, and turned the\r\npurple of such wondrous hue in her eyes, to the softest black; with\r\nintensity of gratification, Jerome himself was forgotten for the\r\nnonce.\r\n\r\nMiss Josey, still in a flutter of delight, now proceeded to put on her\r\nsash, to replace the knot of ribbons at her throat, to pass her hands\r\nassuagingly across Mell's wilderness of frolicsome hair, and to put an\r\nextra touch or two to her simple toilette generally; whispering words\r\nof stimulation and encouragement all the while.\r\n\r\nThoroughly put to rights, Miss Josey placed the girl's hand into that\r\nof a very grand personage--the president of the Grange, in fact--who\r\nled her gallantly to the spot selected for the coronation ceremonies.\r\nThere stood the hero of the day. He advanced a step or two as she drew\r\nnear, he bowed low, and then in a distinct voice with a somewhat\r\nheightened color, but in his usual simple, straightforward manner,\r\nsaid: \"Miss Creecy, I beg you will do me the honor to accept this\r\ntrophy of my victory.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Creecy silently bowed her head; he placed the wreath upon it, and\r\nlo! what has become of our rustic maiden? She is a Queen!\r\n\r\nNevertheless, she immediately fell back again into Miss Josey's hands,\r\nwho hastened to push the crown this way and then that,--forward a\r\nlittle, and then backward a little--just one barley-corn this side and\r\njust one the other; until the magical spot of perfect-becomingness\r\nhaving been reached, she wisely let it be. As soon as the crowd caught\r\nsight of this bright splendor of yellow hair, surmounted by a wreath\r\nof flowers, the shouting and yelling re-commenced; and when it was\r\npassed with electric swiftness from mouth to mouth, that the head of\r\nthe Rutland family, the owner of an honored name and a big estate, had\r\nchosen for his queen, not the daughter of a rich planter or a great\r\nstatesman, but a child of the yeomanry, a ripple of intense excitement\r\nflashed through the multitude, and enthusiasm knew no bounds.\r\n\r\n\"Rutland for the people, and the people for Rutland!\" was the joyous\r\noutpouring of the common heart. A sentiment which only subsided\r\noccasionally, to be renewed with increased vigor and manifold cheers.\r\n\r\n\"I see your game,\" said the secretary of the Grange to Rube, with a\r\nsly wink. \"You are going to run for the Legislature?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your penetration surprises me,\" returned Rube with a laugh. \"What a\r\npity the voting couldn't be done now; I'd be willing to risk a couple\r\nof thousand on my own election, if it could!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's awfully becoming to her, isn't it?\" inquired Jerome, speaking to\r\nClara, and referring to the crown which sat upon the queen's head.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so,\" returned Clara, \"not in the least becoming. It\r\ndoesn't suit the color of her hair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure enough! I had forgotten that. We bought it to suit yours, didn't\r\nwe? It is too bad! but never mind; we'll come in for the second prize,\r\ncertain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not I!\" exclaimed Clara, with a toss of her head. \"It is first or\r\nnone with me. There is something mean, little, contemptible, about a\r\nsecond prize, just like all second-rate things! Having failed in\r\nsecuring the first, were I in your place, I would not try for the\r\nsecond.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she left him, much angered.\r\n\r\n\"Whew!\" softly whistled Jerome. \"It strikes me that what pleases one\r\nwoman, doesn't please another. Why is that? It also strikes me that\r\nit's no use trying to please any of 'em. A man can't; not unless he\r\nconverts himself into a sort of synchronous multiplex machine, and\r\ntries seventy-five different ways all at once.\"\r\n\r\nThe stream of people now poured in one direction,--towards royalty.\r\nQueens differ; but there is a something about every one of them which\r\nfetches the crowd. While this one stood hemmed in on all sides, an\r\nobject of curiosity to all classes and conditions, all eager for a\r\nsight of her, some eager to be made known to her, others wanting to\r\ncatch a look, a word, a smile, Mell heard some one at her elbow say,\r\nsoftly:\r\n\r\n\"Mellville.\"\r\n\r\nTurning, she confronted Jerome. In a flash, her whole appearance\r\nchanged. The moment before she had been a gracious sovereign,\r\naccepting with queenly grace the homage of her loyal subjects. Now,\r\nshe was an outraged monarch jealous of her rank, standing on her\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\n\"How dare you, sir!\" asked Mell, eyeing him haughtily and drawing\r\nherself up to her fullest height. \"How dare you to speak to me! How\r\ndare you touch me! I have not the honor of your acquaintance, sir!\"\r\n\r\nJerome was undeniably astonished; but this was not the time, not the\r\nplace to indulge in a feeling of astonishment, or to make an\r\nexhibition of himself or her.\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty,\" said Jerome, with his characteristic coolness, \"will\r\ngraciously pardon me. The crowd is great, it pressed heavily upon all\r\nsides and I have not been able to resist it.\"\r\n\r\nHe fell back at once, and Mell bowed, just as if nothing had happened,\r\nto the gentleman, whom the master of ceremonies was in the act of\r\nintroducing to her.\r\n\r\nIn the crush, Jerome encountered Rube. He had been called off on some\r\nmatter under discussion among those running the shebang--Rube's way of\r\nputting it--and was now endeavoring to push his way back to Mell.\r\n\r\n\"How-do, old fellow?\" said Jerome, by way of congratulation.\r\n\r\n\"Tip-top!\" said Rube, by way of thanks, and seizing his friend's hand\r\nhe wrung it as if his intention was to wring it clean off. \"You're a\r\ntrump!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't mention it!\" begged Jerome. He began to laugh again. For some\r\nreason the whole thing was excessively amusing to Jerome.\r\n\r\n\"But I _will_ mention it,\" persisted Rube. \"I'll thank you for it to\r\nmy dying day. It was so self-sacrificing on your part, considering\r\neverything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, was it?\" exclaimed his companion, choking down his risibles.\r\n\"Well--ah--I don't exactly feel it that way. A mere trifle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to me,\" declared Rube.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not to me, either,\" conceded Jerome, looking on the subject\r\nmore seriously. \"For Clara--\"\r\n\r\n\"You can patch up Clara,\" Rube suggested, soothingly.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think so? It's a rankling _casus belli_ at present, I can tell\r\nyou! But how about your rustic beauty, eh, Rube? Is she pleased? Does\r\nshe like it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pleased? Like it? You bet she does! She's delighted!\"\r\n\r\n\"No one has introduced me yet,\" Jerome next remarked, quite\r\nincidentally. \"And I am sure if her Gracious Majesty smiles upon any\r\nof her loyal subjects it ought to be me.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so! So come right along now.\" They reached her side.\r\n\r\n\"Mell, here's the very best fellow in the world,\" said Rube, out of\r\nthe fullness of his heart, forgetting the prescribed forms of\r\netiquette in the absorption of warm feeling.\r\n\r\nMell had noted their approach. She was not taken unawares. She bent\r\nher head slightly to the newcomer, she looked him over for a whole\r\nminute, it seemed, before she opened her lips and said:\r\n\r\n\"How do you do, Mr. Very-Best-Fellow-in-the-World?\"\r\n\r\nThose near enough to hear roared with laughter, for the young queen's\r\nmanner made the whole thing so absurdly funny; and perhaps there is\r\nnothing a crowd so much enjoys as the taking down of a person whom\r\nthey regard in the light of one much needing to be taken down.\r\n\r\n\"His name is Devonhough,\" Rube hastened to explain, not relishing the\r\nlaugh against his friend at this particular time by his particular\r\nfault. \"Mr. Devonhough, Miss Creecy. He is my very best friend, Mell.\r\nShake hands with him.\"\r\n\r\nMell did so; but without the faintest glimmering of a smile, and with\r\nsuch glacial dignity as fairly charged the atmosphere with iciness.\r\nNot content with this, she met all his subsequent efforts to cultivate\r\nher acquaintance with the briefest and chilliest repulses.\r\n\r\nRube was much concerned. He saw dimly that his best friend had not,\r\nsomehow, made a favorable impression upon his future wife; but he\r\ncould not tell the why or wherefore. While he wondered within him what\r\nhe could do to put things on a pleasanter footing between them,\r\nsomeone else demanded his attention.\r\n\r\n\"See here,\" said Jerome, as soon as Rube's back was turned. \"I hope\r\nyou now consider me sufficiently punished. I hope you feel even. I\r\nhope you won't treat me to any more state airs. I am tired of them.\r\nYour Majesty, let me tell you something. Mark well my words. It is to\r\nme, not Rube, you owe your present exaltation.\"\r\n\r\n\"_To you!_\"\r\n\r\nThe unsmiling countenance now broke into a ripple of scorn.\r\n\r\n\"What a ridiculous thing for you to say!\"\r\n\r\n\"The whole thing has been ridiculous,\" said Jerome. \"I never in my\r\nwhole life ever enjoyed anything so much. 'Tis the one grain of truth\r\nwhich gives point to the ridiculous. Think of Rube, dear fellow, so\r\nanxious to crown you, knowing nothing, suspecting nothing, begging me\r\nnot to run fast, and I, so ten thousand times more anxious than he\r\ncould possibly be, to have you crowned.\"\r\n\r\n\"_You?_\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. _Me!_ Don't you know, in your heart, Mellville, that I wanted\r\nyou crowned?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I know nothing of the kind! When a man wants a thing done, he\r\ndoes it with his own hand; when he does not want it done, or cares\r\nnot much about it, he does it with another man's hand. Had you been\r\nanxious you would not have left it to Rube.\"\r\n\r\n\"But with that wreath in my own hand, Mell, I was morally bound to put\r\nit upon another head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, indeed! Why?\"\r\n\r\nJerome did not answer immediately. When he did, it was with averted\r\neyes, and with some impatience, and not in reply to her first question\r\nat all, but her quick repetition of his own words, \"Morally bound,\r\neh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mellville. You forget I am a guest in her mother's house.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not forget it! I remember it every hour in the whole twenty-four;\r\nbut does that make it incumbent upon you to ignore me? Jerome, look me\r\nin the face. What is Clara Rutland to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing!\" exclaimed he, savagely, between compressed lips. \"Less than\r\nnothing! A hundred times to-day I have wished her at the bottom of--\"\r\n\r\n\"There! No use to send her there _now_. It's too late!\"\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of what she had done, the wretchedness she saw it was\r\ndestined to entail upon her, all this while couchant like a wild beast\r\nwithin her, now uprose into her expressive features. Jerome was struck\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"You will know soon enough,\" she responded.\r\n\r\nHe stooped to pick up the handkerchief she had dropped, and in\r\nrestoring it, his hand, so cool and steady, came in contact with hers,\r\nso hot and tremulous; it touched and lingered, lingered long, and\r\nclung in a tender pressure; while a voice so low and firm, a voice,\r\noh! so faint and sweet, stole its way into her ear, murmuring but one\r\nword, one little, fond word, which moved her in the strangest way,\r\nwhich thrilled, yet soothed her. Cooler than snow it fell upon her\r\nburning cheeks, warmer than a sunbeam into her freezing heart. That\r\nlittle game with Rube passed out of her memory.\r\n\r\nBut looking up all too soon, she saw him. He smiled upon her. He was\r\nglad to see that she and Devonhough were getting along quite\r\npleasantly.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you would go away!\" she suddenly exclaimed, turning upon her\r\ncompanion rudely. \"Go back to Clara Rutland! You have no business\r\nhere! I do not believe a word you have said to me! I yet fail to\r\ncomprehend why a man may not be the master of his own actions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heigh-ho!\" sighed Jerome. \"Just so it is in life. Just as a man\r\nbegins to think he has put everything in order, and settled the\r\nquestion, here comes chaos again. You do not understand that,\r\nMell? Well, I will tell you. Every man has a master--circumstance. On\r\nmy side, I am surprised that you, with all your quickness of\r\napprehension, have not been able to see clearer and deeper into this\r\nsubject. You ought to have known, you must have felt that I had\r\nsome good reason for acting towards you as I have to-day. Have you\r\nbeen true to your promise to trust me--and trust me blindly? I fear\r\nnot. You have been cruelly angry with me ever since this morning,\r\nwhen I dared not speak.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why was it that you dared not speak?\" demanded Mell, her lip\r\ncurling contemptuously, but with a tremolo movement in her voice.\r\n\"Does it then require some courage for a man, in your position to\r\nspeak to a poor girl like me? Rube does not think so.\"\r\n\r\n\"With Rube it is different.\"\r\n\r\n\"_It is_, very different. There is no false pride about Rube.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I hope there is none about me. But, Mell, you do not in the least\r\nunderstand my position.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know as much about it as I care to know. Henceforth, Mr.\r\nDevonhough, let us be strangers.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can never be strangers,\" said Jerome. He was growing earnest; he\r\nspoke very low and with that rapidity of utterance which accompanies\r\nexcited feelings. \"This no time nor place, Mell, for such an\r\nexplanation; but here, and now, I will make it. I cannot longer exist\r\nunder the ban of your displeasure. Know then, dear, that I would not\r\nspeak to you this morning for your own sweet sake--not mine. I was\r\ndriven to it to protect your good name, and keep you out of the mouths\r\nof those shallow-pated creatures, who have nothing else to talk about\r\nbut other people's failings. Had Clara Rutland once seen me speak to\r\nyou--had she for one moment suspected the least acquaintance between\r\nus, that hydra-headed monster, Curiosity, would have lifted its\r\nunpitying voice in a hundred awkward questions: 'How did you come to\r\nknow Mell Creecy? Where did you meet her? Who introduced you to her?'\r\nAnd so on to the end of a long chapter. I did not wish to say, for\r\nyour sake, that I had never met you anywhere but in a cornfield. I did\r\nnot wish to say, for your sake, that we had became acquainted in a\r\nvery delightful, but by no means conventional, manner. I have thought\r\nit best, all along, to keep the fact of our acquaintance in the\r\nbackground, until we were brought together in some way perfectly\r\nlegitimate and customary. Always for your sake, dear, not mine. Now\r\nyou know in part; to-morrow I will make a clean breast of all my\r\ndifficulties; so disperse these clouds, and give me one sweet look ere\r\nI go.\"\r\n\r\nInstead of that, Mell swallowed a lump in her throat which felt as\r\nbig as her head. She studiously avoided, for the rest of the day,\r\nany further speech with Jerome. His explanation was plausible\r\nenough on its face; but Mell was in no condition of mind to draw\r\nconclusions which might stand the test of reason, or be satisfactorily\r\ndemonstrated on geometrical principles; and nothing that Jerome\r\ncould say was now calculated to act as a sedative on Mell's nerves.\r\nShe kept whispering to herself, \"He feels it, yes, he feels it;\"\r\nand thus nourished the firmness and the bravado necessary to her in\r\nthe further requirements of her high position. She needed it all, and\r\nmore, when it came to bestowing upon Jerome a handsome pair of\r\nspurs, as the second prize of the day. Certainly he cared for her,\r\nor why this glow on his clear-cut face, or why this light in his\r\nspeaking eyes now bent upon her. Mell turned her head quickly.\r\n\r\n\"I can't understand why you don't like Devonhough,\" Rube remarked,\r\nnoticing the movement. \"I think it odd. He carries things with a high\r\nhand among the girls, I can tell you. Most all of 'em are dead in love\r\nwith him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you wish me added to the list?\" interrogated Mell, finding\r\nherself in a tight place, and hardly knowing how to get out of it.\r\n\r\n\"Well, no; I don't!\" laughed Rube, much appreciating the sly humor of\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\nBy seven o'clock the day's festivities were concluded; and then ensued\r\na melting of all hostile elements into a homogeneous mass, all\r\nravenous after iced-lemonade and home-made cake, and a heterogeneous\r\ndevouring of the same; after which, the crowd, well pleased, but\r\npretty well fagged out, turned their faces homeward, under a sun still\r\nshining, but shorn of its hottest beams.\r\n\r\nNo one will gainsay the statement that our heroine has made great\r\nsocial strides in one summer's day. In the morning a simple country\r\ngirl, poor in pocket, humble in rank, unknown in society, seated\r\nbeside Miss Josey in the little pony phaeton, full of fair hopes and\r\ninspirations; in the evening the affianced wife of the best-born and\r\nmost eligible young man in the county; returning to the old farm-house\r\nin grand style, leaning back on soft cushions, beside her future lord,\r\nin a flashy open carriage drawn by a ravishing pair of high mettled\r\nroans.\r\n\r\nAmbitious, indeed, must be that girl not satisfied with this wonderful\r\nresult of one single operation in matrimonial stocks. And yet Mell is\r\nnot happy. She forgets to give heed to what Rube is saying; she\r\nforgets almost to answer him back; so full of regret is she for her\r\nown lost self. She had had a thousand longings to get out of her old\r\nself, and out of her old life, and now, on the threshold of a new\r\nexistence, Mell finds herself with only one desire--just to get back\r\nwhere she came from. If only she could--oh! if only she could, most\r\ngladly would this lately crowned queen have relinquished the glories\r\nof empire, the spoils of captive hearts, the trophies of social\r\ntriumphs, the high emprise of a brilliant future, only to be simple\r\nMell once more.\r\n\r\nAh, poor Mell! Not for sale now. Sold!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nPLAYERS ON A STAGE.\r\n\r\nNow, then, here is Thursday. Jerome had said: \"You will be on hand\r\nwithout fail, Mell; and so will I, and so will something else.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that something else,\" moaned the hapless Mell, bowed down and\r\nheart-stricken, \"will never be on hand again in the meadow for me, nor\r\nanywhere else.\"\r\n\r\nSaddest of all, she had herself laid the axe to the root of her own\r\nhappiness; she had baited her own hook and caught a big fish; she had\r\nprovoked her own doom, and herself sealed it.\r\n\r\nRube was not to blame.\r\n\r\nAnd Jerome--he had made out a good case. Had he loved her less he\r\nwould, perhaps, have acted differently.\r\n\r\nShe had digged a pitfall for her own occupation; and of all\r\ncomfortless and stony places, such pitfalls as this make the hardest\r\nlying.\r\n\r\nOut in the narrow hall, on its own particular peg, hung Mell's white\r\nsun-bonnet. She took it down and put it on her head, and walked slowly\r\nto the top of the hill. With no intention of going to the meadow\r\nherself, her feelings demanded that she should find out if Jerome was\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nHe was, strolling moodily to and fro, in deep thought.\r\n\r\nHe knows now. Rube has told him. He despises her to-day, and yesterday\r\nhe had loved her. Look at him down there in the meadow! a beam from\r\nthe sun, a breath from the hills, a part of the morning, the most\r\nglorious expression of nature in all nature's glory! Observe how he\r\nwalks! Note how he stands still! Most men know how to walk, and most\r\nmen know how to stand still, after a fashion; but not after Jerome's\r\nfashion. In motion, Jerome is a poem set a-going; standing still, he\r\nis grace doing nothing. He can lift one hand, and in that ordinary act\r\nsow the seed of a dozen beautiful fancies; he can wield such mastery\r\nover the physical forces of expression as has wondrous potency to sway\r\nthe emotions of others.\r\n\r\nSo she thought; so she stood, hidden herself from sight, but with the\r\nmeadow in full view; and while so thinking, and so standing, drinking\r\nhim in with every breath, feeding upon him with her eyes, devouring\r\nhim with her soul, she, the affianced wife of another!\r\n\r\nOh, wicked Mell!\r\n\r\nJerome grows impatient; he looks at his watch, and turns inquiringly\r\ntowards the hill; and Mell flies back to the house as if pursued by\r\nfiery dragons. For if he but caught sight of her, if he but crooked\r\nhis finger at her, she would go down there, and then--what then?\r\n\r\nMell was not blind to her own weakness. The afternoon brought Rube,\r\noverwhelmingly happy, overwhelmingly devoted. She must take an airing\r\nwith him in his brand new buggy; and while they scoured the country\r\nround about, Rube was making diligent inquiry as to how soon they\r\nmight get married. Mell caught her breath, and, in the same breath, at\r\na possible reprieve.\r\n\r\n\"Won't you give me a little time to think?\" she pleaded. \"It has come\r\nso sudden!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hasn't it, though!\" cried happy Rube. \"Do you half realize the romance\r\nof the thing, Mellville? 'Tis like a page out of Knight-Errantry, the\r\ndays of lances and standards, and blood-thrilling adventures, when\r\nwarriors in steel swore by the Holy-rood, and won fair women's\r\nsmiles by deeds of valor--something very unlike the prosaic happenings\r\nof this practical modern life. But yesterday a wandering pilgrim, to-day\r\nI have found a shrine. ''Tis a dream!' I thought, when I opened my\r\neyes this morning, 'a dream, too sweet to be true! Rube, old fellow,'\r\nI said to myself, 'you've got something to live for now. You must\r\nlook to your ways and improve upon the old ones. There's a dear little\r\nhand that belongs to you; there's a pair of blue eyes to watch for\r\nyour coming; there's a sweet little woman who believes in you, God bless\r\nher! For her sake I will run the race of life like a man; for her\r\nsweet sake I will win it!'\"\r\n\r\nThis was the time for Mell to speak. She wanted to speak, but--she did\r\nnot. There were just exactly six reasons why she did not.\r\n\r\nHere they are, all in a row:\r\n\r\nReason Number One.--She was not quite sure of Jerome--quite sure,\r\nperhaps, in regard to his affections, but not his intentions. Love is\r\nmuch, but not everything, and a lover surrounded by difficulties is\r\nnot to be depended upon matrimonially.\r\n\r\nNumber Two.--She was as resolutely bent upon getting out of this mean,\r\nsordid life as ever, and what way was there but this way?\r\n\r\nNumber Three.--Rube was rich, and Rube's wife would be rich, too. For\r\nher part, she was sick and tired of poverty. Poverty, in a world\r\ngoverned by wealth, is the most unpardonable sin in that world's\r\ndecalogue.\r\n\r\nNumber Four.--Rube was in \"society,\" and what ambitious woman ever yet\r\nsaved her soul outside the magic circle of society?\r\n\r\nNumber Five.--Rube was an aristocrat, and Rube's wife would be _ex\r\nnecessitate rei_, an aristocrat also. Her Creator, she believed, had\r\nintended her for an aristocrat; otherwise why had He endowed her with\r\nintellect, beauty, and the power to sway men's passions?\r\n\r\nNumber Six.--The fact that she did not love Rube had, in reality,\r\nnothing to do with Rube's eligibility as a husband. He would make a\r\nvery good one, an infinitely better one than none at all!\r\n\r\nOf course, she would be paying a tremendous price for all these\r\nworldly advantages. Mell was aware of that all the while, but after\r\ndeducting from the gross weight of their true value the real or\r\napproximate weight of their possible evils and disadvantages, she\r\nwould undoubtedly still be getting the best of a good bargain.\r\n\r\nWhat is life but an enigmatical offset of losses and gain--so much\r\ngain on the one hand, so much loss on the other? And what was this\r\ntransaction between herself and Rube but a repetition, under a\r\nsomewhat different formula, of those mathematical problems worked out\r\non her slate at school? It was all very simple.\r\n\r\nYoung woman, if you were in Mell's place; if you had six good reasons\r\nfor not telling the man you are about to marry that you did not care a\r\nstraw about him, wouldn't you hold your peace?\r\n\r\nThen cast no stones at Mell.\r\n\r\nMell _was_ deeply moved by Rube's words, but not deep enough to damage\r\nher future prospects. And since a woman has very poor prospects\r\noutside of matrimony, ought we not to excuse her for attending closely\r\nto business?\r\n\r\nAt all events, although Mell's thoughts were heavy, and her soul\r\nstirred within her, and her thick breathing almost stifled in a\r\npainful sense of guilt, she did not say a word. Feeling that Rube's\r\neyes were fixed upon her, she raised to him her own, suffused in\r\ntears; an answer which fully satisfied her companion. From which it\r\nwill appear that a woman may weep for the man she takes in--weep, and\r\nyet keep on taking him in.\r\n\r\nAnd what can a man do? How could Rube tell that it was the hidden\r\npathos of his own groundless faith, and not a feeling of sympathetic\r\naffection, which brought such softness of expression into that girl's\r\nluminous orbs?\r\n\r\nIf the actual is the only true thing, and amounts to everything, as it\r\nreally does in the school of Realism, there is still one difficulty to\r\nbe encountered--to get hold of the actual. He who aspires to find out\r\nthe actual, where a woman is concerned, must get himself another kind\r\nof eye, one whose vision is introspective and able to penetrate into\r\nthat mysterious element in a clever woman's nature which enables her\r\nso successfully to clothe the Not-True in the beautiful garments of\r\nTruth.\r\n\r\nRube Rutland felt uncertain about a good many things--his own strength\r\nunder temptation, his mother's consent to this marriage, Clara's\r\ntemper, the great sea serpent, the Pope's infallibility, the man in\r\nthe Iron Mask, and many a cock-and-bull story beside, but he never\r\nonce doubted Mell Creecy's love, the purest myth among them all.\r\n\r\nHe came, after this, every day to the little house upon the hill, and\r\nhad it out \"comferterble in the parler,\" as old man Creecy had advised\r\nJerome to do. He courted with the enthusiasm of an incorrigible\r\nfaddist over a new fad; and no lover of those olden days of which he\r\nhad spoken, when goodly knights tilted in the jousts of arms, and won\r\nfair lady's favor with deeds of prowess, ever yet surpassed a modern\r\nmighty man with a mission. Devotion itself is paralyzed when it comes\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nAt the Bigge House, as one may suppose, there had been considerable\r\nconsternation when its young master announced his intention of taking\r\nto wife old Jacob Creecy's daughter. Consternation, but hardly\r\nsurprise; for Rube had ever been one of those lawless members of\r\nwell-conducted households privileged to say and do outrageous things,\r\nand expected to turn out of the beaten track on the slightest\r\nprovocation.\r\n\r\nMiss Rutland was most concerned. Said she to her brother:\r\n\r\n\"Rube, why not marry a female Ojibbwa, and be done with it? _That_\r\nwould be an improvement on Mell Creecy as a _mésalliance_. My God!\r\nRube, you can't bring a girl here into this house as your wife, whose\r\nfather talks like a nigger, who says 'dis,' and 'dat,' and 'udder;' or\r\ndo you expect to hold your position in society, your place among\r\nhonorable men, simply by the grace of heaven?\"\r\n\r\nThis was severe; but it was not all--not half, in fact, that Rube had\r\nto hear before he got rid of Clara. But it was not the first time he\r\nhad brought a hornet's nest about his ears, nor swam against the\r\nstream, nor borne the brunt of Clara's tongue. Through much practice\r\nRube had pretty well mastered the art of holding out, which does not\r\nconsist so much in talking back as in saying nothing. Moreover, his\r\ncause was good, and half a man can hold out with a good cause to hold\r\non. One hard speech Rube did make to Clara; he told her, in effect,\r\nthat whatever might be the grammatical shortcomings of old Jacob\r\nCreecy himself, his daughter knew more in one single minute than Clara\r\nwould ever learn in a lifetime.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rutland was not less unwilling, but more reasonable.\r\n\r\n\"You are my only son,\" she said to him, \"my first-born. I expected you\r\nto add lustre to the family and make a great match.\"\r\n\r\n\"The family is illustrious enough,\" replied he; \"if not, it will never\r\nbe more illustrious at my expense. I will have none of your great\r\nmatches, mother. I intend to marry the woman I love. I have loved her\r\never since she was a child. None of the rest of you need marry her,\r\nhowever; I will not impose that task upon you. But Mellville is to be\r\nmy wife to a dead certainty, and I am my own master.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are, my son. I have not sought to prevent your marrying her. I\r\nhave only expressed my disappointment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I am sorry about that. But see here, mother; I will make it\r\neasy for you. Keep this as your own home as long as you live, and I\r\nwill make another home for myself and the wife you do not like.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, my dear boy, ever generous, ever kind! As your wife she\r\n_must_ be dear to me. What is a mother's greedy aspiration compared to\r\nher child's real happiness? Follow your bent, my boy; follow it with\r\nyour mother's sanction. And now, do you still love me a little, Rube,\r\nin spite of this new love?\"\r\n\r\n\"A little, dear mother!\" He threw his arms about her. \"No, not a\r\nlittle! Much, very much; more than ever before! And believe me, when\r\nyou know Mell, you will feel very differently about it. You have only\r\nseen her so far, through Clara's eyes; come and see her as she is;\r\ncome now, mother, with me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it came about that on a certain day Rube came as usual to the\r\nfarm-house, but not as usual, alone. His mother came with him--came,\r\nlooking about her with prying eyes, and a nose bent on thorough\r\ninvestigation, and a mind ready to ferret out every idea in Mell's\r\nbrain; a mind ready to probe every weak place in Mell's character; a\r\nmind ready to catechize every integument in Mell's body.\r\n\r\nThe look of things about the premises prepossessed her at once in the\r\ngirl's favor. The house was neither large, handsome, nor fresh; but it\r\nwas venerable, an attribute greatly esteemed by people of rank. Much\r\nof its unpainted ugliness was concealed in trailing vines and creeping\r\nivy, much of its dilapidation shrouded in luxuriant shrubbery, an\r\nevery-day adaptation of the simplest elements of relief, technique.\r\nThe little front garden, in its white-sanded walks and well-weeded\r\nbeds, brilliant in many-hued blossoms, was just like a spruce\r\ncountry-damsel in her best bib and tucker. The little parlor, daintily\r\nfurnished and tastefully arranged, where the visitor trod, not on bare\r\nboards, but a neat carpet, commingling Turkish forms and Yankee\r\ninterpretations, was still more suggestive. Into this cozy apartment\r\nMell had really crowded, in practical forms, all she had learned of\r\nhuman nature as it appears in man's nature. Pretty things there were,\r\nbut none too pretty for use. Perfect neatness there was, but not too\r\nperfect to interfere with a man's love for the let-me-do-as-I-please\r\nprinciple. Here a man who smokes might, after asking permission, puff\r\naway to his heart's content, puff away without a compunction and\r\nwithout a frown from its ministering spirit. Or, if my lord feels in a\r\nbreaking mood, let him break, break right and left, and there's no\r\ngreat harm done; a few dollars would put them all back. This is a\r\nconsideration by no means small or unimportant to some men, who seem\r\ninspired to break everything they touch, from a woman's heart to the\r\nmost venerated of old brass icons.\r\n\r\nThis little room did everything it could to please a man, and put\r\nnothing in his way; although it made him feel, with its presiding\r\ngenius in it, every kind of way, except uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nThere's a rose upon the mantle, stuck by careless hand in a vase of\r\nantique design--one rose, no more; for one such faultless rose as this\r\nfills up all the spirit's longing in a rose. A thousand roses, perfect\r\nof their kind, could do no more. Here we have _sub rosa_ a profound\r\nphilosophical maxim showing its colors--as brief as profound, i.e.,\r\nenough is enough, whether it be enough rose or enough stewed pigeon\r\nwith green peas.\r\n\r\nOn a spider-legged table in this diminutive lady's bower, there sat a\r\ndish of ferns; some moss was growing in a basket; some colored strands\r\nof wool lay across a piece of canvas; a carved paper-cutter peeped out\r\nfrom the leaves of an unread book, left lying on an ottoman by some\r\nperson who had been seated in an easy-chair with silken cushions, soft\r\nto rest upon in weariness, in a cozy corner; and on a sofa of crimson\r\nplush reposed, in restful quiet, a guitar with blue ribbon attached.\r\nThis guitar told its own tale; Mell _had_ learned something useful,\r\nafter all, at that famous boarding-school; for to the strumming of\r\nthis guitar she could sing you, with inimitable taste and in a\r\nbird-like voice, an English madrigal, or a French _chansonnette_, or\r\none of those plaintive love ditties which finds its way into the\r\nlistener's heart through any language.\r\n\r\n\"Now, mother,\" said Rube, looking about him with pardonable pride,\r\n\"isn't this pleasant? Have we, amid all our grandeur, any such snug\r\nden as this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, no, Rube! It _is_ charming! _Multum in parvo_, one may say. But\r\nwhom have we here?\"\r\n\r\nIt was Mell, halting for one awe-struck instant in the doorway,\r\nattired in a fresh muslin dress, with ribbons to match her eyes, and\r\ncheeks dyed a red carnation at the formidable prospect of meeting,\r\nface to face, the august mistress of the Bigge House. Rube pressed\r\nforward to meet her, and took her fluttering hand in his own, and led\r\nher forward.\r\n\r\n\"Your new daughter, mother, and this, Mellville, is our good mother.\r\nYou'll get along famously with her, I believe, in spite of Clara.\"\r\n\r\nWho but a blundering man, like dear honest Rube, would have so\r\ncompletely let the domestic cat out of the bag?\r\n\r\nNo need for Mell to be the most wide-awake creature in existence to\r\nunderstand on the spot, the real status of affairs, as concerned\r\nherself, at the Bigge House.\r\n\r\nSubjugated at once by her beauty, constrained to admit her lady-like\r\ndeportment, Mrs. Rutland kissed the rounded cheek and hoped she would\r\nmake her dear boy very happy. And Mell looked flatteringly conscious\r\nof the great lady's condescension, and blushingly avowed her\r\nunalterable determination to try. This interesting little ceremony\r\nseemed to dissipate all the underlying displeasure at Rube's choice in\r\nhis mother's mind.\r\n\r\nShe watched the girl closely during the interview which followed. Many\r\ngirls are pretty and lady-like, not many are to be found as well\r\neducated as Mell Creecy, or as thoroughly equipped by both nature and\r\neducation to entertain, to amuse, to fascinate. This was that part of\r\nMell which \"tuck arter her ole daddy,\" as old Jacob was wont to say.\r\nEven Clara Rutland's manners were not more easy and irreproachable,\r\nand Clara had never been half so ready in speech and apt in reply. It\r\nwas a matter of agreeable wonder to Mrs. Rutland how a hard-working\r\nuneducated farmer could have such a daughter, and she wondered also if\r\nthis phenomenal social prodigy could be found so strongly marked in\r\nany other land under the sun.\r\n\r\nObeying an instinct of curiosity, the visitor inquired:\r\n\r\n\"Your father and mother, Melville, are they here? Will they see us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if I can help it!\" inwardly.\r\n\r\nOutwardly very different.\r\n\r\n\"So sorry! Mother is not well to-day. She is rarely well, and rarely\r\nsees anyone. Father is as usual busy upon the farm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rube says your father is a very thorough farmer,\" remarked the\r\nvisitor.\r\n\r\n\"Doesn't a good farmer make money out of it,\" queried Mell, glancing\r\nat her betrothed with a doubtful little smile, \"just as a lawyer does\r\nout of law, and a doctor out of physic? The earth is full of gold, and\r\nought not a good digger to strike it somewhere--some time? Father, at\r\nany rate, is devoted to farming, as an occupation, and is happy in it,\r\ngetting out of the ground more of God's secrets than the rest of us\r\nfind among the stars.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a pretty idea, Mellville,\" said Mrs. Rutland.\r\n\r\n\"Bless you!\" exclaimed Rube, \"that's nothing! She's full of 'em!\"\r\n\r\nFull of them, yes; and feeding his honest soul upon them, in place of\r\nthe real bread of affection.\r\n\r\nThe visit was long and pleasant, and at its close Mell accompanied her\r\nguests to the very door of their carriage. There Mrs. Rutland again\r\ntouched the girl's soft cheek with her high-bred lips. Her foot was\r\nupon the stepping-stone, when with a sudden thought, she turned once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\"Mellville, we are to be very gay next week, a house full of company;\r\nbut I suspect we shall be honored with very little of Rube's society\r\nunless we first secure yours. Will you come, then, and make us a\r\nlittle visit?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are kind,\" answered she, coloring beautifully with intensity of\r\ngratification. \"Most kind! I will come with exceeding pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nThese were perhaps the first unstudied words she had uttered in Mrs.\r\nRutland's presence. There was no doubt about her wanting to go to the\r\nBigge House. She had been wanting to go there a long time. A veritable\r\nflood-tide of joy filled her being at this speedy consummation of her\r\ndearest hopes, but it was not of this she thought at that moment, nor\r\nof Mrs. Rutland, nor of Rube. \"I will see Jerome,\" was what Mell\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\"Sweetest of mothers!\" said Rube inside the vehicle.\r\n\r\n\"Luckiest of men!\" returned his mother. \"I am returning home as did\r\nthe Queen of Sheba; the half was not told!\"\r\n\r\nRube now felt solid, unquestionably solid, in his own mind.\r\n\r\nMell, standing yet in the gateway, looked after them; gladly received\r\nthey had been, like many another guest; gladly, too, dismissed.\r\n\r\n\"The chain tightens,\" cogitated the future mistress of the Bigge\r\nHouse, \"and if I should want to break it!\"\r\n\r\nBut why should she want to break it, unless--\r\n\r\n\"There's no use counting upon that,\" Mell frankly admitted to herself,\r\n\"and no man's difficulties must be allowed to interfere with my\r\nfuture. And Rube is _so_ eligible! A good fellow, too; a most\r\nexcellent fellow! There's a something, however. What is it?\"\r\n\r\nWe will tell you, Mell--Rube is not Jerome.\r\n\r\nGoing back into the house she found her father and mother peeping\r\nthrough the blinds.\r\n\r\n\"Lord, Lord!\" exclaimed old Jacob. \"You'se jess er gittin' up, Mell! I\r\nknowed ye could do it, darter; but I mus' say, I never lookt fer yer\r\nter git es high es the Bigge House.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Creecy inquired about Mrs. Rutland. Was she nice? pleasant?\r\n\r\n\"Very. No one could be nicer or pleasanter. She asked for you--both of\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"She did? Then why didn't you tell us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wife!\" remonstrated the old farmer, \"you is sartingly loss yo'\r\nsenses! Don't ye know, when Mell's fine friends comes er long, we's\r\nexpected ter run inter er rat-hole or some udder hole? All the use\r\nchillun has fer parients these days is ter keep 'em er going. Onst\r\nMrs. Rullan', Mell aint gwine ter know us by site! She aint no chile\r\ner mine, no how, Mell aint!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wall, now, she is yourn, I kin tell ye,\" cried Mrs. Creecy, flaring\r\nup, very much to the enjoyment of her liege lord.\r\n\r\nThe daughter turned off in disgust. Her father's pleasantries were the\r\nleast pleasant of all his disagreeable ways. A coarse man's humor is\r\napt to be the coarsest thing about him.\r\n\r\nIt was under very different auspices from those of her day dreams,\r\nthat Mell, after a few days of busy preparation, was admitted into the\r\nsacred precincts of the social hierarchy.\r\n\r\nJerome was to have been the founder of her greatness, her steersman in\r\nthese unknown waters--not Rube.\r\n\r\nNone in this higher realm welcomed her more graciously than Clara.\r\nClara had high views of philosophy, but only one maxim: \"See how the\r\nhare runs, hear how the owl cries, accept the inevitable, and get all\r\nyou can out of it.\"\r\n\r\nJerome returned from Cragmore the day following her own domestication\r\ninto this new sphere of existence. How strange it all seemed, and how\r\nunnatural! How strange he should find her there, and with so good a\r\nright to be there! Surely years have intervened since those lovely\r\nmornings in the meadow, when Sukey cropped the dew-wet grass, and she\r\nsat on the old tree-stump and Jerome lay at her feet.\r\n\r\nSurely long, long years!\r\n\r\nSo long that Jerome has forgotten all about them--and her. She is now\r\nto him only Miss Creecy, the prospective wife of his nearest friend,\r\nthe prospective mistress of the Bigge House, and not attractive, it\r\nwould appear, in these new surroundings. Others, very likely, did not\r\nnotice how he never spoke to her, if he could help it; how he never\r\nlooked at her, if he could help it; how they kept far apart, as far as\r\nthe East is from the West, though sleeping under the same roof, and\r\neating at the same table, and constantly together morning, noon, and\r\nnight. Others did not notice all these things, but Mell did.\r\n\r\n\"He despises me,\" sobbed Mell in the darkness of her own chamber,\r\nsmothering her sobs in her own pillow. \"Once he loved, and now he\r\ndespises me!\"\r\n\r\nBetter go to sleep, Mell; tears cannot wash away stern facts, and what\r\ngood would it do now, if he did love you?\r\n\r\nThe other guest has come; the one of whom Jerome had spoken. It is the\r\nHonorable Archibald Pendergast, who is middle-aged, well-fed, and\r\nsomewhat portly, who has big round shoulders and a jolly way of\r\nlooking at things, who bellows out his words with a broad accent, and\r\nsays, Aw! aw! with tremendous effect; who wears his whiskers _à la\r\nmanière Anglaise_, as befits a man proud of his British ancestry and\r\nhis English ways. This great man's marvellous wealth and honors, and\r\nincalculable influence in national councils, and stupendous grandeur\r\nof future prospects, carry everything before him--at the Bigge House,\r\nand everywhere else.\r\n\r\nAdapting herself with versatile cleverness, to these prevailing\r\nconditions in her unaccustomed environment, Mell's conception of modes\r\nand manners expanded day by day, and she began to see plainly a good\r\nmany objects only dimly discerned before.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think,\" remarked she, quite innocently to Rube, the day after\r\nthe great man's advent, \"that Mr. Devonhough admires the Senator as\r\nmuch as the rest of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't wonder!\"\r\n\r\nRube looked knowing and laughed.\r\n\r\n\"If he was as badly stuck on you as he appears to be on Clara, _I_\r\nwouldn't admire him either!\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Mell, \"is Jerome?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, certainly. Didn't you know that? I thought you did. They are in\r\nthe same interesting predicament as ourselves. Only Clara won't\r\nannounce, because she wants to keep up to the last minute her good\r\ntimes with other men. I don't see how Devonhough stands it, and I'm\r\nawfully glad you're not that sort of a girl!\"\r\n\r\n\"How long?\" asked not-that-sort-of-a-girl, trying to steady her voice,\r\ntrying to maintain her rôle of a disinterested inquirer.\r\n\r\n\"How long have they been engaged!\" repeated Rube. \"Let me see--Six\r\nmonths at least.\"\r\n\r\n\"Six months!\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem surprised, Mell.\" He turned his glance full upon her.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" said she, pulling herself to rights. \"I was only\r\nthinking that you ought to be willing to wait as long as that.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I would; as many years, for that matter, if there was any good\r\nreason why I should. But there is not; not one, and so, Mell--\"\r\n\r\n\"Six months!\" ejaculated Mell, in the privacy of her own room. \"So all\r\nthe while he lay at my feet he was engaged to Clara Rutland!\"\r\n\r\nMell began to understand Jerome's difficulties.\r\n\r\nLater on she saw clearly some other things. Clara is fond of Jerome,\r\nand would gladly, for that reason, marry him; but she is likewise\r\nattracted by the mighty Senator's wealth, and national importance, and\r\nEnglish ancestry, and future expectations; and for such reasons leans\r\nmatrimonially towards the Honorable Archibald, who is thirty years\r\nolder than Jerome, but thirty years richer and thirty years greater.\r\nBetween two fires Clara meanwhile keeps to the letter of the law with\r\nJerome, and holds out in ambuscade _le pot au lait_ to the Honorable\r\nArchibald.\r\n\r\nA closer acquaintance with the interior circuit of these unwanted\r\nsurroundings, so delicately refined, so distinctly aristocratic, so\r\nfar above her own poor world, and yet withal, so unsatisfying and so\r\n\"over-charged with surfeiting,\" developed to Mell the startling fact\r\nthat a life spent in incessant amusement not only soon ceases to\r\namuse, but becomes, in process of time, a devouring conflict with\r\n_ennui_. She recalled with a sense of wondering comprehension the Arab\r\nproverb: \"All sunshine makes the desert.\"\r\n\r\nAnother thing, these women at ease, with nothing in the world to do,\r\nMell was thunderstruck to discover, were the hardest worked people she\r\nhad ever known, striving each on a daily battle-ground of dawdling,\r\ndressing, and pleasure. Seeking after some personal end, some empty\r\nhonor, or some favorite phantom just out of reach. What bickering and\r\nstrife; what small conspiracies; what canker at the roots and stunting\r\nin the fruit; what Guelph and Ghibbeline factions in the midst of all\r\nthis music, and dancing, and laughter! The same amount of time spent\r\nin a good cause, Mell's long head could not but realize, would ease\r\nthe rack, plant many a blade of corn, staunch many a bleeding wound,\r\nwipe the death drops from many a ghastly brow, lift up heaps of fallen\r\nheroes prone on stony plains, and plant the standard of the cross on\r\nmany a benighted shore. Outside, Mell had yearned towards this\r\nstronghold of the rich, as a place where there was plenty of room for\r\ngrowth and happiness: inside, she discovered with astonishment and a\r\ngroan, that there was plenty of room there for dullness and\r\nunhappiness as well. Idleness without repose, leisure and no ease,\r\ntears and no time to shed them--on every side, and unexpected dry-rot\r\nin the substance of things, she had pictured to her own fancy as fair,\r\nand only fair.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" interrogated Mell of her conscious Ego, \"if not here, where\r\ndwelleth content?\"\r\n\r\nMayhap, Mell, upon the rock where the hawks nest, or in that haven\r\nwhere the roving wind hideth its tired self for rest. Somewhere, but\r\nnever among the haunts of men. The deep hath its treasures, and there\r\nare treasures of the mine; the mind hath its treasures, and there are\r\ntreasures of store; but content is the golden treasure, hardest of all\r\nto find, and when found hardest to keep.\r\n\r\nOne night there was a ball, and the social lights of Pudney and\r\nCragmore, and the capital of the State itself, turned out in full\r\nforce. The Bigge House was crammed to its utmost capacity.\r\n\r\nDressing early, Mell left her room to other guests, in various stages\r\nof evening toilet, and descending to the first floor, looked about her\r\nfor some quiet spot where, for a time, she could hide herself and her\r\ntumultuous thoughts. The large reception room was dimly lighted as\r\nyet, and empty apparently. Glad to find it so, she walked in, and\r\nstanding between the long pier-glasses, a tapering column draped in\r\ntulle clouds, took a full-length, back and front inspection of her own\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nNow this dainty rustic maiden, as we have seen, looked at when framed\r\nin a high-necked, long-sleeved, simple morning-gown, made a sweet\r\npicture for any eye; but it was, in some respects, a tame presentation\r\ncompared to this gorgeously arrayed being, bedecked in flowers and a\r\nlow corsage, with marble shoulders, shapely throat, alabaster neck and\r\nrounded arms, bewilderingly displayed, cunningly concealed. This\r\nfairy-like being cannot be a _bona fide_ woman; she is more likely a\r\nstudy from Reynolds or Gainsborough, who has stepped out of canvas and\r\na gilt frame on the wall there, merely to delight the living eye and\r\ninflame the fumes of vital fancy.\r\n\r\nNot long, however, whether sprite or woman, did she pose there in\r\nadmiration of her own face and figure. For, truth to tell, they have\r\nboth become hateful in the girl's own sight. Her fair face looks to\r\nherself no longer as a fresh-gathered blossom sparkling with dew, as\r\nthe ethereal interpreter of a woman's pure soul, blameless and serene.\r\nMuch more does it look, to her own acute sensibilities, as a painted\r\nmask, put on for hard service; always in place, always properly\r\nadjusted, proof against attack, but every little loophole needing to\r\nbe defended at every point. A mask very troublesome to wear, but not\r\nupon any account to be discarded, since it concealed the discordance\r\nof a secret love and the clanking of a chain.\r\n\r\nBut now, to-night, in this empty room, in this deep silence and\r\nblessed solitude, where there is no eye to see, no ear to hear, she\r\nwill throw off for one thankful moment the ugly, hateful thing. She\r\nwill allow the dejected visage to fitly portray the dejected mind; she\r\nwill breathe freely once more, and sigh and sigh, and moan and moan,\r\nand wring her hands in uncontrollable agony; and, ignoring the fact\r\nthat the heaviest part of her trouble is of her own making, wonder why\r\nshe had ever been born for such as this.\r\n\r\nHope is entirely dead in Mell's heart. Transplanted out of the lowly\r\nvalley of her own birth to the mountain-tops of her soul's desire, she\r\nfeels as lonely as we might imagine the spirit of Greek art, set down\r\nin a modern world. Turn whatever way she would, there was but one fate\r\nfor her--martyrdom. If she did not marry Rube, she would be a martyr\r\nin her own humble home; if she did marry him, she would be a martyr in\r\nhis more pretentious one; and there was not as great a difference as\r\nshe had thought between the air in the valley and the air on the\r\nmountain-top. It is the lungs which breathe, and not the air inhaled,\r\nmost at issue, and a martyr is a martyr anywhere, the social type\r\nbeing hardly less excruciating to undergo than others more quickly\r\nended.\r\n\r\nPitiful in the extreme are such thoughts in a young mind; pitiful such\r\nmanifestations of suffering in one too young to suffer.\r\n\r\nHow the people upstairs would be surprised if they could see her! How\r\nthe Honorable Archibald, who liked things jolly, begawd! who thought\r\nall evidence of feeling bad form, you know; who believed, root and\r\nbranch, in British stoicism, even in the jaws of death; how he would\r\nadvise her in a spirit of friendliness and a well-bred way, not aw to\r\nmake a blawsted dolt of herself--if he only knew. Fortunately, he did\r\nnot know; fortunately, nobody knew.\r\n\r\nNobody?\r\n\r\nThen who or what is that creature in semblance of man, in attitude of\r\ndeepest thought, with folded arms and hanging head, darkly shadowed,\r\ndimly seen, scarcely discernible in the embrasure of the window over\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nSpirit or man? If a man, he might be a dead one for all the noise he\r\nmakes--only a dead man was never known before to use his eyes in such\r\na lively manner, or his ears to such good purpose, or to betray so\r\ndeep an interest in a living woman, even in a ball dress.\r\n\r\nMell did not look towards him, did not know he was there; yet, on a\r\nsudden, as if from some inward sense of vigilance rather than any\r\nextraneous source of knowledge, her pulses strangely fluttered--she\r\nbecame aware that she was not in reality alone. _How_, in the absence\r\nof visual impression, we can only say by an instinct as unaccountable\r\nas the phenomenon of sound waves which excite wire vibrations.\r\n\r\nShe was mysteriously imbued with another presence, if such a thing is\r\npossible, and in all the world there was but one who could so clothe\r\nthe circumambient air in his own personality.\r\n\r\nThat one was Jerome Devonhough. Perceiving she now knew he was there,\r\nhe got up and came towards her.\r\n\r\nMell did not look at him; she looked upon the floor. He looked\r\nstraight at her, and looked so long and hard, and with a gaze so fixed\r\nand steady, that he seemed to be slowly absorbing her very being into\r\nhis own entity.\r\n\r\nWhen this became intolerable, the fairy-like apparition in tulle,\r\nwrestling with the situation, on a war footing with her own feelings,\r\nlifted from a glowing face those _lapis lazuli_ eyes of hers--pure\r\nstones liquified by soul action--to his face and dropped them. In one\r\nswift turn of those eyes she had taken in as much of that stern, cold,\r\naccusing face as she could well bear. But there was nothing on it she\r\nhad not expected to see. She knew the unrelenting disdain of that\r\nproud nature for what is stained, unworthy, unwomanly, as well as she\r\nknew its strength to esteem, its gift to exalt, its power to bless.\r\n\r\nAnd to look into a once loving face now grown cold, and to find there\r\nno longer an indulgent smile nor approving aspect, is not an\r\nexperience to be coveted, even by the happiest.\r\n\r\n\"You are enjoying it, I hope,\" said at length a low mocking voice.\r\n\r\n\"Enjoying it!\" retorted plucky Mell, \"of course I am enjoying it! Why\r\nshouldn't I? I am probably enjoying it as much as you are!\"\r\n\r\n\"More, I hope. I, for one, never did enjoy being miserable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, miserable!\" exclaimed Mell, in a lively tone. His misery appeared\r\nto put her in the highest spirits. \"Going to marry a rich girl and\r\nfeeling miserable over it, how is that? You ought to be as happy,\r\nalmost, as I am!\"\r\n\r\n\"The happiness which needs to be so extolled,\" replied Jerome, with a\r\nsardonic laugh, \"rests on a slim foundation. Mine is of a different\r\nstamp. It leads me to envy the very worms as they crawl under my\r\nfeet. Even a worm is free to go where his wishes lead him--even a\r\nworm is free to find an easy death and quick, when life becomes\r\ninsupportable.\"\r\n\r\nMell pressed her hand upon her heart, beating so fast--that pent-up\r\nheart in a troubled breast, which rose and fell as a storm-tossed\r\nvessel amid tempestuous seas.\r\n\r\n\"You cannot blame me for it,\" said she wildly. \"You slighted me, you\r\ntrifled with me, you goaded me to it! I would do it again; if need\r\nbe!\"\r\n\r\n\"Once has been enough,\" Jerome told her, in sadness. Speech was an\r\neffort to him; when a man regards some treasure, once his own now lost\r\nto him, he thinks much, but he has little to say. That little, nine\r\ntimes out of ten, would better be left unsaid. Jerome felt it so; for\r\na long time he said nothing more--he only continued to look at the\r\nwoman he had lost.\r\n\r\nShe continued to contemplate the floor, until those polished boards,\r\nwaxed in readiness for gay dancers' feet, became to her a sorry sight\r\nindeed, and a source of nervous irritation. When their glances\r\nencountered again, hers was full of passionate entreaty, his of\r\ninflamed regret.\r\n\r\n\"I have a question to put to you,\" he broke forth, harshly. \"What\r\nright have you to marry Rube Rutland, loving me?\"\r\n\r\n\"The same right that you have to marry Clara Rutland, loving me!\"\r\n\r\nThis turned the tables. Now Jerome's glance was riveted upon those\r\npolished boards, and she looked at him. She had not had so good a look\r\nat him in a long time, and her two eyes had never been eyes enough to\r\ntake in as much of him as her heart craved.\r\n\r\n\"At least,\" said Jerome, regaining his composure and holding up his\r\nhead, \"this much may be said for me. My contract with her was made in\r\ngood faith. I liked her well enough--I loved no one else--it was all\r\nright until I met you. My soul is as a pure white dove in this matter,\r\ncompared to yours! And these bonds of mine, they hang but by a single\r\nthread. Our future would have been assured but for your broken\r\nfaith.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mine? It is all _your_ fault, not mine! Had you trusted me, as a man\r\nought to trust the woman he loves, all might have been well with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"All would have been well with us had you trusted _me_, as a woman\r\nshould trust the man she loves. Did I not ask you so to trust me?\r\nGreat God! Mellville, could I conceive that you would stake your\r\nfuture happiness--our future happiness, on the paltry issues of a\r\nfoot-race? That whole day my mind was full of projects for bringing\r\nabout a happy termination to all our troubles. I could have done it! I\r\nwould have done it! But now!\"\r\n\r\nLashed into fury by a vivid conception of his own wrongs, brought\r\nabout, as he chose to consider, through her treachery alone, Jerome\r\nturned upon her angrily:\r\n\r\n\"Let me tell you one thing! You shall not marry Rube Rutland!\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I not?\"\r\n\r\nMell laughed--not one of her musical laughs. Now that she was fairly\r\nin for it, she rather enjoyed this fencing match with Jerome.\r\nHitherto, she had always by stress of circumstances, acted upon the\r\ndefensive with him; now she could assert her mastery.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I not? How will you prevent it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will open his eyes. I will tell him you do not care a rap for\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will tell him that? Very well. I will _swear_ to him that I do.\r\nWhom will he believe? _Not you!_\"\r\n\r\nHer words, her manner, were exasperating, and they were intended to\r\nbe exasperating. That cool and systematic self-control which\r\ncharacterized Jerome, had more than aroused a feeling of rebellious\r\nprotest in the girl's impetuous nature. If she could break him up a\r\nlittle--\r\n\r\n\"_I say you shall not marry him!_\" The words were not loudly spoken,\r\nbut they were the utterances of a man much in earnest. \"Rather than\r\nsee you his wife I would gladly see you dead!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no doubt! But let me tell you, sir, I do not propose to die to\r\nplease you! I propose to please myself by becoming the wife of Rube\r\nRutland!\"\r\n\r\nThis was too much, even for Jerome.\r\n\r\n\"You heartless, cruel, wicked woman!\"\r\n\r\nWith a single stride he reached her side; he shook his finger rudely\r\nin her face; nay, in a frenzy of mad passion he did worse than\r\nthat--he took hold of the wayward creature herself and shook her with\r\nsuch violence that those heavy coils of hair, upon which she had\r\nexpended so much time and pains, loosened and fell about her in a\r\nreckless loveliness beyond the reach of art.\r\n\r\n\"Woman, do you know what you are doing? Do you know that you are\r\nplaying with dangerous implements? toying with men's passions?\r\ndallying with men's souls?\"\r\n\r\nIt is safe to say, Mell had never had such a shaking up, however\r\nfrequent the occasions when she had deserved it.\r\n\r\nThis unconventional usage on the part of Jerome, a man who wore\r\nself-possession and correct manners as an every day coat of mail, not\r\nonly surprised Mell, but terrified and subdued her. In undertaking to\r\n\"break up\" Jerome by stirring up the green-eyed monster, Mell had\r\nneglected to take into account the well-established fact, that no\r\njealous man stands long upon ceremony. Panting for breath, she awoke\r\nunpleasantly to a full comprehension of a madman's possibilities, and\r\nignoring all those impassioned inquiries with which he had interlarded\r\nthe severer measures of corporeal punishment, she remarked in a spirit\r\nof meekness and a very faint voice:\r\n\r\n\"Jerome, let me go, please; you are hurting me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how much more you are hurting me,\" said Jerome, harshly.\r\n\r\nHe released her, however, and felt ashamed. No man with real manliness\r\nin him, but does feel ashamed after he has hurt a woman. She may have\r\ndeserved it, and yet he feels ashamed.\r\n\r\nOne would think that now after this ungentlemanly conduct on Jerome's\r\npart, Mell the high spirited will not only be full of a tremendous\r\nindignation, but be willing, and more than willing, to give him up for\r\ngood and all.\r\n\r\nHow little you know a woman, you who think that! A harmless man never\r\ndoes anywhere so little harm as in a woman's affections. The rod of\r\nempire sways the world and a woman's mind--all women, to a great or\r\nless degree; all women are sisters.\r\n\r\nIn other words, it is very necessary for a man to be capable of\r\nshaking up a woman for past offences, and present naughtiness, when\r\nshe needs it, or else he must make up his mind to take a back seat and\r\ngive up the supremacy. Some of the fair sex never come to terms\r\nwithout a shaking--there may be one or two, here and there among them,\r\nwho never come to terms, even with a shaking!\r\n\r\nMell did not belong to this small minority; she was completely\r\nsubdued. Contrite, and submissive, she now approached her audacious\r\nantagonist; approached him timidly, where he stood a little apart, and\r\nwith his back turned to her, feeling, as we have said, quite ashamed\r\nof himself, and said gently:\r\n\r\n\"Jerome, I will break with Rube if you will break with Clara.\"\r\n\r\n\"An honorable man cannot leave a woman in the lurch,\" answered he, in\r\na manner indicative of a strong protest under the existing law.\r\n\r\n\"And how about an honorable woman?\" interrogated Mell.\r\n\r\n\"She can lie, and lie, and still be honorable,\" he informed her with\r\nfierce irony.\r\n\r\n\"Then you expect me to----\"\r\n\r\n\"I do! I confidently expect you to do it, and at once. Break with him,\r\nand have a little patience with me, until Clara gets the Honorable\r\nArchibald taut on the line, and awakens to the fact that she loves me\r\nstill--but only as a brother! It is coming--it is sure to come, and\r\nbefore long.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the meantime,\" remarked Mell, with a peculiar expression, \"what's\r\nthe use of hurting Rube's feelings?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gods and angels, listen!\" exclaimed her companion, in overwhelming\r\nindignation. \"The question then has narrowed down to the getting of a\r\nhusband without regard to any body's feelings--save Rube. His are not\r\nto be hurt until you can hurt them with impunity! You are bound to\r\nhold on to _him_ until you secure _me_, beyond a peradventure! That is\r\nyour little game, Mell, is it? Out upon you! Oh, unfortunate man that\r\nI am, to have fallen into the hands of a woman who is particular as to\r\nthe fit of her ball dress, but has no preference when it comes to a\r\nhusband; who has the aspect of a goddess, but the easy principles of a\r\nDelilah; who is, in fact, not a genuine woman at all, with a heart and\r\na soul in her, but a man-eating monster, seeking prey--a shark in\r\nwoman's clothing, ready to take into the matrimonial clutch, and\r\nswallow at a single gulp, me, if you can get me; if not me, Rube; if\r\nnot Rube, any other eligible creature in man's guise, whether\r\ndescended from a molecule in the coral, or a tadpole in the spawn:\r\nwhether a swine of Epicurus, or an ape just from Barbary! Shame upon\r\nyou, woman! Shame! Shame!\"\r\n\r\nRestive under these severe strictures, Mell had made several\r\nineffectual attempts to put a stop to them, but her appealing gestures\r\nimplored in vain. Finding he would not desist, she bit her lips in\r\ngreat agitation, and crimsoned violently.\r\n\r\n\"You are the most impertinent man in existence!\" she informed him\r\npetulantly, when he had done.\r\n\r\n\"That's right, Mell,\" he answered. \"Turn red--turn red to the tips of\r\nyour eyelashes! It is the most hopeful sign I have yet seen.\r\nMellville, look at me.\"\r\n\r\nShe raised to him wonderingly her wondrously beautiful eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I have been asking myself how I could love you so well, a woman who\r\ncould condescend to sail under false colors; who knows how to stoop\r\nfrom her high estate, and trick, and juggle, and blind; who has set a\r\ntrap to catch a mouse, and victimizes her prey; who has spread her\r\ntoils to obtain a husband under false pretences. I have asked myself\r\nmany times, 'how can you love that woman?' I have wished that I loved\r\nyou less--that I loved you not at all! And I would crush it out--this\r\nunspeakable tenderness, which shields and defends your image in my\r\nheart--crush it out, beat it down, tear it into tatters, grind it into\r\ndust under the heel of an inexorable resolve, but that I believe, but\r\nthat I _know_, Mell, that there is something within you deeper,\r\nbetter, worthier! 'Truth is God,' and the woman who is true in all\r\nthings is a part of Divinity. But what of the woman who is false where\r\nshe ought to be true? Let her hide her head in the presence of devils!\r\nBe true, then, Mell, be earnest! This frivolous trifling with life's\r\nmost serious concerns shows so small in a being born to a noble\r\nheritage! It is only excusable in a natural _niais_, or a woman\r\nunendowed with a soul.\"\r\n\r\nJerome here paused. After a moment spent in thought, he approached his\r\ncompanion very near, and in a voice of passionate tenderness resumed:\r\n\r\n\"My darling! you can never know what hours of torment, what days of\r\nsuffering, this conduct of yours has cost me. But I believe you have\r\nerred more through thoughtlessness, and a pardonable feeling of\r\nresentment--more through love turned into madness, than any settled\r\ndetermination to do wrong. But now let it go no further. Hasten to set\r\nyourself right with Rube. No matter whether you and I are destined to\r\nbe happy in each other's love or not; at all hazards be true to the\r\nimmortal within you. Promise me to undo the mischief you have done;\r\npromise me to be a good, true, useful woman, thinking more of duty\r\nthan your own interest and pleasure. The world is overstocked with\r\nbutterflies, but it needs good women, and I want you to be one of\r\nthem--the best! My darling, you will promise me?\"\r\n\r\nMell was much affected; she hung her head and her bosom heaved.\r\n\r\n\"Do you hesitate?\" cried Jerome, mistaking her silence. \"Promise me,\r\nMell, I implore, I beseech you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Theatricals?\" asked a voice in the doorway.\r\n\r\nIt was Rube.\r\n\r\n\"Rehearsing your parts?\" he again inquired, coming in.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Jerome. \"For are we not all players upon a stage?\"\r\n\r\n\"And what play have they decided upon?\" next questioned the\r\nunsuspecting Rube, who, carrying no concealed weapons himself, was\r\nnever on the lookout for concealed weapons on others.\r\n\r\n\"I don't recall the name,\" said Jerome. \"Do you, Miss Creecy? It is\r\n'Lover's Quarrel,' or some such twaddle, I think.\"\r\n\r\nMell thought it was something of that kind, but she furthermore\r\nexpressed the opinion that it would be well-nigh impossible to get it\r\nup in time for the delectation of the Honorable Archibald.\r\n\r\n\"Which is no great pity,\" declared the off-hand Rube; \"I wish he'd\r\ntake himself elsewhere to be delectated.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt as to Rube's preferences for a brother-in-law;\r\nwhich, however, did not take away from the awkwardness of this remark.\r\nNot suspicious, neither was Rube obtuse; he noted a singular\r\ncontraction on Jerome's brow, he noted a strange confusion in Mell's\r\nmanner, and he put it all down to his own blundering tongue, which was\r\nalways placing his best friend either in a false or in an annoying\r\nposition before Mell. Out of these considerations he made haste to\r\nsubjoin:\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Mellville, you should have seen Devonhough how splendidly he\r\nacquitted himself in our class plays at college!\"\r\n\r\nThis was a pure offering from friendship's store. Honest Rube, with\r\nhis fine open countenance all aglow with enthusiasm for his friend and\r\njoy in the presence of the woman he loved, looked the archetype of\r\nhopeful young manhood, untouched, as yet, by sorrow or mistrust.\r\nRegarded from an architectural standpoint, he had the sublime\r\nsimplicity and dignity of the Doric, which was just wherein he\r\ndiffered from Jerome, who was a Corinthian column, delicately\r\nchiselled, ornately moulded.\r\n\r\nMell remarked, in reply to this expression of lively admiration from\r\nRube, that she wished she could have seen Mr. Devonhough--or\r\nsomething. Mr. Devonhough, with the expression of a man whose\r\nself-respect will not admit of his bearing much more, said with an\r\nimpatient \"Pshaw,\" that she needn't wish to have seen him, that this\r\ngood acting of his was all in Rube's eye, and nowhere else; that he\r\nhated an actor, and that he never would act another part himself, as\r\nlong as he lived, not to oblige anybody, and so help him God!\r\n\r\nAfter which, shadowed by clouds, beleaguered with dark thoughts, with\r\nsombre fires of jealousy smoldering in his eye, and war-hounds of\r\nanxiety gnawing at his vitals, he abruptly turned and left the\r\nroom--not with his usual deliberation.\r\n\r\nAnd still Rube saw nothing.\r\n\r\n\"He's real cut up,\" said the sympathetic Rube, looking commiseratingly\r\nafter the friend of his bosom. \"And all for what? Because a woman\r\nnever seems certain of her own mind. When judgment overtakes you women\r\nwhat is to become of you all, anyhow--eh, Mell?\"\r\n\r\nMell could hardly say; and Rube, dismissing Jerome from his mind for\r\nthe present, found other occupation. He had never seen Mell before in\r\nfull dress. He addressed himself _con amore_, and exclusively, for a\r\ntime, to the study of structural feminity and those marvels of nature\r\npresented to the eye of the earnest investigator, in the shape of a\r\nwell-formed woman on the outside of a ball dress.\r\n\r\nDuring this process Rube's sensations were indefinable.\r\n\r\nMell, preoccupied in thoughts of her own, hears, at length, his voice\r\ndreamily, as a sound from afar, and looks up irritably to see, for the\r\nhundredth time, how coarse of fibre Rube is compared to Jerome.\r\n\r\nShe resents the unpalatable fact. She resents something else, and\r\nmakes a very vigorous but unavailing effort to gain her freedom.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot understand,\" playfully remonstrated Rube, and with arms\r\nimmovable, \"why so simple a matter disturbs you so much. You are as\r\nwhite as a sheet, you are quivering like a leaf, your hands are icy\r\ncold, and what is it all about?\"\r\n\r\n\"I told you never, _never_ to do that!\" cried out Mell, in an agony of\r\npassionate protest.\r\n\r\nEven the most cold-blooded among mortals finds the caress of a person\r\nnot dear to them offensive; but take the woman of emotional nature,\r\nexquisitely sensitive in all matters of feeling, and to such the touch\r\nof unloved lips is worse than a plague spot.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you hear me? I cannot bear it! I am not used to it!\"\r\n\r\nThere was something more than maidenly coyness in her tone; there was\r\nmental anguish, and a downright shade of anger. We wonder Rube did not\r\ndetect it. But you know, gentle reader, how it is. There are so many\r\nthings all around and about us which we do not hear and see, because\r\nwe are intent upon other matters, and are not looking for them. With\r\nsuch feelings, in that dreadful moment Mell would rather have\r\nsubmitted to a dozen stripes from Jerome, than one single caress from\r\nRube--her future husband, bear you in mind! the being by whose side\r\nshe expected to pass the rest of her days. Poor Mell! If getting up in\r\nthe world requires self-torture, self-immolation such as this,\r\nwouldn't it be better, think you, not to get up? Wouldn't it be\r\nbetter, in the long run, for every woman, situated as you are, to use\r\na dagger, and thereby not only settle her future, but get clean out of\r\na world where such sufferings are necessary? There can't be any other\r\nworld much worse, judged by your present sensations.\r\n\r\nBut Rube, as we have said, did not hear that piteous wail of a woman\r\ncoercing her flesh and blood, the frame of her mind, the bent of her\r\nsoul. She was his own, and no words could tell, how he loved her. If a\r\nman cannot lawfully kiss his own wife, or one so near to being his own\r\nwife, it is a hard case, truly. That one little slip \"'twixt the cup\r\nand the lip,\" which has played such havoc in men's expectations, from\r\nthe first beginnings of time to the present moment, did not enter into\r\nRube's calculations, or his thoughts.\r\n\r\nHe was in a playful and a loving mood. He tightened his clasp upon\r\nher, he chucked her under the chin, he pinched her cheek, he patted\r\nthose sunny locks of hers and smiled down into that fair face, _faire\r\nles yeux doux_, and babbled to her in lover-language, not unlike the\r\n\"pitty, pitty ittle shing\" upon which we linguistically feed helpless\r\ninfancy, as little witting the possible sufferings of the child under\r\nsuch an infliction, as Rube did Mell's.\r\n\r\n\"Now truly, Mell,\" asked Rube, \"did you never let any other fellow\r\nkiss you--never? not once?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" said Mell, emphatic and indignant. \"_Never!_ And _you_ shouldn't\r\nnow, if I could help myself! Do go away! I tell you I'm not used to\r\nsuch as this!\"\r\n\r\nShe was almost ready to cry.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing was immensely amusing and entertaining to Rube, and\r\nwhile he laughed, he could also understand how it might come hard on a\r\ngirl, at first, to feel the bloom despoiled on her chaste lips.\r\n\r\n\"But you will get used to it after awhile,\" he assured her, with a\r\nquiet smile. \"My word for it, you will! I will see to it that you do.\r\nThere now, my pretty one (just what Jerome called her) sweet,\r\nfrightened bird, why ruffle your beautiful plumage against these bars?\r\nThey are made of adamant; but only be quiet and take to them kindly\r\nand they will not derange a single feather. You are exquisitely lovely\r\nto-night! You will intoxicate all beholders! And have you been\r\nthinking of that blissful time when we are going to get married?\"\r\n\r\nShe had, of course; but what made him so impatient? Couldn't he wait\r\nuntil she got back home? Rube could, certainly; but only on\r\nconditions, and those conditions would come very hard on a girl not\r\nused to a lover's kiss, and who objected to a lover's fondling, unless\r\nshe managed well.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Mell could manage well. She could have managed the\r\ndiversified attractions of a dime museum if necessary.\r\n\r\n\"And before he shall desecrate my lips again,\" Mell vowed to herself,\r\nunder her breath, \"I will perish by my own hands!\"\r\n\r\nAh! Mell, Mell, you should have thought of that before you sold\r\nyourself!\r\n\r\nAt daylight she crawled upstairs and into bed. The ball had been a\r\ngreat success and she its reigning belle. Women like her, with such a\r\nform, with such a face, with such glory of hair and wealth of high\r\nspirits and physical exuberance, work like a spell in a ball-room.\r\nThere was something bewildering in the gleam of her eye; something\r\nintoxicating in the turn of her neck, the flow of her garments.\r\n\r\nShe had danced, to please Rube, more than once with Jerome. It was\r\nwhile the two were floating together in that delirious rapture of\r\nconscious nearness, to which the conventional waltz gives pretext\r\nand the stamp of propriety, and while their senses swayed to the\r\nrhythmic measure of the sweetest music they had ever heard, that\r\nMell looked up meltingly into her partner's face--a face absorbed,\r\nexcited, yet darkly set with a certain sternness which Mell fully\r\nunderstood--looked up and said to him: \"Only wait until I get back\r\nhome.\" Simple words indeed, and holding little meaning for those\r\nwho heard; but they gave a new lease of life to Jerome. He answered\r\nback in a whisper, certain words. And now it only remained for\r\nClara Rutland to accept the Honorable Archibald Pendergast and the\r\nhappiness of two loving hearts would be assured.\r\n\r\nThe ball is over, gone, past, never to come back again, with its waltz\r\nmelody, its ravishing rhyme without reason, its sweet smelling\r\nflowers, its foam-crested wine, its outlying joy, its underlying\r\npathos, its hidden sweetness, and its secret pain. For, there never\r\nwas a ball yet which had its lights and not its shadows; which did not\r\nhave some heavy foot among its light fantastic toes; some heavy heart\r\namong its gallant men and beautiful women.\r\n\r\nMell lives it over in the pale dawn. It made her blood curdle and her\r\nflesh creep to think of those two men. What was she going to do with\r\nthem--Rube and Jerome? How was it all to end?\r\n\r\nHorrible it would be to break off with Rube, more horrible still not\r\nto do so. Fearful it would be to tell him the truth--the whole truth.\r\nBut that was what Jerome expected her to do, what she ought to do.\r\n\r\nThose words of his were burned into her memory with fire. He wanted\r\nher to become a good, true, useful woman, and be no longer a\r\nbutterfly.\r\n\r\nHe had called her 'my darling.' He had called her so twice. He loved\r\nher just as much as ever. In fact, he loved her more; for the man is\r\nnot living who does not love a woman more when he finds out somebody\r\nelse loves her as well as he.\r\n\r\nShe was quite decided, and Jerome was undeniably right; there was but\r\none honorable course for her to follow. Even if Jerome married Clara,\r\nand she herself never had another offer of marriage (she never would\r\nhave another such as Rube) how sweet it would be, even in a life of\r\nloneliness, to be free, to be able to maintain the dignity and the\r\nprobity of her womanhood, to be able to throw aside the despicable\r\npart of a double-dealer and a deceiver, to be able to feel that she\r\nhad been worthy of Jerome though never his.\r\n\r\nThus Mell felt when she stretched her weary limbs on that silken couch\r\nof ease in the dim morning light, and turned her face to the wall, and\r\nclosed her eyes, and thought of that exquisite moment, when from\r\nJerome's shoulder, conventionally used, she had proffered to him the\r\nolive branch of peace and had caught the heavenly beams of that smile\r\nwhich restored her to his favor. With the bewitchment of this smile\r\nreflected upon the fair lineaments of her own face, Mell fell into\r\nthat sweet rest, which remains even for the people who flirt.\r\n\r\nBut how different everything always seems the day after the ball!\r\n\r\nIt must be the gas-light in the ball-room, it must be the sunlight in\r\nthe day-time, which makes all the difference. Sunlight is the\r\neffulgence of a God, and lights up Reality; gas-light is a ray kindled\r\nby the feeble hand of man to brighten the unreal--a delusion and a\r\nsnare.\r\n\r\nThe absurd fancies of a ball-room hide their fantastic fumes in the\r\nbroad daylight.\r\n\r\nComing down to a six o'clock dinner--finding Rube at the bottom of\r\nthe stairs to attend upon her--finding the assembled company,\r\nincluding the Honorable Archibald, half-famished and yet kept\r\nwaiting for their dinner, until the future mistress of the Bigge\r\nHouse put in an appearance, Mell began more clearly to estimate her\r\nown importance--her own, but through Rube. Her beauty, her wit,\r\nthey were her own; but they had availed her little before her\r\nbetrothment to Rube. Especially was she impressed with this aspect of\r\nthe case, when, hanging upon his arm, she entered the brilliant\r\ndrawing-room to become immediately the bright particular star of the\r\nsocial heavens, the cynosure of all eyes; to be immediately\r\nsurrounded by flattering sycophants; to be pelted with well-bred\r\nraillery for her tardiness and sleepy-headedness; to be bowed down\r\nto and reverenced and waited upon and courted and admired by these\r\nhigh-born people--she, old Jacob Creecy's daughter, but the future\r\nwife of the young master of this lordly domain.\r\n\r\nAnd Jerome expected her to give all this up--did he? And to give it up\r\nwhether he gave up Clara, or not? Jerome was simply crazy--and she\r\nwould be a good deal crazier herself before he caught her doing it!\r\nMell still has an eye to the main chance. Mell still \"tuck arter her\r\nole daddy!\"\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe summer wanes. The ripened grain is harvested and the chaff falling\r\nfrom the sheaves on the threshing floor; the patient teams sniff the\r\nfirst cool breeze and put their shoulders to the wheel; the wagons are\r\nheaped in corn; the fields grow white for the picking. In the windings\r\nof green valleys yellow leaves and red play fast and loose amid the\r\ngreen, and go fluttering to the ground; the deer stalks abroad; glad\r\nhunters blow their horns, and the unleashed hounds are joyful at the\r\nscent of noble prey.\r\n\r\nTwice has the moon changed, and Mell is still at the Bigge House,\r\nshowing up amid its polished refinements, as a choice bit of Corian\r\nfaïence contrasted with cut-glass. Every day she spoke of going, but\r\nevery day there was some reason why she should not go and should stay.\r\nMrs. Rutland wanted her to stay; and Mell herself, whatever her\r\nmisgivings, whatever her struggles, whatever her trials, wanted, too,\r\non the whole, to stay. Here was a congenial atmosphere of style and\r\nfashion, congenial occupation--or the congenial want of any, endless\r\nvariety of amusement, the hourly excitement of spirited contact with\r\nkindred minds, and no vulgar father and mother to mortify her tender\r\nsensibilities. Here, too, she was in the presence of the one being on\r\nearth she most loved, and even to see him under cold restraint, was\r\nbetter than not to see him at all. Sometimes it happened they sat near\r\neach other for a few blissful seconds; sometimes it was a stolen look\r\ninto each other's eyes; sometimes an accidental touch of the hand when\r\nJerome was initiating the ladies into the ingenious methods of a\r\nfore-overhand stroke or a back-underhand stroke, or the effective\r\nresults of skillful volleying--such casual trifles as these, unnoticed\r\nby others, but more precious to them than \"the golden wedge of\r\nOphir.\"\r\n\r\nSo the days passed on; rainy days, dry days, clear days, cloudy days,\r\nbright days, dark days, every kind of day, and every one of them a\r\nday's march nearer the imperishable day.\r\n\r\n\"There's a messenger outside, Miss Mellville, to say that your father\r\nis sick and wishes you to come home.\"\r\n\r\nJerome, it was, who spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Father sick!\" exclaimed Mell. \"I will go at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"How provoking!\" broke in Mrs. Rutland. \"I wanted you particularly\r\nto-day. Rube, too. Don't you remember he wants you to go to Pudney?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" interrupted Mell hastily. She did not wish Mrs. Rutland to\r\nsay before Jerome what Rube wanted her to go there for. It was to have\r\nher picture taken. \"I am very sorry, but if father is really sick I\r\nought to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rhesus is under saddle,\" said Jerome. \"Shall I ride over and find out\r\njust how he is? I can do so in a very few minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" said Mell, with quick speech and restrained emphasis. Whom would\r\nhe see there? What would he hear? Her mother in an old cotton frock,\r\ntalking bad grammar. And Jerome was so delicate in his tastes, so\r\nfastidious and æsthetic.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Mell, decidedly. \"I'm much obliged, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" interposed Mrs. Rutland, \"I wish you would go, for Rube is not\r\nhere and I've no notion of letting Mell go unless it is necessary.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you say I must not?\" inquired Jerome, addressing Mell and not\r\nmoving.\r\n\r\n\"Go, if Mrs. Rutland wishes it,\" stammered Mell, furiously angry with\r\nherself that she could not utter such commonplace words to him without\r\ngetting all in a tremor. They were all blind, these people, or they\r\nmust have seen, long ago, how it stood with Jerome and herself.\r\n\r\nHe was back in an incredibly short space of time.\r\n\r\n\"I saw your mother,\" Jerome reported. (Great heavens! in her\r\npoke-berry homespun, without a doubt!) \"Your father is quite sick, but\r\nnot dangerously so. He only fancied seeing you, but can wait until\r\nto-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the old man waited, Mell had her pretty face photographed for\r\nRube.\r\n\r\nHe drove her home in the buggy the next morning. Coming in sight of\r\nthe quiet and shade of the old farm-house and recalling, as a\r\nforgotten dream, its honest industry, its homely manners, its sweet\r\nsimplicity, Mell marvelled at her own sensations. Could it be\r\ngladness, this feeling that swept over her at sight of the old home?\r\nYes, it was gladness. Perplexed in mind, heavy at heart, and fretted\r\nto the lowest depths of her soul by this struggle within her, which\r\nseemed to be never ending, Mell was glad to get back into the quietude\r\nof the old farm house after the continuous strain and excitement of\r\nthe past few weeks. The flowers in the little garden stirred gently in\r\nthe breeze; there was a gleam of blue sky above the low roof; birds\r\nchirped softly in the euonymus hedge under the window of her own\r\nlittle room, and the tranquillity and serenity and staidness of the\r\nspot soothed her feverish mind and calmed her feverish spirit. It was\r\nlonely, desolate, mean, and poor, but none the less a refuge from the\r\nstorms of a higher region; from the weariness of pleasure and the\r\nburden of empty enjoyment; from the tiresomeness of being amused, and\r\nthe troublesomeness of seeming to be amused without being; from an\r\necstasy of suffering and an agony of transport; in short, a hoped-for\r\nrefuge from herself and Jerome.\r\n\r\n\"Hurry up, Mell! Hurry up! He's mos' gone!\"\r\n\r\n\"What, mother! You don't mean--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I does, Mell. He was tuck wuss in the night. He won't know ye,\r\nI'm 'fraid.\"\r\n\r\nBut he did, and opening his eyes he smiled faintly, as she hung over\r\nhis ugly face--uglier now, after the ravages of disease, than ever\r\nbefore; dried up by scorching fevers to a semblance of those\r\nparched-up things we see in archæological museums; deeply lined and\r\nseamed and furrowed, as if old Time had never had any other occupation\r\nsince he was a boy but to make marks upon it; uglier than ever, but\r\nwith an expression upon it which had never been there before--that\r\nsolemn dignity which Death gives to the homeliest features.\r\n\r\n\"Father! father!\" sobbed Mell, \"don't die! Don't leave your little\r\nMell! Don't leave me now, when I've just begun to love you as I\r\nought!\"\r\n\r\nHa, Mell! Just begun! He has reached a good old age, and you are a\r\nwoman grown, and you have just begun to love your father! It is too\r\nlate, Mell. He does not need your love now. He is trying to tell you\r\nthat, or something else. Put your ear a little closer.\r\n\r\n\"What did you say, father! Try to tell me again.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he did; she heard every word:\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, little Mell! I ain't gwine ter morteefy ye no mo'!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nA DEAL IN FUTURES.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you fret so much about it?\" asked Rube, sitting beside his\r\npromised wife about a week after the old man was laid to rest. \"You\r\nloved your father, of course, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"There's the point!\" exclaimed Mell. \"I did not love him--not as a\r\nchild ought to love a parent. What did it matter that his looks\r\nwere common and his speech rude? His thoughts were true, his\r\nmotives good, his actions honest, and now I mourn the blindness which\r\nmade me value him, not for what he was, but what he looked to be. In\r\nself-forgetfulness and sacrificing devotion to me he was sublime. He\r\nwent in rags that I might dress above my station; he ate coarse food\r\nthat I might be served with dainties; he worked as a slave that I\r\nmight hold my hands in idleness; and how did I requite him? I was\r\nashamed of him; I held him in contempt. Oh, oh! My, my!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, now,\" remonstrated Rube, trying to stem the torrent of this\r\nlachrymatory deluge, and wondering what had become of all the\r\ncomforting phrases in the English language, that he could not put his\r\ntongue upon one of them. \"Do try to calm yourself, dearest. I know you\r\nare exaggerating the true state of the case, as we are all prone to\r\ndo in moments of self-upbraiding. I never saw you lacking in respect\r\nto him.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's a great many bad things in me you never saw,\" blubbered Mell,\r\nbreaking out afresh.\r\n\r\n\"Dear, dear!\" said Rube, \"I never saw such grief as this!\"\r\n\r\n\"You--are--disgusted, I know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit of it!\" declared Rube; \"just the contrary! I fairly dote on\r\nthe prospect of a wife who is going to cry hard and cut up dreadful\r\nwhen anything happens to a fellow. It kind of makes dying seem sort of\r\neasy. But, come, now; you've cried enough. Let me comfort you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" cried Mell, shrinking away from him. \"If you only knew, you\r\nwould not want to comfort me. I do not deserve a single kind word from\r\nyou. I am unworthy your regard. I am a weak woman, and a wicked one.\r\nOh, Rube! I have not treated you right. That day at the picnic I was\r\nangry with some one else; I was piqued; I did not feel as I made you\r\nthink I felt. I--that is--\"\r\n\r\nHere Mell broke down completely in her disjointed arraignment of self,\r\nthoroughly disconcerted by the young man's change of countenance. His\r\nbreath came quick, a dark cloud overspread his features, and he lost\r\nsomewhat of his ruddy color.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean, then, to say I was but a tool, and the whole thing a lie\r\nand a cheat?\"\r\n\r\nRube's thoughts sped as directly to their mark, as the well-aimed\r\narrow from the bent bow.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be so angry with me,\" prayed Mell, \"please don't! You don't\r\nknow how much I have suffered over it. I say, at that time I thought I\r\ncared for some one else, and so I ought not, in all fairness, to have\r\nencouraged you; but, it is only since father died, that I have been\r\nable to see things in their true light. I have had a false standard of\r\ncharacter, a false measure of worth, a false conception of human aims\r\nand human achievement. Out of the wretchedness of sleepless hours I\r\nhave heard the under-tones of truth: Knowledge is great, but how much\r\ngreater is goodness without knowledge than knowledge without\r\ngoodness!\"\r\n\r\nRube made no reply. He left her side, and, crossing the room, folded\r\nhis arms and looked moodily out of the window. He was very simple in\r\nnature, somewhat slow, sometimes stupid; but loyal and true--true in\r\ngreat things, and no less true in small ones, and as open as the day.\r\n\r\nMell dried her eyes, and glanced at him anxiously. The worst part of\r\nher duty was now over. She began already to feel relieved; she began\r\nalready to know just how she was going to feel in a few minutes more,\r\nthe possessor of a conscience, void of offence before God and man.\r\nThere's nothing like it--a good conscience.\r\n\r\n\"This beats all!\" soliloquized Rube, at the window; \"I'll be hanged if\r\nthere's enough solid space in a woman's mind to peg a man's hat on!\r\nNow, just as things have panned out all right for Devonhough, here's a\r\ntombstone in my own graveyard!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" thought Mell, hearing, considering.\r\n\r\n\"_Just as things have panned out all right for Devonhough._\"\r\n\r\nWhat did that mean? Her throbbing, panting, bursting heart knew only\r\ntoo well. Clara had come to a decision--she would marry Jerome, and\r\nnot the Honorable Archibald.\r\n\r\nRube had scarcely ceased to speak when Mell raised her head.\r\n\r\n\"Rube!\"\r\n\r\nVery soft that call!\r\n\r\nUnheeding, Rube still looked out of the window and into the past. That\r\nday at the picnic--that beautiful day, that day of days; a pure,\r\nwhite, luminous spot in memory's galaxy of fair and heavenly\r\nthings--that day she had not felt as she had made him think she felt;\r\nhence, he had been a cat's-paw, a puppet; and she--oh, it could not be\r\nthat Mell was a dissembler, a hypocrite, a serpent!\r\n\r\n\"Rube!\"\r\n\r\nA little louder was this call.\r\n\r\nHe turned, he obeyed--no more able to resist the beckoning hand, the\r\ndulcet voice, the luring glance, than you or I the spells of our own\r\nindividual Sirens and Circes.\r\n\r\nHe came back to her, but stood in gloomy waiting, his brow so dark,\r\nhis expression so hard and cold and stern, that the girl on the sofa\r\nfelt herself wilting and withering before him, as a frail flower in a\r\ndeadly blast.\r\n\r\nShe did not say a word.\r\n\r\nShe only used two eyes of blue, and two big tears which rolled out of\r\nthem, and down upon her velvet cheek, and splash upon her little white\r\nhand, with crushing effect--not upon the hand, but the beholder.\r\n\r\n\"Mell,\" said he, hoarsely, \"what is all this? What is the meaning of\r\nit? I do not see your drift, exactly. Do you wish to be free?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought that would be _your_ wish,\" floundered Mell, \"perhaps, when\r\nyou heard of that other--other fancy--you know, Rube; if I had not\r\ntold you anything about it, and it had come afterwards to your\r\nknowledge, you would have thought I had not acted squarely towards\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"So much, then, I understand; but what are your leanings now? Don't\r\nbeat about the bush; speak out your wishes plainly. I am not a brute.\r\nI would release a woman at the very altar, if her inclinations leaned\r\nin another direction. Do you imagine I would care to marry a woman,\r\nhowever much I might love her, whose heart was occupied by another?\r\nWhere would be the sanctity of such a marriage? I would be the worse\r\ndefrauded man of the two. So, Melville, if there is any one you like\r\nbetter than you do me, speak it now. Tell me plainly, do you care for\r\nme--or some one else?\"\r\n\r\nNow, Mell, here's your chance; hasten to redeem your past. He has put\r\nthe whole thing before you in a nutshell. You know just how he thinks\r\nand how he feels. After this, you dare not further betray a heart so\r\nnoble, so forbearing, so true! Tell him, Mell; tell him, for your own\r\nsake; tell him, for his sake; tell him, for God's sake! Come, Mell,\r\nspeak--speak quick! Don't wait a second, a single second! A second is\r\na very little bit of time, the sixtieth part of one little minute;\r\nbut, short as it is, if you hesitate, it will be long enough for you\r\nto remember that you may live to be a very old woman, and pass all\r\nyour life in this old farm-house, utterly monotonous and wearisome;\r\nthat you will be very lonely; that you will be very poor; that you\r\nwill be very unhappy; that you will miss Rube's jewels and Rube's\r\nsugar plums and Rube's hourly devotions, to which you have now become\r\nso well accustomed;--short, but long enough to remember all this. So\r\nspeak, Mell, quick! quick! The second is gone before Mell speaks.\r\n\r\nIt was a long second for Rube.\r\n\r\n\"O Mell, Mell! can it be that you care for him and not for me? At\r\nleast, let _me_ hear it--let me hear the truth! I can bear anything\r\nbetter than this uncertainty.\"\r\n\r\nEven this bitter cry brought forth no response. The dumbness of\r\nDieffenbachia lay upon Mell's tongue.\r\n\r\n\"I see how it is,\" said Rube, turning to go.\r\n\r\n\"No, you don't!\" exclaimed Mell, pulling him back. She was now\r\ndesperate. Her tear-stained face broke into April sunshine. \"I do not\r\ncare for that other. How could you think so? Once I thought so myself;\r\nit was a delusion. A woman cannot love a selfish, tyrannical,\r\noverbearing creature like that!--not really, though she may think so\r\nfor a time; but you, Rube, you are the quintessence of goodness! you\r\nare worth a dozen such men as he!\"\r\n\r\n\"So it's me!\" ejaculated Rube. \"I am the lucky dog! I am the\r\nquintessence of goodness!\"\r\n\r\nHe drew a long breath; he sank comfortably back into the old seat and\r\ninto the old sense of security, and addressed himself with a joyous\r\nair and renewed enthusiasm to the old rôle of love-making.\r\n\r\nJust like a man--the very man who thinks he has such a deep insight\r\ninto dark matters, who thinks he knows so much about everything in the\r\nwide world, especially women!\r\n\r\n\"You are the most conscientious creature alive!\" declared Rube,\r\nhappier than ever, over a nearly lost treasure. \"The whole amount of\r\nyour offence seems to be that you once thought you cared--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--that's it! I once thought so.\"\r\n\r\n\"But _I_ once thought that I cared for another girl. You would not,\r\nfor that reason, wish to send me adrift, would you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Only I wish you hadn't!\"\r\n\r\n\"Just the way I feel about it.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed uncontrollably.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty one! Soul of honor! What other girl would have opened her lips\r\nabout such a trifle? And now I will not be put off another moment.\r\nName the day which is to make me the happiest of men.\"\r\n\r\nThe day was named, and Mell really felt more composure of mind and\r\nless disquietude of spirit than she had known for many a day. She had\r\neased, to some extent, her guilty conscience. She had shed many\r\nbitter, if unavailing, tears over Rube and her dead father; and now,\r\nconvinced that she could not help herself, and determined to make the\r\nbest of it, her mind drifted complacently over the long stretch of\r\nprosperous years before her, wherein she would be neither lonely, nor\r\npoor, nor unhappy, nor unloved; with sugar plums to her taste and\r\njewels in quantity--for there are just two things in this world every\r\nyoung woman is sure to love--tinsel and taffy.\r\n\r\nA healing balm now poured itself, so to speak, into her life and\r\nfuture prospects.\r\n\r\nOf Jerome she saw no more. He had gone home before her father's\r\nfuneral. He had seemingly passed out of her life forever. She never so\r\nmuch as mentioned his name, even to Rube, and she even thought of him\r\nless frequently than of yore. How could she be expected to think of\r\nhim with the wedding trousseau demanding all her thoughts and time?\r\n\r\nBut one day Rube came to the farm-house, worried, and told Mell, of\r\nhis own accord, that it was about Jerome and Clara. There had been a\r\nrow between them.\r\n\r\nThe Honorable Archibald Pendergast, as she well knew, was no ordinary\r\nman--neither, it seemed, was he an ordinary lover. Notwithstanding his\r\nlate rejection, he had been paying Clara such marked attentions in\r\nWashington that a society journal had publicly announced their\r\nengagement; whereupon Jerome had delivered his ultimatum--she would\r\nmarry him at once or else they were quits.\r\n\r\n\"And I don't blame him,\" declared Rube, \"not one bit! He stood as much\r\nat her hands, and stood it as long, as a man _can_ stand. I never\r\ncould have taken the same from you.\"\r\n\r\nAh, Rube, we little know, any of us, just what we are taking at any\r\nhour in the day and at the hands of our own friends!\r\n\r\nIt is well for us that we do not.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" inquired Mell, scarcely able to articulate, so great was\r\nher agitation, \"what is Clara going to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is going to marry the Honorable Archibald,\" replied Rube, adding,\r\nwith the breezy disgust of a sunny temper: \"It's a confounded shame!\r\nHe's old enough for her father, and I don't believe she cares _that_\r\nabout him! But he's a great statesman, and there's a good prospect of\r\nhis getting into the White House some of these days; and some women\r\nlove social eminence better than they do their own souls! I am glad\r\nyou are not one of that kind, Mell--you will be content with your\r\nplanter husband, won't you, Mell?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have written him to come to our wedding,\" pursued Rube. \"I like him\r\nas well as ever--even more! He's a splendid fellow! I hope he will\r\ncome, but I think it hardly probable.\"\r\n\r\nMell thought, too, it was hardly probable. After this, things went\r\nwrong again with Mell. Her trousseau ceased to occupy her time and\r\nattention; her wayward thoughts waged internecine strife in regions of\r\nturmoil and vain speculation.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Jerome made no sign.\r\n\r\n\"Woe is me!\" wept Mell. Much had she wept since her father died; but a\r\ndead man is not half so sore a subject of weeping as a living woman's\r\nunworthiness, when it falls under her own judgment.\r\n\r\n\"To do right is the only thing,\" moaned the unhappy girl--\"to do right\r\nand give no heed to consequences. I have learned the lesson at last.\r\nIt has been a hard one. Henceforth I am going to do right though I\r\nslay myself in the doing.\"\r\n\r\nShe prayed that night as she had never prayed in all her life before.\r\nShe asked for divine help in doing right by Rube. And she arose from\r\nher knees strengthened to do her duty, as she then conceived it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST STRUGGLE.\r\n\r\nAnd the quiet days pass one by one--each one very like the other--until\r\nthe last sun has set, and the evening lights gleam in the old\r\nfarm-house on the last night before the wedding-day--that wedding-day\r\nwhich she had, to the very last, put off to the latest possible time.\r\nUnder the hush of evening skies, in the flower-decked garden, in the\r\ndreamy grey air, in the sight of fallow fields glistening in the\r\nmoonlight, Rube is saying good-night.\r\n\r\n\"To bed early,\" was the parting injunction of Mell's future lord; \"we\r\nhave a long journey before us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Mell, solemnly, \"a very long journey. The journey of\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\"However long, all too short,\" was Rube's fond reply. He stroked her\r\nlovely hair. \"Mell!\r\n\r\n                  'May never night 'twixt me and you\r\n                  With thoughts less fond arise!'\"\r\n\r\nAfter he was gone Mell repeated those words, \"a very long journey.\"\r\nThen she sighed.\r\n\r\nIt would have to be a very long journey, indeed, to correspond with\r\nthis sigh of Mell's--a very long sigh.\r\n\r\nWell, there is no better time for a woman to sigh than the night\r\nbefore she is married. Nor are tears amiss. Not one in ten knows what\r\nshe's about; for, if she did, she would not--\r\n\r\nOn the brink of the Untried there is room enough to stop and look\r\nabout one, to think better of it, to turn around and go back; only no\r\nman or woman was ever yet gifted with brains enough to do it. The\r\nthings unknown, which loom up so temptingly into sight upon the brink\r\nof the Untried, look far more desirable, infinitely more tempting,\r\nthan all the known blessings of the past. And so Mell sighed--but\r\nlifted not a finger to save herself.\r\n\r\nShe went back into the little parlor to finish packing some\r\nfavorite trifles in a box to be sent to the Bigge House ere she\r\nreturned--school friend's mementoes and some of Rube's presents.\r\n\r\nThus engaged, outside was heard the noise of stamping hoofs and the\r\nrumbling of wheels--some vehicle stopped at the gate--somebody came up\r\nthe sanded garden path, ascended the steps, crossed the little porch\r\nand gave a hasty rap upon the front door.\r\n\r\nMell sprang to her feet. It thrilled her strangely, that footstep on\r\nthe porch, that knock upon the door.\r\n\r\nWho could be coming there at such an hour--and the night before her\r\nwedding?\r\n\r\nRube, perhaps; something he had forgotten to do or say. She would go\r\nto the door; she started, and came back. She listened again.\r\n\r\nIt was not Rube's step--it was not Rube's knock.\r\n\r\nHer senses were ever alert; she always noticed such things.\r\n\r\nBut the man outside had no time to lose, and did not propose to wait\r\nthere all night. He cleared his throat impatiently and knocked again.\r\nThis knock was louder than the first and more peremptory. It had a\r\nremarkable effect upon Mell--a startling effect.\r\n\r\nShe sank upon the nearest chair, she trembled from head to foot; wild\r\nthoughts whirled through her anarchical brain with the swiftness of a\r\nwhirlwind, and it was not until the persistent intruder knocked the\r\nthird time that she succeeded, through breath coming thick and fast,\r\nand half-palsied lips, faintly to call out, \"Come in!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the man came in, and the girl, crouching upon the chair, as if she\r\nwould fain hide herself down in depths of concealment where he would\r\nnever find her, felt no surprise, knowing already the late comer was\r\nJerome.\r\n\r\nJerome--but not at his best. He had been sick--or, so she thought, her\r\naffrighted eyes sweeping over him in one swift glance. Pale was his\r\nface, and careworn; physically, Jerome had never appeared so ill;\r\nspiritually, he had never appeared to better advantage.\r\n\r\nThere are perplexed and ethereal truths in the heart of human things\r\nwhich no bloom of health ever yet expressed. The sweetness pressed out\r\nof suffering by the operations of its own nature, clothes itself in a\r\nsubtler and more irresistible charm than was ever yet discovered in\r\nthe hues of a pearly complexion, or the rays of a brilliant eye. From\r\nunder the potent spell of its attraction, we soon forget a countenance\r\nmerely beautiful; we never forget the one made beautiful through\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\nOur sainted mother, who went through rivers of fire and a thousand\r\ndeath agonies ere death itself came; who died, at last, with a joyful\r\nsmile on her face, bidding us meet her on the other shore--we do not\r\nforget how _she_ looked!\r\n\r\nOur heroic father, borne home from the battle-field, with his death\r\nwound; who bade us with his last breath to serve God and our\r\ncountry--we do not forget how _he_ looked! These are the images\r\nindelibly fixed in the sensitized slide of memory, while the\r\npeach-bloom face upon the boulevard, the merry face in the dance, fade\r\nas fades the glory of a flower.\r\n\r\nJerome has suffered. Some of his youth he has left behind him. But\r\nwith that youth he has left, too, much of his suffering. At this\r\nmoment every feature in his facial federation of harmonious elements\r\nwas lighted up with a kindling spirit of its own. Whatever the\r\ninspiration, whether intrinsically noble, or ignoble, it is to its\r\npossessor a glorious inspiration. We say noble, or ignoble; for, one\r\nman's glory may be another man's shame, and both true men. So,\r\nperhaps, no cause is great in itself, but only great in the conception\r\nof the soul who conceives it and who fights for it.\r\n\r\nOut of Jerome's presence, Mell had branded him as a being selfish,\r\ntyrannical, and incapable of long retaining a woman's love; in his\r\npresence she only knew he was the embodiment of life's supreme good.\r\n\r\nBut worse than a flaming sword was now the sight of the man she loved.\r\nShe dreaded the sound of his coming voice as she dreaded the trump of\r\nDoom. What would he say--he who handled words as a skilful surgeon\r\nmanipulates cutting-instruments, to kill or cure--what would he say to\r\nthe woman who had been untrue to her word?\r\n\r\nHe said absolutely nothing.\r\n\r\nNo formal salutation passed between the two. Drawing a chair directly\r\nin front of the hostess, by whom his coming was so little expected,\r\nJerome sat down upon it and regarded the agitated face and the almost\r\ncowering form of the woman before him, in profound silence.\r\n\r\nShe had dreaded his words, had she? Heavens! This wordless arraignment\r\nof her guilty self at the bar of her own conscience, her silent\r\naccuser both judge and jury, and only two wretched hearts, which ached\r\nas one, for witness, was worse than a true bill found in a crowded\r\ncourt of justice. A storm of angry words, a typhoon, a sorocco, a\r\nveritable Dakota blizzard of sweeping invective, would have been easy\r\nlines compared to this.\r\n\r\nShe would die--Mell knew she would--of sheer shame and self-reproach,\r\nbefore this awful silence, which threatened to continue to the end of\r\ntime, was ever broken.\r\n\r\nWould he never open his mouth and say something, no matter how\r\ndreadful?\r\n\r\nHe did, at last.\r\n\r\n\"Mellville,\" said Jerome, gently, \"are you glad to see me?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" passionately.\r\n\r\n\"Not glad? Then you are the most ungrateful, as well as the most\r\nfaithless, of mortal beings. I have travelled long to get here. My\r\nreaching here in time was uncertain, well nigh a hopeless matter; but\r\nnothing is hopeless to the man who dares. What did I come for? Do you\r\nknow?\"\r\n\r\n\"To load me with reproaches. Do it and begone!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Mell; I have not come for that! There's no salvation in abuse,\r\nand I have come to save. Perhaps, Mell, there is no one in the whole\r\nworld who understands you--your nature, in its strength and in its\r\nweakness--as well as I. You are not a perfect woman, Mell; you have\r\none fault, but even that fault I love because I so love you! And I see\r\nso plainly just how and why your love has failed me in my utmost need,\r\nand I know so well just how and why the conditions of existence, amid\r\nsuch surroundings as this, must be utterly unendurable to a girl of\r\nyour temperament and aims. And so, through all my anger and all my\r\nsorrow and all my wounded affection, I have made excuses in my heart\r\nfor my pretty Mell, my faithless Mell, whom I still love in spite of\r\nall her weakness; who in that weakness could find no other way of\r\nescape from a poor, bald, common-place, distasteful life, except\r\nthrough the crucifixion of her own heart, the ruin of her own\r\nhappiness. Weak, you are nevertheless far dearer to me than the\r\nstrongest-minded of your sex; false in act but not at heart, you are\r\nstill the sweetest to me of all sweet womanhood; and I have come to\r\nsave, not to reproach you! Here is what I bring. It goes fittingly\r\nwith the heart long in your possession.\"\r\n\r\nHe reached forth his hand to her. Mell inspected it with those dark\r\nand regretful looks we bestow on the blessings which are for others,\r\nbut not for us.\r\n\r\nThis was the hand whose touch conferred happiness; a hand so strong,\r\nso firm, so steady, perfect in every joint and finger-tip, endowed\r\nwith all the intellectual subtlety and effective mechanism of which\r\nthe hand of man is capable--the only hand, among thousands and\r\nten-thousands of human hands, she had ever wanted for her own--and now\r\nhere it was, so near, and, alas! farther than ever before! She\r\nclenched her own hands convulsively together, and closed her eyes to\r\nshut out the sight of it and the entreating tenderness of its appeal.\r\n\r\n\"Take it,\" said Jerome, seductively; \"it is now mine to give, and\r\nyours to accept.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too late,\" returned Mell, in sadness; \"to-morrow I wed with Rube.\"\r\n\r\n\"_To-morrow?_ Yes, I know. But have you ever reflected what a long way\r\noff to-morrow is? and how little we need to dread the coming of\r\nto-morrow, if we look well after to-day? And, my dear Mell, how many\r\nthings occur to-night ere to-morrow ever comes! That's another thing\r\nyou have not thought about. In your plans for marrying Rube to-morrow,\r\nyou have neglected to take into consideration\"--the rest he whispered\r\ninto her ear, so low, so low she could scarcely catch it, but the\r\nsudden crash of brazen instruments, the sharp clash of steel, a\r\nthunderbolt at her very feet could not have made her start so\r\nviolently or convulsed her with such terror--\"_the fact that you are\r\ngoing to marry me to-night!_\" With a gesture of instinctive\r\nrepugnance, with a look of supplicating horror, she pushed him away.\r\n\r\n\"Only devils tempt like that!\"\r\n\r\n\"No devil ever yet tempted a woman to right-doing.\"\r\n\r\n\"It could not be right to treat Rube so.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the only way to right a wrong already done him.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I am going to make that wrong up to Rube. I have sworn to do it!\r\nI am going to stick by Rube through thick and thin. You go away! What\r\ndid you come here for? Dark is the fate of the woman who breaks her\r\nplighted vows.\"\r\n\r\n\"Darker still the fate of the woman who seals false vows. Such are\r\nuntrue to the high instincts of the immortal within them.\"\r\n\r\n\"But think how infamous! how base such an act! how scandalous! I\r\ncannot do it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet, you will do worse--far worse. A loveless marriage is worse than\r\na broken vow. Such a marriage may pass current for legal tender in the\r\ncourts of the world, but when some day, you come to square up\r\naccounts, you will find fraudulent bonds and unholy speculation in\r\nmarried estate the worst investment a foolish woman ever made.\r\nDishonesty never pays, but it pays less in a marriage without love\r\nthan anywhere else. And where's the use of trying to deceive Rube and\r\nthe rest of the world, when God knows? You can't very well hoodwink\r\n_Him_, Mell. And how will you be able to endure it; to be clothed in\r\nmarvellously fine garments and ride in a chariot, and envy the beggars\r\nas you pass them in their honest rags; to be a Jonas in every kiss, a\r\nMachiavelli in every word, a crocodile in every tear; Janus-faced on\r\none side, and mealy-mouthed on the other; to be a fraud, a sham, a\r\nmake-believe, an organized humbug, and a painted sepulchre? That's the\r\npicture of the woman who marries one man and loves another. Is it a\r\npleasant picture, Mell? You will chafe behind the gilded bars, and\r\nchamp the jewelled bit. You will feel the sickening thraldom of a\r\ncankering memory, a rankling regret, a sullen remorse, a longing after\r\nyour true self, with every breath a lie, every act a counterfeit,\r\nevery word a mincing of the truth. God only knows how you will bear\r\nit!\"\r\n\r\nGod only--she did not. Her head drooped lower in unspeakable\r\nbitterness and humiliation. Amid all the darkness she could see but\r\none ray of light.\r\n\r\n\"But if I do my duty--\" began Mell.\r\n\r\n\"A woman's first duty to her husband is to love him,\" said Jerome,\r\ngravely; \"failing in that, she fails in all else.\"\r\n\r\n\"But love comes with the doing of duty, everybody says. I must do my\r\nduty by Rube.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. Do your duty, Mell, but do it now. That is all I ask.\r\nManifestly it is not your duty to marry him. With every throb of your\r\nheart pulsating for me, you will not be worth one dollar to Rube in\r\nthe capacity of a wife. He would tell you so, if he knew. Can't you\r\nsee that, Mell?\"\r\n\r\nShe could see it distinctly. Jerome's words burned with the brilliancy\r\nof magnesium, throwing out this aspect of the subject in glaring\r\nlight. Rube stood again before her, as he had stood on the morning of\r\nthat day upon which she had undertaken to fulfil her promise to Jerome\r\nand failed so ignominiously--stood, and was saying: \"_I_ would be the\r\nmost defrauded man of the two,\" and \"where would be the sanctity of\r\nsuch a marriage?\"\r\n\r\nNot one dollar would she be worth to him--_if he knew!_ He would know\r\nsome time; everything under the sun gets known somehow, the only\r\nquestion is--when?\r\n\r\nSeeing the impression made, Jerome spoke again, in words low,\r\nimpassioned:\r\n\r\n\"Save yourself, for the love of God! Save yourself and Rube from such\r\na fate!\"\r\n\r\nMell glanced about her in terror and confusion, turning red and pale.\r\nGladly would she save herself; but how can a respectable member of\r\ngood society accept salvation at such a price--the price of being\r\ntalked about?\r\n\r\n\"It is too late,\" she told her companion, in tones as sorrowful as the\r\nwail of a wandering bard in a strange land; \"too late! Why, man, the\r\nbridal robes are ready, the bridal cake is baked, the bridal guests\r\nare bidden; and would you have me, at this last minute, turn Rube\r\ninto a laughing-stock, a by-word on every idle lip, a man to be\r\npointed out upon the streets, a man to be jeered at in the crowd?\r\nWould you have me do that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. That is not a happy lot, but it soon passes, and is better than\r\nbeing duped for life and wretched for life.\"\r\n\r\nMell averted her face. She seemed striving for words:\r\n\r\n\"I don't see why Rube should be so unhappy as you seem determined to\r\nmake him. Even granting that he knew that I do not feel romantically\r\ntowards him, as I have felt towards you--\"\r\n\r\n\"Have felt?\" interposed her listener.\r\n\r\nShe waived his question aside and proceeded:\r\n\r\n\"Still there is a love born of habit and propinquity, and that will\r\ncome to my rescue. Rube is a splendid fellow! I respect him. I honor\r\nhis character, and I could be happy with him if--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Jerome, huskily, \"go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"_If it were not for you._\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" exclaimed he, \"has it come to that? That alters the case\r\ncompletely. I will take myself off, then! I will get out of your way!\r\nHad I suspected the existence of one drop of real affection in your\r\nheart towards the man you are about to marry, I would have cut off\r\nthis right hand of mine rather than come here to-night. In coming I\r\nwas sustained by the belief that I would not defraud my friend--not in\r\nreality--not of any thing he could value; not of a wife, but of an\r\nempty casket. This belief, on my part, is all that redeems my coming\r\nfrom being an act of diabolism. And now it turns out that there is a\r\nvery good reason why the bridal cake cannot be thrown to the dogs, and\r\nthe bridal robes cannot be committed to the flames, and the bridal\r\nguests cannot upon any account be robbed of their bride upon the\r\nmorrow--_you could be happy with him if it were not for me!_\"\r\n\r\nBitter in tone was this repetition of her words--words which wounded\r\nhim so keenly. They were calculated to wound the tender sensibilities\r\nof any lover, most of all a lover of Jerome Devonhough's stamp. He\r\ncould condone any weakness on her part, except that which touched his\r\nown dominion over her--the sceptre of his love, the yoke of his power.\r\nUnder a pacific exterior, there seethed in Jerome, volcanic masses of\r\nself-will and unchangeable purpose; hemmed in, held in bounds, seldom\r\nbreaking forth in violent eruption, but always there. He was totally\r\nunprepared for any change in the feelings of the woman upon whom he\r\nhad lavished the arbitrary tenderness of his own strong nature.\r\nJerome, you perceive, is no more of a hero than Mell is a heroine. He\r\nis the counterpart of the man who lives round the corner, who sits\r\nnext you in church, whom you meet not unfrequently at your friend's\r\nhouse at dinner. This man loves his wife, not because she is an\r\nartistic production, elaborately wrought out in broad, mellow,\r\ntriumphant lines, grand in character, but rather because he recognizes\r\ngood material in her for his own moulding. We must never approach the\r\ncontemplation of any man's requirements in a wife with our minds full\r\nof loose generalities. There is so much of the fool in every man, the\r\nwisest man, who falls in love. He falls in love, not so much with what\r\nis ideally lovable in a woman, but what is practically complemental to\r\nhis own nature. Jerome, being strong, loved Mell, who was weak, and\r\nweak in those very places where Jerome was strong. She needed him. He\r\nfelt that he was a necessary adjunct to her perfect development in the\r\nsphere of womanhood; he felt that she was necessary to him in the\r\nenlargement of his manhood. For, does not a man of his type need some\r\none to guide, to govern, to lord it over, and to get all the nonsense\r\nout of? But he would love her, too, notwithstanding all this, with\r\nthat sheltering devotion which a woman needs--all women, with one\r\nexception. A strong woman in her strength is not dependent upon any\r\nman's love.\r\n\r\n\"So it has come to this,\" pursued Jerome, brooding in low tones over\r\nthe matter, \"there is but one impediment to your happiness--the man\r\nwhom you have professed to love, whom you have so basely resigned.\r\nWith me safely out of the way, you and Rube are all right. You do, it\r\nseems, know your own mind at last. And Clara Rutland knows hers at\r\nlast, and everybody is about to be made incontinently happy--everybody\r\nbut me! I am left out in the cold! I am left, between you all,\r\nstranded on the lonely rock of unbelief, either in a woman's word or a\r\nwoman's love; and must eat alone, and digest as best I may, all the\r\nsour grapes left over from two marriage-feasts. A pleasant prospect,\r\ntruly! Would to God I had never seen either one of you!\"\r\n\r\nMell was dumb. She was dumb from conviction. Clara Rutland _had_\r\ntreated him badly, and so had she; and she could think of nothing to\r\nsay which would put in any fairer light that ugly treatment. She\r\nmarvelled at his patience through it all; she was bewildered that he\r\nhad thus far, during this trying interview, remained\r\n\r\n                 \"In high emotions self-controlled.\"\r\n\r\nShe knew a change must come. She saw through furtive eyes and without\r\nraising her head, that a change had already come. Not even a strong\r\nwill can regulate a heart's pulsations--a heart which has been sinned\r\nagainst in its most sacred feelings. As the storm-clouds sweep up from\r\nthe west and mass themselves with awful grandeur in battle array, so\r\nlowered dark and tempestuous thoughts, pregnant with danger, on the\r\nyoung man's brow. Across his frame there swept a convulsive quiver of\r\nemotion; his features took on that hard, stern look of repressed\r\nindignation and passion which Mell so well knew and so much feared.\r\n\r\nWith that look upon his face, Jerome was not a man to be trifled\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nBut what was he going to do? Shake her again?\r\n\r\nShe said nothing when he took hold of her two hands with a grasp of\r\niron. Silently she awaited her fate; tremblingly she wondered what\r\nthat fate would be.\r\n\r\nHe was only telling her good-by. He knew not how hard he pressed upon\r\nthose tender hands; he only knew he might never clasp them in his own\r\nagain. It was a terrible moment--terrible not alone for Mell.\r\n\r\nOne would have thought, seeing how he suffered in giving her up, that\r\nshe was the last woman in the world; whereas, we know there are\r\nmultitudes of them, many more estimable in character, some equally\r\ndesirable in person, with just such wondrous hair, just such\r\nenchanting eyes, just such shapeliness of construction, enough in\r\nitself to inspire mankind with the most passionate love--plenty of her\r\nkind, but none exactly Mell!\r\n\r\nSensible of that detaining clasp; knowing his keen eyes scanned darkly\r\nand hungrily every quivering feature in her unquiet face; hearing his\r\nlabored breath and the low sobs wrung from a strong man's agony, Mell\r\nfelt first as a guilty culprit.\r\n\r\nIf only he would stab her to the heart, and then himself.\r\n\r\nWe little thought, any of us, when we saw him lying in the meadow on\r\nthe grass at her feet, that out of the joyous inspiration of that\r\nglorious summer weather, out of two young lives so beautiful, out of\r\nyoung love, a thing so full of poetry and romance, would come such\r\nwretchedness as this.\r\n\r\nAfter a little while, the touch of those rose-leaf palms, the\r\nwhiteness of her face, the appeal for mercy in those eyes seeking his\r\nown, had a soothing effect upon Jerome. He would now put forth all his\r\nstrength and quietly say good-by.\r\n\r\nSoftly he pressed to his lips one of those imprisoned hands; softly,\r\nin a heart-sick rapture of despairing renunciation, he was about to do\r\nthe same with the other, when the glint of Rube's solitaire, the\r\npledge of her hated bondage to another, the glaring witness of her\r\ntreachery towards himself, flashed into his eyes and overcame all his\r\ngood resolutions. With a look of unutterable reproach, with a gesture\r\nof undying contempt, he tossed the offending hand back upon her lap.\r\n\r\n\"Think not,\" he broke forth, in vehement utterance, \"that no thought\r\nof me will embitter your bridal joys! I leave you to your fate! I go\r\nto my own! Dark it may be, but not darker than yours!\"\r\n\r\nAnd this was the quiet way in which he bade her good-by.\r\n\r\nThe words pierced Mell to the very soul, and, combined with the\r\nblackness of his countenance, filled her with indefinable, but very\r\nhorrible imaginings. He had almost reached the door, when with a\r\nsmothered cry of pain, she followed him.\r\n\r\nAs irresistibly as ever he drew her.\r\n\r\n\"Jerome! Jerome! Where are you going?\"\r\n\r\n\"To ruin!\" exclaimed he, turning upon her with that barbaric\r\nfierceness which seems to underlie everything strong in nature--\"to\r\nruin, where you women without principle, have sent many a better man!\r\nTo ruin, and to hell, if I choose,\" he added, with fearful emphasis.\r\n\"My going and my coming are no longer any concern of yours!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they are, Jerome,\" she assured him, deprecatingly. \"Don't leave\r\nme in anger, Jerome!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in anger? Then, how--in delight?\" There was now a menacing gleam\r\nin his eye which more than ever alarmed her. \"My cause is lost. You\r\nhave done me all the wrong you could, and now that I am dismissed, set\r\naside, told to begone, debased, and dethroned, you expect me to be\r\ndelighted over it, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Jerome; but do not leave me feeling so. Promise me to do nothing\r\nrash.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not promise you anything! You have not spared my feelings, why\r\nshould _I_ spare yours? Since your affection for me has moderated into\r\nthat platonic kind, which admits of your happiness in union with\r\nanother, I will do whatever I please to do, knowing no act of mine,\r\nhowever dreadful, will affect you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jerome, do not say that! You must see, you must know in your\r\nheart, that I do still care for you--Oh, God! more than I ought.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet not enough to make you do what is right!\"\r\n\r\n\"But to right you, will wrong Rube,\" she answered in confusion.\r\n\r\n\"Enough, then; you know your own feelings, or ought to. Since Rube is\r\nthe one dearest to you, marry him!\"\r\n\r\nHe turned again upon his heel. Obeying an impulse she could not\r\nresist, Mell once more detained him. It is hard to die, everybody\r\nsays; but to die yourself must be easier than to give up the one you\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n\"Jerome, wait a moment! Come back! Jerome, you do not realize what a\r\ndishonorable thing this is you are persuading me to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't I?\" he laughed wildly. \"God Almighty! Mellville, what do you\r\ntake me for? Wouldn't I have been here a week ago, two weeks ago, but\r\nfor the battle I have had to fight with my own scruples--but for the\r\nwar I have had to wage with my own soul? I have said to myself, again\r\nand again, 'I will not do this thing though I die!' But when I started\r\nout upon this journey, it had come to this: 'I must do this thing or\r\nelse--die!'\"\r\n\r\nShaken as a storm-rifted tree bending in the blast, she was not yet\r\nuprooted.\r\n\r\n\"It is hard, hard,\" she murmured, wringing her hands in nervous\r\nconstraint; \"but time, you know, Jerome, time softens everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"It does!\" he said, harshly--\"even the memory of a crime!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" exclaimed Mell, every word of his filling\r\nher with indefinable fears.\r\n\r\n\"I mean what I say. Once out of the way, you and Rube, the two beings\r\nmost dear to me on earth, could be happy together; you have told me\r\nso. Then, how selfish in me--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jerome, you would not! Surely you would not do such a thing!\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not say that I would, nor that I would not. A desperate man is\r\nnot to be depended on either by himself or others. I only know that in\r\nthis fearful upheaval of all my life's aims and ends, any fate seems\r\neasier than living. But Mellville--\" his tones were now quiet, but\r\nthey were firm; his lips were set in angles of immovable resolve; his\r\nbrow bent and dark with the shadows of unlifting determination. It\r\nwould be difficult to imagine a more striking figure than Jerome in\r\nthe rôle of a man who had made up his mind--\r\n\r\n\"But Mellville, this struggle must end. It must end _now_, or it will\r\nput an end to us. I did not come here to-night to submit to the\r\nhumiliation of begging a woman to marry me against her will. I came to\r\nrescue a being in distress from the painful consequences of her own\r\nrash act. Now, then, you love me, or you do not? You will marry me, or\r\nyou will not? Which is it? Answer! In five minutes I leave this house,\r\nwith or without you!\"\r\n\r\nHe dropped upon his knees at her feet; he snatched her to his breast.\r\nReason was gone, his soul all aflame:\r\n\r\n\"Mell, listen: Love is more than raiment, more than food, more than\r\nthe world's censure or the world's praise. It is sweeter in life than\r\nlife itself! But time presses; the other wedding comes on apace; we\r\nhave no time to spare. An hour's hard driving will bring us to Parson\r\nFordham's, well known to me. There we will be married at once, and\r\ncatch the early train at Pudney. Our names will be an execration and a\r\nby-word for a little time, but what of that? What though all friends\r\nturn their backs upon us! Together we will enter hopefully upon a new\r\nlife, loving God and each other--a life of truer things, Mell; a life\r\nconsecrated to each other and glorified by perfect love and perfect\r\ntrust. Will you lead that life with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I will not!\"\r\n\r\n\"What, Mellville!\" he cried. \"You will not! I thought you loved me,\r\nloved me as I loved you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Once I loved you,\" she said. She spoke now as much to her own soul as\r\nto his perceptions. \"Once--or was it only that I thought I did? For\r\nlong weeks I struggled against deceiving Rube, and out of that I must\r\nhave drifted by slow degrees into deceiving myself. For, to-night,\r\neven to-night, when I parted from Rube I thought it was you I loved,\r\nnot he! But the mists have lifted from my vision, and now, at this\r\nmoment--never fully until this moment--I see you both in your true\r\nlight; I weigh you understandingly, one against the other; I set your\r\nself-seeking against his unselfishness, your improbity against his\r\nhigh sense of honor. And how plainly I see it all! Just as if a moral\r\nkaleidoscope were exhibiting by spiritual reflections, to the eyes of\r\nmy mind, the difference between one man and another, at an angle of\r\nvirtue which is the aliquot part of three hundred and sixty degrees of\r\nreal merit! Upon this disk of the imagination appears your own image;\r\nand what are you doing? Passing me by as an unknown thing, a thing too\r\nsmall to know in the presence of mighty magnates at a county picnic!\r\nThere is another manly form; what is he doing? Lifting me up from the\r\nbare earth where the other's cruel slights have crushed me; feeding me\r\nwith his own hands; even then loving me. How different the pictures!\r\nShift the scene. Some one is crowning me: I am a queen before the\r\nworld. Whose hand has held a crown for me? Not yours--Rube's! You had\r\nnot the courage. He had. I love courage in a man. I love it better\r\nthan a handsome face or an oily tongue. A man without courage--what is\r\nhe? He isn't a man at all--not really. Jerome Devonhough,\" here she\r\nturned her lovely face, grown so cold, and her exquisite eyes, grown\r\nso scornful, full upon him, \"were you the right sort of a man, would\r\nyou be here to-night? Will a man, false to his friend, be true to his\r\nwife? I can trust Rube Rutland; can I trust you? No! For, even while\r\nloving, I could not keep down a feeling of contempt. Beginning with\r\nrespect for Rube, that sentiment of respect has ripened into\r\nlove--real love--not the wild, senseless, mad, unreasoning passion of\r\nan untutored girl, which eats into its own vitals, and drains its own\r\nlees,--as mine for you,--but that deeper, better, higher, more\r\nenduring, and well-nigh perfect affection of the full-lived woman, who\r\nout of deep suffering has emerged into an enlightened conception of\r\nher own nature's needs, her own heart's craving for what is best,\r\ntruest, most God-like in a man! That love, which will wear well, nor\r\ngrow threadbare through time, which will take on a more wondrous glow\r\nin the realms of eternity, is the love I feel for Rube!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" he exclaimed, not yet quenched, not yet hopeless. \"Eternity is\r\na long word, and all your fine talking cannot deceive _me!_ Oh, woman,\r\nwoman, what a face you have, and what brains! I do not know which\r\nholds me tighter. That face so fair, that mind so subtle--together\r\nthey might well turn the head of the devil himself, but they cannot\r\ndeceive _me!_ The string which draws you is golden. It is not Rube you\r\nlove so much, so purely, so perfectly; oh, no, not Rube! Not Rube, but\r\nhis possessions. Not the man--the man's house! Its beautiful turrets\r\nand gables, its gardens and lawns, its lovely views, and spacious\r\nluxury, and abounding wealth. For that you give me up. Still loving\r\nme, Rube's pelf is dearer still!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not now--not now! Now I love _him_--the man! Not for what he has, but\r\nfor what he is. For his truth, his nobility, his honor; and, as that\r\nhonor is in my keeping, I bid you go and return no more. Your power to\r\ntempt me from my duty _and my love_ is over! My faith is grounded, my\r\npurpose unalterable. Go!\"\r\n\r\n\"This is folly. Come with me!\" he cried, striving to draw her towards\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nShe resisted.\r\n\r\n\"Come!\" he urged.\r\n\r\nShe broke from him, crying:\r\n\r\n\"No, by heaven! Were it the only chance to save my own life, I would\r\nnot go! I have done with you now, forever!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-night, then,\" he told her, with a bitter sneer and a low,\r\nmocking bow. \"Good-night; but you will be sorry for this! You will\r\nregret this night's work all the days of your life. Its memory will\r\ndarken the brightest day of your life!\"\r\n\r\nShe did not speak, or move, as he turned upon his heel and left her.\r\n\r\nThere sounds his foot upon the stair, and next upon the gravelled\r\nwalk! And now the garden-gate swings open, and the carriage-door bangs\r\nshut, after which the wheels grate upon the pebbles, and the clatter\r\nof horses' hoofs rings out upon the midnight air. Gone! Gone!\r\n\r\nHer head reels; all her senses seem benumbed. Not even a heavy tread\r\nthrough the dark entry did she hear. It was the clasp of strong arms\r\naround her which woke her from her trance.\r\n\r\nShe turned, exclaiming in alarm: \"Rube! You here! You--you have\r\nheard?\"\r\n\r\n\"Every word. I was up; I could not sleep. Does any man sleep the night\r\nbefore he is married? _I_ could not. I lighted a cigar and went out\r\nupon the lawn. At the gate I stood, puffing away and looking up in\r\nthis direction, wondering if my sweet wife that is to be had obeyed my\r\nparting injunctions and gone to sleep, when presently a carriage came\r\ntearing along, going in the very direction of my own thoughts. A man\r\nsat within; I cannot say that I exactly recognized that man in the\r\nmoonlight, but I saw him move quickly back when he saw me, and that\r\naroused my suspicions. I followed; I could not help following.\r\nSomething told me my happiness was menaced, my love in danger. I was\r\ndetermined to know the truth, Mell. I listened.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you do not hate me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hate you, Mell? Dearer to me than ever you are at this moment! I\r\nknow how you have been tempted; I realize all you have overcome. Never\r\ncould I doubt such love! Comforted by it, I can bear up even under\r\nso heavy a misfortune as the treachery of a friend. But the hour is\r\nlate; we must not talk longer; you must snatch a little rest.\r\nGood-night once more, dear love. To-morrow, Mellville, you will be\r\nmine--to-morrow!\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, Rube! To-morrow, yours! Upon every day and every morrow of my\r\nlife, always yours!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note:\r\n\r\n  Authors' archaic and variable spelling and hyphenation is mostly\r\n  preserved.\r\n\r\n  Authors' punctuation styles are preserved.\r\n\r\n  Passages in italics indicated by _underscores_.\r\n\r\n  Passages in bold indicated by =equal signs=.\r\n\r\n  Typographical problems have been changed and are listed below, as\r\n  are changes made to standardise some hyphenation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Changes:\r\n\r\n  Page 169: Was 'territores' (nullify the results of the war by\r\n            converting the Southern States into conquered =territories=,\r\n            in order that party supremacy)\r\n\r\n  Page 169: Was 'acquiesence' (The hint was taken, the contest of 1868\r\n            was fought under a seeming =acquiescence= in the views of\r\n            Stevens and Morton;)\r\n\r\n  Page 194: Was 'imperturable' (\"No, indeed!
